The cause of refractoriness may be either immune or non-immune. Among immune-related refractoriness, antibodies against HLA antigens are the primary cause. Non-immune causes include splenomegaly (enlargement of the spleen), fever, and sepsis. Cause Platelet refractoriness can be due to immune causes or non-immune causes. Non-immune causes account for over 80% of cases of platelet refractoriness, and sepsis is one of the most common non- immune causes. HLA alloimmunization is the commonest immune cause of platelet refractoriness. =Non-immune causes=  Patient-related  *Sepsis *Fever *Disseminated intravascular coagulation *Splenomegaly *Treatment of infection, antibiotics (vancomycin), antifungals (amphotericin B) *Graft- versus-host disease *Hepatic veno-occlusive disease *Bleeding  Platelet component-related  * Age of platelet component * ABO mismatch between platelet component and recipient * Number of platelets within the component if platelet increment (PI) is used to calculate platelet refractoriness * Pathogen-reduced platelet component =Immune causes= *Alloantibodies to platelet antigens **Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies **Human platelet antigen (HPA) antibodies *Immune complexes *Other antibodies **Drug-related antibodies Diagnosis Platelet transfusion refractoriness can be defined in several different ways. All measures of platelet refractoriness are defined by the timing of the post-transfusion platelet count, usually 1 hour post transfusion or 24 hours post transfusion or both. =Platelet increment (PI)= This is the simplest method, and only requires data on the platelet count before and after the transfusion. The platelet increment is also known as the absolute count increment and count increment. PI = post-transfusion platelet count - pre-transfusion platelet count However, it is affected by the number of platelets given in the transfusion (platelet dose) and the patient's blood volume. Larger patients and smaller platelet doses decrease the platelet increment. These factors are adjusted for in the other methods of defining platelet refractoriness. A 1-hour post-transfusion PI of less than 5 to 10 x 109/l is considered evidence of platelet refractoriness. Due to lack of data on platelet dose this is often the only measure of platelet refractoriness that can be performed in routine clinical practice. =Percentage platelet recovery (PPR)= Requires data on the platelet increment (PI), the patient's total blood volume (TBV) - estimated using the patient's weight multiplied by 0.075, and the number of platelets transfused (platelet dose) PPR = ((PI x TBV)/PD) x 100 At 1 hour post-transfusion, a PPR < 20% is considered evidence of platelet refractoriness. At 16 hours post-transfusion a PPR < 10% is considered evidence of platelet refractoriness. =Percentage platelet increment (PPI)= PPI is very similar to the percentage platelet recovery (PPR) but there has been an additional adjustment for splenic pooling of platelets (PPR multiplied by 2/3) PPI = PPR/0.67 = ((PI / 0.67) x TBV)/PD x 100 =Corrected count increment (CCI)= This requires data on the platelet increment (PI, in platelets/¬µl), the patient's Body surface area (BSA, in m2), and the number of platelets transfused (PD, in 1011). {CCI} = PI * \\\\frac{BSA}{PD} For example, a PI of 25,000 platelets/¬µl, a BSA of 1.8m2 and a PD of 4x1011 gives a CCI of 11,250 platelets*m2/1011¬µl At 1 hour post- transfusion a CCI greater than 7500 indicates a sufficient post-transfusion increment, whereas a CCI less than 7500 is considered diagnostic of platelet refractoriness. At 24 hours post transfusion a CCI less than 5000 suggests platelet refractoriness. =Platelet dose= Some blood banks maintain records of the estimated number of platelets in each unit. Current requirements in the US stipulate that a unit of apheresis platelets must contain at least 3.0 x1011 platelets. In England only 1% of adult platelet components are tested to check the number of platelets meet the minimum required standard of 2.4 x 1011 platelets. Only components that contain fewer than 1.6 x 1011 platelets are discarded. This means that there can be a lot of variability in the number of platelets contained within each transfusion.  Treatment  Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Non-immune causes are usually treated by treating the underlying cause e.g. sepsis. If there is no obvious non-immune cause, a first step can be to use platelet components that are likely to produce the greatest platelet increment (less than 3 days old and ABO-matched), while further investigations are performed (testing for HLA antibodies). If an immune cause is suspected and HLA antibodies are detected, then HLA-selected platelet components can be used. Although HLA-selected platelets lead to improved platelet increments at 1 hour post-transfusion, there is currently insufficient evidence to demonstrate their clinical effectiveness at preventing bleeding. If HLA antibodies are not detected, and HPA antibodies are detected, then HPA-selected or crossmatched platelet components can be used. HLA and HPA-selected components should not be used if no HLA or HPA antibodies are detected.

It is a popular feature of East African secondary school examinations and has also featured in Oxford's English collection from the region.  History  Rugyendo originally penned the poem in his Senior Six at Ntare School in Mbarara. Some time later Richard Ntiru, editor of the poetry collection Tensions, and an old schoolmate, wrote to him from Uganda Publishing House in Kampala, where he was doing vacation work, to let him know that the house was looking to collect poems originally composed in mother tongues and translated by their authors into English. Rugyendo complied, submitting two pieces in both forms. One was \\"My Husband Has Gone\\".Rugyendo 2007. Of the second poem he has since lost track. When he went to Dar es Salaam for his university studies in 1970, Rugyendo almost completely forgot about the poems.Rugyendo 2007. In January 1971, Idi Amin came to power, and he observed the disorienting effect on the lives of his peers, not least of all the high-ranking managers at Uganda Publishing House: \\"that,\\" he wrote some 35 years later, \\"seems to have been the end of the [Ntiru] project.\\" The poem remained unpublished. The next time Rugyendo, still in Dar es Salaam, encountered it was when the Oxford University Press contacted hhim from Nairobi, seeking the right to publish the English version in a collection of verse from East Africa. He saw no reason to refuse and promptly jumped at the chance, omitting in the process to ask where the publishers had found the poem and what had become of its mother-tongue version.

These alloantibodies destroy the patient's platelets leading to thrombocytopenia, a rapid decline in platelet count. PTP usually presents 5‚Äì12 days after transfusion, and is a potentially fatal condition in rare cases. Approximately 85% of cases occur in women. TOC Mechanism  PTP is rare, but usually occurs in women who have had multiple pregnancies or in people who have undergone previous transfusions. The precise mechanism leading to PTP is unknown, but it most commonly occurs in individuals whose platelets lack the HPA-1a antigen (old name: PLA1). The patient develops antibodies to the HPA-1a antigen leading to platelet destruction. In some cases, HPA-5b has also been implicated. It is unclear why alloantibodies attack the patient's own, as well as any transfused allogeneic random donor platelets. Probable explanation for this is that the recipient's platelets acquire the phenotype of donor's platelet by binding of the soluble antigens from the donor onto the recipient's platelet. Treatment Symptoms are usually sudden in onset and self-limiting, most often resolving within 2 weeks. IVIG therapy is the primary treatment. Additionally, PTP is an American Society for Apheresis Category III indication for plasmapheresis.

Written during the summer of 1978, and published the following year, the book describes the 1978 English cricket season through a series of essays based around matches Moorhouse attended. Each chapter features a specific match. Moorhouse attended a range of games from school and village level to Test matches, thus covering both amateur and professional cricket. The book therefore describes different types of cricket and the different levels at which it is played, providing a picture of its place in English society at that time. The descriptions are also set against the backdrop of the Packer Crisis, which was affecting cricket at that time, with a number of professionals joining the so-called 'Packer Circus', an unofficial series of matches funded by Australian tycoon Kerry Packer. This resulted in a number of senior players being banned from international cricket, and lengthy court cases to resolve the resulting disputes. Theme The book contains description of 14 fixtures of various kinds. The writer starts the book at Lord's, the Mecca of cricket, with the traditional three-day fixture between the MCC and the County champions of the previous season (in this case, Middlesex). He visits Lord's three more times during the course of the season (in June for the Test Match against Pakistan, in July, for the oldest fixture, between Eton and Harrow School, and finally in early September for the Gillette Cup final). He also goes to grounds around the country, including Oxfordshire to cover a village championship game and Lichfield for a minor county game. Awards The Best Loved Game was awarded the Cricket Book of the Year award by The Cricket Society in 1979. In May 2019, it was longlisted by Wisden Cricket Monthly in an article on the best cricket books of all time. Influence The Best Loved Game was the inspiration for Still the Best Loved Game?, by Neil Cole, published in 2019, forty years after the publication of the original. Still the Best Loved Game? follows a similar format, with observations on cricket drawn from matches throughout an English summer, but takes a much more inclusive approach befitting the 21st century (featuring women's, as well as men's, cricket; disability cricket; MCC Schools v the English Schools Cricket Association, which includes state school players, rather than Eton v Harrow; and a Loughborough v Durham university match rather than Oxford v Cambridge).

Governance  Plenmeller is in the parliamentary constituency of Hexham. The parish council is Plenmeller with Whitfield. Historically, Plenmeller was a township, also incorporating Unthank, within the ancient parish of Haltwhistle.  Economy  Coal mining dominated the history of the area in recent times. Employment at Plenmeller colliery reached its peak in the early 1920s.see information: http://www.dmm.org.uk/colliery/p019.htm When the colliery closed in 1932 it caused widespread hardship in the area. More recently coal has been extracted by open cast methods on Plenmeller Common and land then returned to a more natural landscape. The open cast mine was opened by John Northand CBE, Deputy Chairman of the British Coal Corporation, on 19 September 1991. By the time the site was completed in May 2002 there had been 1.91 million tonnes of coal extracted. RPC Containers Ltd., manufacturers of blow-moulded plastic containers, now operate from the site of the old colliery. There is a farm at the west side of the village.  Landmarks  Unthank Hall is a Grade II listed mansion house, now serving as commercial offices, situated on the southern bank of the River South Tyne. The house, which was built in the 16th century, incorporating an ancient Pele tower, was substantially remodelled and extended in 1815. The Hall was later rebuilt between 1862 and 1865. Much of the 1865 house has since between demolished and only the central gables and entrance porch survive.  Transport  = Rail = Penmeller Halt on the Alston line opened in 1919 to serve the colliery. The halt closed in 1946 and was demolished but trains continued to stop as required until the 1960s.Plenmeller Halt Disused Stations The village is now served by Haltwhistle railway station on the Tyne Valley line. The line was opened in 1838, and links Newcastle with Carlisle. The line follows the course of the River Tyne through Northumberland. Passenger services on the Tyne Valley Line are operated by Northern. The line is also heavily used for freight. = Road = The village lies just to the south of the A69 road as it bypasses Haltwhistle. The road is a major road running east-west across the Pennines, linking Newcastle upon Tyne with Carlisle in Cumbria.  Etymology  It is generally agreed that the name \\"Plenmeller\\" is of Brythonic Celtic origin. The first element is most plausibly blajn meaning \\"summit\\" (c.f. Welsh blaen). The second element is more obscure. Suffixes of -ma…£l, \\"chief\\" and -mƒô:l, \\"bare\\" are both possible. The attestation Plenmeneure from 1256 would favor the suffix -ma…£n, \\"a stone\\".

In response, electronic countermeasures (ECM) and flying tactics were developed to overcome them. They proved to be quite successful provided that a reliable and timely threat warning was given. The infrared seeking missile threat Analysis of aircraft losses due to enemy action since the 1960s shows that at least 70% of all losses were attributed to passive heat seeking i.e. Infrared (IR) guided missiles. This might be surprising given that radar guided SAM systems have longer engagement ranges, are faster, have higher maneuvering potential, carry larger warheads and are equipped with proximity fuzes. The main reason why IR guided missiles were so effective was that it took much longer to develop effective warning systems against them. Most aircraft that were shot down never knew that the missiles were coming. Radar warning receivers on the other hand already proved their effectiveness by the early 1970s which considerably improved the survival rate of aircraft against radar threats. The first air-to-air IR missiles appeared in the 1950s. The technology allowed more compact missile designs and made it possible to develop IR man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS) i.e. shoulder-launched missiles, which became operational by the 1960s. IR MANPADS are relatively cheap, quite robust, easy to operate and difficult to detect. They also do not require the infrastructure often associated with radar-guided SAM deployments which often reveals their presence. Vast quantities of MANPADS have been manufactured (more than 700,000 produced since 1970 according to CSIS \\"Transnational Threats Update\\" Volume 1. No 10. 2003). Large numbers proliferated during the Cold War and immediate post Cold War era. Substantial quantities are available and affordable on the black market and have found their way into the hands of \\"non state\\" organizations or the so-called \\"asymmetric\\" threat. (An estimate by Jane's Intelligence Review of Feb 2003 puts this number as high as 150 000). An article \\"Proliferation of MANPADS and the Threat to Civil Aviation\\" of August 13, 2003 by Jane's Terrorism and Insurgency Centre estimates that the black market price of MANPADS like the SA-7 could be as low as $5,000.http://archives.californiaaviation.org/airport/msg27392.html Intelligence regarding the whereabouts of MANPADS, especially in the hands of \\"non state\\" organizations, is usually vague and unreliable. This, in turn, makes it difficult to anticipate where and when to expect MANPADS attacks. The 2nd- and 3rd-generation MANPADS appeared by the 1980s and further increased the performance and effectiveness of MANPADS due to advanced new seeker head technology, improved rocket motors and aerodynamic refinements. Their performance improved in terms of lethal range, minimum launch angle, maneuvering potential and all aspect engagement angles (1st-generation MANPADS were restricted to only rear sector attacks). They also became more ECM resistant. MANPADS therefore became even more lethal specifically against more vulnerable platforms such as helicopters, light aircraft, and commercial and military transport aircraft (during approaches and departures). The slower speed of these platforms forces them to spend more time within the kill zones of MANPADS compared to high performance fighter and strike aircraft. At least 35 MANPADS attacks on civilian aircraft are on record. Twenty four were shot down killing about 500 people in the process. Missile approach warning (MAW) system requirements Protecting aircraft against IR guided missiles depends in most cases firstly on reliable detection and warning of missiles and secondly on applying effective ECM. An exception to this are omni-directional IR jammers which do not make use of missile warning at all as they simply radiate modulated IR energy for as long as they are switched on. These jammers have been around since the 1970s and when the correct jamming modulation techniques were applied, were reasonably effective against 1st-generation amplitude-modulated MANPADS, which operated in the near-IR band (1 to 2 micrometres (Œºm)). The arrival of 2nd- and 3rd-generation MANPADS changed that. They operate in the mid-IR band (3 to 5 Œºm) and use more advanced modulation techniques (for example frequency modulation). Instead of jamming these missiles, the omni-directional IR jammer became a source for the missiles to home in. =Functional requirements= Providing timely warning against IR MANPADS is a challenge. They give no warning of their presence prior to launch, they do not rely on active IR, radar guidance or a laser designator which would possibly emit a detectable radiation. They are typically fire-and-forget and can lock on and engage a target, speed to the target and destroy it in seconds. They have a small but visible radar signature and also a propellant which burns ‚Äì depending on the platform, typically for a very short duration. MANPADS are relatively short-range weapons, typically up to about five kilometers with the heart of the kill envelope one to three kilometers. They therefore allow very little margin for error to effectively counter them as the time to impact (TTI) on a target at one kilometer, is only about three seconds. The TTI for targets at three and five kilometers is also relatively short ‚Äì only seven to a little over eleven seconds respectively. The MAW must provide reliable and timely warning to allow appropriate counter measure responses. Near 100% probability of warning (POW) and very fast reaction times to counter nearby missile launches (in the order of one second) are essential. Air crew will rely on the system only if they have high confidence in it. The MAW must also have sufficiently low false alarm rates (FAR), even when illuminated by multiple sources (which may include threats) from different directions. Quick response times and low FAR are inherently conflicting requirements. An acceptable solution requires a balanced approach to provide the most successful end result without compromising the POW. Since a longer time-to-impact (TTI) warning is almost invariably desirable, this leads to the conclusion that there is something like a too-low FAR: all warning systems gather data, and then make decisions when some confidence level is reached. False alarms represent decision errors, which (assuming optimal processing) can be reduced only by gathering more information, which means taking more time, inevitably resulting in a reduced time-to-impact. Most users would tolerate an increased FAR (up to some point where it starts limiting operations) instead of a reduced TTI, because their probability of survival depends fairly directly on the TTI, which represents the time in which countermeasures can be deployed. Accurate azimuth and elevation angle of attack (AOA) information can be another very important requirement. Directional IR counter measures (DIRCM) systems depend on MAW systems for accurate enough initial pointing (about two degrees) to ensure that the DIRCM acquires and engages incoming missiles timely and successfully. Accurate AOA is also important in deciding the dispensing direction of the counter measure decoys (flares). It is vital to avoid the situation where the platform and the dispensed decoys both remain within the instantaneous field of view (IFoV) of incoming missiles. In situations like that missiles could very well, once they pass the decoys, still hit the platform. This is of particular importance where separation between the decoys and the platform takes too long as is the case with slow flying aircraft. Accurate AOA is further important where the platform should preferably maneuver when dispensing decoys to increase the miss distance. This is more applicable to fast jets where their high speed tends to negate the separation caused by the decoy's ejection velocity. A turn towards approaching missiles to establish/increase the angle between the decoy and the platform is especially important in cases where a missile approaches from the rear between the five or seven 'o clock sectors. If the AOA is not accurate enough, the pilot could very well turn in the wrong direction and set himself up for the situation as described above. The system must also be fully automated as the human reaction time in relevant cases (short range launches) is too long. =Physical requirements= Light aircraft, helicopters and fighters usually have limited space and mass capacity for additional equipment. The system should also not cause adverse aerodynamic drag which demands minimal physical size and number of boxes. The power consumption must further be kept within the capacity of the platform's electrical system. To reduce the installation and integration costs, the necessary interfaces have to be provided to ensure communication and co-existence with other on-board avionics. =Human-machine interface (HMI) requirements= Integrated display and control functions are desirable to avoid duplication on instrument panels where space is limited. If a platform is equipped with both radar and missile warning systems, the HMI should display both threats clearly and unambiguously. The integrated HMI must also indicate the system's operating status, serviceability status, mode of operation, remaining decoy quantities etc. Separate control panels are justified only for safety of flight purposes such as ECM on/off and decoy jettison functions. =Cost considerations= Procuring EW self-protection systems has direct and indirect cost implications. Direct costs involve the initial price of the system, spare parts as well as test equipment to ensure that the performance and availability of the systems is maintained throughout their entire life cycle. Installing and integrating EW systems on aircraft is another direct cost Indirect cost on the other hand involves degradation of the aircraft's performance as a result of having the system on-board which in turn impacts negatively on the operating cost of the aircraft. The lowest initial price of a system does therefore not necessarily offer the best solution as all the factors needs to be considered. The overall cost effectiveness of systems i.e. price versus performance is more important in deciding which system to select. Types of missile approach warning systems Three different technologies have been used for MAW systems i.e. systems based on: Pulse-Doppler radar, Infrared, and Ultraviolet. Each technology has its advantages and disadvantages which can be summarized as follows: =Pulse- Doppler‚Äìbased MAW= ;Advantages * Can measure distance and speed of approaching missiles. It can therefore determine the time to impact (TTI) and optimize the timing of countermeasure (flare) dispensing. * Does not depend on the motor of missiles to be burning. * Less sensitive to weather conditions. ;Disadvantages * In sophisticated threat environments active systems could reveal the aircraft's presence with the radar radiation by the MAW and therefore increase its vulnerability. * Detection range of small missiles with low radar cross section like MANPADS is limited and could result in marginal warning time and consequent late decoy dispensing. * Cannot measure direction accurately enough to direct DIRCM systems. * Susceptible to false alarms caused by other RF sources. * Can cause interference with ground air traffic control radars if operating frequency is not selected carefully. * More difficult to integrate than passive systems due to spatial limitations. =Infrared-based MAW= ;Advantages * In good weather conditions, the atmospheric transmission of IR radiation tends to be better than that of solar-blind UV radiation. * Can potentially achieve longer detection ranges at altitude where there is no ground clutter. * Can potentially detect the kinetic heat of missiles after motor burnout at altitude, but probably not at low level due to high IR background clutter. * Provides good AOA information for pointing a DIRCM and good decision making regarding decoy dispensing direction and maneuvering. ;Disadvantages * Very low IR transmission through liquid water and ice, which precludes all-weather operation. Even a few tens of micrometers of water on the lens, or in the atmosphere between the threat and the sensor, is sufficient to effectively blind both MWIR and LWIR sensors. * Must compete with massive amounts of natural (sun) and man-made IR clutter. * False alarm rate and/or probability of warning is therefore a huge problem against surface-to-air missiles due to high IR background clutter originating from the earth. * Needs vast computing power to alleviate false alarm problem which in turn drives up cost. * Two colour detectors are used in some systems to assist in the suppression of background clutter and lower FAR. Even though it solves some problems, it creates others as it complicates the system further due to the optical, sensitivity and extremely high pixel rate requirements which impact negatively on cost and reliability. * Cannot provide actual range information. * Traditionally IR detectors have very narrow instantaneous fields of view to achieve good enough signal to target ratio. Large detector arrays are therefore required to provide 360¬∞ azimuth coverage which is another cost driver. * Requires cooled detectors which complicates life cycle logistic support and result in high cost of ownership. * Detection range could be limited against future new technology low IR/UV emission rocket motors. =Ultraviolet-based MWS= ;Advantages * Operates in solar blind UV spectral wavelength region and therefore has no natural (sun) false alarms. UV based MAW systems therefore have a much reduced false alarm problem to solve compared to IR based systems. * Very good probability of warning in high clutter background environments. * All-weather operation, as it is impervious to solar clutter, and hardly affected by liquid water. * Wide instantaneous field of view. * Provide very good AOA information for good decoy dispensing decision making, maneuvering and for pointing DIRCMs. * Has fast response time against nearby missile launches. * Is a simpler system than pulse Doppler & IR technologies. * Does not require cooling and needs only moderate computing power. * Low life cycle cost. ;Disadvantages * To detect approaching missiles, the rocket motor of the missile must be burning ‚Äì it requires the high effective burning temperatures associated with solid fuel rocket motors. * IR- based systems are probably better at altitude but UV is better against surface-to-air missiles. * Cannot provide actual range information but can derive TTI from the rapid increase in amplitude of the approaching missile's signal. * Detection range could be limited against future new technology low IR/UV emission rocket motors. Implementations of MAW systems Current available MAW systems as well as those under development, represent all three types of technologies. Each technology has strong and weak points and none provide a perfect solution. =Pulse-Doppler radar-based= ;France * MWS - 20 (Damien) originally from Dassault Electronique (now Thales) ;Israel * EL/M-2160 (ALQ ‚Äì 199) from ELTA ;Japan * J/APQ ‚Äì 1 * from Mitsubishi Electronic Corporation ;Russia *LIP MAW (obsolete system) *Arbalet-D from Phazatron NIIR Corporation ;UK *PVS 2000 originally from GEC Marconi and Plessey Avionics (now SELEX and Thales) (obsolete system) ;UK and Italy *AMIDS from SELEX and Elettronica (uncertain of production/development status) ;USA *AN/ALQ ‚Äì 127 originally from Westinghouse (now Northrop Grumman) (obsolete system) *AN/ALQ ‚Äì 153 originally from Westinghouse (now Northrop Grumman) (obsolete system) *AN/ALQ ‚Äì 154 from AIL (obsolete system) *AN/ALQ ‚Äì 156 from BAE Systems EI&S; =Infrared-based= ;Israel *PAWS from Elisra ;France *DDM- SAMIR/DDM-NG from Sagem and MBDA ;Germany *PIMAWS from BGT (uncertain of production/development status) ;Italy *Leonardo MAIR(in operation) https://www.leonardocompany.com/en/products/mair ;Germany and France *MIRAS from Hensoldt (Hensoldt Holding GmbH) and Thales ;Russia *President-S (BKO) from KRET and Scientific-Research Institute Ekranhttp://www.deagel.com/Protection-Systems/President-S_a003126001.aspx ;UK *ELIX-IR from Thales UK (uncertain of production/development status) ;USA *AN/AAR 44B from L-3 Cincinnati Electronics *MIMS from Northop Grumman (uncertain of production/development status) *JATAS, under development by Alliant Techsystems (ATK) and BAE Systems under a USN contract, with initial operational deployment scheduled for late 2015 *AN/AAR-56 from Lockheed Martin for F-22 (operational) *AN/AAQ-37 distributed aperture system (DAS) from Northrop Grumman for F-35 (In production/testing) ;USA and Israel *PAWS - 2 from Raytheon and Elisra =Ultraviolet-based= ;Germany *AN/AAR 60 or MILDS (Missile Launch Detection System) from Hensoldt Holding GmbH.\\"MILDS AN/AAR-60 Missile Warning System.\\" EADS North America, Retrieved 18 July 2013. ;Israel *Guitar ‚Äì 350 from Rafael (Uncertain of production/development status) ;Sweden/South Africa * MAW 300 from Saab Avitronics\\"MAW 300\\" Saab Avitronics ;USA *AN/AAR 47 with upgraded AN/AAR-47A(V)2 sensors. *AN/AAR 54 originally from Westinghouse (now Northrop Grumman) *AN/AAR 57 originally from Sanders (now BAE Systems EI&S;) ;Russia * 101KS-U part of the 101KS Atoll electro- optical (EO) system for the Russian Air Force Su-57 fifth generation aircraft.

The parish is bounded on the north by the Celtic Sea, on the southeast by Forrabury and Minster parish and on the west by Tintagel parish. History and description The hamlet of Trevalga lies 500 metres from the coast on the seaward side of the road from Boscastle to Tintagel. Unusually, the hamlet is part of an estate held in trust by The Gerald Curgenven Will Trust with profits after maintenance going to Marlborough College, a public school in Wiltshire. The estate has been held in trust since 1961 under a bequest of the last Lord of Trevalga Manor, Gerald Curgenven (died 1959). This was to ensure its preservation from development and allow local families to remain there. However, in 2010, the college was given faulty legal advice that it was actually the owner of the hamlet. As it would be breaking charity law in doing so the College thereafter placed the entire estate on the market. This situation caused understandable concern amongst the tenants, and other inhabitants, about the hamlet's future. Thereafter, protests and petitions were set up, using the social networking website Facebook in an attempt to prevent the sale. The legality of the sale was disputed by the Trustees and Tenants of the estate; then the sale was suspended and the Manor placed back into the hands of the Trustees. There were formerly a slate quarry and a silver lead mine in the parish. Trevalga was one of the manors held by King William at the time of the Domesday Book (1086); it had formerly been held by Queen Matilda and before her by Britric. There were 2 ploughs but land for 8 ploughs; 14 households (including serfs, villeins and smallholders), the livestock was mainly sheep and the pasture was 1 league long and half a league wide. The annual value was ¬£4.Thorn, Caroline, et al. (eds.) (1979) Cornwall (Domesday Book; 10.) Chichester: Phillimore; entry 1,17 The recorded history of the manor continues in the 13th century when it was held by the family of Bassett; in 1601 the Bassetts sold it to the family of Welsh, who were succeeded by the family of Northcote. In 1682 it was bought by William Bolitho of Exeter; upon the death of Richard Bolitho Stephens in 1928 it was inherited by his widow. Mrs. Stephens donated to the church a fine pulpit, reading desk and sanctuary chair, in memory of her late husband.Palmer (1930) Trevalga is mentioned in the song Black and Gold along with other places nearby. Trevalga lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). =Notable buildings= The parish church is dedicated to St Petroc; the patrons of the rectory are the dean and chapter of Truro. The earliest recorded rectors are Richard (1173) and Robert Bardolph (1191). The church was built in the 12th and 13th centuries (the tower being later than the nave and chancel). After restoration work the church was reopened in 1875. For many years it has been a member of the Boscastle Group of Anglican parishes.Pevsner, N. (1970) Cornwall, 2nd ed., edited by Enid Radcliffe. Penguin BooksPalmer, W. S. Cave (1930) Souvenir of the Parish and Church of Trevalga. Trevalga: [the Author] The original manor house of Trevalga is Redevallen in the adjoining parish of Minster. The current building dates from 1642 but is possibly on the site of an earlier building. Writing in 1879, Sir John Maclean describes the principal room being decorated with a moulded cornice, and that it formerly had a fine moulded ceiling. MacLean also records that the walls were pierced for musketry. The house is a grade II listed building. There is an early Cornish wheel-headed wayside cross in the churchyard.Langdon, A. G. (1896) Old Cornish Crosses. Truro: Joseph Pollard; p. 50 The cross is believed to date from the 8th century. It used to stand by the churchpath but was moved to the churchyard in the early 19th century by the then rector. At the southeastern corner of the parish of Trevalga is Trevalga Mill, a ruined eighteenth century water mill. The mill lies in fields next to the Trevillet River and is the only one of the four mills on the river (the others are Halgabron, Trevillet and Trethevy) to lie upstream of the waterfall currently known as St Nectan's Kieve. The mill belonged to the nearby manor of Redevallen and would have been used first for grinding corn then perhaps also the making of worsted.The \\"Chapel\\" Kieve and Gorge of \\"St Nectan\\" Trevillet Millcombe, Tintagel; by Sidney J.

Life Klehr was born as the son of a teacher. After attending the Volksschule in Wohlau until 1918 he got an apprenticeship with a cabinet maker, passing the exam in 1921 that allowed him to do it by trade. As of 1934 he worked as a night porter in a community home, then subsequently as a nurse in a sanatorium. From 1938 he was assistant sergeant at Wohlau prison. Klehr was a member of the Nazi Party and Allgemeine SS as of 1932. He participated in military exercises with the Wehrmacht and received training to become a medic. Shortly before the beginning of the war he was drafted into the Waffen-SS. In August 1939 he was transferred to Buchenwald concentration camp as a guard, then to Dachau concentration camp as a medical orderly a year later. In January 1941 he was promoted to SS-Unterscharf√ºhrer and transferred to Auschwitz, working as a medical orderly in the prisoners' infirmary. Klehr was renowned for killing by phenol injections into the heart, something he essentially took over as of some time in 1942. He devised ways to optimise the speed of the killing process, such as experimenting with the positioning of prisoners before their injection. Klehr occasionally conducted selections himself, and when he was informed that the camp doctor was unavailable, stated immediately, \\"Today I am the camp doctor.\\" Due to various descriptions of him standing against a background of corpses \\"wearing either a white coat or \\"a pink-rubber apron and rubber gloves\\" and \\"holding a 20-cc hypodermic with a long needle\\" in his hands, Klehr has been described as the \\"ultimate caricature of the omnipotent Auschwitz doctor.\\" He was famed for his sadistic cruelty.http://auschwitz.org/en/history/the-ss-garrison/the-organizational- structure-of-auschwitz-concentration-camp As told by Witold Pilecki, who had first hand knowledge of Klehr's operations in Auschwitz \\"They were not exclusively those seriously ill or exhausted. Some were here only because Klehr did not like them and put them down in the \\"needle list\\", there was no way out. The butchers were also different than in the beginning of the camp; nevertheless I do not know if they may be called degenerates. Klehr used to murder with his needle with great zeal, mad eyes and sadistic smile, he put a stroke on the wall after the killing of each victim. In my times, he brought the list of those killed by him up to the number fourteen thousand and he boasted every day with great delight, like a hunter who told of the trophies of the chase.\\" https://archive.org/stream/WITOLDREPORT/WITOLD%20REPORT_djvu.txt In 1943 Klehr became head of the disinfection squad (Desinfektionskommando). As a handler of Zyklon B his tasks included not only delousing living quarters and clothes, but direct involvement in the mass gassing of prisoners. He was one of those responsible for inserting the gas. He was present during selections where those incapable of working were sent to the gas chambers, and drew up a schedule as to who under him was to insert the Zyklon B.Naumann, Bernd. Auschwitz (NY:1966), pp 76-77. On 20 April 1943 Klehr was awarded the War Merit Cross second class with swords. He was transferred to the Gleiwitz subcamp in 1944 where he was head of the prisoners' hospital and was medically responsible for Glewitz camps I to IV. After the war Upon the evacuation of Auschwitz Klehr guarded prisoners being transported to Gross-Rosen concentration camp, after which he was taken under command by an SS combat unit. In the beginning of May 1945 he was taken prisoner in Austria by Americans and was held until 1948. He returned to his family in Braunschweig and resumed work as a cabinet maker. In April 1960 the Frankfurt prosecutor's office issued an arrest warrant which was executed in September after Klehr's whereabouts was determined. On 19 August 1965, the court convicted him of murder in at least 475 cases, assistance in the joint murder of at least 2730 cases, and sentenced him to life imprisonment with an additional 15 years. The witness Glowacki testified in court that Klehr killed the women who survived the massacre after the alleged uprising at the Budy female subcamp by phenol injection. While in prison, Klehr was interviewed by journalist and film-maker Ebbo Demant. When Demant brings up Holocaust denial, Klehr said: On 25 January 1988, Klehr's sentence was suspended due to unfitness for custody (Vollzugsuntauglichkeit). On 10 June, he was ordered to serve the remainder on probation. After seven months of freedom, he died at age 83.

It was founded during the Tang Dynasty. The temple is listed as an architecture of national heritage and major conservation. It is situated on a land of 100,000 square meters. There are more than 400 large stone pillars. The temple houses important cultural treasures, including: * a Tang Dynasty sharira stupa with a tilt; * a Liang Dynasty (502-587) jade Buddha and stone sharira stupa; * a Shu-Han ritual bronze ding vessel from the Zhangwu era (220s); * a Tang Dynasty ceramic stupa; * a copy of the Flower Adornment Sutra (Avatamsaka Sutra) dated back to the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368), with gold and silver pigments. Temple The temple was first built during the Tang Dynasty. It was burnt down during the Ming Dynasty; and rebuilt after the Kangxi Emperor (1654-1722) reign in Qing Dynasty. On Aug 16, 1956, the temple was listed as one of the first group of Sichuan Historical and Revolution Culture Heritage Conservation unit. On July 7, 1980, it was re-listed as one of Sichuan‚Äôs Cultural Heritage Conservation Unit. On June 25, 2001, it was listed as a major National Cultural Heritage Conservation Unit. The temples has a number of halls, including the Qing-era Arhat Hall (), containing 500 two-meter-high clay figurines of arhats. The temple also houses numerous treasures, including white jade Buddha from Burma and a stone tablet engraved with 1000 Buddhist figures.Harper (2007), 765. Pagoda The Sharira Stupa (), the temple's pagoda, is the only part of the temple that still dates from the Tang dynasty. It was built between 862-888. It is square, has thirteen floors, and is 30 meters tall. The inside of the pagoda is solid, so one cannot go inside. The first floor of the pagoda is quite tall compared to the upper floors. The upper floors all feature upturned eaves, with copper bells hanging from them. The top of the pagoda is gold-plated, and each of the four sides of every floor has an image of the Buddha inlaid in gold.Xu (2007), 95. Shortly after the pagoda‚Äôs construction in the Tang Dynasty, the upper part of the pagoda partially collapsed. During the Ming Dynasty, the upper part of the pagoda was restored, but the seventh floor and those above were built tilted slightly towards the west, not according to the pagodas original proportions. As a result, the pagoda has a noticeable tilt.  See also  * List of leaning towers#China Notes References *Harper, Damian ed. China. London: Lonely Planet, 2007. *Xu Xiaoying, ed.

Description From the age of Caracalla onwards carved sarcophagus production shows a kind of reaction to the \\"pittoricism\\" of examples from the preceding era (late 2nd-early 3rd century), such as the Portona sarcophagus), with a return to richer plasticity, as is also documented in Roman portraiture between 215 and 250. Hugely influenced by their use in the eastern empire and the middle east, hunting scenes in Roman art had started to become popular in Hadrianic art and the popularity of their use on sarcophagi spread thanks to Caracalla's predilection for Alexander the Great and his hunts and - the Mattei example is one of the earliest with such scenes. The hunting scenes, with major influence from the eastern empire. In the Roman world it acquired a new meaning as a signifier of military values, as shown by the Virtus-Roma figure in Amazonian dress standing behind the mounted hunter in this scene. This mounted hunter has a physiognomic portrait (datable to between 220 and 230, by comparison with the style of the portrait of Caracalla) and hurls a spear towards a lion at the right. Beneath this lions paws is a fallen hunter with sword and shield, and under this lion is another, dead lion. To the left are two standing nude divinities, possibly the Dioscuri. To the right, above the live lion, is a beardless mounted hunter in a tunic and another nude standing figure. The composition is very crowded, with overlapping figures in a scheme unknown in 2nd century classicism. The use of drilling and the abundant chiaroscuro of high relief are typical of the expressionism of the turn of the 2nd/3rd centuries, though the solid plasticity and consistency of the figures indicate a continuing classicism. This compositional pattern is repeated with little variation on later hunting sarcophagi.

PDF The term \\"preflex\\" for such a zero-delay, intrinsic feedback loop was coined by Loeb. Unlike stabilization methods using neurons, such as reflexes and higher brain control, a preflex happens with minimal time delay; however, it only stabilizes the main movements of the musculoskeletal system. Visco-elastic correction Muscles possess nonlinear visco-elastic properties when they contract. This property can autocorrect movements when a muscle is forced to change its length, and at a velocity different from that with which it was originally commanded. Such automatic correction is useful when a commanded action is perturbated, for example, if a step goes into a hole as this causes the foot to unexpectedly stretch down. The nonlinear visco-elastic properties of muscles interact with these perturbation induced velocity and length differences such that they counteract directly, as they happen, the effects upon the body of the perturbation. Part of the resistance to perturbation is passive, by means of the nonlinear increase in passive tension and joint torques produced by muscular and other soft tissues. Tissue prestress is a preflexive property that constitutes a basal level of passive tension which, due to its presence in antagonistic tissues of a joint, increases joint passive stiffness and stability. Evolutionary opportunity Muscles contain many different systems on which the evolutionary selection of preflex stabilization can operate. The deltoid muscle, for example, consists of at least seven segments with different bone attachments and neural control. Within each muscle segment, there exists a complex internal structure that goes down to one in which each muscle unit consists of a tendon, aponeurosis, and a fascicle of active contractile and passive elements. Another source of variation is in the internal architecture of the fiber orientation relative to a muscle‚Äôs line of action, for example, as found in pennate muscles. The complexities of the different visco-elastic length- and velocity-force relationships of these subparts provides the opportunity for the adaptive selection of structurally complex muscle biocomposites with highly task-tuned nonlinear visco-elastic length- velocity- force relationships. This nature of muscles to be composite structures thus provides the adaptive opportunity for evolution to modify the visco-elastic reactions of the musculoskeletal system so they counteract perturbations without the need for spinal or higher levels of control.  Examples  = Leg step recovery = Helmeted guineafowl like many other bipedal birds walk upon rough ground. When a guineafowl's leg steps into a hole (a common disruption against which evolution has tuned the nonlinear visco-elastic properties of its musculoskeletal system), a momentarily uncommanded velocity and length change in the muscles that span its leg joints occurs. This length/velocity discrepancy interacts with the nonlinear length and velocity- force relationships that have evolved in response to such a disruption with the result that the leg extends further into the hole, and thus keeps the bird‚Äôs body stable and upright. =Leg wiping = It is the intrinsic musculoskeletal properties of a frog‚Äôs leg, not neurally mediated spinal reflexes, that stabilize its wiping movements at irritants when the leg movement is instigated. =Squat jumps = A human example of a preflex stabilization occurs when a person explosively jumps up from a squat position, and the leg muscles act to provide a minimal time delay against perturbations from the vertical.

MTK also won that year's Super Cup trophy to bring the good times back to the famous Budapest club. = Vasas = A short stint in charge of Vasas SC then followed, before he packed his bags once more and headed back to Kuwait. = Al-Salmiya = He took the Al Salmiya Club to third spot and also managed to help them finish in the top 4 of the GCC cup. = Gy≈ër = In 2007, Egerv√°ri headed to Gy≈ër, in Hungary, and took this club from close to bottom of the league to third spot, and qualification into the UEFA Cup. This was made even more special as it was the first time in 22 years that Gy≈ëri ETO FC made it into Europe. He helped Gy≈ër beat Zestafoni of Georgia, over two legs, before meeting German giants VfB Stuttgart in the next round. His young Gy≈ër side suffered numerous injuries, with key captain Peter Stark, breaking his ribs, which resulted in him missing most of the season. Gy≈ër also suffered from fatigue after their involvement in the UEFA Cup, and the management of the club decided to do without his services in December 2008. = Hungary U-20 = Egerv√°ri spent a short period of six months out of the game, deciding to focus on improving his English language skills during that time. He did receive offers from clubs for his services, but felt that he needed to properly recharge his batteries. He then received an offer that he simply could not refuse. The then President of the Hungarian FA, Istvan Kisteleki, offered him the U20 national team manager's job, with little over a month before the 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup finals in Egypt. He accepted, and began to work on his young squad with very little time allowed. Egerv√°ri once again proved his worth by guiding the little fancied Hungarians to a bronze medal position in the finals, which included big wins over the Italy national under-20 football team and Czech Republic national under-20 football team. His young Hungarian side returned to Budapest airport amidst wild celebrations, with over a thousand people welcoming home his side. It was perhaps the best achievement from a Hungarian side since the 1954 FIFA World Cup finals in Switzerland. He took on the additional role of U21 team manager and defeated the Italian U21 side in Hungary with a 2‚Äì0 win. The U21s currently sit in second place, with every chance of qualifying for the London 2012 Olympic games. = Hungary = The departure of Dutchman Erwin Koeman resulted in Egerv√°ri being the obvious choice to manage the full Hungarian national side for the first time. He was officially appointed on 23 July 2010, with his first task being to take the Hungarian national side to England for a friendly at Wembley Stadium on 11 August 2010. Once again he had been given the challenge of preparing his side with very little time, but as his success in Egypt with the U-20 side showed, he was more than up to the challenge. In the Euro 2012 qualifying, Egerv√°ri debuted against Sweden by losing 2‚Äì0 in Stockholm on 3 September 2010. On home turf his debut was a 2‚Äì1 win against Moldova. In their third match the team crushed San Marino 8‚Äì0 at Pusk√°s Ferenc Stadium. Their second away match was in Helsinki Olympic Stadium, where √Åd√°m Szalai scored the opening goal. Mikael Forssell equalized the result in the 88th minute, but Hungary won the match on a late goal by Bal√°zs Dzsudzs√°k in the 94th minute. In 2011 Hungary played their first match against Azerbaijan in Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Dubai. In the 37th minute, Gergely Rudolf scored a goal. The second goal was scored by Tam√°s Hajnal in the 81st minute. Hungary beat Azerbaijan 2‚Äì0 in a friendly match. The first match in the Euro 2012 Qualifiers was against the Netherlands at home in the Pusk√°s Ferenc Stadium on 25 March 2011. Hungary was beaten by 4‚Äì1 in front of 23,817 supporters. The second match was four days later on 29 March 2011. Hungary was beaten by 5‚Äì3 in a thrilling match. Gergely Rudolf scored the equalizer (1‚Äì1), Gera Zolt√°n scored the second Hungarian goal (1‚Äì2) and the third goal (3‚Äì3). Finally, the Netherlands beat Hungary 5‚Äì3 in the Amsterdam Arena. In March 2011, Hungary was third in their group. One of the most important success of Egerv√°ri's coaching career was the Euro 2012 qualifying between Hungary and Sweden. Due to the injuries of key people like Bal√°zs Dzsudzs√°k, Roland Juh√°sz, and Zolt√°n Gera, nobody expected a victory against Sweden. On 2 September 2011, Szabics scored against Sweden at the Pusk√°s Ferenc Stadium in the last minutes of the first half. However, Sweden equalized in the second half. A late goal by Szabics's fellow striker Gergely Rudolf resulted the celebration of 25,000 spectators after beating Sweden in the Euro 2012 qualifying by 2‚Äì1. On 11 October 2013, Egerv√°ri resigned immediately after an 8‚Äì1 defeat against the Netherlands in Amsterdam in a penultimate game in the FIFA World Cup 2014 qualifying round, in which Hungary had the chance of securing a second place in Group D that could have entitled it to play-off games. He was remembered for the renaissance of modern Hungarian football, and contributed for Hungary's later success in UEFA Euro 2016. =Di√≥sgy≈ër= On 29 December 2015, he was appointed as the manager of Nemzeti Bajnoks√°g I club Di√≥sgy≈ëri VTK.

At least 10,000 Roman sarcophagi have survived, with fragments possibly representing as many as 20,000.Ja≈õ Elsner, introduction to Life, Death and Representation: Some New Work on Roman Sarcophagi (De Gruyter, 2011), p. 1. Although mythological scenes have been quite widely studied,Elsner, introduction to Life, Death and Representation, p. 12. sarcophagus relief has been called the \\"richest single source of Roman iconography,\\"Elsner, introduction to Life, Death and Representation, p. 14. and may also depict the deceased's occupation or life course, military scenes, and other subject matter. The same workshops produced sarcophagi with Jewish or Christian imagery.Elsner, introduction to Life, Death and Representation, pp. 1, 9. Early Christian sarcophagi produced from the late 3rd century onwards, represent the earliest form of large Christian sculpture, and are important for the study of Early Christian art. They were mostly made in a few major cities, including Rome and Athens, which exported them to other cities. Elsewhere the stela gravestone remained more common. They were always a very expensive form reserved for the elite, and especially so in the relatively few very elaborately carved examples; most were always relatively plain, with inscriptions, or symbols such as garlands. Sarcophagi divide into a number of styles, by the producing area. \\"Roman\\" ones were made to rest against a wall, and one side was left uncarved, while \\"Attic\\" and other types were carved on all four sides; but the short sides were generally less elaborately decorated in both types.Hennig, 93‚Äì94 The time taken to make them encouraged the use of standard subjects, to which inscriptions might be added to personalize them, and portraits of the deceased were slow to appear. The sarcophagi offer examples of intricate reliefs that depict scenes often based on Greek and Roman mythology or mystery religions that offered personal salvation, and allegorical representations. Roman funerary art also offers a variety of scenes from everyday life, such as game-playing, hunting, and military endeavors. Early Christian art quickly adopted the sarcophagus, and they are the most common form of early Christian sculpture, progressing from simple examples with symbols to elaborate fronts, often with small scenes of the Life of Christ in two rows within an architectural framework. The Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus (ca. 359) is of this type, and the earlier Dogmatic Sarcophagus rather simpler. The huge porphyry Sarcophagi of Helena and Constantina are grand Imperial examples. Cremation was the predominant means of disposing of remains in the Roman Republic. Ashes contained in cinerary urns and other monumental vessels were placed in tombs. From the 2nd century AD onward, inhumation became more common, and after the Roman Empire came under Christian rule, was standard practice.Glenys Davies, \\"Before Sarcophagi,\\" in Life, Death and Representation, p. 20ff. The Sarcophagus of Lucius Cornelius Scipio Barbatus is a rare example from much earlier. A sarcophagus, which means \\"flesh-eater\\" in Greek, is a stone coffin used for inhumation burials. Sarcophagi were commissioned not only for the elite of Roman society (mature male citizens), but also for children, entire families, and beloved wives and mothers. The most expensive sarcophagi were made from marble, but other stones, lead, and wood were used as well. Along with the range in production material, there existed a variety of styles and shapes, depending on where the sarcophagus was produced and whom it was produced for. History =Before sarcophagi= Inhumation burial practices and the use of sarcophagi were not always the favored Roman funerary custom. The Etruscans and Greeks used sarcophagi for centuries before the Romans finally adopted the practice in the second century. Prior to that period, the dead were usually cremated and placed in marble ash chests or ash altars, or were simply commemorated with a grave altar that was not designed to hold cremated remains. Despite being the main funerary custom during the Roman Republic, ash chests and grave altars virtually disappeared from the market only a century after the advent of the sarcophagus. It is often assumed that the popularity for sarcophagi began with the Roman aristocracy and gradually became more accepted by the lower classes. However, in the past, the most expensive and ostentatious grave altars and ash chests were commissioned more frequently by wealthy freedmen and other members of the emerging middle class than by the Roman elite. Due to this fact and the lack of inscriptions on early sarcophagi, there is not enough evidence to make a judgment on whether or not the fashion for sarcophagi began with a specific social class. Surviving evidence does indicate that a great majority of early sarcophagi were used for children. This suggests that the change in burial practice may not have simply stemmed from a change in fashion, but perhaps from altered burial attitudes. It is possible that the decision to begin inhuming bodies occurred because families believed that inhumation was a kinder, and less disturbing burial rite than cremation, thus necessitating a shift in burial monument. =Stylistic transition from altars and ash chests to sarcophagi= Although grave altars and ash chests virtually disappeared from the market in the second century, aspects of their decoration endured in some stylistic elements of sarcophagi. The largest stylistic group of early sarcophagi in the second century is garland sarcophagi, a custom of decoration that was previously used on ash chests and grave altars. Though the premise of the decoration is the same, there are some differences. The garland supports are often human figures instead of the animal heads used previously. In addition, specific mythological scenes fill the field, rather than small birds or other minor scenes. The inscription panel on garland ash altars and chests is also missing on garland sarcophagi. When a sarcophagus did have an inscription, it seemed to be an extra addition and usually ran along the top edge of the chest or between the decorations. The fact that early garland sarcophagi continued the tradition of grave altars with decorated garlands suggests that the customers and sculptors of sarcophagi had similar approaches to those who purchased and produced grave altars. Both monuments employed a similar collection of stylistic motifs with only subtle shifts in iconography. =Metropolitan Roman, Attic, and Asiatic sarcophagus production centers= The Sarcophagus with the Triumph of Dionysus is a good example of a Metropolitan Roman-style sarcophagus with its flat lid, three-sided decoration, and Dionysian scenes from Greek mythology. Sarcophagi production of the ancient Roman Empire involved three main parties: the customer, the sculpting workshop that carved the monument, and the quarry-based workshop that supplied the materials. The distance between these parties was highly variable due to the extensive size of the Empire. Metropolitan Roman, Attic, and Asiatic were the three major regional types of sarcophagi that dominated trade throughout the Roman Empire. Although they were divided into regions, the production of sarcophagi was not as simple as it might appear. For example, Attic workshops were close to Mount Pentelikon, the source of their materials, but were usually very far from their client. The opposite was true for the workshops of Metropolitan Rome, who tended to import large, roughed out sarcophagi from distant quarries in order to complete their commissions. Depending on distance and customer request (some customers might choose to have elements of their sarcophagi left unfinished until a future date, introducing the possibility of further work after the main commission), sarcophagi were in many different stages of production during transport. As a result, it is difficult to develop a standardized model of production. Metropolitan Rome Rome was the primary production center in the western part of the empire. A Metropolitan Roman sarcophagus often took the shape of a low rectangular box with a flat lid. As the sarcophagus was usually placed in a niche or against a wall in a mausoleum, they were usually only decorated on the front and two shorter sides. Many were decorated with carvings of garlands and fruits and leaves, as well as narrative scenes from Greek mythology. Battle and hunting scenes, biographical events from the life of the deceased, portrait busts, the profession of the deceased and abstract designs were also popular. Attic Asiatic garland sarcophagus, the predominant type during the reigns of Trajan and Hadrian (Walters Art Museum),Davies, \\"Before Sarcophagi,\\" in Life, Death and Representation, pp. 21, 28ff. dated between 150 and 180, in Dokimeion marble, so probably made in Phrygia and then shipped to Rome. The gable-roof lid exemplifies the garland tradition common on ash altars and chests. It also has several incomplete parts on its four sides, suggesting the work was interrupted or it was needed on short notice. Athens was the main production center for Attic style sarcophagi. These workshops mainly produced sarcophagi for export. They were rectangular in shape and were often decorated on all four sides, unlike the Metropolitan Roman style, with ornamental carvings along the bottom and upper edge of the monument. The lids were also different from the flat metropolitan Roman style and featured a pitched gable roof, or a kline lid, which is carved in the style of couch cushions on which the form of the deceased reclines. The great majority of these sarcophagi also featured mythological subjects, especially the Trojan War, Achilles, and battles with the Amazons. Asia Minor (Asiatic) The Dokimeion workshops in Phrygia specialized in architecturally formed large-scale Asiatic sarcophagi. Many featured a series of columns joined together by an entablature on all four sides with human figures in the area between the columns. The lids were often made in the gabled-roof design in order to complete the architectural-style sarcophagi so the coffin formed a sort of house or temple for the deceased. Other cities in Asia Minor produced sarcophagi of the garland tradition as well. In general, the sarcophagi were decorated on either three or four sides, depending on whether they were to be displayed on a pedestal in an open-air setting or against the walls inside tombs. =Myth and meaning on ancient Roman sarcophagi= A transition from the classical garland and seasonal reliefs with smaller mythological figures to a greater focus on full mythological scenes began with the break up of the classical style in the late second century towards the end of Marcus Aurelius' reign. This shift led to the development of popular themes and meanings portrayed through mythological scenes and allegories. The most popular mythological scenes on Roman sarcophagi functioned as aids to mourning, visions of life and happiness, and opportunities for self-portrayal for Roman citizens. Images of Meleager, the hero who slew the Calydonian Boar, being mourned by his lover and hunting companion Atlanta, as well as images of Achilles mourning Patroclus were very common on sarcophagi that acted as grieving aids. In both cases, the mythological scenes were akin to mourning practices of ordinary Roman citizens in an effort to reflect their grief and comfort them when they visited the tomb. Playful images depicting Nereids, Dionysiac triumphs, and love scenes of Dionysus and Ariadne were also commonly represented on sarcophagi. It is possible that these scenes of happiness and love in the face of death and mourning encouraged the living to enjoy life while they could, and reflected the celebration and meals that the mourners would later enjoy in the tomb when they returned to visit the deceased. The third century involved the return in popularity of self-representation on Roman sarcophagi. There were several different ways Roman citizens approached self-representation on sarcophagi. Some sarcophagi had actual representations of the face or full figure of the deceased. In other cases, mythological portraits were used to connect characteristics of the deceased with traits of the hero or heroine portrayed. For example, common mythological portraits of deceased women identified them with women of lauded traits in myth, such as the devoted Selene or loyal Alcestis. Scenes featuring the figures of Meleager and Achilles expressed bravery and were often produced on sarcophagi holding deceased men. Biographical scenes that emphasize the true virtues of Roman citizens were also used to commemorate the deceased. Scholars argue that these biographical scenes, as well as the comparisons to mythological characters, suggest that self-portrayal on Roman sarcophagi did not exist to celebrate the traits of the deceased, but rather to emphasize favored Roman cultural values and demonstrate that the family of the deceased were educated members of the elite that could understand difficult mythological allegories. =Third- and fourth- century sarcophagi= The breakup of the classical style led to a period in which full mythological reliefs with an increase in the number of figures and an elongation of forms became more popular, as discussed above. The proportion of figures on the reliefs also became increasingly unbalanced, with the main figures taking up the greatest area with smaller figures crowded in the small pockets of empty space. In the third century, another transition in theme and style of sarcophagi involved the return in popularity of representing mythological and non-mythological portraits of the deceased. Imagery of the four seasons also becomes popular during the third and fourth centuries. With the advent of Christianity in the third century, traditional motifs, like the seasons, remained, and images representing a belief in the afterlife appeared. The change in style brought by Christianity is perhaps most significant, as it signals a change in emphasis on images of retrospection, and introduced images of an afterlife. Themes and Imagery =The Tragic Sarcophagi= The Massacre of the Niobids Roman sarcophagus showing the massacre of Niobe ºs children. Ca 160 AD. Glyptothek, Munich The story of Niobe and her 14 children is a tragic one. Niobe, after having so many children that reached maturity, bragged about having so many children to Leto, who had only two. This act of hubris was unforgivable to the Titan, so she sent her two children, Apollo and Artemis, to kill her children. According to Ovid's version, the twins kill the sons first while they practice riding outside the city, and then the daughters as they are mourning their brothers and fathers. In the myth, supposedly the father kills himself out of grief after their seven sons die, and when Artemis has killed all but the youngest daughter, Niobe begs for her to be spared. Alas, she is not spared, and out of grief Niobe turns to stone. On the Sarcophagus showing the massacre of Niobe's children, carved ca. 160 AD and now in Munich's Glyptothek, Artemis is depicted on the far left shooting five female Niobids (‚ÄúNiobids‚Äù is a term for the children of Niobe), with Apollo on the far right shooting five male Niobids, both of which have a dead child laying at their feet. The front of this sarcophagus only shows ten Niobids, but two more are depicted on either side of it. There are also two bearded Pedagogues shown trying to save the Niobids on the front and a nurse on the left trying to do the same on the front, along with Niobe herself on the left trying to protect one of her daughters. The lid depicts all 14 corpses stacked on top of one another in a disorderly fashion, emphasizing the heartlessness of this tragedy. This myth is used on relatively few sarcophagi, but like many other sarcophagi depicting tragedies, the intention behind this imagery is to show the viewer how tragic the death of their loved one was. All 14 Niobids were taken as children, which is a tragedy in that they had so much longer to live and more things to do, and the manner in which they died is also highly tragic. Niobe, especially, must have felt very upset with the loss of her children, since she was previously so happy to have had so many children, she had farther to fall emotionally. Plus, she lost her husband due to this massacre, so she was truly alone in the world. The person who picked out this sarcophagus for their loved one likely saw themselves as Niobe and their loved one as the Niobids, left behind after a tragedy to mourn alone. This imagery was not used to comfort those left behind, but to emphasize to the latter what had been lost, and perhaps they found solace in comparing their own loss to that of Niobe. Medea/Creusa  Roman sarcophagus showing the story of Medea and Creusa. Ca 150 AD. Altes Museum, Berlin Medea‚Äôs story is commonly considered one of the first feminist pieces of literature, since the plight of its main character, Medea, a strong-willed woman hemmed in by a patriarchal system, is shown to be a sympathetic one, even if her actions are questionable. In her myth, she betrays her father, Creon, king of Colchis, to help Jason, leader of the Argonauts, steal the Golden Fleece. Then, they sail to Corinth, where they live together happily for a few years and have two children. Eventually, Jason repudiates Medea in order to marry the princess of Corinth, Creusa (or sometimes referred to as Glauce). Medea does not take lightly to this, since she gave up everything for Jason, so in her rage, she infuses a golden diadem and a robe with poisonous magic, and has her two sons deliver the lethal gifts to the princess. Creusa puts them on, assuming these gifts innocuous, and catches on fire, her flesh melting from the magical enchantments. Her father, Creon, attempts to pull the gifts off his daughter, but‚Äîas related in Euripides's canonical drama‚Äîhe too dies from this contact. Both Creon and Creusa/Glauce thus suffer horrible deaths. For the final touch, Medea kills her own children, takes their corpses, and rides off on her chariot drawn by snakes. A good example of its presentation on Roman sarcophagi is the piece carved ca. 150 AD and now in Berlin's Altes Museum. Reading it from left to right, we see, first, Jason standing and watching as his and Medea's two young sons prepare to carry the two poisoned gifts to the princess Creusa, while their aged nurse watches over them; and then just to the right, Jason again, paying a visit to the seated princess. The center is given over to the princess's horrific end: Creon looks on Creusa in horror as his daughter flails about, screaming, flames shooting up from her forehead, as she dies a gruesome death. To the right of that, Medea is shown drawing her sword, about to kill her children playing innocently at her feet, and then on the far right she escapes in her chariot drawn by winged serpents, with one child's corpse over her shoulder, while the leg of the other dangles limply from the back of the chariot. Although this is Medea's story, the use of this myth on sarcophagi is not to compare the deceased to Medea, but rather to Creusa. Showing Creusa perfectly happy and youthful in the first half of the imagery and immediately following it up with her tragic death and the horrible death of Medea's children emphasizes the immense loss that the family feels. When one imagines their loved one as Creusa, it seems that she had everything waiting for her in life but was cruelly stolen from our world far before her time, and Creon likewise functions as a stand-in for the family member of the deceased who would feel the loss of their loved one most. Particularly in the time of the Romans, the greatest achievement in a woman's life was marriage, and the worst disaster her death. As such, the imagery on Medea sarcophagi show the highest point of her life, followed by her sudden, terrible death, making the tragedy all the worse through the surprise of the family. Abduction of Persephone Roman sarcophagus showing the abduction of Persephone. Ca. 230‚Äì240 AD. Capitoline Museum, Rome Several versions of the myth of the abduction of Persephone survive from antiquity, the Homeric Hymn to Demeter being one, and the version in Ovid‚Äôs Metamorphoses being another. In the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, Persephone is picking flowers in a field with other goddesses, among them Artemis and Athena, when the ground suddenly opens up. Hades flies out of it on his chariot, grabs Persephone, and whisks her away to the underworld. When Demeter, her mother, finds out what happened, she prevents crops from growing, and therefore preventing the gods from receiving the offerings they so desire. Zeus, in exchange for her stopping her tirade, sends Hermes down to the Underworld to order Hades to bring her back, and he obliged. However, Hades had earlier offered Persephone pomegranate seeds, and she had eaten four, binding her to him as his wife (the eating of pomegranates, a symbol of sexual awakening and fertility, played a role in Greek weddings). Zeus thus determined that Persephone would spend eight months of every year above ground, with her mother, while the other four months, one for each seed eaten, would see her rejoin her dark husband in the gloom of the Underworld. In Ovid‚Äôs version, there is a stronger emphasis on Hades‚Äô love for Persephone. A sarcophagus in Rome's Capitoline Museum, carved between 230 and 240 AD, renders the scene in detail. It depicts Hades snatching Persephone (here she bears the portrait features of the dead woman buried within) as the central image, with Athena reaching out towards them in an attempt to prevent the abduction from taking place. Demeter is on her chariot pulled by serpents on the far left, a way of visualizing her wrath, even though she was not present during the abduction. In between her and Athena is a scene of Hades surprising Persephone, Persephone looking unwilling, Aphrodite above her urging her to go with him, and Artemis behind Hades readying her bow to protect her companion. On the far right, Hermes is seen leading Hades‚Äô horses, Nike with a wreath in her right hand and a palm branch in her left, and Hercules with his club. This myth used on this type of sarcophagi typically meant for women, with the head of Persephone as she gets abducted commonly being a portrait of the deceased that was buried in the sarcophagus (seen in the Sarcophagus with the Rape of Persephone, ca. 230‚Äì240). The image of Demeter, Artemis, and Athena are meant to invoke the same sense of tragedy and grief that the Roman individual who got this for their loved one would feel, through the perspective of Demeter's own loss. Persephone, like the deceased loved one that rests within, was taken in her prime, without the chance of leading a full life. The tragedy of the loss of the deceased is felt throughout their own personal world, just like in the Hymn to Demeter. Additionally, this imagery could also have been used on other sarcophagi that put portrait features on Hades riding his chariot to show that the husband, who perhaps died first, is finally in union with his wife again in the afterlife. Rather than evoking a sense of tragedy of her loss, it could bring some reprieve to the family members the deceased left behind that they are finally united with their spouse in the afterlife. =Sarcophagi with 'Erotic Sleepers'= Among the most common themes depicted on Roman sarcophagi spread over a hundred years are variants of the 'erotic sleeper'. The finality of death was avoided through depictions of the deceased alternatively as asleep. Rather than dealing with the permanent loss of a loved one, they could be imagined as still present in a way, and somewhat aware of the world around them. Sleep allowed for hope amongst the living that they may one day reunite with the deceased in dreams or in their own eternal sleep. Frequently used mythological subjects included sarcophagi reliefs featuring the moon goddess Selene and the sleeping shepherd/hunter Endymion as well as reliefs featuring the god of wine Dionysus and the sleeping figure of Ariadne, which further introduced an erotic/romantic note into these scenes, celebrating the romantic love that the deceased couple had enjoyed. Selene and Endymion Roman sarcophagus showing Selene approaching Endymion. Ca. 230‚Äì240 AD. Louvre, Paris As commonly seen on sarcophagi featuring the myth of Selene and Endymion ‚Äî a good example is the sarcophagus carved ca. 230‚Äì240 AD and now in the Louvre ‚Äî Selene is depicted as descending from her chariot pulled by horses or sometimes oxen. Endymion lies before her, stretched out in a pose signifying sleep before the viewer, sometimes on a rock. Cupids surround the couple, representing their love. Oftentimes, either the god Hypnos, the personification of sleep, or the goddess Nyx, the personification of night, are pictured carrying a poppy in one hand and pouring a sleeping potion over Endymion with the other, reiterating his eternal slumber. Pastoral imagery of shepherds, flocks of animals, and herding dogs are scattered throughout setting the tone of felicity and peace. Other gods can be seen throughout these reliefs representing physical or cosmic aspects of the myth. Roman sarcophagus showing Selene approaching Endymion; mourning Cupids at corners. Ca. 150 AD. Metropolitan Museum, New York Sarcophagi of this nature that were intended for a man can be read as a portrayal of a wife visiting her deceased husband and moreover, a reflection of the viewer's own experience approaching their deceased loved one. Selene carries a torch or is accompanied by cupids carrying torches in order to light her way in the night similar to how a visitor to the deceased would carry a torch to see in the darkness of a tomb. As seen on an early (ca. 150 AD) sarcophagus in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City featuring Selene and Endymion, the cupids at the corners invert their torches as a customary Roman sign of mourning further emphasizing the funerary context. Selene can also be seen carrying a garland representative of the banquets and feasts that were held at tomb sites. The background characters of nymphs, shepherds, and cupids play the role of other familial visitors gathered around the actual sarcophagus to visit their beloved deceased. Many sarcophagi featuring Selene and Endymion have portrait features or the faces of Selene and Endymion carved out for portrait features, furthering the connection between Selene as wife and Endymion as husband. Roman sarcophagus showing Selene approaching Endymion. Ca. 200‚Äì200 AD. San Paolo fuori le mura, Rome While Selene and Endymion can still be imagined as a husband and wife, it was possible for Selene to be imagined as a representation of a deceased wife, and Endymion as a living husband. Specifically seen in a sarcophagus in Rome's cathedral of San Paolo fuori le mura, Selene is figured as an apparition of a bride, since she is here shown floating and dressed in bridal drapery. In this case, Endymion is imagined to actually be sleeping and representative of the husband of the deceased woman. The deceased bride is visiting her sleeping husband in his dreams. Above her are three stars, along with the vestiges of two small boys, who are probably personifications of Phosphorus and Hesperus, the morning and evening stars. Their presence implies that Selene's visits occur between the evening and morning and are also representative of recurring dream visits by the deceased. Looking at Selene and Endymion as representative of a married couple, the myth itself relates a cosmic love. Helios and Selene are often pictured on opposite ends of these sarcophagi representing the cycle of night and day that continues eternally. The depiction of Tellus, the personification of the Earth, as sometimes seen as a background character to these sarcophagi, also displays the cosmic significance of their love. The cupids, as well as loosely draped clothing on Selene, convey an erotic tone. Endymion is often exposed and has suggestively draped clothing either pointed out or further accentuated by cupids or extra characters such as Hypnos. Roman sarcophagus showing Selene approaching Endymion. Ca. 200‚Äì220 AD. Metropolitan Museum, New York Occasionally, Selene and Endymion sarcophagi are used to represent familial love rather than erotic marital love. A good example is another Selene and Endymion sarcophagus in New York's Metropolitan Museum, a huge and exquisitely carved piece carved ca. 200‚Äì220 AD. This one features a portrait and inscription on the lid explaining that the sarcophagus was commissioned by a daughter for her mother. The placement of the portrait above the goddess was likely done to emphasize the beauty of the mother and describe her as coming to visit her sleeping family similar to other sarcophagi of this subject. Endymion would then be a broad representation of family rather than a husband. A child sarcophagus commissioned by his parents displaying this subject matter was likely comparing the child's beauty to that of Endymion rather than as something Romantic. The erotic nature of the myth is toned down and the focus is placed on the deceased imagined as Endymion resting in eternal sleep. In a more general sense, the idea of eternal sleep rather than death provided comfort to the living family of the deceased. The removal of the finality of death brought about hope that the departed was not truly gone. Sleep leaves a person in a state where they are not present or aware of the world around them resonating deeply with death. The use of pastoral imagery as seen in shepherds further relays the peace and comfort that comes with sleep. Flocks of animals on these sarcophagi or even the shepherds themselves are often seen sleeping similar to Endymion or the deceased. If the deceased is imagined as Selene coming to visit in dreams, the remaining family is comforted by the potential nighttime visits they can have with their beloved. Dionysus and Ariadne Roman sarcophagus showing Dionysus approaching Ariadne. Ca. 230‚Äì240 AD. Louvre, Paris Sarcophagi featuring Dionysus and Ariadne show the drunken Dionysus propped up by a satyr as he gazes upon his beloved Ariadne for the first time. He stands before her sleeping form as she faces the viewer, her body exposed. The remainder of the sarcophagi depicts the procession of Dionysiac revelers celebrating with song and dance. Ariadne is oftentimes given portrait features or was prepared to have portrait features. Comparisons to Ariadne are used to exemplify beauty and likely did just that for the deceased. Similar to the Selene and Endymion sarcophagi, the deceased is meant to be imagined as Ariadne being visited by her husband in the form of Dionysus. The way in which Dionysus gazes upon Ariadne is meant to evoke intense and eternal love between the pair as well as the deceased and their loved one. Ariadne is imagined to then be taken up to live happily amongst Dionysus and his revelers, providing comfort for the family that their own deceased continues to enjoy happiness even in death. Matching pairs of sleeper sarcophagi, now displayed in the Louvre in Paris, were found in Bordeaux with one displaying the myth of Selene and Endymion and the other the myth of Dionysus and Ariadne. It is believed that the Selene and Endymion sarcophagus contained the husband while the Dionysus and Ariadne sarcophagus contained the wife, drawing a direct comparison between the sleeper and deceased. The scenes of cosmic love, as well as matching sarcophagi featuring a sleeping deceased, exemplified the bond between husband and wife. The Dionysus and Ariadne sarcophagus of this pairing featured a centaur family amongst the revelers. This familial image held no significance in the myth itself but is, rather, used as a bridge between the myth and the life of a Roman visitor. = Dionysian Imagery= One of the more curious examples of mythological and biographical sarcophagi are those featuring Dionysian imagery. Dionysus (or, as the Romans called him, Bacchus) is known as a god of celebration and revelry, particularly of wine, and the wild areas of the world outside the cities. As such he and symbolism associated with him were popular for their ability to show scenes of joy or relaxation. Dionysian imagery is usually shown through the use of wine, grapes, and a generally festive atmosphere. Dionysus is often associated with large predatory cats, especially panthers, and as such images of felines tend to crop up often as well. Dionysus himself is often shown as a young man, beardless, often drunken. His bride, Ariadne, is also depicted often, either enjoying time with her husband, or sleeping, being approached by the procession of her future husband Dionysus. Various Shapes of Dionysian Sarcophagi Most Roman sarcophagi are rectangular in shape, and as such, as a god known for ignoring conventions in his mythology, Dionysian sarcophagi sometimes fittingly go against even this most basic convention of the art. Sarcophagi with Dionysian imagery often feature ends that are curved and rounded off, rather than squared off. Sarcophagi with this shape are called lenos Sarcophagi, named after Greek and Roman term for a wine vat, i.e., the tub in which grapes were crushed and fermented during the process of creating wine. This lends to the metaphorical connection ripening of the body of the deceased as it decomposes and the fermenting of the grapes as they begin to form wine. This type of shape is also used to represent the passage of time, the rounded edge allowing for the imagery of unending cycles that cannot easily be represented across the corners of a traditional sarcophagus. Several of the sarcophagi with Dionysian imagery shown in this section are of lenos shape. Basic Conventions of Dionysian Sarcophagi thumbleftRoman sarcophagus showing a Dionysiac procession. Ca. 160‚Äì170 AD. Baths of Diocletian, Rome. Dionysian imagery was meant to show a fun atmosphere of enjoyment. Often this was done by depicting him and his followers in a procession across the piece. One such example is the sarcophagi displayed in Rome's Baths of Diocletian. It depicts the servants of Dionysus‚Äîthe male satyrs and the female bacchants‚Äîas they play music, drink wine, and dance. A pair of donkeys, one so intoxicated that it can no longer stand, attempts to haul an old drinking buddy of Dionysus, an old, bald, pudgy, boozy reveller named Silenus, by cart. Each of these characters has a different role to play in the minds of the viewer. Silenus represents a drunken state in which the affected almost seems like an old man; hunched over, unable to walk, often barely able to stand. The Satyrs sometimes bring a sexually frisky note to the revelry. They are often depicted attempting to seduce the female bacchants who show no interest, spurn the advances, and continue playing their music and enjoying the party. thumbleftRoman lion- head lenos sarcophagus showing Cupids making wine. Ca. 290 AD. Getty Villa, Malibu. thumb Roman strigillated lion-head lenos sarcophagus, in current use as a water basin. Ca. 260 AD. Palazzo Mattei, Rome. Other types of Dionysian imagery include those sarcophagi, many of them lenos-shaped, which show images of grapes and the wine making process. Often cupids gathering grapes and crushing them to obtain their juices are present. One example of a lion-headed lenos sarcophagi now in the Getty Villa in Malibu, shows cupids picking grapes from the vine, as well as others who crush grapes with their feet within a lenos. Another popular format of Roman Sarcophagi are the so-called strigillated sarcophagi, whose front panels are dominated by rows of S-shaped curves, often used to evoke water or another liquid. It can be associated with wine. See, for example, the lion-headed lenos sarcophagus currently in use as a water basin in Rome's Palazzo Mattei, a use which must have been inspired by the liquid associations of the S-shaped strigillated decoration. Roman sarcophagus with Dionysus on his panther, flanked by the Four Seasons (the ‚ÄúBadminton Sarcophagus‚Äù). Ca. 220‚Äì230 AD. In the Metropolitan Museum, New York Because of his association with the wilder parts of the human psyche, Dionysus is closely associated with large wild felines, especially lions (hence the common presence of lion heads on lenos sarcophagi shaped like wine vats) and panthers. On Roman sarcophagi, a panther can often be seen within the parade Dionysus is participating in, and lion heads can often be seen prominently on sarcophagi. A good example is the so-called \\"Badminton Sarcophagus\\" in New York's Metropolitan Museum, which shows in the center Dionysus riding a Panther, flanked by images representing the four seasons, while his various servants fill in the background. One interesting addition is Pan, a wild god, with the lower quarters and horns of a goat, associated with shepherding, rugged landscapes, and sexual desire having his cup filled with wine by Dionysus himself. Dionysus and Ariadne thumbRoman sarcophagus showing Dionysus approaching Ariadne. Ca. 230‚Äì240 AD. Louvre, Paris. One of the most detailed forms of Dionysian sarcophagi is that showing the myth of Dionysus coming across the sleeping figure of Ariadne, in Greek mythology the Cretan princess who helped Theseus slay the Minotaur, only to be marooned and abandoned by Theseus on the island of Naxos. The image itself consists of Ariadne, reclining in sleep, being approached by Dionysus and his procession of satyrs and Bacchants as he is enamored by her beauty. The image became popular among couples because of its ability to represent either party during the death of the other. If a man had lost his wife the image can be used to represent a man longing for his lost love, represented as peacefully dreaming in an endless sleep. If a woman has lost her husband, the image appears as a sleeping wife whose husband has come to visit her in her sleep. One marvelous example is the Dionysus and Ariadne sarcophagus shown in The Louvre, in Paris. Ariadne lies asleep, her face uncarved, meant for a portrait that was never added. Dionysus walked toward her scantily clad form with his full procession following him. This sarcophagus also shows the slight discomfort that too- close identification with Dionysus might cause respectable Roman men. Dionysus was depicted as young, carefree, often drunken, and androgynous. All of these were characteristics that a prestigious Roman male would not want to be associated with. It would seem that Romans liked the idea of Dionysus, as well as the feelings he was known to bring, but did not want to be directly compared to him. This led to a workaround in which, like the sarcophagi presented, Dionysus stands alone with a face carved to represent the god, and a space for a portrait image was made in the upper right of the lid. This allowed for the male to still have Dionysus imagery and atmosphere connected to him after death, and still allow him a place of prestige and respect, a step removed from the god himself. =Seasonal and Bucolic Imagery= The third century AD saw new types of sarcophagi arise that focused on nature. These moved away from the portrayal of Greek myths that had dominated Roman sarcophagi of the preceding (second) century, preferring instead to depict the abundance and tranquility that the natural world around them had to offer. This was expressed in two different categories of Roman Sarcophagi: those that depicted the seasons; and those that depicted [bucolic] imagery. The season imagery shows the cycle of life and the cosmic order of things, while the bucolic imagery portrays an idyllic world removed from the hustle and bustle of the city. Seasonal Imagery Roman sarcophagus with Cupids holding seasonal garlands; episodes from the story of Theseus & Ariadne above the swags; on the lid, Cupids race chariots. Ca. 120‚Äì150 AD. Metropolitan Museum, New York Representations of the seasons on Roman sarcophagi typically showed the gifts that nature had to offer people during each season, and thus also evoked associations with the cycle of nature and of life. The sarcophagus showing Cupids holding seasonal garlands in New York's Metropolitan Museum furnishes a good example. The Cupids here hold garlands composed of various flowers, fruits, and agricultural products, each associated with a different one of the four seasons: on the very left, flowers, representing spring, then sheaves of grain representing summer, then fruit (especially grapes and grape leaves) representing autumn, and then lastly olives representing winter. At the same time, the flow of the garlands, one blending into the next, represents the fluid change in the seasons themselves. What was the allure of this imagery? It reminded the viewer that nature provides in abundance, no matter the season, and by extension, proclaimed that the deceased, while alive, had enjoyed all that nature and life had to offer, in every season. It also would have served as a promise to the deceased on the part of surviving members, that they would continue to honor her or his memory year-round, in all seasons, and continue to bring the products of the various seasons into the tomb year-round as offerings to the deceased. The lid, meanwhile, shows four Cupids engaging in a chariot race. Romans would have seen the connection between chariot races and the four seasons, because the racing teams in the Roman world were divided into four factions; moreover, Roman chariot races were dedicated to the sun god, Sol (the Greek Helios), who controlled the seasons. Each chariot on the lid is pulled by an animal representing one of the seasons (the boar, for example, was associated with winter). The seasonal agricultural products on the chest thus have their animal counterparts on the lid. Finally, much like the cycle of nature and the seasons, Roman chariot races went round and round a circular (more specifically, oval) race course. The imagery on chest and lid thus complement each other perfectly. Roman sarcophagus with Dionysus on his panther, flanked by the Four Seasons (the ‚ÄúBadminton Sarcophagus‚Äù). Ca. 220‚Äì230 AD. In the Metropolitan Museum, New York The imagery of the seasons on Roman sarcophagi was often associated with the god Dionysus. This was an obvious connection, since Dionysus, as god of grapes and wine, was closely associated with the natural products of a particular season and with sharing those gifts with the world. Hence many season sarcophagi include Dionysiac elements. A good example is the so-called \\"Badminton Sarcophagus\\" in New York's Metropolitan Museum, which shows in the center Dionysus on his panther, flanked by standing personifications of the Four Seasons marked by their seasonal gifts/attributes: winter stands at the far left with a brace of ducks, with a boar at his feet; then spring, holding a basket of flowers and a budding stalk; then summer, basket of grain in hand; and finally autumn at the far right, cradling a cornucopia of grapes and grape leaves in one arm while holding a captured hare. Celebration of Dionysus's natural (particularly viticultural) gifts, along with the rest of nature's never-ending abundance, and the happiness and pleasure that they bring in eternal cycle, is clearly foregrounded on a sarcophagus such as this. Other season sarcophagi even more strongly referenced the notion of an unshakeable ever-repeating cosmic order underlying the world. A good example is the season sarcophagus in Washington D.C.'s Dumbarton Oaks Museum. Here the standing personifications of the Four Seasons flank a central tondo/roundel (Romans called this a clipeus, the term for a round shield) which contains (unfinished) portrait busts of the deceased couple buried inside. Note that carved around the rim of the clipeus are the twelve zodiac signs. Why include these? They likely symbolize the ‚Äúeternal fame and everlasting state of bliss that people wished for the deceased‚Äù. But the entire cycle of twelve zodiac signs would also have served as a visual reminder of the eternally cycling order underlying the cosmos, of which the four seasons are simply an earthly manifestation. Tranquility in the face of death, and celebration of life, was to come via contemplation of this fundamental stability in the cosmic order of things. Bucolic Imagery Roman lenos sarcophagus with bucolic scenes (the sarcophagus of Iulius Achilleus). Ca. 290 AD. National Roman Museum in the Baths of Diocletian, Rome. While the seasonal imagery focuses on nature's abundance and the cosmic order that underlies it, bucolic imagery emphasizes a slightly different side to what nature might offer. Bucolic sarcophagi imagine nature as a place of escape from the strains of city life. They present an idealized vision of the 'natural state' to be enjoyed in the countryside ‚Äî free from crushing crowds, free from noise, free from politics, free from social demands and social strife, in short, free from everything negative that elite Romans associated with the city ‚Äî which is visually embodied on the sarcophagi through images of shepherds tending their flocks in rustic surrounds. A gorgeous example is the sarcophagus of Iulius Achilleus (his name is inscribed on the coffin) now on display in the Baths of Diocletian in Rome.Mont Allen, \\"Cows, Sheep, and Sages: Bucolic Sarcophagi and the Question of 'Elite Retreat',\\" Mitteilungen des Deutschen Arch√§ologischen Instituts, R√∂mische Abteilung 124 (2018), pp. 248 (fig. 1), 252, 253. Like many other bucolic sarcophagi, this one shows the life of a shepherd as one of peace, tranquility and prosperity, with plenty of leisure time for idle musing and soulful contemplation. The shepherds here are surrounded by their happy herds (including sheep, goats, cattle, and horses), who appear to smile as they nibble away contentedly. One shepherd is shown resting his head on a stick lost in thought, showing that they have all the time in the world to rest and reflect upon what lies ahead of them. Notice the arch behind a shepherd in the top left: this is a depiction of a city gate in the background, an explicit reminder to the viewer that the 'natural state' shown is something only found outside the city, free from its politics, burdens, and strife. Of course, such bucolic scenes never present the gritty facts of real ancient pastoral life ‚Äî ceaseless tending of the flocks, baking in ferocious summer heat, freezing in winter, at the mercy of the elements and uncertain food supplies, miserable accommodations, a life of wretched poverty ‚Äî but instead serve up a sanitized fantasy of rustic life designed to indulge the pampered yearnings of elite city-dwellers eager for scenes of tranquility in an imagined 'natural state'. Like the seasonal imagery just discussed, bucolic scenes too were especially popular during the second half of the third century and the early part of the fourth centuries: more than 400 sarcophagi carved between 260 and 320 AD have survived. They would also have a long afterlife in later Western art, as the bucolic motifs popularized on Roman sarcophagi‚Äîabove all, the figure of a shepherd with a sheep slung around his shoulders‚Äîwas enthusiastically adopted by early Christian art (since this image of a 'good shepherd' could be re- interpreted as an image of Christ). Personalization The Portonaccio sarcophagus Sarcophagi personalization is the customization of a sarcophagus to display the attributes, achievements, or history of the deceased through art and/or inscriptions. The key way in which sarcophagi were personalized was through portraiture of a mythological character that would be carved with the facial features of the deceased. Because many sarcophagi were made in advance of being bought, several examples of unfinished portrait heads remain. = Sarcophagus of Lars Pulena = The sculpted scene on the front of the coffin shows the deceased in the Underworld between two Charuns (Etruscan death demons) in which signified that his journey to the afterlife was successful. On the lid, Pulena is shown laid across, in a reclining position, resting on his left arm and in front of him, a list of his life's achievements which were inscribed on an open scroll. = Melfi Sarcophagus = The Asiatic sarcophagus with kline portrait of a woman also carried an Etruscan influence of sculpting portraiture on the lid. Made of marble, with reliefs on all four sides of the box (a feature in Eastern Sarcophagi production), and sculpted mini statues of Greek gods and heroes in frames are depicted. The lid displays a portrait of the woman with Cupid (right end) and a little dog (in which the paws only remain at the left end). = Battle of Romans and barbarians = The Portonaccio sarcophagus is an example of one of a group of about twenty-five late Roman battle sarcophagi, with one exception all apparently dating to 170‚Äì210, made in Rome or in some cases Athens. These derive from Hellenistic monuments from Pergamon in Asia Minor showing Pergamene victories over the Gauls, and were all presumably commissioned for military commanders. The Portonaccio sarcophagus is the best known and most elaborate of the main Antonine group, and shows both considerable similarities to the Great Ludovisi sarcophagus, the late outlier from about 250, and a considerable contrast in style and mood.Strong, 205 The face of the general is unfinished, either because the sculptors awaited a model to work from, or they had produced the work speculatively with no specific commission. The general and his wife are also each shown twice on the lid frieze, together holding each other's hands at the centre, and singly at the ends, again with unfinished faces.Henig, 93 The unusually large Ludovisi Battle sarcophagus shows a chaotic battle scene between the Romans and barbarian foes. At the centre, a young general wears no helmet nor wields any weapon and has emblem of Mithras, the Persian god of light, truth, and victory over death carved into his forehead. Several scholars have identified him as one of the sons of Trajan Decius, who died of plague. = Santa Maria Antiqua Sarcophagus = A sarcophagus from the church of Santa Maria Antiqua with philosopher, orant, and Old and New Testament scenes is Early Christian art in which displays the story of Jonah on the left one-third, heads of a praying woman and a seated man reading from a scroll which are unfinished (intended to be portraits of the deceased) in the center, and continuing on, Christ as Good Shepherd, and the baptism of Christ.

Her main activity was in the three fields in which she made significant innovations - the High Middle Ages, archaeological restoration, and environment and landscape. President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi conferred the Medaglia d'Oro for culture and art in Vaccaro's memory in February 2001. Personal life Alessandra Vaccaro was born at Rome on 4 April 1940 to a notable middle class Roman family. Her grandfather, Michelangelo Vaccaro, was a university professor who wrote a text fundamental to criminal anthropology and became a senator and head of cabinet under the Crispi government. Her father was a chemist who was an international expert on prophylaxis, and her mother, Emerenziana, was director of the Istituto di Patologia del Libro. In 1965 she married Gianfranco Melucco, a lawyer.  Career Vaccaro enrolled in the literature faculty of La Sapienza university at Rome, where she studied Greek and Roman archaeology under Ranccio Bianci Bandinelli, and specialised in archaeology at the Scuola Nazionale di Archeologia. In 1962 to 1963, Vaccaro took part in excavations at the Etruscan sanctuary of Pyrgi (today S. Severa) and at the Centro Sperimentale di Archeologia Sottomarina. From 1964 she won a bursary to study at the Scuola Archeologica Italiana di Atene and, in 1965, she worked on the publication of the Annuario di Storia dell'Arte edited by the Biblioteca di Archeologia e Storia dell'Arte di Roma, and took charge of a sector of the excavation at Pyrgi, and the publication of the 'vernice nera' and Hellenistic pottery. Vaccaro joined the Amministrazione delle Antiquita e Belle Arti in 1965, where she directed a series of excavations including, from 1970 to 1974, those at the Duomo Vecchio di Arezzo and, in 1971, those at the Longobardi necropolis of Chuisi-Arcisi. Here she widened her interests to take on the reorganisation and restoration of the Roman portraits in the Museo Archaeologico di Firenze; the High Medieval era was a decidedly pioneering field of research at that time. She moved to Rome in 1971 to the Istituto Centrale del Restauro (ICR) and in 1974 was made director of the Museo dell'Alto Medioevo, where she extended the museum's publications along this innovative new line of interest, publications which included the Corpus della Scultura Altomedievale and I Longobardi in Italia, which remain valid reference works today. Further, she introduced the discipline of the High Medieval Era amongst university disciplines which led to it being taught more widely. From 1976 to 1979 Vaccaro was elected to the Italian Parliament as a backbench Partito Comunista Italiano MP. Upon leaving parliament she was appointed Sopraintendente Aggiunto and Archeologico at the Minstero dei Beni Culturali e Ambiental (MBCA) as well as becoming director of the Servizio Beni Archeologico at ICR, where her broad scientific interests allowed her to take on many themes put in place innovative and competent restoration projects These included directing research into and restoration of the principal marble monuments in Italy dating from the classical era of Rome : Trajan's Column reliefs * Trajan's Column * Column of Antoninus Pius * Arch of Constantine * Arch of Septimus Severus * Temple of Hadrian * Temple of Saturn * Temple of Vespasian and Titus * the Tombs of Tuffatore at Paestum * the paleochristian underground remains of S. Salvatore of Cabras in Sardinia * the bronze statue of Marcus Aurelius at Rome * the Bronzes of Riace in Reggio Calabria During the fifteen years she spent at ICR, the innovations she brought to archaeological work were published widely, including works on the conservation of stone, architectural patinas and polychromy of ancient monuments. Her work on restoration and 'maintenance programmes' formed the basis for the 'Carta del Rischio del Patrimonio Culturale Italiano'. At this time Vaccaro also contributed to setting up and teaching numerous new courses integrating archaeology and restoration at several universities in Italy. In 1994 she was in charge of the technical service dealing with international relations and great risks to the environment and landscape at the Minstero dei Beni ed Attivita Culturale, and instigated research into natural and anthropogenic risks to the environment and landscape particularly in respect of archaeological zones such as Pompeii. Vaccaro also represented Italy in international groups such as the National Work Group for the UNESCO World Heritage List and the Bureau du Conseil de la Cooperation Culturelle of the Council of Europe, amongst her many other national and international roles Bibliography  Mostra dei materiali della Tuscia Longobarda nelle raccolte pubbliche toscane, Florence 1971 * Corpus della scultura altomedievale VII.

Life and career Nick Folland studied at Loughborough University, gaining a BSc and a PGCE. After graduating, he taught young deaf people for three years before joining the staff at Blundell's School in Devon. Folland came into county cricket unusually late; following success at Minor Counties level with Devon, he was persuaded by Somerset that he could combine his teaching with a professional cricket career and made his debut in regular first-class cricket in 1992, at the age of 28. He had played one first-class match earlier for the Minor Counties representative side against the Indian tourists in 1990. Folland went on to play 32 first-class matches and 68 at List A level. The highlight of his career was the two first- class centuries in a match that he made in 1993 against Sussex.https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/57/57495.html These turned out to be the only two first-class hundreds of his career. He left regular cricket midway through the 1994 season, deciding, according to Wisden, that \\"regular first-class cricket was not for him\\". He was the Head of Blundell's preparatory school for ten years. He became Head of St John's on the Hill Preparatory School in Chepstow, Monmouthshire, in 2011. Since 2015 he has been Headmaster of Sherborne Prep School in Sherborne, Dorset. His brother, Neil, taught at Haberdashers' Aske's Boys School with his Devon teammate Doug Yeabsley.

It is also known as \\"shisha\\" in Canada, USA, Brazil, Europe and the Middle East. Argilah or Argileh (, sometimes pronounced Argilee), and shisha or sheesha (), is the common term for the hookah itself in the Arab world. History Although hookah pipes have been used for several hundred years, mu Ωassel is a recent invention, going back to the early 1990s. Before this, raw tobacco was smoked in hookah pipes, which was not very easy to use. The tobacco needed to be mixed with water, squeezed, and molded prior to use. It was hard to keep lit and produced a strong harsh smell and taste with a potent nicotine delivery. At the end of the twentieth century, hookah was no longer a very popular way to smoke tobacco, and in the Middle East was popular mainly among older, Arab men who smoked it with friends in cafes. Young people became interested in hookah use beginning in the early 1990s when milder sweetened and flavored hookah tobacco, commonly called Mu Ωassel, first became available. It is made by fermenting tobacco with molasses, glycerine and fruit essence, producing a moist and pliable mixture. Its easiness to use, and pleasant aroma and taste made it popular with young people. It quickly became the most common type of hookah tobacco globally, and sales skyrocketed, fueled by the ever increasing variety, growing internet availability and advertising. Culture =Middle East= Arab world Bedouin smoking a hookah, locally called nargileh, in a coffeehouse in Deir ez-Zor, on the Euphrates, 1920s In many places in the Arab world, the smoking of shisha is a part of traditional culture, and is considered a social custom. Social smoking is typically done with the use of a hookah with a single hose which is passed around the group or double hose, but some hookahs can employ up to four hoses. When the smoker is finished, the hose is either placed back on the table, signifying that it is available, or is handed directly to the next user. Social convention dictates that the mouthpiece and hose should be folded back on itself in such a way that the mouthpiece is not pointing at the recipient. Disposable mouth tips are sometimes used in cafes. Many caf√©s in the Middle East offer hookah. Caf√©s are widespread and are common social gathering places (akin to public houses in Britain). Some expatriate residents arriving in the Middle East frequent hookah caf√©s in lieu of pubs in the region, especially where prohibition is in place and alcohol is not served. Levant In the Levant (Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, and Syria), hookah (sometimes referred to as 'arguileh', or as 'narguileh') is widely used, and its availability is nearly universal. Hookah has become part of the culture. Smokers are often seen on the side of the streets, parks, bus stops, and other public venues. Cafes are sometimes observed to be fully occupied by hookah smokers, even during late hours of the night. It is not uncommon to see a female smoking hookah. In the Levant, it is very social, and the activity is often accompanied by a game of Tawla (Backgammon), cards, or tea. Iran Persian woman in Qajari dress smoking the traditional Qalyan In Iran, the hookah is known as a ·∏°alyƒÅn (, also spelled ghalyan, ghalyaan or ghelyoon). It is similar in many ways to the Arabic hookah but also differs in several ways. One difference is the uppermost part of the hookah, the \\"ghalyoun,\\" locally called 'sar' (, i.e. head), where the tobacco is placed. Compared to Turkish hookahs, the Iranian version tends to be somewhat larger. Additionally, the majority of the hose is flexible and covered with soft silk or cloth, while Turkish hookahs often have mouthpieces and partially rigid hoses which are as long as or longer than the flexible part of the hose. Each smoker will typically carry their own personal mouthpiece (called an Amjid, ). The amjid is a detachable hookah mouthpiece, and is usually made of wood or metal and can be decorated with valuable or other stones. Amjids are considered to be decorative and are a highly personal item. Public smoking venues will often carry disposable or cleanable amjid for the use of smokers who do not carry their own. The exact date of the first use of ·∏°alyƒÅn in Persia is not known. According to Cyril Elgood, it was Abu‚Äôl-Fat·∏• Gƒ´lƒÅnƒ´, a Persian physician at the court of the Mughal emperor Akbar I, who \\"first passed the smoke of tobacco through a small bowl of water to purify and cool the smoke and thus invented the hubble-bubble or hookah.\\" However, in the poems of Ahlƒ´ ≈†ƒ´rƒÅzƒ´, he refers to the use of the ·∏°alyƒÅn, thus dating its use to at least as early as the time of ·π¨ahmƒÅsp I in the late 14th century. It seems, therefore, that Abu‚Äôl-Fat·∏• Gƒ´lƒÅnƒ´ should be credited with the introduction of the ·∏°alyƒÅn, already in use in Persia, to India. Although the Safavid Shah  øAbbƒÅs I strongly condemned tobacco use, towards the end of his reign smoking ·∏°alyƒÅn and ƒçopoq (q.v.) had become common at every level of society. In schools and learned circles, both teachers and students had ·∏°alyƒÅns during lessons. Smoking was so popular, that the shah had his own private ·∏°alyƒÅn servant, and the first evidence for the position of water pipe tender (·∏°alyƒÅndƒÅr) dates from this time. The materials from which water pipes were made from included glass, pottery, and a type of gourd. Due to the unsatisfactory quality of indigenous glass, glass reservoirs were sometimes imported from Venice. In the time of Shah SolaymƒÅn in the late 15th and early 16th century, ·∏°alyƒÅns became more elaborately embellished as their use increased. The wealthy owned gold and silver pipes, and even the general population spent more on ·∏°alyƒÅns than they did on the basic necessities of life. An emissary of Shah Sultan Husayn, to the court of Louis XV in the early 16th century, on his way to the royal audience at Versailles, had in his retinue an officer holding his ·∏°alyƒÅn, which he used while his carriage was in motion. We have no record indicating the use of ·∏°alyƒÅn at the court of NƒÅder Shah Af≈°ƒÅr, although its use seems to have continued uninterrupted. There are portraits of Karƒ´m Khan Zand and Fat·∏•-  øAlƒ´ Shah QƒÅjƒÅr which depict them smoking the ·∏°alyƒÅn. Iranians had a special tobacco called Khansar (, presumably name of the origin city). With Khansar, coals would be put on the Khansar without foil. Khansar has less smoke than the normal tobacco. =Caucasus= Azerbaijan It is one of the popular entertainment and hangout activities, mostly among youngsters and men in Azerbaijan, especially in Baku. =South Asia= Pakistan Although it is traditionally prevalent in rural areas for generations, where users smoke traditional tobacco hookahs have become very popular in the cosmopolitan cities with the advent of modern tobacco flavours. India The intricate work on a Malabar Hookah The hookah family The concept of hookah is thought to have originated in India once the province of the wealthy, it was tremendously popular especially during Mughal rule. The hookah has since become less popular; however, it is once again garnering the attention of the masses, and caf√©s and restaurants that offer it as a consumable are popular. The use of hookahs from ancient times in India was not only a custom, but a matter of prestige. Rich and landed classes would smoke hookahs. Tobacco is smoked in hookahs in many villages as per traditional customs. Smoking a tobacco- molasses shisha is now becoming popular amongst the youth in India. There are several chain clubs, bars and coffee shops in India offering a wider variety of mu Ωassels, including non-tobacco versions. Hookah was recently banned in Bangalore. However it can be bought or rented for personal usage or organised parties only. Koyilandy, a small fishing town on the west coast of India, once made and exported hookahs extensively. These are known as Malabar Hookhas or Koyilandy Hookahs. Today these intricate hookahs are difficult to find outside of Koyilandy and not much easier to find in Koyilandy itself. As hookah makes a resurgence in India, there have been numerous raids and bans recently on hookah smoking, especially in Gujarat =Nepal= A hookah at a restaurant in Nepal Hookahs (‡§π‡•Å‡§ï‡§º‡•ç‡§ï‡§º‡§æ), especially wooden ones, are popular in Nepal. Hookah usage is considered to symbolize family elitism historically. Today, however, hookahs have become popular among tourists and young people. =Bangladesh= Hookah, as the traditional smoking contraption, has been commonly used in Bangladesh since the Mughal ages. But flavored Shisha was introduced to Bangladesh in the early 2000s. Shisha became very popular among the young crowds, and shisha bars and lounges opened up in large numbers to cater to those crowds. However, due to health concerns and unregulated consumption, the government banned shisha in late 2010. Shisha lounges were ordered to shut down. A very few shisha lounges were given permission to continue business, as they mostly served to foreigners. =Southeast Asia= Philippines In the Philippines, hookah use was more or less traditionally confined to the minority Arab Filipino and Indian Filipino communities. The custom has also been present in the indigenous Muslim Filipino community (a considerable religious minority), where a historical following of Middle Eastern socio- cultural trends led to the hookah being a rare--albeit prestigious--social habit of the nobility in the vital trade hubs of Mindanao such as Cotabato and Jolo. Hookah was meanwhile virtually unknown to the predominant Christian Filipinos in Luzon and the Visayas before the late 20th century. Presently, hookah use is gaining popularity among younger, more cosmopolitan Christians, particularly with college students and young adults who may be underage and thus unable to purchase cigarettes. In the National Capital Region and other conurbations such as Metro Cebu and Metro Davao, hookahs and flavoured shisha are available in various high-end bars, clubs, and \\"shisha lounges\\" as well as in traditional Middle Eastern restaurants.  Vietnam  In Vietnam, shisha has been around for a long time, with the response of young people, so the hobby of smoking shisha is becoming more and more popular.Most people think that smoking shisha is better than smoking due to less nicotine. People can smoke shisha at cafes, karaoke bars and bars in Vietnam. =South Africa= In South Africa, hookah, colloquially known as a hubbly bubbly, \\"hub\\", or an okka pipe, is popular amongst the Cape Malay and Indian populations, wherein it is smoked as a social pastime. However, hookah is seeing increasing popularity with white South Africans, especially the youth. Bars that additionally provide hookahs are becoming more prominent, although smoking is normally done at home or in public spaces such as beaches and picnic sites. In South Africa, the terminology of the various hookah components also differ from other countries. The clay \\"head/bowl\\" is known as a \\"clay pot\\". The hoses are called \\"pipes\\" and the air release valve is known as a \\"clutch\\". Some scientists point to the dagga pipe as an African origin of hookah.\\"The Mysterious Origins of the Hookah (Narghile) The Sacred Narghile =United States and Canada= A hookah and a variety of mu Ωassel packages are on display in a Harvard Square store window in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States. During the 1960s and 1970s, hookahs were a popular tool for the consumption of various derivations of tobacco, among other things. At parties or small gatherings the hookah hose was passed around with users partaking as they saw fit. Typically, though, open flames were used instead of burning coals. Today, hookahs are readily available for sale at smoke shops and some gas stations across the United States, along with a variety of tobacco brands and accessories. In addition to private hookah smoking, hookah lounges or bars have opened in cities across the country. Recently, certain cities, counties, and states have implemented indoor smoking bans. In some jurisdictions, hookah businesses can be exempted from the policies through special permits. Some permits, however, have requirements such as the business earning a certain minimum percentage of their revenue from alcohol or tobacco. In cities with indoor smoking bans, hookah bars have been forced to close or switch to tobacco-free mu Ωassel. In many cities though, hookah lounges have been growing in popularity. From the year 2000 to 2004, over 200 new hookah caf√©s opened for business, most of them targeted at young adults Lyon, Lindsay \\"The Hazard in Hookah Smoke\\". (28 January 2008) and located near college campuses or cities with large Middle-Eastern communities. This activity continues to gain popularity within the post-secondary student demographic.Quenqua, Douglas \\"Putting a Crimp in the Hookah\\". The New York Times, 30 May 2011 According to a 2018 study, 1.1% of students with some college but no degree, an associate degree or an undergraduate degree reported waterpipe or pipe tobacco product use either every day or some days. As of November 2017, at least 2,082 college or university campuses in the U.S. have adopted 100% smokefree campus policies that attempt to eliminate smoking in indoor and outdoor areas across the entire campus, including residences. Hookah use by youth and adolescents rose from 1998 even as cigarette use decreased: youth hookah use more than doubled from 2011 to 2014 according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, since then the US Department of Health and Human Services has stated that older teens have decreased their use of hookahs in recent years. The most recent research, from 2014 to 2018, shows that the percentage of high school seniors who had used a hookah in the last year decreased from 20 percent to 8 percent. Among adolescents and young adults, hookah use is highest among those aged 19‚Äì20, and those who live in cities. It is less common in suburban and rural areas. In 2011, 18.5% of 12th-grade students reported having smoked a hookah in the past year. By 2019, 3.4% of highschool students reported having used hookah in the last 30 days. Health effects Smoking mu Ωassel exposes users to many of the same toxicants found in cigarettes. Substantial amounts of carbon monoxide, nicotine, and tar have been found in inhaled hookah smoke. A single session of smoking mu Ωassel results in far more toxicants inhaled than a session of cigarette smoking, largely because a session of hookah use is much longer than an average session of cigarette smoking: 60 minutes on average for hookah users versus five minutes for a single cigarette. A typical session of smoking mu Ωassel results in a user inhaling 90,000 ml of smoke versus 500 ml for a cigarette, as well as 1.7 times as much nicotine, 8.4 times as much carbon monoxide, and 36 times as much tar. Mu Ωassel smoking also exposes users to heavy metals and is thought to expose users to more carcinogens than cigarettes. The charcoal used to heat up the mu Ωassel has unique health detriments in addition to those of the mu Ωassel itself, including increased carbon monoxide and metal inhalation. These toxicants have led the American Lung Association, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Food and Drug Administration to conclude that smoking mu Ωassel using a hookah \\"has many of the same health risks as cigarette smoking.\\" \\"Although many users think it is less harmful, hookah smoking has many of the same health risks as cigarette smoking.\\" These risks include lung cancer, respiratory disease, low birth weight in babies, increased risk of respiratory disease in babies, heart disease and artery clogging, as well as oral, stomach, esophagus, and bladder cancers. Herbal mu Ωassel and shisha poses similar risks to its tobacco-containing counterpart: smoke from herbal mu Ωassel contains equal or greater levels of carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, aldehydes, tar, and carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) as tobacco-containing smoke. These chemicals contribute to cancers, heart disease, and lung disease. Smoking mu Ωassel in a hookah also releases secondhand smoke that harms the health of those around the smoker. Secondhand smoke from hookahs contains carbon monoxide, PAH, aldehydes, ultrafine particles (<2.5Œºm), and respirable particulate matter (particles small enough to enter the lungs). Studies of hookah lounges in Virginia have found that hookah lounges have worse air quality than comparable restaurants that allow indoor cigarette smoking. Acute effects of exposure to secondhand smoke from hookahs including wheezing, nasal congestion, and chronic cough, although long term effects have yet to be studied. The detrimental effects of secondhand smoke from hookahs apply equally to tobacco-free mu Ωassel or shisha: one study found that herbal hookah smoke contains carcinogens equal or greater to that of hookah smoke with tobacco, in addition to PAH, carbon monoxide, and metals. A 2008 study on hookah smoking and cancer in Pakistan found that the overall serum CEA levels in ever/exclusive hookah smokers were not significantly different from non-smokers. However, the study also concluded that heavy hookah smoking (2‚Äì4 daily preparations; 3‚Äì8 sessions a day; 2 to 6 hours net daily smoking time) substantially raises CEA levels, although still not as much as cigarette smoke. Hookah smoking was revealed to increase the size of the abdomen, hips, and chest due to swelling because of toxic levels.

In total 642 men, women and children were murdered in Oradour-sur-Glane by troops from the 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich. The SS commander who ordered the massacre said the death of K√§mpfe was the reason for the killings. K√§mpfe, who was a commander in 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich, was said to be a \\"pleasant and likeable man.\\" A highly respected combat veteran who had been awarded Nazi Germany's extremely rare Close Combat Clasp in Gold (making him one of only 631 military personnel - out of 18‚Äì20 million soldiers of the German Wehrmacht and Waffen- SS - to earn the clasp during World War II).Berger 2004, p. 6. He was also one of the very few to receive both this bravery award and the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. Biography K√§mpfe was born in Th√ºringen, Germany in 1909. He trained to be a typographer like his father but after Hitler took power in 1933 he became a Leutnant in the Heer before transferring to the Waffen-SS in 1939. On the Eastern Front in Russia, he commanded the 3rd Battalion, 4th SS- Panzergrenadier Der F√ºhrer Regiment, the Das Reich Division's reconnaissance group. K√§mpfe received the Knights Cross of the Iron Cross for bravery and exemplary leadership during the Zhitomir‚ÄìBerdichev Offensive in the winter of 1943-44. In Spring 1944, the Das Reich Division had been withdrawn from Russia and sent to the south of France for refitting in preparation for the anticipated Allied invasion of occupied Europe. While in the southern France, K√§mpfe was ordered to begin operations against the Maquis (rural guerillas who - according to German intelligence reports - were active in the southern uplands of central France). On 9 June 1944, he was captured east of Saint- L√©onard-de-Noblat by a group led by a Sergeant Jean Canou from Colonel Georges Guingouin's Brigade, a group in the Maquis du Limousin. Canou handed him over to Guingouin. The following day K√§mpfe was executed on the orders of Guingouin or killed during an attempt to escape.Guy Penaud, La Das Reich, p.264 His body was then burned (although some reports say he was burned alive). When it was discovered that the highly decorated officer had been kidnapped, troops from the Das Reich division and members of the Milice began a brutal search of the surrounding area for K√§mpfe. Two local men were shot dead east of Saint- L√©onard-de-Noblat. Later that day the massacre at Oradour-sur-Glane was committed by troops from the 1st Battalion, Das Reich. The commander of the 4th SS Panzer Grenadier Regiment, SS-Standartenf√ºhrer Sylvester Stadler ordered a court martial into the massacre at Oradour-sur-Glane. SS- Sturmbannf√ºhrer Adolf Diekmann, the commander of the 1st Battalion, 4th SS Panzer Grenadier Regiment, and a personal friend of K√§mpfe, was charged over the killings. He said he found K√§mpfe's handcuffed body inside a German field ambulance with the remains of other German soldiers just outside the village of Oradour-sur-Glane. The vehicle had been set alight burning alive everyone inside. After seeing his friend's fate, the village was destroyed on his orders. SS-Brigadef√ºhrer Heinz Lammerding, Das Reich's division commander, agreed that Diekmann should face a court martial.

Detail of the central panel of the Sarcophagus of Stilicho, Basilica of Saint Ambrose, Milan. Early Christians sarcophagi are those Ancient Roman sarcophagi carrying inscriptions or carving relating them to early Christianity. They were produced from the late 3rd century through to the 5th century. They represent the earliest form of large Christian sculpture, and are important for the study of Early Christian art. The production of Roman sarcophagi with carved decoration spread due to the gradual abandonment of the rite of cremation in favour of inhumation over the course of the 2nd century throughout the empire. However, burial in such sarcophagi was expensive and thus reserved for wealthy families. The end of the Christian persecutions desired by Gallienus in 260 began a period of peace for the Christians that lasted until the end of that century and allowed Christianity to spread in the army, in senior administrative posts and even the emperor's circles. In the second half of the 3rd century, especially due to increased demand from this group of wealthy Christians, the use of sarcophagi spread widely, with plastic treatments following trends in contemporary sculpture. Production and typology The sarcophagi seem to have been produced by workshops who also created pieces with pagan or Jewish iconography. The techniques are the same, but Christian sarcophagi developed a rather different style of layout, with framed scenes, later arranged on two tiers. The images of Christ move in an iconic direction, very unlike the depiction of gods in pagan equivalents, where deities are normally shown, if at all, in narrative scenes.

Dating to between 190 and 200, it was used for the burial of a Roman general involved in the campaigns of Marcus Aurelius and shows influences similar to those of the Column of Marcus Aurelius. Description The sarcophagus is one of a group of about twenty-five late Roman battle sarcophagi, with one exception all apparently dating to 170-210, made in Rome or in some cases Athens. These derive from Hellenistic monuments from Pergamon in Asia Minor showing Pergamene victories over the Gauls, and were all presumably commissioned for military commanders. The Portonaccio sarcophagus is the best known and most elaborate of the main Antonine group, and shows both considerable similarities to the Great Ludovisi sarcophagus, the late outlier from about 250, and a considerable contrast in style and mood.Strong, Donald, et al., Roman Art, 1995 (2nd edn.), p. 205, Yale University Press (Penguin/Yale History of Art), The face of the general is unfinished, either because the sculptors awaited a model to work from, or they had produced the work speculatively with no specific commission. The general and his wife are also each shown twice on the lid frieze, together holding each other's hands at the centre, and singly at the ends, again with unfinished faces.Henig, Martin (ed), A Handbook of Roman Art, p. 93, Phaidon, 1983, Pairs of figures of an older man and a woman stand beneath trophies at either end of the main face, uninvolved in the battle.

Signs and symptoms Symptoms include bruising, petechiae, hematomas, oozing of blood at surgical or puncture sites, stomach pains; risk of massive uncontrolled bleeding; cartilage calcification; and severe malformation of developing bone or deposition of insoluble calcium salts in the walls of arteries. In infants, it can cause some birth defects such as underdeveloped face, nose, bones, and fingers. Vitamin K is changed to its active form in the liver by the enzyme Vitamin K epoxide reductase. Activated vitamin K is then used to gamma carboxylate (and thus activate) certain enzymes involved in coagulation: Factors II, VII, IX, X, and protein C and protein S. Inability to activate the clotting cascade via these factors leads to the bleeding symptoms mentioned above. Notably, when one examines the lab values in Vitamin K deficiency [see below] the prothrombin time is elevated, but the partial thromboplastin time is normal or only mildly prolonged. This may seem counterintuitive given that the deficiency leads to decreased activity in factors of both the intrinsic pathway (F-IX) which is monitored by PTT, as well as the extrinsic pathway (F-VII) which is monitored by PT. However, factor VII has the shortest half-life of all the factors carboxylated by vitamin K; therefore, when deficient, it is the PT that rises first, since the activated Factor VII is the first to \\"disappear.\\" In later stages of deficiency, the other factors (which have longer half lives) are able to \\"catch up,\\" and the PTT becomes elevated as well. Cause Vitamin K1-deficiency may occur by disturbed intestinal uptake (such as would occur in a bile duct obstruction), by therapeutic or accidental intake of a vitamin K1-antagonist such as warfarin, or, very rarely, by nutritional vitamin K1 deficiency. As a result, Gla-residues are inadequately formed and the Gla- proteins are insufficiently active. Epidemiology The prevalence of vitamin K deficiency varies by geographic region. For infants in the United States, vitamin K1 deficiency without bleeding may occur in as many as 50% of infants younger than 5 days old, with the classic hemorrhagic disease occurring in 0.25-1.7% of infants.Vitamin K Deficiency eMedicine. Author: Pankaj Patel, MD. Coauthor(s): Mageda Mikhail, MD, Assistant Professor. Updated: Feb 13, 2014 Therefore, the Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that 0.5 to 1.0 mg Vitamin K1 be administered to all newborns shortly after birth. Postmenopausal and elderly women in Thailand have high risk of Vitamin K2 deficiency, compared with the normal value of young, reproductive females. Current dosage recommendations for Vitamin K may be too low. The deposition of calcium in soft tissues, including arterial walls, is quite common, especially in those suffering from atherosclerosis, suggesting that Vitamin K deficiency is more common than previously thought. Because colonic bacteria synthesize a significant portion of the Vitamin K required for human needs, individuals with disruptions to or insufficient amounts of these bacteria can be at risk for Vitamin K deficiency. Newborns, as mentioned above, fit into this category, as their colons are frequently not adequately colonized in the first five to seven days of life. Another at-risk population comprises those individuals on any sort of long-term antibiotic therapy, as this can diminish the population of normal gut flora.

It is amongst the reddest naked eye stars, with a significant reddish hue when seen in binoculars. It is approximately 900 light years from Earth. Spectrum TX Piscium is a very red star, 2.6 magnitudes fainter at blue wavelengths than in the middle of the visual range, and another 3.3 magnitudes fainter in the ultraviolet. It has been given a spectral class C7,2, indicating a relatively cool carbon star with only modest C2 band strength. It has alternately been classified as C-N5 C24, suggesting a warmer star with stronger C2 bands. Spectral features have been observed to vary. Variability The apparent magnitude of TX Piscium varies between +4.9 and +5.5 and it is classified as a slow irregular variable. Photometry has shown some periodicity in the brightness of 224 days, and some spectral variation over 450 days, suggesting the star is not entirely irregular. The star apparently lies on the period-luminosity relation corresponding to fundamental mode pulsations, unusual for a low-amplitude semi-regular or irregular variable which usually pulsate in an overtone. The angular diameter has been measured at around 10 mas, although this varies depending on the observed wavelength and the atmosphere appears to be highly asymmetric. There may be one or more \\"blobs\\" of ejected material near the star. Some observations show the angular diameter to change in synchrony with the visual brightness. Properties TX Piscium is a thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP- AGB) star, which means that it is alternately fusing helium in a shell around its core and fusing hydrogen in a shell closer to its surface. Stars on the TP-AGB are generally unstable, with high mass loss and pulsations. The periodic flashes of the helium shell in a TP-AGB star are known as thermal pulses and cause the hydrogen shell to be extinguished. This creates strong convection and the third dredge-up (TDU) which brings helium fusion products such as carbon to the surface. After several TDUs, the abundance of carbon in the atmosphere begins to exceed that of oxygen and then the star is known as a carbon star. In TX Piscium, the carbon/oxygen ratio is calculated to be 1.03, which is at the low end of the scale of carbon stars. It is thought to be a relatively new carbon star. TX Piscium has a mass of approximately . Modelling of its observed properties suggest a mass between , while evolutionary models suggest a mass between . In particular, stars with a mass below are not expected to become carbon stars. The temperature of TX Piscium is thought to vary between 3,080 K at minimum visual brightness and 3,170 K at visual maximum. Similarly, its luminosity varies between . Many of its physical properties are uncertain due to uncertainty in its distance. The Hipparcos parallax corresponds to a distance of 275 parsecs, but other estimates give distances as high as 315 parsecs.

The Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus is a marble Early Christian sarcophagus used for the burial of Junius Bassus, who died in 359. It has been described as \\"probably the single most famous piece of early Christian relief sculpture.\\"Journal of Early Christian Studies, Leonard Victor Rutgers, The Iconography of the Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus (review of Malbon book) - Volume 1, Number 1, Spring 1993, pp. 94-96; for Janson it is also the \\"finest Early Christian sarcophagus\\", and Kitzinger, 26, calls it the \\"most famous\\". The sarcophagus was originally placed in or under Old St. Peter's Basilica, was rediscovered in 1597,or 1595, see Elsner, p. 86n. and is now below the modern basilica in the Museo Storico del Tesoro della Basilica di San Pietro (Museum of Saint Peter's Basilica) in the Vatican. The base is approximately 4 x 8 x 4 feet. Together with the Dogmatic sarcophagus in the same museum, this sarcophagus is one of the oldest surviving high-status sarcophagi with elaborate carvings of Christian themes, and a complicated iconographic programme embracing the Old and New Testaments. Junius Bassus Junius Bassus was an important figure, a senator who was in charge of the government of the capital as praefectus urbi when he died at the age of 42 in 359. His father had been Praetorian prefect, running the administration of a large part of the Western Empire. Bassus served under Constantius II, son of Constantine I. Bassus, as the inscription on the sarcophagus tells us, converted to Christianity shortly before his death ‚Äì perhaps on his deathbed. Many still believed, like Tertullian, that it was not possible to be an emperor and a Christian, which also went for the highest officials like Bassus. Style The style of the work has been greatly discussed by art historians, especially as its date is certain, which is unusual at this period.Reece, 237 All are agreed that the workmanship is of the highest quality available at the time, as one might expect for the tomb of such a prominent figure. Cast of Christ's trial before Pilate, with Pilate about to wash his hands. The sarcophagus in many respects shows fewer features of the Late Antique style of sculpture typified in the Arch of Constantine of several decades earlier: \\"The sculpture ignores practically all the rules obeyed by official reliefs. Some figures are portrayed frontally, but certainly not all, and they are not shown in a thoroughly Late Antique manner; the scenes are three-dimensional and have depth and background .... drapery hangs on recognizable human forms rather than being arranged in predetermined folds; heads are varied, portraying recognisably different people.\\"Reece, 240 The sarcophagus has been seen as reflecting a blending of late Hellenistic style with the contemporary Roman or Italian one, seen in the \\"robust\\" proportions of the figures, and their slightly over-large heads. The setting in the niches casts the figures against a background of shadow, giving \\"an emphatic chiaroscuro effect\\"Calvesi, Maurizio; Treasures of the Vatican, p.10, Skira, Geneva and New York, 1962 ‚Äì an effect much more noticeable in the original than the cast shown here, which has a more uniform and lighter colour. The cast also lacks the effects created by light on polished or patinated highlights such as the heads of the figures, against the darker recessed surfaces and backgrounds. Ernst Kitzinger finds \\"a far more definite reattachment to aesthetic ideals of the Graeco-Roman past\\" than in the earlier Dogmatic Sarcophagus and that of the \\"Two Brothers\\", also in the Vatican Museums.Kitzinger, 26 The form continues the increased separation of the scenes; it had been an innovation of the earliest Christian sarcophagi to combine a series of incidents in one continuous (and rather hard to read) frieze, and also to have two registers one above the other, but these examples show a trend to differentiate the scenes, of which the Junius Bassus is the culmination, producing a \\"multitude of miniature stages\\", which allow the spectator \\"to linger over each scene\\", which was not the intention of earlier reliefs which were only \\"shorthand pictographs\\" of each scene, only intended to identify them.Kitzinger, 22-26, 25 quoted. He notes a \\"lyrical, slightly sweet manner\\" in the carving, even in the soldiers who lead St Peter to his death, which compares to some small carvings from the Hellenized east in the Cleveland Museum of Art, though they are several decades older.Kitzinger, 26-27, 26 quoted. Even allowing for \\"the gradual appropriation of a popular type of Christian tomb by upper-class patrons whose standards asserted themselves increasingly both in the content and in the style of these monuments\\", Kitzinger concludes that the changes must reflect a larger \\"regeneration\\" in style.Kitzinger, 28 Iconography Job on the dunghill; Adam and Eve The carvings are in high relief on three sides of the sarcophagus, allowing for its placement against a wall. The column and many parts of the figures are carved completely in the round. The arrangement of relief scenes in rows in a columnar framework is an introduction from Asia Minor at about this time.Hall, 80 No portrait of the deceased is shown, though he is praised in lavish terms in an inscription; instead, the ten niches are filled with scenes from both the New and Old Testaments, plus one, the Traditio Legis, that has no Scriptural basis. The scenes on the front are:Hall, pp. 79-80 in the top row, Sacrifice of Isaac, Judgement or Arrest of Peter, Enthroned Christ with Peter and Paul (Traditio Legis), and a double scene of the Trial of Jesus before Pontius Pilate, who in the last niche is about to wash his hands. In the bottom row: Job on the dunghill, Adam and Eve, Christ's entry into Jerusalem, Daniel in the lion's den (heads restored), Arrest or leading to execution of Paul. Cast of one of the sides; putti harvesting grapes. The tiny spandrels above the lower row show scenes with all participants depicted as lambs: on either side of Christ entering Jerusalem are the Miracle of the loaves and fishes and the Baptism of Jesus.Rome the Cosmopolis, p. vii caption 6, Catharine Edwards, Greg Woolf, Cambridge University Press, 2006, , The other scenes may be the Three youths in the fiery furnace, the Raising of Lazarus, Moses receiving the tablets and Moses striking the rock.Lowrie, 90, and J.W. Appell The sides have more traditional Roman scenes of the Four Seasons represented by putti performing seasonal tasks such as harvesting grapes. On a damaged plaque surmounting the lid is a poem praising Bassus in largely secular terms, and the inscription running along the top of the body of the sarcophagus identifies him, and describes him as a \\"neophyte\\", or recent convert. Further small reliefs on the lid, and heads at the corners, are badly damaged.Texts, though nb the descriptions of the iconography here are not accurate. They showed scenes of feasts and a burial procession typical of pagan sarcophagi;Elsner, 87 it is possible the lid was not created to match the base. =Scenes with Christ= The emphasis on scenes of judgement may have been influenced by the career of Bassus as a magistrate, but all the scenes shown can be paralleled in other Christian works of the period. alt= In all the three scenes where he appears Christ is a youthful, beardless figure with shortish hair (though longer than that of other figures), which is typical of Christian art at this period. The angel standing behind Abraham in the Sacrifice of Isaac is depicted similarly, and without wings. Christ appears in the centre of both rows; in the top row as a law-giver or teacher between his chief followers, Peter and Paul (the Traditio Legis), and on the bottom entering Jerusalem. Both scenes borrow from pagan Roman iconography: in the top one Jesus is sitting with his feet on a billowing cloak representing the sky, carried by Caelus, the classical personification of the heavens. Christ hands Peter a scroll, probably representing the Gospels, as emperors were often shown doing to their heirs, ministers or generals.James Hall, A History of Ideas and Images in Italian Art, p. 80, 1983, John Murray, London, . Hellemo, pp. 65-70 discusses the place of the work in the development of the traditio legis subject. Before Pilate Christ also carries a scroll, like a philosopher.Janson Pilate, perhaps worried by Jesus's reputation for miracles, is making the gesture Italians still use to ward off the evil eye.Lowrie, 89 - the cornu, a fist with the index and little finger extended. Pilate has a mild and passive appearance, contrasting strongly with the powerful and determined expression of the figure in low relief profile behind him on the wall, the only figure in these scenes depicted in this style and technique. If he is not just one of Pilate's subordinate officers, he may be intended as a portrait or statue of the emperor; Roman official business was usually conducted before such an image, upon which (under the deified pagan emperors) any oaths required were made. The lower scene loosely follows the entry (\\"adventus\\") of an emperor to a city, a scene often depicted in Imperial art; Christ is \\"identified as imperator by the imperial eagle of victory\\" in the conch moulding above the scene.Eduard Syndicus; Early Christian Art; p. 97; Burns & Oates, London, 1962, and see Edwards & Woolf, op & page cit. There was already a tradition, borrowed from pagan iconography, of depicting Christ the Victor; in this work that theme is linked to the Passion of Jesus, of which the entry to Jerusalem is the start,Adventus Domini, p. 100, Geir Hellemo a development that was to play a great part in shaping the Christian art of the future. The inclusion of the pagan figure of Caelus may seem strange, but he was not an important figure in Ancient Roman religion, so was evidently considered as a harmless pictorial convention by the Christian designer of the composition, as well as one of the elements showing continuity with Roman tradition. From the following century personifications of the River Jordan often appear in depictions of the Baptism of Jesus,G Schiller, Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. I,1971 (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, p.133 & figs, and the manuscript Chronography of 354, just a few years older than the sarcophagus and made for another elite Christian, is full of personifications of cities, months and other concepts. The putti in the Chronography also relate closely to those on the sides of the sarcophagus.Meyer Schapiro, Selected Papers, volume 3, Late Antique, Early Christian and Mediaeval Art, p. 143, 1980, Chatto & Windus, London, =Other scenes= Cast of the Sacrifice of Isaac. The hand of God originally came down to hold Abraham's knife (both are now missing). The Old Testament scenes depicted were chosen as precursors of Christ's sacrifice in the New Testament, in an early form of typology. Adam and Eve are shown covering their nakedness after the Fall of Man, which created the original sin and hence the need for Christ to be sacrificed for our sins. Adam and Eve themselves made no sacrifices, but behind Eve is a lamb, and beside Adam a sheaf of wheat, referring to the sacrifices of their two sons, Cain and Abel. Just to the right of the middle is Daniel in the lion's den, saved by his faith, and on the left is Abraham about to sacrifice Isaac. Job is seen at the point when he has lost everything, but retains his faith; his wife and a \\"comforter\\" look on anxiously. Christians saw these as foreshadowings of the sacrifice of God's only son, Jesus, though the Crucifixion itself, a rare subject up until the 5th century, is not depicted. The scenes prior to the martyrdoms of Peter and Paul, both common in Early Christian art, show the same avoidance of the climactic moments which were usually chosen in later Christian art. But they demonstrate to the viewer how the heavenly crown could be achieved by ordinary Christians, although the Imperial persecutions were now over. Both scenes also took place in Rome, and this local interest is part of the balance of Christian and traditional Roman gestures that the sarcophagus shows.Elsner's main theme The reeds behind Paul probably represent the boggy area of the city where Paul's execution was traditionally believed to have happened.Lowrie, 89 Peter's execution was believed to have happened close to his grave, which was within a few feet of the location of the sarcophagus; both executions were believed to have occurred on the same day.

History The newspaper was founded in 2007 by two undergraduates Lionel Faull (Editor 2007, Managing Editor 2008), and Ines Schumacher (Deputy Editor 2007, Editor 2008). It received almost no funding from the Rhodes University SRC at the time, and had to rely almost entirely on advertising revenue. The Oppidan Press was founded to provide news and entertainment to the previously disenfranchised Oppidan community and increase the quality of student media at Rhodes University. The newspaper's direct competitor is Activate. Purpose The Oppidan Press is primarily a newspaper produced for student readers who live off-campus in digs, although its orientation and coverage necessarily includes campus affairs, because all students are members of the Rhodes community. It is published fortnightly during university term-time, i.e. approximately 12 editions per year. However, this does not exclude special editions published for certain events which fall outside of these parameters. Financing Although The Oppidan Press receives a grant from Rhodes University's Student Representative Council, all printing costs are covered by advertisements and private sponsors. The grant is used for the newspaper's extensive training programme, functions and office equipment. This makes the newspaper's editorial side completely independent of the University.

McCray was born in North Philadelphia in 1953 and raised in Brewerytown, a neighborhood of North Philadelphia. During the late 1960s, he and a group of friends started doing graffiti in Philadelphia, by writing their monikers on walls across the city. The movement spread to New York City and blossomed into the modern graffiti movement, which reached its peak in the U.S. in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and then spread to Europe. Since his tagging days, McCray has developed a close relationship with The Philadelphia Mural Arts Program. He is a public speaker and a youth advocate.  Childhood and Corrections Facility  Born in Brewerytown in 1953, Darryl McCray was primarily raised by his mother and grandparents. In 1965, McCray was sent to a juvenile corrections facility called the Youth Development Center (YDC). While at the YDC, McCray adopted the nickname \\"Cornbread\\". McCray complained to the cook of the institution, Mr. Swanson, that he only baked white bread, while McCray preferred his grandmother's cornbread. McCray‚Äôs constant badgering inspired Mr. Swanson to start calling McCray \\"Cornbread\\", a nickname that McCray adopted. The YDC was full of Philadelphia gang members who would write their names on the walls of the facility. McCray claims he was never part of a gang, but he would write his new nickname, \\"Cornbread\\", on the walls next to the gang members. McCray claimed to be the first person to tag his own name and not a gang name or symbol.  Tagging in the 1960s and 1970s  When McCray was released from the YDC, he went to Strawberry Mansion Junior High School. There, he developed a crush on a girl named Cynthia Custuss. To win her attention, he wrote ‚ÄúCornbread Loves Cynthia‚Äù all over North Philadelphia. After winning over Cynthia, he continued tagging North Philadelphia. In 1971, Cornelius Hosey was shot dead in gang warfare, and Philadelphia newspapers incorrectly identified him as Cornbread, the tagger. He was arrested for tagging ‚ÄúCornbread Lives‚Äù on an elephant at the Philadelphia Zoo.  The Anti-Graffiti Network and Mural Arts  In 1984, Mayor Wilson Goode founded the Anti-Graffiti Network and recruited McCray to help him stop the inner-city youth from tagging. The Anti-Graffiti Network eventually turned into The Mural Arts Program, the largest public art program in the United States. In 2011, there was a local mural tour in West Philadelphia called Love Letters which drew its inspiration from 1967's \\"Cornbread Loves Cynthia‚Äù  Activist and Icon  In 2007, documentary filmmaker, Sean McKnight, made a film called Cry of the City Part 1: The Legend of Cornbread.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1545047/ The story of Cornbread is also prominently included in the documentary film about the history of graffiti, called Bomb It (2007). In August 2013, McCray was honored at the Graffiti Hall of Famehttp://www.complex.com/city- guide/2013/05/the-15-coolest-places-in-harlem-right-now/graffiti-hall-of-fame in East Harlem for his contribution to hip-hop culture. Today, McCray works as a public speaker and youth advocate. He gives motivational talks about his youth as a tagger, his run-ins with the law, and his struggles with drugs.

Its most characteristic feature is the trapezium-shaped window frames. The Regio- Shuttle is classified by the Deutsche Bahn as Class 650, by the ƒåesk√© Dr√°hy as Class 840 or Class 841, however numerous private railways have their own Regio-Shuttles.  Technical information  Originally a product from the firm of ADtranz, the RS1 is now being built and sold by Stadler Rail AG, since Bombardier Transportation had to sell the site at Berlin-Wilhelmsruh in 2001 for legal reasons when they took over ADtranz. The RS1 is a railbus built to UIC standards, which therefore can withstand longitudinal forces of ; it is available with centre buffer couplings or the usual European Buffers and chain couplers. 65% of the vehicle floor is low-level and designed for a platform height of . On the Sch√∂nbuchbahn a special variant designed for platforms is in use. The railbus has a high-level floor over the two four-wheeled bogies at each end. Two independent diesel-mechanical drive units, e.g. from MAN, run either on diesel fuel or Biodiesel from rape seed oil, each drive both axles on one of the two bogies. The RS1's appearance is striking because its window design looks like a timber-framed bridge support (or Warren truss), the angled bodyshell pillars being visible at the windows. This construction was originally proposed to ABB (later ADtranz) by Design Triangle during a research study into weight reduction for high speed trains. The study, reported in a paper to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1996, showed that the diagonal pillar concept allowed mass reduction, improved passenger views and flexibility of seating layout, whilst maintaining adequate body strength and stiffness.\\"Diagonal Window Pillars - A New Vision for Passengers\\", Institution of Mechanical Engineers, London, 1996 ABB applied for a patent on the design. The Bombardier Itino uses a similar angled window pillar design. A similar window pillar design had been used on the Schienenzeppelin railcar in 1929. From an operational point of view the Regio- Shuttle may be used for one-man operations on full gauge railways without any restrictions. Its relatively small capacity (maximum under 170 passengers) is balanced by the fact that the vehicle can be driven in multiples of up to seven units. A rake of five RS1's can thus handle a maximum of just under 850 passengers, albeit somewhat uneconomical compared with a locomotive-hauled train due to the fuel consumption of its ten diesel motors. In 2006 a Regio- Shuttle was converted by Voith. Amongst other things it was to have stricter exhaust emission and the top speed was to be raised to 140 km/h. A production series was to follow,Press release from Voith Turbo on 16 October 2006 however it looks as if the production of the Regio-Shuttle ceased in 2006. In 2007 and 2008 further orders followed from the ODEG,Press release from ODEG on 6 October 2008 the HzL and Rhenus Veniro. Including the machines on order the total number of manufactured Regio-Shuttles comes to 365 units.

Avocado production in California Avocados, native to Central and South America, have long been produced in California. In 1989, California supplied 90 percent of fresh avocados produced in the United States. As of 2008, approximately 6,500 growers produce avocados on 60,000 bearing acres of land (less than 100 square miles). Price and production levels vary from season to season, and from year to year, due to weather and incidents such as fires. In a typical year production averages 350 million pounds at a wholesale price of $1 per pound, although 2008 was an exceptionally low yield year. Most avocados are grown from San Luis Obispo south, with San Diego County the largest producer. Organization history The California Avocado Commission's predecessor organization, the California Avocado Advisory Board, was organized in 1961 out of dissatisfaction by individual growers with the success of the state's largest agricultural cooperative, Calavo Growers, to secure stable prices for avocados. New laws were passed allowing growers to form an association that would obtain a compulsory contribution from businesses directly involved in the avocado industry, and use the money to advertise and promote avocados to consumers throughout America. The Board assumed this marketing responsibility from Calavo, which continued to manage distribution and relations with retailers for the 60% of growers who remained in the co-op. The newly organized Board began marketing avocados to American housewives and stay-at-home fathers, attempting to downplay the fruit's Mexican origin in favor of an exotic tropical or Mediterranean image, as well as its suitability for mass-produced processed food. The Board also attempted to counter the avocado's reputation as being unhealthy and fattening, a marketing effort that has continued sporadically through the present in an attempt to increase sales. In the 1970s guacamole, once primarily consumed in America by Mexican- Americans, became popular throughout all of America, initially due to a Sunset Magazine cover story featuring avocado recipes. In the late 1970s to early 1980s consumption surged again due to Latino immigration. During the period Avocado consumption tripled in Mexico as well. The present Commission was organized in 1978 as a successor to the Advisory Board. In the 1980s there was a boom in Avocado planting in California, mostly by small, semi-professional growers. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the Commission lobbied to prevent imports of fresh avocados from Mexico, which has a much larger avocado industry and lower labor, water, and land costs. One argument it used successfully until 1997, when importation was finally allowed, was that allowing Mexican avocados into the United States would spread crop disease. However, after 1997, lower costs of production in Mexico forced California growers to lower wages to become competitive. Programs The organization is based in Irvine, California. Among its initiatives are advertising, public relations, defending growers from effects of importation of avocados from Mexico, compiling and disseminating industry news and information, lobbying, research on growing and production, and policing groves from \\"avocado rustlers\\" who steal fruit. Revenues vary from $10-20 million per year (they vary with industry income).

More formally, a PIT algorithm is given an arithmetic circuit that computes a polynomial p in a field, and decides whether p is the zero polynomial. Determining the computational complexity required for polynomial identity testing is one of the most important open problems in algebraic computing complexity.  Description  The question \\"Does (x+y)(x-y) equal x^2 - y^2 \\\\, ?\\" is a question about whether two polynomials are identical. As with any polynomial identity testing question, it can be trivially transformed into the question \\"Is a certain polynomial equal to 0?\\"; in this case we can ask \\"Does (x+y)(x-y) - (x^2 - y^2) = 0\\"? If we are given the polynomial as an algebraic expression (rather than as a black-box), we can confirm that the equality holds through brute-force multiplication and addition, but the time complexity of the brute-force approach grows as \\\\tbinom{n+d}{d}, where n is the number of variables (here, n=2: x is the first and y is the second), and d is the degree of the polynomial (here, d=2). If n and d are both large, \\\\tbinom{n+d}{d} grows exponentially.Saxena, Nitin. \\"Progress on Polynomial Identity Testing.\\" Bulletin of the EATCS 99 (2009): 49-79. PIT concerns whether a polynomial is identical to the zero polynomial, rather than whether the function implemented by the polynomial always evaluates to zero in the given domain. For example, the field with two elements, GF(2), contains only the elements 0 and 1. In GF(2), x^2 - x always evaluates to zero; despite this, PIT does not consider x^2 - x to be equal to the zero polynomial.Shpilka, Amir, and Amir Yehudayoff. \\"Arithmetic circuits: A survey of recent results and open questions.\\" Foundations and Trends in Theoretical Computer Science 5.3‚Äì4 (2010): 207-388. Determining the computational complexity required for polynomial identity testing is one of the most important open problems in the mathematical subfield known as \\"algebraic computing complexity\\".Dvir, Zeev, and Amir Shpilka. \\"Locally decodable codes with two queries and polynomial identity testing for depth 3 circuits.\\" SIAM Journal on Computing 36.5 (2007): 1404-1434. The study of PIT is a building-block to many other areas of computational complexity, such as the proof that IP=PSPACE.Adi Shamir. \\"IP=PSPACE.\\" Journal of the ACM (JACM) 39.4 (1992): 869-877. In addition, PIT has applications to Tutte matrices and also to primality testing, where PIT techniques led to the AKS primality test, the first deterministic (though impractical) polynomial time algorithm for primality testing.  Formal problem statement  Given an arithmetic circuit that computes a polynomial in a field, determine whether the polynomial is equal to the zero polynomial (that is, the polynomial with no nonzero terms).  Solutions  In some cases, the specification of the arithmetic circuit is not given to the PIT solver, and the PIT solver can only input values into a \\"black box\\" that implements the circuit, and then analyze the output. Note that the solutions below assume that any operation (such as multiplication) in the given field takes constant time; further, all black-box algorithms below assume the size of the field is larger than the degree of the polynomial. The Schwartz‚ÄìZippel algorithm provides a practical probabilistic solution, by simply randomly testing inputs and checking whether the output is zero. It was the first randomized polynomial time PIT algorithm to be proven correct. The larger the domain the inputs are drawn from, the less likely Schwartz‚ÄìZippel is to fail. If random bits are in short supply, the Chen-Kao algorithm (over the rationals) or the Lewin-Vadhan algorithm (over any field) require fewer random bits at the cost of more required runtime. A sparse PIT has at most m nonzero monomial terms. A sparse PIT can be deterministically solved in polynomial time of the size of the circuit and the number m of monomials, see also.Grigoriev,Dima, Karpinski,Marek, and Singer,Michael F., \\"Fast Parallel Algorithms for Sparse Multivariate Polynomial Interpolation over Finite Fields\\", SIAM J. Comput., Vol 19, No.6, pp. 1059-1063, December 1990 A low degree PIT has an upper bound on the degree of the polynomial. Any low degree PIT problem can be reduced in subexponential time of the size of the circuit to a PIT problem for depth-four circuits; therefore, PIT for circuits of depth-four (and below) is intensely studied.

He attended Viewbank College and was recruited by the Essendon Football Club with the fifth overall selection in the 2008 national draft. AFL career Hurley in debut season. Hurley showed tremendous form throughout the TAC Cup, showing his all-round quality for the Northern Knights. He was named All-Australian in 2007 and backed it up with another selection after the 2008 AFL Under 18 Championships and was also selected in the TAC Cup Team of the Year in both seasons. He made his debut against the Port Adelaide Power in round 1, 2009, and was nominated twice as the AFL Rising Star nominee, in round 20 of that season, and round 18 the following year, both times against . After his match-winning four goal performance against Hawthorn in round 22, 2009, Leigh Matthews said, \\"Very few young talls have the physical maturity to match it with their older and stronger opponents, which is why the brilliant early form of young Bomber Michael Hurley is quite amazing.\\" Ahead of the 2010 season, Hurley inherited the famous number 18 guernsey from retired club great Matthew Lloyd. The following four seasons saw Hurley's form fluctuate due to injury and the constant shuffling of his position in the team between both ends of the ground. He averaged 22 goals per season, and spent just as much time playing in the back line on some of the opposition's best key forwards, where his precise kicking and attacking flair out of the back half were noticeable on numerous occasions. The 2014 season brought with it a permanent role for Hurley as a key defender, the position for which he was initially drafted. This newfound positional consistency allowed him to really begin to shine as a footballer. He played a career-high 21 games during the season and averaged 19 disposals, six marks and three rebound 50s for the year. Despite Essendon's poor performances in the 2015 season, Michael averaged 21 disposals, seven marks and six rebound 50s over 19 matches. He was awarded with his first All-Australian selection, and finished runner-up in the W.S. Crichton Medal. Hurley, along with 33 other Essendon players, was found guilty of using a banned performance-enhancing substance, thymosin beta-4, as part of Essendon's sports supplements program during the 2012 season. He and his teammates were initially found not guilty in March 2015 by the AFL Anti-Doping Tribunal, but a guilty verdict was returned in January 2016 after an appeal by the World Anti-Doping Agency. He was suspended for two years which, with backdating, ended in November 2016; as a result, he served approximately fourteen months of his suspension and missed the entire 2016 AFL season. During his suspension, he signed a five-year contract extension to stay with Essendon until the end of 2022.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-18/michael- hurley-signs-five-year-contract-extension-with-essendon/7763824?section=sport In 2017, he was named in the All-Australian Team. Personal life On 25 September 2009, Hurley was arrested after a drunken altercation with a taxi driver, after the driver demanded payment for the fare when Hurley asked him to stop at a fast food drivethrough. Hurley was later charged with multiple counts of assault; it is alleged that he punched the driver and kicked him in the groin.

Career After attending Allegheny College from 1873 through 1877, McKelvy signed with the Indianapolis Blues of the National league for the 1878 season. He became the first player from Allegheny College to make it to the Major League level, as well the first to hit a home run. It came against Bobby Mitchell on June 1, 1878, in the top of the third inning, when he hit a two- run, inside-the-park home run. It was the only home run Mitchell surrendered during his four-year career. McKelvy played in a league leading 63 games that season, 62 of them in center field, which also led all National league center fielders in games played. His two home runs were third, and his 36 runs batted in were seventh amongst the league leaders. He pitched in a total of four games as a pitcher, one of which was a start, and the other three came in relief. 1878 was the only year that the Blues were at the Major League level, and McKelvy did not reappear in the Majors until he made a one-game return, for the 1882 Pittsburgh Alleganys. In that game, played on August 24, 1882, he played right field, batted four times, and did not have a hit. This was his last appearance in the Majors. Post-career McKelvy died at the age of 61 in Omaha, Nebraska, and is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Omaha.

With the support from his mother and school principal, Brad is a success story, becoming a motivational speaker and an award-winning teacher. Plot Twelve-year-old Brad lives in Missouri with his divorc√©e mother, Ellen, and younger brother, Jeff. He constantly gets into trouble with his father Norman and his teachers at school due to his tics. In one class, his teacher calls him to the front to make him apologize to his class for disrupting the class and promise he won't do it again. Determined to find out what is wrong with her son, Ellen seeks medical help. A psychiatrist believes that Brad's tics are the result of his parents' divorce. One lady suggests an exorcism. Ellen takes her search to the library and comes across Tourette syndrome (TS) in a medical book. She shows this to the psychiatrist, who agrees with the diagnosis, and says that there is no cure. Brad and his mother attend a support group for the first and last time. From then on, Brad aspires to never be like the other members of the support group and to become successful. At the beginning of middle school, Brad is sent to the principal's office for being disruptive. The principal invites him to the school concert later in the afternoon. At the end of the concert, which Brad's Tourette's tics had disturbed, he calls Brad up to the stage and asks Brad to talk about his TS. As Brad makes his way back to his seat, the school applauds him. As an adult, Brad lives with his house mate Ron in Georgia, and is looking for work as an elementary school teacher. He is turned down after 24 interviews because of his TS. He finally gets an interview where the staff is accepting and they give him the job. On his first day, Brad explains his TS to the children. He helps Thomas with reading and makes an impression on Heather, a girl with terminal cancer. Another student's father pulls her out of Brad's class as he fears Brad will distract her. Brad meets Nancy on an online dating site. After dating her for some time, he invites her over for Thanksgiving back at Ellen's house, where he tells Nancy he loves her, and the feeling is reciprocated. He confides in Ellen his concern that Nancy will get fed up with his tics, but she reassures him that he must not let his TS get in the way. An observer at the school assesses Brad's teaching, and the head teacher announces that Brad has been chosen to receive the Teacher of the Year award, which he accepts in front his family, friends and students. The ending titles tell that Brad got his master's degree; he dressed up as Homer, (Atlanta Braves) mascot; he married Nancy in 2006; and a photograph of the real Brad Cohen teaching his class are shown.

This segment has developed with the advent of dedicated electronic trading platforms and the internet, which allows individuals to access the global currency markets. In 2016, it was reported that retail foreign exchange trading represented 5.5% of the whole foreign exchange market ($282 billion in daily trading turnover).Triennial Central Bank Survey (April 2016), Bank for International Settlements Prior to the development of forex trading platforms in the late 90s, forex trading was restricted to large financial institutions. It was the development of the internet, trading software, and forex brokers allowing trading on margin, that started the growth of retail trading. Today, traders are able to trade spot currencies with market makers on margin. This means they need to put down only a small percentage of the trade size and can buy and sell currencies in seconds.  History  The year 1996 saw the first generation of forex online trading platforms. As a result, foreign exchange and customers' markets flourished. Web-technology not only allowed retail foreign exchange trading to foster easy and fast ways for customers to access the markets, but also currency pairs while making trades from their own computers. The software development of trading platforms has seen a number of stages. Initially, trading platforms were based on basic programs downloaded to computers, such as the popular MetaTrader 4. This was followed by the development of easier-to-use interfaces and advanced features such as charting and technical analysis tools. The next stage saw the move to web-based platforms and mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones. Since 2010 there has also been a focus on developments to integrate automated trading tools and social trading into the forex trading platforms. Fraud Retail forex trading has been promoted by some as an easy way to make profits and has thus been the focus for a number of foreign exchange frauds. In response, financial regulators in a number of countries have introduced restrictions or provided warnings about this type of trading as well as legal actions against perpetrators. However, due to the decentralized nature of currency trading and the easy global access to the internet, a number of brokers are based in less restrictive jurisdictions.

The Place Saint-Paul and the surrounding area were, unofficially, named the Pletzl when the neighborhood became predominantly Jewish because of an influx of immigrants at the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth. The area hosts a diverse Jewish community, assembling traditional Jewish families as well as many more who arrived through immigration from Eastern Europe and North Africa through the past centuries. The area is now characterised by its synagogues, butchers, Jewish delicatessens, and falafel vendors, which provide a social and cultural fabric for its inhabitants. The darkest days for this community came during the Second World War, when Vichy collaboration with the Nazis resulted in the raids in which many residents were abducted and sent off to death camps. Today, the community is an Orthodox one, extremely religious, and most citizens belong to one of the three local synagogues; one located at 17, rue des Rosiers, another at 25, rue des Rosiers and the one at 10, rue Pav√©e, an art nouveau temple designed by Hector Guimard, famous for his work on the Paris M√©tro. Why Pletzl? Some time ago, the City of Paris installed a plaque at the corner of the Rue des Rosiers and the Rue Ferdinand Duval that explains why the Jewish quarter is known as the \\"Pletzl\\". Translated, it reads: > Fleeing persecution, Ashkenazi Jews flooded into Paris beginning in 1881. > They found places living among their co-religionists already established in > the Marais. By 1900, about 6,000 had arrived from Rumania, Russia and > Austria-Hungary; 18,000 more arrived in the years preceding the First World > War. Installed in considerable numbers in the Rue des √âcouffes, the Rue > Ferdinand Duval (named Rue des Juifs, \\"Jews Street\\", until about 1900), and > the Rue des Rosiers, they constituted a new community, the \\"Pletzl\\", the > \\"little place\\" in Yiddish, and they created the √âcole Israelite du Travail > (Israelite Trade School) at 4B, Rue des Rosiers.

History  Beckwithshaw takes its name from the now smaller settlement of Beckwith, to the east. The suffix \\"shaw\\", first recorded in 1323, is from the Old English sceaga, meaning a copse. In 1875, a reservoir was built to the west of the village. Known as Ten Acre Reservoir, it actually only covered .

In 2019, it will be drained so that it only contains of water to relieve pressure on the dam head and will also be converted into a wildlife area. Beckwithshaw was historically a hamlet in the ancient parish of Pannal. When the village of Pannal was removed from the civil parish of Pannal in 1937, Beckwithshaw became the largest settlement in the parish. The name of the civil parish was changed from Pannal to Beckwithshaw in 2010. The parish now shares a grouped parish council with Haverah Park.

To her right, Adam lies on the ground. The Dogmatic Sarcophagus, also known as the \\"Trinity Sarcophagus\\" is an early Christian sarcophagus dating to 320‚Äì350,Various scholars give narrower ranges, but the great majority of dates given fall within this range now in the Vatican Museums (Vatican 104).There is another \\"Trinity Sarcophagus\\" at Arles, alsao with a three-figure Trinity. It was discovered in the 19th century during rebuilding works at the basilica di San Paolo fuori le Mura, in Rome, Italy. Together with the Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus, it one of the most important examples of Christian-Roman sculpture of the Constantinian era. It draws its name from its clear references to the dogmas of the Council of Nicaea (325), in particular to Christ being consubstantial with God the Father, as shown (for example) by the scene of a figure with the appearance of Jesus between Adam and Eve, though whether the figure is to be understood as Christ or God the Father is less clear ‚Äì the dogmatic point works either way. Description The front face is split into two registers, typical of the style of the time, with Old Testament and New Testament subjects and a central shell-shaped clipeus containing the portraits of the dead couple, embraced and wearing marital clothes typical of the 4th century (tunica manicata, dalmatina and toga contabulata by the man, who holds a rotulus in his hand, and tunic and palla by the woman). The heads are basic types, showing there was either no desire or not enough time to personalize the sarcophagus. In the upper register are five episodes, two from the book of Genesis and three miracles of Christ: *Three similar bearded figures representing the Trinity, the middle enthroned representing God the Father, creating Eve from the rib of Adam, who lies on the ground. *A younger, beardless, figure with the conventional appearance of Christ between Adam and Eve, and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. *Marriage at Cana * Multiplication of the loaves *Resurrection of Lazarus In the lower register are six scenes, one linked to Christ's birth, two to the Bible and three to St Peter: *Adoration of the Magi, with an enthroned Virgin and Child, and with Magi in oriental dress and Phrygian caps, and with Balaam behind the throne *Healing the blind *Daniel in the lions' den *Habbakuk with the basket of loaves and the angel *Peter denying Christ, with the crowing cockerel from the Gospel account *Peter's arrest, by two soldiers wearing Pannonian caps *Moses or Peter creating a spring of water in the presence of a centurion (with the latter wearing typical 4th century military dress) The sarcophagus can be dated to between 330 and 340 due to the male hairstyles (apart from those of Christ and Peter), the squat square figures and the lack of calligraphic detail. There are echoes of the previous \\"plebeian\\" official art, which has led some to suggest that the sarcophagus is from the same workshop that produced and amended the reliefs for the Arch of Constantine (dedicated in 315). Iconography The account in Genesis naturally credits the Creation to the single figure of God, in Christian terms, God the Father. However the first person plural in Genesis 1:26 \\"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness\\", and New Testament references to Christ as creator (John 1:3, Colossians 1:15) led Early Christian writers to associate the Creation with the Logos, or pre-existing Christ. A number of other sarcophagi, most conveniently collected in the same Vatican collection as the Dogmatic Sarcophagus, also show groups of three figures usually interpreted as representing the Trinity in scenes from Genesis. Sometimes one figure is beardless, while the other two are bearded. Given the funerary context, and that adjacent scenes often show New Testament miracles, including the Raising of Lazarus, the emphasis of these scenes may relate as much to the overcoming of sin and hope of new life as the Fall of Man. Christ was compared to Adam in Romans 5:14‚Äì21, and was sometimes called the \\"new Adam\\", especially in connection with baptism (at this period catechumens were apparently naked when this was administered). This may also be referred to in the second scene, or the central figure may represent the Divine Logos, who is also shown with the appearance of Jesus. The scene represents the \\"division of labours\\" between Adam and Eve; the central figure holds a sheaf of corn in one hand and a dead hare (in another Vatican example a lamb) in the other, although one might expect hunting hares to be Adam's task and agriculture Eve's, rather than the opposite as the sarcophagus seems to suggest. Adam and Eve also functioned as typological forerunners of Jesus and Mary, and the Tree of Knowledge of the Cross of the Crucifixion. In addition they represented faithfulness in marriage, and scenes of them between the Logos are interpreted by some as representing their marriage ceremony, suitable for the sarcophagus of a married couple.

American astronomer Edward Emerson Barnard added this nebula to his catalog of dark nebulae in 1919. His catalog was published in 1927, at which stage it included some 350 objects. Because of its opacity, its interior is extremely cold, its temperature being about 16 K (‚àí257 ¬∞C). Its mass is about twice that of the Sun and it measures about half a light- year across. Characteristics Despite being opaque at visible-light wavelengths, use of the Very Large Telescope at Cerro Paranal has revealed the presence of about 3,700 blocked background Milky Way stars, some 1,000 of which are visible at infrared wavelengths. Careful measurements of the degree of obscuration resulted in a finely sampled and accurate mapping of the dust distribution inside the cloud. Observations obtained with Herschel Space Observatory were able to constrain the distribution of the dust component and its temperature even more. Having a dark cloud in the solar neighborhood greatly facilitates observation and measurement. If not disrupted by external forces, the stability of dust clouds is a fine balance between outward pressure caused by the heat or pressure of the cloud's contents, and inward gravitational forces generated by the same particles (see Jeans instability and Bonnor-Ebert mass). This causes the cloud to wobble or oscillate in a manner not unlike that of a large soap bubble or a water-filled balloon which is jiggled. In order for the cloud to become a star, gravity must gain the upper hand long enough to cause the cloud to collapse and reach a temperature and density where fusion can be sustained. When this happens, the much smaller size of the star's envelope signals a new balance between greatly increased gravity and radiation pressure. The cloud's mass is about twice that of the Sun, and it measures about half a light-year across. Barnard 68's well-defined edges and other features show that it is on the verge of gravitational collapse followed by becoming a star within the next 200,000 years or so. The cloud is often confused with Bo√∂tes void although the two have nothing in common, but pictures of Barnard 68 are often used to illustrate articles about Bo√∂tes void.

He is currently with the Yokohama DeNA BayStars in Japan's Pacific League. He made his Giants debut in 2007 against the Tokyo Yakult Swallows, pitching 2/3 of an inning and giving up a hit and a walk in that span. He saw expanded action in 2008 as a mid- season call-up, and he was part of a young bullpen that led the Giants to a Japan Series berth against the eventual champion Saitama Seibu Lions. In 28 games, he pitched in relief in 26 of them and made two starts, one of them being his first career complete game against the Hiroshima Toyo Carp on September 24. He made four appearances in the '08 playoffs, all without giving up a run. His first full season in 2009 started off very well, as Tono posted quality starts in four of his first five starts, en route to 14 for the year, but his smoking habit caught up with him late in the season. Run support was a problem for him though, as he had 10 no-decisions to go with his 8-8 record and a respectable 3.17 ERA. His season was marred by a bit of controversy, as Tono was pulled from his start on September 16 by manager Tatsunori Hara. A frustrated Hara said after the game, \\"As an athlete, not being able to quit smoking represents a larger weakness. He needs to get stronger.\\" This was the third in a string of three straight poor starts for the young righty. Ultimately, Tono was a part of the 2009 Japan Series Champion Giants, who defeated the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters in six games to with their 21st title. He pitched in three games in the postseason, giving up 1 run in 8 and 1/3 innings. He also started the deciding 6th game in the series, but had to leave with two down in the very first inning after being struck on the hand on a line drive by Nippon Ham Fighters first baseman Shinji Takahashi. Pitching Style Tono is one of many starters in Japan who pitches exclusively from the stretch position, modifying his delivery when there are runners on base. He does not have overpowering pitches, as his four-seam fastball tops out only at 144 km/h (89 MPH). However, Tono does compensate with good control on his fastball and also has an array of other pitches, among them a sharp curveball, a late-breaking slider, and a forkball, leading to a lot of strikeouts. He is prone to bad spells resulting from errors or consecutive hits, and is also prone to giving up home runs. However, he is also adept at pitching out of jams and gets clutch strikeouts when needed.

Previous versions of this model (referred to as the Attitude, Social Norm, Self-Efficacy (ASE) model, derived from the Theory of Planned Behavior) have been used to explain a variety of types of health behavior. Phases of behavioral change The I-Change Model is a phase model and assumes that at least three phases in the behavioral change process can be distinguished: 1\\\\. Awareness; 2. Motivation; 3. Action. For each phase particular determinants are more relevant. =Awareness= Awareness of a particular problem in a person is the result of accurate knowledge and risk perceptions of the person about his own behavior (not all persons are aware of the level of their own behavior, for instance, many persons overestimate the amount of their physical activity. Cues in their environment (e.g. a person with cancer) may also prompt a person to become more aware of a particular risk and the need to adopt a particular health behavior. =Motivation= Motivation to change a behavior depends on a person's attitude (the results of perceived advantages and disadvantages of the behavior), social influence beliefs (norms of others, behavior of others, and support of others) and self- efficacy expectations (the perceived ability to perform a particular health behavior). The ultimate result in level of motivation to adopt a health behavior can be measured by intentions, a concept derived from Fishbein & Ajzen's Theory of Reasoned ActionFishbein, M., & Ajzen, I. (1975). Belief, attitude, intention, and behavior: An introduction to theory and research. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley. or related concepts such as the stage of change concept of the Transtheoretical Model of Prochaska. =Action= Intentions do not necessarily lead to behavior. Factors determining action, besides a positive intention, are again self-efficacy, action planning and goal setting. With regard to action planning we distinguish preparation planning (planning actions required to change), initiation planning (planning the actions needed to perform the new behavior for the first time) and coping or maintenance planning (planning the actions to cope with barriers and relapse in order to maintain the realized changes). Additionally, the development of skills required for the new health behavior is needed as well. Predisposing factors The I-Change Model assumes that these motivational processes are determined by various predisposing factors such as behavioral factors (e.g. life styles), psychological factors (e.g. personality), biological factors (e.g. gender, genetic predisposition), social and cultural factors (e.g. the price of cigarettes, policies), and information factors (the quality of messages, channels and sources used).

He is known in his native Bengal primarily as one of the foremost Nazrulgeeti exponents, and was one of the foremost artistes of the 'golden age' of Nazrulgeeti (c. 1930s‚Äì1970s). He recently won the West Bengal Assembly elections of 2011 on a Trinamool Congress ticket from the Uttarpara (Vidhan Sabha constituency) in Hooghly district, defeating his nearest rival by a large margin of 43,193 votes. Biography Dr. Anup Ghosal was born and brought up in a musical family. He has been a born talent whose witness the world is today. He was born to Lt. Amulya Chandra Ghosal and Lt. Labanya Ghosal. Mother Labanya had been the main source of inspiration for little Anup. She herself had a god gifted sonorous voice. Apart from Anup, his elder sisters too were good singers in their respective capacities and that made the perfect musical environment for Anup to imbibe music into his inner self. When he was 4, his mother arranged for his musical training. She understood that she had given birth to a musical maestro. His first performance took place at 4¬Ω, when he sang for a children's programme, Shishu Mahal from All India Radio, Kolkata. Dr. Ghosal's music lessons which began from the age of four continued till he was about 26 yrs of age. During his entire learning years he became a master of Thumri, Kheyal, Bhajan, Ragpradhan, Rabindra Sangeet, Nazrulgeeti, Dwijendrageeti, Rajnikanter Gaan, modern Bengali songs and several other folks songs. He received his music lessons from various esteemed 'Gurus'. Among them was late Sangeetacharya Sukhendu Goswami, the famous music maestro of Bengal. He learnt Rabindra Sangeet from the legendary Debabrata Biswas and learnt different Bengali songs from Manindra Chakraborty. Apart from musical learnings he did his graduation in humanities from Asutosh College, Kolkata. He did his Masters as well as Ph. D from Rabindra Bharati University. His thesis was entitled \\"Nazrulgeeti - Roop O Rashanabhuti\\". During his school and college days, Anup took part in many reputed music competitions (All India) where he secured highest marks in different classical, light classical, Bengali songs (traditional and modern), Rabindra Sangeet and folk songs. Anup stood first in 'Sangeet Bharati Degree Examination' (classical music) in the year 1966-67 and was awarded a gold medal. He is a National Scholar, selected in 1966-67 (securing highest position in classical music). Anup's first venture into movies as a playback singer was at the age of 19 yrs, when he sang for the movie of all times, ' Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne ', by the legendary Satyajit Ray. His association with Ray continued which made him the rightful recipient of National Award in 1981 for 'Hirak Rajar Deshe'. He has sung for various Bengali as well as Hindi movies, and also in Bhojpuri and Assamese. Dr. Ghosal has visited UK, USA, Canada, Germany for various musical concerts. He has been equally appreciated in the countries abroad as has been in India. He still visits the Western countries to promote Indian Musical Culture with special reference to Bengali songs along with folk songs of Bengal. Anup Ghosal has also written an authoritative book on Indian Music, \\"Ganer Bhubane\\". He believes that music is universal and is the best unifying force. Researchers have proved that tribal music in India, from east to west and from north to south, is basically the same, only the notes have changed slightly due to different dictions. There is a lot of similarity between the Russian folk songs and the Bengali Bhatiyali songs. He believes that the future of Indian classical music is bright. Anup Ghosal has been elected as one of the members of the West Bengal Legislative Assembly from Uttarpara Constituency (Hoogly 185) as a candidate of All India Trinamool Congress headed by Ms. Mamata Banerjee in 2011. Accolades and awards Ghoshal has been offered Honorary Citizen of Chicago in 1994 by Mayor Richard M.

The Roman army was initially deployed against the oppidum of Segeda, whose Celtiberian inhabitants, the Belli, had been expanding its walls and attacking other nearby tribes.

Swanton, The Lives of Two Offas (Crediton, 2006), pp. xxx-xxxi The earliest editor, William Wats, argues that the texts are older than Matthew's day but were revised by him; he bases this view on stylistic elements, such as the inclusion in the first Vita of a quotation from Lucan (Pharsalia I. 92‚Äì3) which also appears repeatedly in Matthew's Chronica maiora. Account The text concerns two kings, King Offa of the Angles, a fourth or fifth-century ancestor figure of the Mercians, and King Offa of Mercia (r. 757-796), through whose lives the text recounts the foundation of St Alban's Abbey: Offa of Angel made the vow to found a monastery, while several centuries later, his namesake Offa of Mercia executed this plan on discovering the relics of the British martyr king St Alban and built St Alban's Abbey. Although some historical elements are interwoven into the story, Matthew had little reliable information to go on and much of the narrative is therefore fictitious. Of particular interest is that it features the oldest surviving account of the \\"Constance\\" tale-type.Margaret Schlauch, Chaucer's Constance and Accused Queens, New York: Gordian Press 1969 p 64 The king of York tries to marry his daughter; when she refuses, she is abandoned in the woods, where Offa finds her, and he marries her, but later, when he is at war, through a forged letter, she is again abandoned in the woods with her children, and she, Offa, and the children are reunited many years later.Laura A. Hibbard, Medieval Romance in England pp 23-4 New York Burt Franklin,1963 This tale was particular popular in chivalric romance such as The Man of Law's Tale and Emar√© in England.Laura A. Hibbard, Medieval Romance in England p24-5 New York Burt Franklin,1963 Twenty variants are known, including those in French, Latin, German, and Spanish.Margaret Schlauch, Chaucer's Constance and Accused Queens, New York: Gordian Press 1969 p 69 It has been suggested that it is related to the story of Offa and his queen in Beowulf, but Beowulf does not contain sufficient information concerning her to identify her with this tale type; Drida is described as coming to him over water because of her father, but that could mean that she was sent by him, not that she fled him.Margaret Schlauch, Chaucer's Constance and Accused Queens, New York: Gordian Press 1969 p 67 The story contains many fairy tales motifs: the heroine forced to flee an incestuous marriage,Margaret Schlauch, Chaucer's Constance and Accused Queens, New York: Gordian Press 1969 p 36 such as The She-Bear, Allerleirauh, Donkeyskin, and The King who Wished to Marry His Daughter; a strange woman found by the king, who marries her, but who is then forced into exile with her children owing to substituted letters,Margaret Schlauch, Chaucer's Constance and Accused Queens, New York: Gordian Press 1969 p 26 such as The Girl Without Hands and The Armless Maiden; or a fairy tale featuring both elements, as in Penta of the Chopped-off Hands.

The corporation nominated hold and manage (as trustee) or manage (as agent) before native title determination and registration, is called a Prescribed Body Corporate (PBC).

Once both the native title determination has been made and the court has determined that the nominated corporation is to be the PBC, it is registered by the National Native Title Tribunal (NNTT) as required by the Native Title Act 1993, and becomes known as a Registered Native Title Body Corporate (RNTBC) (ss 193(2)(e) and 253 NTA).

In some instances, native title claim groups will create a new organisation whose sole purpose is to act as an RNTBC. Alternatively, they may nominate an existing corporation to become the RNTBC as long as it is already incorporated under the CATSI Act and complies with the provisions of the NTA. Importantly, it must have, among its purposes, the purpose of becoming an RNTBC. Where native title groups have received financial settlements, RNTBCs may become part of a corporate structure which can include charitable trusts, companies, and other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations, each of which may perform different or similar functions to achieve the objectives of the native title group and some of which may be incorporated under the Commonwealth Corporations Act 2001, which applies to the broader Australian community. The kind of bodies that can be determined as PBCs (and therefore registered as RNTBCs) and their functions are set out in the Native Title Act 1993 and Native Title (Prescribed Bodies Corporate) Regulations 1999. Other types of Indigenous bodies Some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations are not RNTBCs (often referred to as \\"native title corporations\\" or \\"traditional owner corporations\\"), but may have generated native title outcomes without having a native title determination. This can occur in different ways, including under other legislation, such as the Victorian Traditional Owner Settlement Act 2010, through native title settlements such as the comprehensive South-West Native Title Settlement for Noongar people in Western Australia, and through native title claimant groups entering into Indigenous Land Use Agreements (ILUAs). Statutory requirements Statutory differences between PBCs and other corporations: * RNTBCs and PBCs are special types of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations because they are created especially for common law native title holders to hold or manage native title. * PBCs must have the words \\"registered native title body corporat\\" or \\"RNTBC\\" in their name, and must be registered with the Office of the Registrar of Indigenous Corporations (ORIC) as required by the Native Title Act (NTA), while other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations can choose to register under other state or territory associations law or under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). * PBCs have obligations under the NTA such as the requirement to consult with and obtain consent from native title holders in relation to any decisions which surrender or affect native title rights and interests. * If an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation becomes or ceases to be a PBC (RNTBC), it must notify ORIC within 28 days. * PBC directors and officers are protected from a range of criminal and civil penalties for breach of duties as long as they have acted in good faith in complying with obligations under native title legislation (excluding the duty to not trade while insolvent). * PBCs are not required to value their native title rights and interests as part of their assets, for the purpose of determining their size classification under CATSI. * PBCs must ensure that their constitution is consistent with native title legislation. * ORIC must not change the PBC‚Äôs constitution on the basis of an act done in good faith and with the belief that the corporation or its officers are complying with native title legislation. * ORIC is not able to de-register a PBC as long as it remains a PBC and manages or holds native title interests.

Cromemco's Dazzler (or TV DAZZLER) was a graphics card for S-100 bus computers. Released in 1976,Les Solomon, \\"Solomon's Memory\\" , in Digital Deli, Workman Publications, 1984, it is the first commercial color bit-mapped graphics card available for microcomputers.Harry Garland, \\"Ten years and counting\\", Creative Computing, Volume 10, Number 11 (November 1984), pg. 104 Multiple Dazzler cards could be installed in a single machine and synced together, a feature which could, with minor modification, be used to genlock. Genlocked Dazzler cards drove ColorGraphics Weather Systems displays that generated most of the weather imagery seen on US television in the early 1980s.\\"WeatherCentral History\\" , boasts that, by 1982, 70% of the top 50 TV markets in the U.S. used CWS History The Dazzler came about in a roundabout fashion after Les Solomon, an editor for Popular Electronics magazine, demonstrated the original Altair 8800 to Roger Melen of Stanford University. After seeing it, Melen purchased Altair #2 for his friend Harry Garland to work with. The two built a number of add-ons for the machine, starting with an early video digitizer called the Cyclops and then moving on to the prototype Dazzler. The Dazzler was first introduced at the Homebrew Computer Club on November 12, 1975. Like many early microcomputer projects of the era, the Dazzler was originally announced as a self-built kit in Popular Electronics. In order to \\"kick start\\" construction, they offered kits including a circuit board and the required parts, which the user would then assemble on their own. This led to sales of completely assembled Dazzler systems, which became the only way to purchase the product some time after. Sales were so fruitful that Melen and Garland formed Cromemco to sell the Dazzler and their other Altair add-ons, selecting a name based on Crothers Memorial Hall, their residence while attending Stanford. When Federico Faggin's new company - Zilog - introduced the Z80, Cromemco branched out into their own line of Z80-based S-100 compatible computers almost immediately. Over time these became the company's primary products. Combinations of their rackmount machines and the Dazzler formed the basis of ColorGraphics Weather Systems (CWS) product line into the late 1980s, and when CWS was purchased by Dynatech in 1987, Dynatech also purchased Cromemco to supply them. Dazzler software Early Dazzler Software The original advertisement for the Dazzler offered three different software programs for sale (provided on punched paper tape.) These were Conway's Game of Life, Dazzlewriter (an alphanumeric display) and a colorful pattern- generating program, Kaleidoscope. The cover of the June 1976 issue of Byte magazine shows a Dazzler image from Conway's Game of Life, and credits Ed Hall as author of the Life software for the Dazzler. Byte also credits Steve Dompier with authoring the animation tool \\"Dazzlemation\\" and the first animation made with Dazzlemation called \\"Magenta Martini\\". George Tate (who later co-founded Ashton-Tate) is credited with a Tic-Tac-Toe game for the Dazzler, and Li-Chen Wang is credited as the author of \\"Kaleidoscope\\". Stan Veit, owner of the Computer Mart of New York, described the reaction when he displayed the changing patterns of Kaleidoscope on a color television in his store window at the corner of 5th Avenue and 32nd Street in New York City in early 1976. ‚ÄúPeople driving by began to stop and look ‚Äì they had never seen anything like it before. In a short time the Dazzler had caused a traffic jam on 5th Avenue!‚Äù The police had to contact the building landlord and make him disconnect the television. Over time, Cromemco introduced additional software for the Dazzler, at first on paper tape and later floppy disk, including Spacewar! in October 1976.Cromemco Inc., \\"Spacewar\\", 1976 Cromemco customers also developed software for a wide range of graphics applications, from monitoring the manufacturing processes at a coffee factory in Columbia to displaying real-time images of heart blood flow, generated through cardiac radionuclide imaging, in Scotland. Dazzler hardware Picture of Cromemco Dazzler (Board 1). First Microcomputer Color Graphics Interface. The Dazzler used over 70 MOS and TTL ICs, which required two cards to hold all the chips,Manual, pg. 3 \\"Board 1\\" held the analog circuits, while \\"Board 2\\" held the bus interface and digital logic. The two cards were connected together with a 16-conductor ribbon cable. Although the analog card did not talk on the bus, it would normally be plugged into the bus for power connections and physical support within the chassis. The manual also described a way to \\"piggyback\\" the two cards with a separate power cable to save a slot. Output from the analog card was composite color, and an RF modulator was available for direct connection to a color TV. The Dazzler lacked its own frame buffer, accessing the host machine's main memory using a custom DMA controller that provided 1 Mbit/s throughput.Manual, pg. 4 The card read data from the computer at speeds that demanded the use of SRAM memory, as opposed to lower cost DRAMs. Control signals and setup was sent and received using the S-100 bus's input/output \\"ports\\", normally mapped to 0E and 0F. 0E contained an 8-bit address pointing to the base of the frame buffer in main memory, while 0F was a bit-mapped control register with various setup information. The Dazzler supported four graphics modes in total, selected by setting or clearing bits in the control register (0F) that controlled two orthogonal selections. The first selected the size of the frame buffer, either 512 bytes or 2 kB. The other selected normal or \\"X4\\" mode, the former using 4-bit nybbles packed 2 to a byte in the frame buffer to produce an 8-color image, or the latter which was a higher resolution monochrome mode using 1-bits per pixel, 8 to a byte. Selecting the mode indirectly selected the resolution. In normal mode with a 512 byte buffer there would be 512 bytes √ó 2 pixels per byte = 1,024 pixels, arranged as a 32 by 32 pixel image. A 2 kB buffer produced a 64 by 64 pixel image, while the highest resolution used a 2 kB buffer in X4 mode to produce a 128 by 128 pixel image.Manual, pg. 6 In normal mode the color was selected from a fixed 8-color palette with an additional bit selecting intensity, while in X4 mode the foreground color was selected by setting three bits in the control register to turn on red, green or blue (or combinations) while a separate bit controlled the intensity. Super Dazzler Cromemco CS-2 microcomputer with Super Dazzler in television broadcast control room. In 1979, Cromemco replaced the original Dazzler with the Super Dazzler. The Super Dazzler Interface (SDI) had 756 x 484 pixel resolution with the capability to display up to 4096 colors. Dedicated two-port memory cards were used for image storage for higher performance. While the original Dazzler had a composite video output signal, the new SDI used separate RGB component video outputs for higher resolution. The SDI also had the ability to be synchronized to other video equipment. Cromemco systems with the SDI board became the systems of choice for television broadcast applications, and were widely deployed by the United States Air Force as Mission Support Systems.

It is also the state animal of Manipur. Its common English name is Manipur brow-antlered deer or Eld's deer and the scientific name is Rucervus eldii eldii. Its original natural habitat is the floating marshy grasslands of the Keibul Lamjao National Park, located in the southern parts of the Loktak Lake, which is the largest freshwater lake in eastern India. The film The Return of Sangai (Manipuri Film: Sangai Hallakpa ) made by the Manipur Forest Departmenthttp://theindia.info/TheReturnOfSangai gives a deep insight of Sangai and Keibul Lamjao National Park  Distribution and habitat  The brow-antlered deer or the dancing deer is found in its natural habitat only at Keibul Lamjao National Park over the floating biomass locally called \\"phumdi\\" in the south eastern part of Loktak Lake. It is located between 24¬∞27‚Äô N and 24¬∞31‚Äô N latitude and 93¬∞53‚Äô E and 93¬∞55‚Äô E longitudes. The park covers an area of 40 km2 and the home range of the deer in the park is confined to 15‚Äì20 km2. Phumdi is the most important and unique part of the habitat. It is the floating mass of vegetation formed by the accumulation of organic debris and biomass with soil. Its thickness varies from few centimeter to two meters. The humus of phumdi is black in color and very spongy with large number of pores. It floats with 4/5 part under water. The number of deer listed in the Red Data Book was only 14 in 1975. After the declaration of the area as a national park and with strict conservation measures taken up by the Forest Department, the fear of its extinction has been greatly reduced.  Biology and behavior  The brow-antlered deer is a medium-sized deer, with uniquely distinctive antlers, measuring 100‚Äì110 cm. in length with extremely long brow tine, which form the main beam. The two tines form a continuous curve at right angles to the closely set pedicels. This signifies its name, brow-antlered deer, the forward protruding beam appears to come out from the eyebrow. The antlers of the opposite sides are unsymmetrical with respect to each other. The beams are unbranched initially whereas curvature increases as length increases and they get forked also. The sexes are moderately dimorphic in body size and weight. The height and weight of a fully grown stag may be approximately 115‚Äì125 cm at shoulder and 95 to 110 kg (210 to 230 lb) respectively. The height and weight of the female are shorter and less as compared to the male counterpart. The length of the body from the base to the ear up to the tail is about 145 to 155 cm in both sexes. The tail is short and rump patch is not pronounced. Sangai (Rucervus eldii eldii) Sangai feed on a variety of water living plants, grasses, herbaceous plants, and shoots. Zizania latifolia, Saccharum munja, S. bengalensis, Erianthus procerus, E. ravernnae, etc. are the favorite food plants of sangai. Feeding behavior of sangai can be easily seen over new shoots on freshly cut fire line area. It exhibits a bimodial activity pattern. Sangai starts grazing usually early morning approximately 4:30 am and generally continue up to 8:00 am. On cloudy morning the period may extend to 10:00 am. In the evening it starts at 3:00 pm and continue up to 6:00 pm. After feeding it takes rest. During day time it rests under thick and tall reeds and grasses. At night some of them even rest on the hillocks. The sangai has a maximum lifespan in the wild of around 10 years.Thamin or Brow-antlered Deer Cervus eldi Rutting takes place in the early spring months between February and May. Males compete with each other to gain control of a harem of females that they can then mate with. After a 220- to 240-day-long gestation period, normally a single calf is born. The young are spotted at birth; these spots fade as the animal grows. The young are weaned at 7 months of age, and becomes sexually mature from 18 months of age onwards.  Sangai in Manipur society  Sangai male with newborn fawn Culturally, the sangai finds itself imbedded deep into the legends and folklore of the Manipuris. Based on a popular folk legend, the sangai is interpreted as the binding soul between humans and the nature. The slaying of the sangai, an unpardonable sin, is conceived as the rude breaking up of the cordial relationship between humans and the nature. When humans love and respect the sangai, it is respecting nature. In the sangai, therefore, humans find a way of expressing their love for the nature. Socially, the sangai is the symbol of a prized possession of the state. It is believed that the name sangai (sa \\"animal\\" and ngai \\"in awaiting\\") was coined from its peculiar posture and behaviour while running. By nature, the deer, particularly the males, even when running for its life stops occasionally and looks back as if he is waiting for someone and hence the name. According to a Manipuri folklore, a legendary hero Kadeng Thangjahanba of Moirang once captured a gravid sangai from Torbung Lamjao for a gift to his beloved Tonu Laijinglembi during an animal hunting expedition. However, as fate would have it, he found his beloved married to the king on his return. The heartbroken hero released the deer free in the wild of Keibul Lamjao. From that time onwards the place became the home of sangai. In another folklore of Manipur, a prince called Pudangkoi of Luwang clan had, by the grace of a divine entity, transformed himself into a deer which has later on called sangai. Further, there were references of sangai head with crown of antlers, being decorated on the head of royal boat called Hiyang Hiren. Identified as one of the rarest animal species in the entire world, the sangai is the apple of the eye for the people. Talk of Manipur, and one of the first things to introduce the state is the sangai, other than polo, its classical dance, sports and films.  Danger of extinction  The sangai was believed to be almost extinct by 1950. However, in 1953 six heads of the sangai were found hovering at its natural habitat. Since then, the State Government has taken serious and positive measures for the protection of this rare and endangered species. The number of endangered deer sangai found in Manipur has increased from 204 in 2013 to 260, according to the latest census conducted in March 2016 jointly by Wildfire Wing, Forest department, State government, Manipur University and Wildfire Institute of India. The sangai faces a two-pronged danger to its life. Firstly, its habitat is steadily degenerating by reason of continuous inundation and flooding by high water caused as the result of artificial reservoir of the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation Loktak. Secondly, poachers are out there to trap and slay the deer at the slightest opportunity. In 1983 the 103 megawatt capacity National Hydroelectric Power Corporation Loktak was commissioned with the objective of ensuring rapid development in the State. A maximum high water level of above mean sea level (MSL)is maintained in the Loktak Lake to feed the reservoir for the hydel project. This high water level had wreaked havoc in the Keibul Lamjao National Park. The high water level, maintained continuously through the year, had disturbed the natural life cycle of the vegetation growth, the phumdi, upon which the sangai thrives. The deer feed on several types of vegetation that grow on the phumdi. The vegetation also provides shelter to the deer and other wildlife in the park. The life-cycle of the phumdi involves floating on the water surface during season of high water as in the monsoons. In the lean season, when the water level reduces, the biomass come into contact with the lake bed and they secure the required nutrient from there. When the rains come again and they become afloat, the biomass have enough 'food'‚Äîthe nutrients‚Äîstored in their roots and their life continues. What is happening now, according to local scientists who are studying the phenomena, is that with continuous high water in the lake throughout the year much of this process of 'feeding' on the nutrient in the lakebed had discontinued. The result‚Äîthe biomass are losing weight and getting thinner by the year. Around January last week in 1999, it was reported that a large chunk of the biomass in the northern part of National Park had broken up into pieces and had drifted freely from the park area. This was a bad sign for the sangai habitat. It spelled out very clearly that the beginning of the end of the sangai habitat had begun. There are reports of local people cutting up the phumdi into sizable pieces and then towing away these with dugout canoe for 'selling' to fish culture owners. This is another potential danger to the sangai habitat. It meant humans are now aiding the process of annihilating the habitat area, supplementing to the rapid degeneration of the habitat.

He made a winning debut for him in a Novices' Hurdle in October 1997 and followed that up with another victory at Cheltenham in November. He had mixed fortunes in his next 3 starts, of which he won one, was runner up in one and fell in the other. But he bounced back to the Lanzarote Hurdle at Kempton in January 1999. Following that win, he was sent off 6/4 favourite for the Tote Gold Trophy, but disappointed by finishing 6th, which he followed by filling the same position in the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham, behind Istabraq. In his final of the season, he was sent off the favourite for the Welsh Champion Hurdle, but could only finish 2nd.

Coppertone is headquartered in Whippany, New Jersey. Coppertone uses a variety of branding, including the Coppertone girl logo and a distinctive fragrance. One of the few remaining ads in existence, on the side of a building in Miami Product line The original product dates to 1944, when pharmacist Benjamin Green invented a lotion to darken tans. The product line has been expanded to include many skin care products, predominantly sunscreens. Coppertone has become the leading sun care brand in the United States, with annual $9 billion in global sales.  Branding  A variety of kinds of branding are used to identify various Coppertone products = Coppertone name = The name Coppertone originated from its marketing of suntan lotion. = Coppertone girl = The company became famous in 1953 when it introduced the Coppertone girl, an advertisement showing a young blonde girl in pigtails staring in surprise as a Cocker Spaniel puppy sneaks up behind her and pulls down her blue swimsuit bottom, revealing her bottom to have a lighter tone than the rest of her body. The logo has been redrawn many times to meet varying branding objectives. Early versions show the girl wearing only petite swimsuit bottoms and flowers in her pigtails. At the turn of the 21st century, Coppertone revised drawings of the Coppertone Girl so that they would be less revealing and show no tan lines. Some recent versions show only the girl's lower back, as opposed to her bottom, or wearing a T-shirt, a hat, and holding a bottle of Coppertone while the puppy is shown pulling on her shorts.  Logo history  The original Coppertone logo was the profile of an Indian chief. In 1953 Tally Embry Advertising in Florida was hired, and their ad men created the concept of the little girl and the pup. An artist named Joyce Ballantyne Brand re-drew the little girl in 1959 when the original artwork was destroyed in a fire. She was then working for Grant Advertising in New York.  Coppertone sign  A series of mechanical billboards were constructed across the United States, whereon the motorized dog and swimsuit bottoms rocked up and down perpetually. Though most of them are long since gone or have stopped moving, one such billboard of the then Coppertone Girl still stands in Miami Beach -- dog, pigtails, swimsuit, bottom, and all. Live models When Joyce Ballantyne Brand redrew the logo in 1959, she purportedly used her daughter, Cheri, as her model, and her drawing closely resembled the original artwork. Sometime around 1965, Jodie Foster made her acting debut as the Coppertone girl in a television commercial, when she was three years old. In 1993, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Coppertone girl, a contest was held at Disney's Polynesian Hotel in Orlando Florida to find \\"The Coppertone Girl\\", since Cheri Brand had grown up by then. The contest was hosted by Regis Philbin along with Cheri as one of the judges. The winner was picked based on the contestant's maturity, congeniality, eloquence, confidence, and how well she resembled the cartoon. The winner was four-year-old Alexis Durgee. She was chosen out of over 100,000 models and twenty remaining finalists. Afterwards she appeared on Sally Jessy Raphael Show with Cheri Brand and Dalton Orband, the winning Coppertone Boy. Alexis went on to model for Coppertone and Water Babies advertisements through the following year and was shot in several Coppertone commercials. =Fragrances= Many Coppertone products share a distinctive fragrance. Chandler Burr described it as \\"arguably the single greatest work of scent branding ever.\\" A researcher on human memory used it as an example of an odor that evokes memories. Besides for the classic fragrance, the Coppertone product line has expanded to include other scents. = Slogans = Accompanying early Coppertone girl ads was the impish slogan, \\"Don't be a paleface!\\" Advertising campaign for Coppertone in France (1973) Another tagline was \\"Tan, don't burn.\\". This slogan was adapted to the French market in the 1973 advertising campaign \\"Bronzez vite et sans danger\\" featuring a close-up of the top of a bathing suit worn, this time, by a grown-up woman (Moors & Warot advertising agency).

Eckhart came into prominence during the Avignon Papacy at a time of increased tensions between monastic orders, diocesan clergy, the Franciscan Order, and Eckhart's Dominican Order of Preachers. In later life, he was accused of heresy and brought up before the local Franciscan-led Inquisition, and tried as a heretic by Pope John XXII. He seems to have died before his verdict was received. He was well known for his work with pious lay groups such as the Friends of God and was succeeded by his more circumspect disciples John Tauler and Henry Suso. Since the 19th century, he has received renewed attention. He has acquired a status as a great mystic within contemporary popular spirituality, as well as considerable interest from scholars situating him within the medieval scholastic and philosophical tradition. Biography Eckhart was probably born in the village of Tambach, near Gotha, in the Landgraviate of Thuringia,Bernard McGinn, The Mystical Thought of Meister Eckhart, (New York: Crossroad Publishing Company, 2001), p.2, points out that previous scholarship which had placed Eckhart's birth in Hochheim is incorrect: Hochheim is used in the sources to indicate Eckhart's family name, not his birthplace. perhaps between 1250 and 1260.Walter Senner, ‚ÄòMeister Eckhart‚Äôs Life, Training, Career, and Trial‚Äô in Jeremiah Hackett (ed.), A Companion to Meister Eckhart (Leiden: Brill, 2012), 7‚Äì84. It was previously asserted that he was born to a noble family of landowners, but this originated in a misinterpretation of the archives of the period.Meister Eckhart, The Essential Sermons, Commentaries, Treatises and Defense, trans. and ed. by Bernard McGinn and Edmund Colledge, New York: Paulist Press, 1981, p.5. In reality, little is known about his family and early life. There is no authority for giving him the Christian name of Johannes, which sometimes appears in biographical sketches: his Christian name was Eckhart; his surname was von Hochheim. =Church career= Predigerkirche Eckhart joined the Dominicans at Erfurt, probably when he was about eighteen, and it is assumed he studied at Cologne.This supposition is founded on Eckhart‚Äôs frequent citation, with respect, of Albert the Great, who had taught at Cologne until his death in 1280, and more particularly, his statement in his 1294 Easter Sermon that \\"Albert often used to say: 'This I know, as we know things, for we all know very little. (Bernard McGinn, The Mystical Thought of Meister Eckhart (New York: Crossroad Publishing Company, 2001), p.2.) He may have also studied at the University of Paris, either before or after his time in Cologne.The evidence for Eckhart's studies in Cologne is similarly circumstantial as recounted in Meister Eckhart, The Essential Sermons, Commentaries, Treatises and Defense, trans. and ed. by Bernard McGinn and Edmund Colledge, New York: Paulist Press, 1981, p.7. The first solid evidence we have for his life is when on 18 April 1294, as a baccalaureus (lecturer) on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, a post to which he had presumably been appointed in 1293, he preached the Easter Sermon (the Sermo Paschalis) at the Dominican convent of St. Jacques in Paris. In late 1294, Eckhart was made Prior at Erfurt and Provincial of Thuringia. His earliest vernacular work, Reden der Unterweisung (The Talks of Instructions/Counsels on Discernment), a series of talks delivered to Dominican novices, dates from this time (c. 1295‚Äì1298).McGinn, Eckhart, p.4 In 1302, he was sent to Paris to take up the external Dominican chair of theology. He remained there until 1303. The short Parisian Questions date from this time.The Parisian Questions were first discovered in 1927. They are translated with an introduction in Armand Maurer, ed., Master Eckhart: Parisian Questions and Prologues, (Toronto: Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies, 1974). In late 1303 Eckhart returned to Erfurt, and was made Provincial for Saxony, a province which reached at that time from the Netherlands to Livonia. He therefore had responsibility for forty-seven convents in this region. Complaints made against him and the provincial of Teutonia at the general chapter held in Paris in 1306, concerning irregularities among the ternaries, must have been trivial, because the general, Aymeric of Piacenza, appointed him in the following year his vicar- general for Bohemia with full power to set the demoralized monasteries there in order. Eckhart was Provincial for Saxony until 1311, during which time he founded three convents for women there.On the possible dating of the works written in this period, see McGinn, Eckhart, pp.5‚Äì9. On 14 May 1311 Eckhart was appointed by the general chapter held at Naples as teacher at Paris. To be invited back to Paris for a second stint as magister was a rare privilege, previously granted only to Thomas Aquinas.McGinn, Eckhart, p.9 Eckhart stayed in Paris for two academic years, until the summer of 1313, living in the same house as William of Paris. Then follows a long period of which it is known only that he spent part of the time at Strasbourg.cf. Urkundenbuch der Stadt Strassburg, iii. 236. It is unclear what specific office he held there: he seems chiefly to have been concerned with spiritual direction and with preaching in convents of Dominicans.Meister Eckhart, The Essential Sermons, Commentaries, Treatises and Defense, trans. and ed. by Bernard McGinn and Edmund Colledge, New York: Paulist Press, 1981, p.10. A passage in a chronicle of the year 1320, extant in manuscript (cf. Wilhelm Preger, i. 352‚Äì399), speaks of a prior Eckhart at Frankfurt who was suspected of heresy, and some have referred this to Meister Eckhart. It is unusual that a man under suspicion of heresy would have been appointed teacher in one of the most famous schools of the order, but Eckhart's distinctive expository style could well have already been under scrutiny by his Franciscan detractors. =Accusation of heresy= The Meister Eckhart portal of the Erfurt Church The Meister Eckhart portal of the Erfurt Church, quoting John 1:5 In late 1323 or early 1324, Eckhart left Strasbourg for the Dominican house at Cologne. It is not clear exactly what he did here, though part of his time may have been spent teaching at the prestigious Studium in the city. Eckhart also continued to preach, addressing his sermons during a time of disarray among the clergy and monastic orders, rapid growth of numerous pious lay groups, and the Inquisition's continuing concerns over heretical movements throughout Europe. It appears that some of the Dominican authorities already had concerns about Eckhart's teaching. The Dominican General Chapter held in Venice in the spring of 1325 had spoken out against \\"friars in Teutonia who say things in their sermons that can easily lead simple and uneducated people into error\\".McGinn, Eckhart, (2001), p.14 This concern (or perhaps concerns held by the archbishop of Cologne, Henry of Virneburg) may have been why Nicholas of Strasbourg, to whom the pope had in 1325 given the temporary charge of the Dominican friaries in Germany, conducted an investigation of Eckhart's orthodoxy. Nicholas presented a list of suspect passages from the Book of Consolation to Eckhart, who responded sometime between August 1325 and January 1326 with a lost treatise Requisitus, which satisfied his immediate superiors of his orthodoxy. Despite this assurance, however, the archbishop in 1326 ordered an inquisitorial process.cf. the document in Preger, i. 471; more accurately in ALKG, ii. 627 sqq. At this point he issued a Vindicatory Document, providing chapter and verse of what he had been taught.In the early twentieth century, the suspicion of Eckhart was often put down to tensions between Dominicans and Franciscans. This narrative, however, has been replaced by one which emphasises the broader context of fears concerning the Heresy of the Free Spirit. See Bernard McGinn, The Harvest of Mysticism, (2005), p.103. Throughout the difficult months of late 1326, Eckhart had the full support of the local Dominican authorities, as evident in Nicholas of Strasbourg's three official protests against the actions of the inquisitors in January 1327.McGinn, Eckhart, (2001), p.17 On 13 February 1327, before the archbishop's inquisitors pronounced their sentence on Eckhart, Eckhart preached a sermon in the Dominican church at Cologne, and then had his secretary read out a public protestation of his innocence. He stated in his protest that he had always detested everything wrong, and should anything of the kind be found in his writings, he now retracts. Eckhart himself translated the text into German, so that his audience, the vernacular public, could understand it. The verdict then seems to have gone against Eckhart. Eckhart denied competence and authority to the inquisitors and the archbishop, and appealed to the Pope against the verdict. He then, in the spring of 1327, set off for Avignon. In Avignon, Pope John XXII seems to have set up two tribunals to inquire into the case, one of theologians and the other of cardinals. Evidence of this process is thin. However, it is known that the commissions reduced the 150 suspect articles down to 28; the document known as the Votum Avenionense gives, in scholastic fashion, the twenty-eight articles, Eckhart's defence of each, and the rebuttal of the commissioners. On 30 April 1328, the pope wrote to Archbishop Henry of Virneburg that the case against Eckhart was moving ahead, but added that Eckhart had already died (modern scholarship suggests he may have died on 28 January 1328).The general assumption in modern scholarship on Eckhart has been that the date of Eckhart's death is lost. McGinn, Eckhart, (2001), p.17, however, trusts the argument of Walter Senner that a seventeenth-century Dominican source noted that Eckhart was remembered in German convents on 28 January ‚Äì suggesting this day in 1328 was the date of his death. Some early twentieth-century writers suggested Eckhart may have not in fact died, but continued his ministry in anonymity, but there is no single medieval source that supports this suspicion. The papal commission eventually confirmed (albeit in modified form) the decision of the Cologne commission against Eckhart. Pope John XXII issued a bull (In agro dominico), 27 March 1329, in which a series of statements from Eckhart is characterized as heretical, another as suspected of heresy.The bull is given complete in ALKG, ii. 636‚Äì640). At the close, it is stated that Eckhart recanted before his death everything which he had falsely taught, by subjecting himself and his writing to the decision of the Apostolic See. It is possible that the Pope's unusual decision to issue the bull, despite the death of Eckhart (and the fact that Eckhart was not being personally condemned as a heretic), was due to the pope's fear of the growing problem of mystical heresy, and pressure from his ally Henry II to bring the case to a definite conclusion.McGinn, Eckhart, (2001), p.18. =Rehabilitation= Eckhart's status in the contemporary Catholic Church has been uncertain. The Dominican Order pressed in the last decade of the 20th century for his full rehabilitation and confirmation of his theological orthodoxy. Pope John Paul II voiced favorable opinion on this initiative, even going as far as quoting from Eckhart's writings, but the outcome was confined to the corridors of the Vatican. In the spring of 2010, it was revealed that there had been a response from the Vatican in a letter dated 1992. Timothy Radcliffe, then Master of the Dominicans and recipient of the letter, summarized the contents as follows: Professor Winfried Trusen of W√ºrzburg, a correspondent of Radcliffe, wrote in a defence of Eckhart to Cardinal Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI), stating: Influences Eckhart was schooled in medieval scholasticism and was well-acquainted with Aristotelianism, Augustinianism, and Neo-Platonism. Teachings =Sermons= Although he was an accomplished academic theologian, Eckhart's best-remembered works are his highly unusual sermons in the vernacular. Eckhart as a preaching friar attempted to guide his flock, as well as monks and nuns under his jurisdiction, with practical sermons on spiritual/psychological transformation and New Testament metaphorical content related to the creative power inherent in disinterest (dispassion or detachment). The central theme of Eckhart's German sermons is the presence of God in the individual soul, and the dignity of the soul of the just man. Although he elaborated on this theme, he rarely departed from it. In one sermon, Eckhart gives the following summary of his message: As Eckhart said in his trial defence, his sermons were meant to inspire in listeners the desire above all to do some good. In this, he frequently used unusual language or seemed to stray from the path of orthodoxy, which made him suspect to the Church during the tense years of the Avignon Papacy. =Theology= In Eckhart's vision, God is primarily fecund. Out of overabundance of love the fertile God gives birth to the Son, the Word in all of us. Clearly, this is rooted in the Neoplatonic notion of \\"ebullience; boiling over\\" of the One that cannot hold back its abundance of Being. Eckhart had imagined the creation not as a \\"compulsory\\" overflowing (a metaphor based on a common hydrodynamic picture), but as the free act of will of the triune nature of Deity (refer Trinitarianism). Another bold assertion is Eckhart's distinction between God and Godhead (Gottheit in German, meaning Godhood or Godhead, state of being God). These notions had been present in Pseudo-Dionysius's writings and John the Scot's De divisione naturae, but Eckhart, with characteristic vigor and audacity, reshaped the germinal metaphors into profound images of polarity between the Unmanifest and Manifest Absolute. =Contemplative method= John Orme Mills notes that Eckhart did not \\"leave us a guide to the spiritual life like St Bonaventure‚Äôs Itinerarium ‚Äì the Journey of the Soul,\\" but that his ideas on this have to be condensed from his \\"couple of very short books on suffering and detachment\\" and sermons.John Orme Mills, Meister Eckhart and Prayer, Eckhart Society According to Mills, Eckhart's comments on prayer are only about contemplative prayer and \\"detachment.\\" Influence and study =13th century= Eckhart was one of the most influential 13th-century Christian Neoplatonists in his day, and remained widely read in the later Middle Ages.As McGinn, Eckhart, p.1, points out, about three hundred manuscripts containing Eckhart's German sermons, both authentic and pseudonymous, survive. Some early twentieth-century writers believed that Eckhart's work was forgotten by his fellow Dominicans soon after his death. In 1960, however, a manuscript (\\"in agro dominico\\") was discovered containing six hundred excerpts from Eckhart, clearly deriving from an original made in the Cologne Dominican convent after the promulgation of the bull condemning Eckhart's writings, as notations from the bull are inserted into the manuscript.Meister Eckhart, The Essential Sermons, Commentaries, Treatises and Defense, trans. and ed. by Bernard McGinn and Edmund Colledge, New York: Paulist Press, 1981, p.19. The manuscript came into the possession of the Carthusians in Basel, demonstrating that some Dominicans and Carthusians had continued to read Eckhart's work. It is also clear that Nicholas of Cusa, Archbishop of Cologne in the 1430s and 1440s, engaged in extensive study of Eckhart. He assembled, and carefully annotated, a surviving collection of Eckhart's Latin works.Meister Eckhart, The Essential Sermons, Commentaries, Treatises and Defense, trans. and ed. by Bernard McGinn and Edmund Colledge, New York: Paulist Press, 1981, p.20. As Eckhart was the only medieval theologian tried before the Inquisition as a heretic, the subsequent (1329) condemnation of excerpts from his works cast a shadow over his reputation for some, but followers of Eckhart in the lay group Friends of God existed in communities across the region and carried on his ideas under the leadership of such priests as John Tauler and Henry Suso.Christianity through the Centuries, Earle E. Cairns, Zondervan, 1996 =Johannes Tauler and Rulman Merswin= Eckhart is considered by some to have been the inspirational \\"layman\\" referred to in Johannes Tauler's and Rulman Merswin's later writings in Strasbourg where he is known to have spent time (although it is doubtful that he authored the simplistic Book of the Nine Rocks published by Merswin and attributed to the layman knight from the north). On the other hand, most scholars consider the \\"layman\\" to be a pure fiction invented by Merswin to hide his authorship because of the intimidating tactics of the Inquisition at the time. =Theologia Germanica and the Reformation= It has been suspected that his practical communication of the mystical path is behind the influential 14th- century \\"anonymous\\" Theologia Germanica, which was disseminated after his disappearance. According to the medieval introduction of the document, its author was an unnamed member of the Teutonic Order of Knights living in Frankfurt. The lack of imprimatur from the Church and anonymity of the author of the Theologia Germanica did not lessen its influence for the next two centuries ‚Äì including Martin Luther at the peak of public and clerical resistance to Catholic indulgences ‚Äì and was viewed by some historians of the early 20th century as pivotal in provoking Luther's actions and the subsequent Protestant Reformation. The following quote from the Theologia Germanica depicts the conflict between worldly and ecclesiastical affairs: =Obscurity= Eckhart was largely forgotten from the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries, barring occasional interest from thinkers such as Angelus Silesius (1627‚Äì1677).McGinn, Eckhart, p.1 For centuries, none of Eckhart's writings were known except a number of sermons, found in the old editions of Johann Tauler's sermons, published by Kachelouen (Leipzig, 1498) and by Adam Petri (Basel, 1521 and 1522). =Rediscovery= Interest in Eckhart's works was revived in the early nineteenth century, especially by German Romantics and Idealist philosophers.McGinn, Eckhart, p.1. Franz Pfeiffer's publication in 1857 of Eckhart's German sermons and treatises added greatly to this interest.This was in the second volume of his Deutsche Mystiker (Stuttgart). Pfeiffer's edition included 111 sermons and 18 treatises, as well as a number of sayings and fragments ‚Äì but many of these are now recognised to be later works falsely attributed to Eckhart. (Meister Eckhart, The Essential Sermons, Commentaries, Treatises and Defense, trans. and ed. by Bernard McGinn and Edmund Colledge, New York: Paulist Press, 1981, p.62) A second important figure in the later nineteenth century for the recovery of Eckhart's works was Heinrich Seuse Denifle, who was the first to recover Eckhart's Latin works, from 1886 onwards.Mention could also be made of Franz Jostes, Meister Eckhart und seine Junger, ungedruckte Texte zur Geschichte der deutschen Mystik (Collectanea Friburgensia, iv., Freiburg, 1895). During the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, much Catholic interest in Eckhart was concerned with the consistency of his thought in relation to Neoscholastic thought ‚Äì in other words, to see whether Eckhart's thought could be seen to be essentially in conformity with orthodoxy as represented by his fellow Dominican Thomas Aquinas.McGinn, Eckhart, p.20. =Attribution of works= Since the mid-nineteenth century scholars have questioned which of the many pieces attributed to Eckhart should be considered genuine, and whether greater weight should be given to works written in the vernacular, or Latin. Although the vernacular works survive today in over 200 manuscripts, the Latin writings are only found in a handful of manuscripts. Denifle and others have proposed that the Latin treatises, which Eckhart prepared for publication very carefully, were essential to a full understanding of Eckhart.Meister Eckhart, The Essential Sermons, Commentaries, Treatises and Defense, trans. and ed. by Bernard McGinn and Edmund Colledge, New York: Paulist Press, 1981, p.62. In 1923, Eckhart's Essential Sermons, Commentaries, Treatises and Defense (also known as the Rechtsfertigung, or Vindicatory Document) was re-published. The Defense recorded Eckhart's responses against two of the Inquisitional proceedings brought against him at Cologne, and details of the circumstances of Eckhart's trial. The excerpts in the Defense from vernacular sermons and treatises described by Eckhart as his own, served to authenticate a number of the vernacular works.Meister Eckhart, The Essential Sermons, Commentaries, Treatises and Defense, trans. and ed. by Bernard McGinn and Edmund Colledge, New York: Paulist Press, 1981, p.63. Although questions remain about the authenticity of some vernacular works, there is no dispute about the genuine character of the Latin texts presented in the critical edition.Meister Eckhart, The Essential Sermons, Commentaries, Treatises and Defense, trans. and ed. by Bernard McGinn and Edmund Colledge, New York: Paulist Press, 1981, p.64. =Eckhart as a mystic= Since the 1960s debate has been going on in Germany whether Eckhart should be called a \\"mystic\\". The philosopher Karl Albert had already argued that Eckhart had to be placed in the tradition of philosophical mysticism of Parmenides, Plato, Plotinus, Porphyry, Proclus and other neo-Platonistic thinkers. Heribert Fischer argued in the 1960s that Eckhart was a mediaeval theologian. Kurt Flasch, a member of the so-called Bochum-school of mediaeval philosophy, strongly reacted against the influence of New Age mysticism and \\"all kinds of emotional subjective mysticism\\", arguing for the need to free Eckhart from \\"the Mystical Flood\\". He sees Eckhart strictly as a philosopher. Flasch argues that the opposition between \\"mystic\\" and \\"scholastic\\" is not relevant because this mysticism (in Eckhart's context) is penetrated by the spirit of the University, in which it occurred. According to Hackett, Eckhart is to be understood as an \\"original hermeneutical thinker in the Latin tradition\\". To understand Eckhart, he has to be properly placed within the western philosophical tradition of which he was a part. Josiah Royce, an objective idealist, saw Eckhart as a representative example of 13th and 14th century Catholic mystics \\"on the verge of pronounced heresy\\" but without original philosophical opinions. Royce attributes Eckhart's reputation for originality to the fact that he translated scholastic philosophy from Latin into German, and that Eckhart wrote about his speculations in German instead of Latin. Eckhart generally followed Thomas Aquinas's doctrine of the Trinity, but Eckhart exaggerated the scholastic distinction between the divine essence and the divine persons. The very heart of Eckhart's speculative mysticism, according to Royce, is that if, through what is called in Christian terminology the procession of the Son, the divine omniscience gets a complete expression in eternal terms, still there is even at the centre of this omniscience the necessary mystery of the divine essence itself, which neither generates nor is generated, and which is yet the source and fountain of all the divine. The Trinity is, for Eckhart, the revealed God and the mysterious origin of the Trinity is the Godhead, the absolute God. Modern popularisation =Theology= Matthew Fox Matthew Fox (born 1940) is an American theologian. Formerly a priest and a member of the Dominican Order within the Roman Catholic Church, Fox was an early and influential exponent of a movement that came to be known as Creation Spirituality. The movement draws inspiration from the wisdom traditions of Christian scriptures and from the philosophies of such medieval Catholic visionaries as Hildegard of Bingen, Thomas Aquinas, Saint Francis of Assisi, Julian of Norwich, Dante Alighieri, Meister Eckhart and Nicholas of Cusa, and others. Fox has written a number of articles on Eckhart and a book titled Breakthrough: Meister Eckhart's Creation Spirituality in New Translation. =Modern philosophy= The French philosopher Jacques Derrida distinguishes Eckhart's Negative Theology from his own concept of diff√©rance although John D. Caputo in his influential The Tears and Prayers of Jacques Derrida emphasises the importance of that tradition for this thought.Derrida, J: \\"How to Avoid Speaking: Denials\\" pages 3‚Äì70, in \\"Languages of the Unsayable: The Play of Negativity in Literature and Literary Theory\\" Stanley Budick and Wolfgang Iser, eds. 1989 =Modern spirituality= Meister Eckhart has become one of the timeless heroes of modern spirituality, which thrives on an all-inclusive syncretism. This syncretism started with the colonisation of Asia, and the search of similarities between Eastern and Western religions. Western monotheism was projected onto Eastern religiosity by Western orientalists, trying to accommodate Eastern religiosity to a Western understanding, whereafter Asian intellectuals used these projections as a starting point to propose the superiority of those Eastern religions. Early on, the figure of Meister Eckhart has played a role in these developments and exchanges. Renewed academic attention to Eckhart has attracted favorable attention to his work from contemporary non-Christian mystics. Eckhart's most famous single quote, \\"The Eye with which I see God is the same Eye with which God sees me\\", is commonly cited by thinkers within neopaganism and ultimatist Buddhism as a point of contact between these traditions and Christian mysticism. Schopenhauer The first translation of Upanishads appeared in two parts in 1801 and 1802. The 19th-century philosopher Schopenhauer was influenced by the early translations of the Upanishads, which he called \\"the consolation of my life\\". Schopenhauer compared Eckhart's views to the teachings of Indian, Christian and Islamic mystics and ascetics: Schopenhauer also stated: Theosophical Society A major force in the mutual influence of Eastern and Western ideas and religiosity was the Theosophical Society, which also incorporated Eckhart in its notion of Theosophy. It searched for ancient wisdom in the East, spreading Eastern religious ideas in the West. One of its salient features was the belief in \\"Masters of Wisdom\\", \\"beings, human or once human, who have transcended the normal frontiers of knowledge, and who make their wisdom available to others\\". The Theosophical Society also spread Western ideas in the East, aiding a modernisation of Eastern traditions, and contributing to a growing nationalism in the Asian colonies. Neo-Vedanta The Theosophical Society had a major influence on Hindu reform movements. A major proponent of this \\"neo-Hinduism\\", also called \\"neo-Vedanta\\", was Vivekananda (1863‚Äì1902) who popularised his modernised interpretation of Advaita Vedanta in the 19th and early 20th century in both India and the West, emphasising anubhava (\\"personal experience\\") over scriptural authority. Vivekananda's teachings have been compared to Eckhart's teachings. In the 20th century, Eckhart's thoughts were also compared to Shankara's Advaita Vedanta by Rudolf Otto in his Mysticism East and West. According to King, the aim of this work was to redeem Eckhart's mysticism in Protestant circles, attempting \\"to establish the superiority of the German mysticism of Eckhart over the Indian mysticism of Sankara\\". Buddhist modernism The Theosophical Society also had a major influence on Buddhist modernism, and the spread of this modernised Buddhism in the West. Along with H. S. Olcott and Anagarika Dharmapala, Helena P. Blavatsky was instrumental in the Western transmission and revival of Theravada Buddhism. In 1891, Karl Eugen Neumann, who translated large parts of the Tripitaka, found parallels between Eckhart and Buddhism, which he published in Zwei buddhistische Suttas und ein Traktat Meister Eckharts (Two Buddhist Suttas and a treatise of Meister Eckhart). D.T. Suzuki, who joined the Theosophical Society Adyar and was an active Theosophist, discerned parallels between Eckhart's teachings and Zen Buddhism in his Mysticism: Christian and Buddhist, drawing similarities between Eckhart's \\"pure nothingness\\" (ein bloss nicht) and sunyata. Shizuteru Ueda, a third generation Kyoto School philosopher and scholar in medieval philosophy showed similarities between Eckhart's soteriology and Zen Buddhism in an article.Shizuteru Ueda (1989), Eckhart um zen am problem Reiner Schurmann, a Professor of Philosophy, while agreeing with Daisetz T. Suzuki that there exist certain similarities between Zen Buddhism and Meister Eckhart's teaching, also disputed Suzuki's contention that the ideas expounded in Eckhart's sermons closely approach Buddhist thought, \\"so closely indeed, that one could stamp them almost definitely as coming out of Buddhist speculations\\". Schurmann's several clarifications included: # On the question of \\"Time\\" and Eckhart's view (claimed as parallel to Buddhism in reducing awakening to instantaneity) that the birth of the Word in the ground of the mind must accomplish itself in an instant, in \\"the eternal now\\", that in fact Eckhart in this respect is rooted directly in the catechisis of the Fathers of the Church rather than merely derived from Buddhism; # On the question of \\"Isness\\" and Suzuki's contention that the \\"Christian experiences are not after all different from those of the Buddhist; terminology is all that divides us\\", that in Eckhart \\"the Godhead's istigkeit [translated as \\"isness\\" by Suzuki] is a negation of all quiddities; it says that God, rather than non-being, is at the heart of all things\\" thereby demonstrating with Eckhart's theocentrism that \\"the istigkeit of the Godhead and the isness of a thing then refer to two opposite experiences in Meister Eckhart and Suzuki: in the former, to God, and in the latter, to \`our ordinary state of the mind'\\" and Buddhism's attempts to think \\"pure nothingness\\"; # On the question of \\"Emptiness\\" and Eckhart's view (claimed as parallel to Buddhist emphasis \\"on the emptiness of all 'composite things'\\") that only a perfectly released person, devoid of all, comprehends, \\"seizes\\", God, that the Buddhist \\"emptiness\\" seems to concern man's relation to things while Eckhart's concern is with what is \\"at the end of the road opened by detachment [which is] the mind espouses the very movement of the divine dehiscence; it does what the Godhead does: it lets all things be; not only must God also abandon all of his own ‚Äì names and attributes if he is to reach into the ground of the mind (this is already a step beyond the recognition of the emptiness of all composite things), but God's essential being ‚Äì releasement ‚Äì becomes the being of a released man.\\" =Psychology and psychoanalysis= Erich Fromm The notable humanistic psychoanalyst and philosopher Erich Fromm was another scholar who brought renewed attention in the West to Eckhart's writings, drawing upon many of the latter's themes in his large corpus of work. Eckhart was a significant influence in developing United Nations Secretary General Dag Hammarskj√∂ld's conception of spiritual growth through selfless service to humanity, as detailed in his book of contemplations called V√§gm√§rken (\\"Markings\\"). Carl G. Jung In Aion, Researches Into the Phenomenology of Self The Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Volume 9, Part II, Princeton University Press (1959) Carl G. Jung cites Eckhart approvingly in his discussion of Christ as a symbol of the archetypal self. Jung sees Eckhart as a Christian Gnostic: > Meister Eckhart's theology knows a \\"Godhead\\" of which no qualities, except > unity and being, can be predicated; it \\"is becoming,\\" it is not yet Lord of > itself, and it represents an absolute coincidence of opposites: \\"But its > simple nature is of forms formless; of becoming becomingless; of beings > beingless; of things thingless,\\" etc. Union of opposites is equivalent to > unconsciousness, so far as human logic goes, for consciousness presupposes a > differentiation into subject and object and a relation between them. (Page > 193.) > As the Godhead is essentially unconscious, so too is the man who lives in > God. In his sermon on \\"The Poor in Spirit\\" (Matt. 5 : 3), the Meister says: > \\"The man who has this poverty has everything he was when he lived not in any > wise, neither in himself, nor in truth, nor in God. He is so quit and empty > of all knowing that no knowledge of God is alive in him; for while he stood > in the eternal nature of god, there lived in him not another: what lived > there was himself. And so we say this man is as empty of his own knowledge > as he was when he was not anything; he lets God work with what he will, and > he stands empty as when he came from God.\\" Therefore he should love God in > the following way: \\"Love him as he is; a not-God, a not-spirit, a not- > person, a not-image; as a sheer, pure, clear One, which he is, sundered from > all secondness; and in this One let us sink eternally, from nothing to > nothing. So help us God. Amen.\\" (Page 193.) Jung summed up his view of Eckhart saying: > The world-embracing spirit of Meister Eckhart knew, without discursive > knowledge, the primordial mystical experience of India as well as of the > Gnostics, and was itself the finest flower on the tree of the \\"Free Spirit\\" > that flourished at the beginning of the eleventh century. Well might the > writings of this Master be buried for six hundred years, for \\"his time was > not yet come.\\" Only in the nineteenth century did he find a public at all > capable of appreciating the grandeur of his mind. (Page 194.) =In popular culture= In Jacob's Ladder, Louis, the main character's friend, attributes the following quote to Eckhart: In Z213: Exit, by Dimitris Lyacos the same quote, attributed to Eckhart, appears in a slightly different wording: In the book The Gargoyle by Andrew Davidson, Eckhart is mentioned in a story Marianne Engel recounts to the (unnamed) protagonist about her days in the Engelthal Monastery: Eckhart is also referenced in J. D. Salinger's Franny and Zooey. In a letter to Zooey, Buddy says, The third movement of John Adams's Harmonielehre symphony (1985) is titled \\"Meister Eckhart and Quackie\\", which imagines the mystic floating through space with the composer's daughter Emily (nicknamed Quackie) on his back whispering secrets of grace in his ear.Simon Rattle & City of Birmingham SO (1994) CD booklet Eckhart Tolle quotes Meister Eckhart in The Power Of Now as saying \\"Time is what keeps the light from reaching us\\". Works Manuscript Soest, Stadtarchiv und Wissenschaftliche Stadtbibliothek, Codex Nr. 33, folium 57 verso, a‚Äìb The publication of the modern critical edition of Eckhart's German and Latin works began in 1936, and is nearly complete.Meister Eckhart: Die deutschen und lateinischen Werke. Herausgegeben im Auftrage der Deutschen Forschungsgemeinschaft. Stuttgart and Berlin: Kohlhammer Verlag, 11 Vols., 1936‚Äì. The Latin works comprise 6 volumes (widely referred to as LW1‚Äì6), while the German works comprise 5 volumes (widely referred to as DW1‚Äì5). =Latin works= One difficulty with Eckhart's Latin writings is that they clearly represent only a small portion of what he planned to write. Eckhart describes his plans to write a vast Opus Tripartitum (Three-Part Work). Unfortunately, all that exists today of the first part, the Work of Propositions, is the Prologue illustrating the first proposition (with Eckhart intending the first part alone to consist of over one thousand propositions).Meister Eckhart, The Essential Sermons, Commentaries, Treatises and Defense, trans. and ed. by Bernard McGinn and Edmund Colledge, New York: Paulist Press, 1981, p.64. This Prologue exists in two manuscripts discovered by Denifle ‚Äì one discovered in Erfurt in 1880, and the other in Kues in 1886. The second part, called the Work of Questions, no longer exists. The third part, the Work of Commentaries, is the major surviving Latin work by Eckhart, consisting of a Prologue, six commentaries, and fifty-six sermons.Meister Eckhart, The Essential Sermons, Commentaries, Treatises and Defense, trans. and ed. by Bernard McGinn and Edmund Colledge, New York: Paulist Press, 1981, p.65. It used to be thought that this work was begun while Eckhart was in Paris between 1311 and 1313; however, recent manuscript discoveries mean that much of what survives must be dated to before 1310.Bernard McGinn, The Harvest of Mysticism, (2005), p.98. The surviving Latin works are, therefore: *The early Quaestiones Parisiensis (Parisian Questions).LW 1:27‚Äì83.

The problems involve not only whether a particular sermon or treatise is to be judged authentic or pseudonymous, but also, given the large number of manuscripts and the fragmentary condition of many of them, whether it is even possible to establish the text for some of the pieces accepted as genuine.Meister Eckhart, The Essential Sermons, Commentaries, Treatises and Defense, trans. and ed. by Bernard McGinn and Edmund Colledge, New York: Paulist Press, 1981, p. 66. Eckhart's sermons are versions written down by others from memory or from notes, meaning that the possibility for error was much greater than for the carefully written Latin treatises. The critical edition of Eckhart's works traditionally accepted 86 sermons as genuine, based on the research done by its editor Josef Quint (1898-1976) during the 20th century. Of these, Sermons 1‚Äì16b are proved authentic by direct citation in the Defense. Sermons 17‚Äì24 have such close textual affinities with Latin sermons recognised as genuine that they are accepted. Sermons 25‚Äì86 are harder to verify, and judgements have been made on the basis of style and content. Georg Steer took over the editorship in 1983. Between 2003 and 2016, the critical edition under Georg Steer added another 30 vernacular sermons (Nos. 87 to 117) in volumes 4.1 and 4.2. Because six sermons exist in an A and B version (5a-b, 13-13a, 16a-b, 20a-b, 36a-b und 54a-b) the final total of vernacular sermons is 123 (numbered consecutively from 1 to 117). When Franz Pfeiffer published his edition of Eckhart's works in 1857, he included seventeen vernacular treatises he considered to be written by Eckhart. Modern scholarship is much more cautious, however, and the critical edition accepts only four of Eckhart's vernacular treatises as genuine: *The longest of these, the Reden der Unterweisung (Counsels on Discernment/Discourses on Instruction/Talks of Instruction),LW 5:137‚Äì376. is probably Eckhart's earliest surviving work, a set of spiritual instructions that he gave to young Dominicans in the 1290s. It was clearly a popular work, with fifty-one manuscripts known.Bernard McGinn, The Harvest of Mysticism, (2005), p.95. *A second vernacular treatise, the Liber Benedictus (Book \\"Benedictus\\" ), in fact consists of two related treatises firstly, Daz buoch der g√∂tl√Æchen tr≈ìstunge(The Book of the Divine Consolation),DW 5:1‚Äì105. and secondly, a sermon entitled Von dem edeln menschen (Of the Nobleman).DW 5:109‚Äì119. *The final vernacular treatise accepted as genuine by the critical edition is entitled Von Abgescheidenheit (On Detachment).DW 5:400‚Äì434. All four vernacular treatises are translated into English in Meister Eckhart, The Essential Sermons, Commentaries, Treatises and Defense, trans. and ed. by Bernard McGinn and Edmund Colledge, New York: Paulist Press, 1981. However, this treatise is generally today not thought to be written by Eckhart.Bernard McGinn, The Harvest of Mysticism, (2005), p.632. =Modern editions and translations= * Meister Eckhart: Die deutschen und lateinischen Werke.

The squadron was inactivated on 15 May 1991. The unit was first activated in 1942, and served until April 1944 as a replacement and operational training unit for light bombardment and fighter-bomber units and crews. It was active as a reserve unit from 1949 to 1951, flying the aircraft of the regular 52d Fighter-All Weather Group until it was called to active duty for the Korean War and its personnel used to fill out other units. Its longest period of active duty started in 1953, when it was activated as an interceptor squadron. After training in the Western United States, it moved to Germany, serving in the air defense of Western Europe until 1968, when it converted to the tactical fighter mission. History =World War II= The squadron was activated in 1942 as the 301st Bombardment Squadron (Light) at Hunter Field, Georgia, and equipped with Douglas A-24 Banshee dive bombers as one of the original squadron s of the 84th Bombardment Group.Maurer, Combat Units, p. 150 It received its initial cadre and equipment from the 3d Bombardment Group. It operated briefly with Vultee V-72 (A-31 Vengeance) aircraft, but its operations showed this aircraft was unsuitable for dive bombing. The squadron served as an Operational Training Unit (OTU), acting as the parent for elements of several light bombardment groups.These units were the 85th, 311th, 312th, 319th, 405th and 407th Bombardment Groups Abstract, 84 Bombardment Group 1943 History In 1943, the squadron was redesignated as the 496th Fighter-Bomber Squadron as were other AAF single engine bombardment units, and was re-equipped with Republic P-47 Thunderbolts. It continued to serve as an OTU until October 1943. The OTU program involved the use of an oversized parent unit to provide cadres to \\"satellite groups.\\"Craven & Cate, Vol. VI, Introduction, p. xxxvi During the fall of 1943, operations dwindled and by the end of September 1943 only five aircraft were assigned to the entire 84th Group. The squadron then became a Replacement Training Unit (RTU) and also participated occasionally in demonstrations and maneuvers. RTUs were also oversized units, but with the mission of training individual pilots or aircrews. However, the AAF found that standard military units, based on relatively inflexible tables of organization were proving less well adapted to the training mission in the US. Accordingly, a more functional system was adopted in which each base was organized into a separate numbered unit.Craven & Cate, Vol. VI, p. 75 The squadron was, therefore, disbanded in April 1944 and replaced by the 261st AAF Base Unit (Combat Crew Training School, Fighter), which took over the personnel, equipment and mission of the squadron at Abilene Army Air Field. =Air reserve= F-82 of the 52d Fighter GroupAircraft is North American F-82F Twin Mustang serial 46-414 assigned to the 2d Fighter All Weather Squadron The May 1949 Air Force Reserve program called for a new type of unit, the corollary unit, which was a reserve unit integrated with an active duty unit. The plan called for corollary units at 107 locations. It was viewed as the best method to train reservists by mixing them with an existing regular unit to perform duties alongside the regular unit. Cantwell, p. 73 As part of this program, the squadron was reconstituted as the 496th Fighter Squadron, All Weather and activated at Mitchel Air Force Base, New York in the Air Force Reserves to train as a fighter corollary unit of the 52d Fighter Group of the regular Air Force, moving with the 52d to McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey a few months later. The squadron was apparently undermanned and thus performed very little training. During its only 2-week summer encampment (12‚Äì26 June 1950), the entire 84th Group had only four pilots capable of flying the 52d's North American F-82 Twin Mustangs provided for their training. Like other corollary units, the 84th Group seems to have been poorly manned, and the parent 52d Fighter-All Weather Wing made little use of its corollary units, focusing on its combat mission instead. The 84th Group was ordered to active service on 1 June 1951, inactivated the next day, and its few people became \\"fillers\\" for the 52d Wing or, if there was no vacancy in the 52d, for other USAF units.Cantwell, pp. 79, 110 =Interceptor operations= 496th FIS F-86D SabresAircraft are North American F-86D-45-NA Sabres. Serial 52-3938 is in front. After the squadron transitioned to the F-102 in 1959, this aircraft was transferred to the Japanese Self-Defense Air Force. Activated briefly at Hamilton Air Force Base, California in early 1953, equipped with North American F-86F Sabres, performed air defense of the West Coast of the United States. Reassigned to the United States Air Forces in Europe, assigned to the 86th Fighter-Interceptor Wing at Landstuhl Air Base, West Germany in 1954. Mission in USAFE was air defense of West Germany, flying North American F-86D Sabre interceptors. 496th FIS Convair F-102 Delta DaggersAircraft are Convair F-102A-65-CO Delta Daggers serials 56-1210 and 56-1219 Moved to Hahn Air Base in November 1956, remaining assigned to the 86th. Operated from Hahn for the next decade, being re-equipped with the F-102A Delta Dagger in 1959. =Tactical fighter operations= 496th TFS F-4 PhantomAircraft is McDonnell F-4E Phantom II serial 68-513, taken about 1970 Reassigned to the host 50th TFW at Hahn in 1968 as part of the withdrawal of the F-102 from Europe, being re-equipped with McDonnell F-4E Phantom IIs and becoming a tactical Fighter Squadron. Continued routine training operations throughout the 1970s, upgrading to General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft in 1982.

This 1997 work was the first sky atlas to include the Hipparcos and Tycho Catalogue data, extending earlier undertakings in terms of completeness and uniformity to a magnitude limit of around 10‚Äì11 magnitude. It appeared as a stand-alone publication, and as three volumes of the 17-volume Hipparcos Catalogue. The 1548 charts include one million stars from the Hipparcos and Tycho-1 Catalogues, three times as many as in any previous all-sky atlas; more than 8000 galaxies with their orientation; outlines of many bright and dark nebulae; the location of many open and globular clusters; and some 250 of the brightest quasars. The non- stellar objects in the atlas are identified by type and designation. The chart scale is 100 arcsec/mm, matching that at the focus of an 8-inch f/10 Schmidt- Cassegrain. Star magnitudes are essentially Johnson V. Distance labels are given for stars within 200 light-years of the Sun. Proper motion arrows are given for stars with motions exceeding 0.2 arcsec/yr.

It originally aired on September 29, 1961 on CBS. Opening narration Plot It is a typical evening in a typical suburban community. At the residence of physician Bill Stockton, he enjoys a birthday party being thrown for him by his wife Grace and their son Paul. Also at the party are Jerry Harlowe, Bill's brother-in-law; Frank Henderson and Marty Weiss, Bill and Jerry's former roommates; and the wives and children of Jerry, Frank, and Marty. Bill is well known and liked by this gathering; he attended the State University with Marty, Frank, and Jerry. Moreover, Bill has repeatedly administered to the health and well-being of each one of said guests and/or delivered their children. Everyone is especially friendly and jovial, even when mention is made of Bill's late-night work on a fallout shelter which he has built in his basement. Suddenly, a Civil Defense (CONELRAD) announcement overheard by young Paul is made that unidentified objects have been detected heading for the United States. In these times, everybody knows what that means: nuclear attack. As panic ensues, the doctor locks himself and his family into his shelter. The same gathering of friends becomes hysterical and now wants to occupy the shelter. All of the previous cordiality is now replaced with soaring desperation; pent-up hostility, searing nativism, and other suppressed emotions boil to the surface. Stockton offers his basement to the guests, but the shelter itself has sufficient air, provisions, and space for only three people (the Stocktons themselves). The once-friendly neighbors do not accept this; they break down the shelter door with an improvised battering ram. Just then, a final Civil Defense broadcast announces that the objects have been identified as harmless satellites and that no danger is present. The neighbors apologize for their behavior; yet Stockton wonders if they have destroyed each other without a bomb.

Meeting with U.S. President John F. Kennedy in Vienna, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev insisted--not for the first time--that NATO troops withdraw from Berlin, handing over the city to an independent, Soviet-aligned East Germany. Khrushchev explicitly threatened thermonuclear war if the United States refused to relent. Kennedy responded publicly seven weeks later in a televised address on July 25, 1961. During the speech, Kennedy stated his intention to ensure access to shelters in the event of a nuclear attack on the United States. In the aftermath of the speech, numerous companies began producing such shelters, and products were sold with explicit reference to the shelters; for instance, Foam-Ettes toothpaste tablets boasted that they could be used \\"wherever you are‚Äîeven in a family fallout shelter.\\"Henriksen, Margot A.

Amerigroup covers 7.7 million seniors, people with disabilities, low-income families and other state and federally sponsored beneficiaries, and federal employees in 26 states, making it the nation‚Äôs largest provider of health care for public programs. History Amerigroup began as AMERICAID Community Care in 1994 and was initially aimed at the health care problems of children, mothers and pregnant women enrolled in Medicaid. Amerigroup became a publicly traded corporation in the fall of 2001. In 2006, Amerigroup entered the Medicare Advantage program, serving low-income people who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid through special needs plans. In 2007, Amerigroup began the operation of traditional Medicare Advantage plans. Currently, Amerigroup offers health care services through three government programs that target different segments of the country‚Äôs low-income population: Medicaid, the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and Medicare. On July 9, 2012, Anthem Inc. (then known as WellPoint) entered into an agreement to acquire Amerigroup Corporation for $4.9 billion. On 1 March 2020, Amerigroup told Grays Harbor Community Hospital (GHCH) and Harbor Medical Group (HMG) of their decision to terminate their relationship with the company effective 28 June 2020.

National Advisory Board In 2007, Amerigroup developed the National Advisory Board (NAB) to focus on meeting the needs of seniors and people with disabilities, who are a significant proportion of its clients. The NAB provides policy recommendations for improving programs and services for seniors and people with disabilities. Convened by Lex Frieden, who was instrumental in conceiving and drafting the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the NAB is made up of 19 community advocates, health care experts and academics. The NAB advocated that the modernized health care infrastructure be required to meet the needs of people with disabilities and seniors. Corporate social responsibility =Amerigroup Foundation= The main goals of the Amerigroup Foundation are to foster access to care, encourage safe and healthy children and families, and promote community improvement and healthy neighborhoods. In the past year, the Foundation contributed more than $3 million to various community organizations across the United States. Since inception, the Foundation has awarded $17.3 million to community health centers, service organizations, and local programs. =Volunteerism= Amerigroup has a Community Volunteers program, created to recognize and support the contributions employees make in communities across the country and to inspire others to volunteer. All Amerigroup employees receive a paid day off each year to do volunteer work in their communities. Medicaid fraud Fired Executive Cleveland Tyson provided federal prosecutors with evidence that Amerigroup was systematically declining services to low-income pregnant women in Illinois from 2001 to 2003. Their contract with the state required that they enroll all eligible clients, but prosecutors submitted emails showing that Amerigroup had a policy of targeting healthy enrollees and specifically excluded pregnant women and others with expensive conditions. In October 2006, a federal jury found Amerigroup liable for $48 million in damages, which was tripled by statute to $144 million. In March 2007, an additional fine of over $190 million was levied for 18,000 false claims. After appealing the judgments, Amerigroup agreed in July 2008 to settle the charges for $225 million. As a whistleblower, qui tam provisions entitled Tyson to $56 million of the settlement.

Armies were sometimes known to sever the penises of their enemies to count the dead, as well as for trophies. The practice of castration (removal of the testicles) sometimes involved the removal of all or part of the penis, generally with a tube inserted to keep the urethra open for urination. Castration has been used to create a class of servants or slaves called eunuchs in many different places and eras. In Russia, men of a devout group of Spiritual Christians known as the Skoptsy were castrated, either undergoing \\"greater castration\\", which entailed removal of the penis, or \\"lesser castration\\", in which the penis remained in place, while Skoptsy women underwent mastectomy. These procedures were performed in an effort to eliminate lust and to restore the Christian to a pristine state that existed prior to original sin. In the modern era, removing the human penis for any such activity is very rare (with some exceptions listed below), and references to removal of the penis are almost always symbolic. Castration is less rare, and is performed as a last resort in the treatment of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer. Penis removal in medicine and psychology Some men have penile amputations, known as penectomies, for medical reasons. Cancer, for example, sometimes necessitates removal of all or part of the penis. In some instances, botched childhood circumcisions have also resulted in full or partial penectomies. A man who has his penis removed may have one or more problems with his personality, urination, sex life, and vulnerable testicles; he may also experience a phantom penis (see phantom limb). Genital surgical procedures for trans women (transgender or transsexual women) undergoing sex reassignment surgery, do not usually involve the complete removal of the penis; part or all of the glans is usually kept and reshaped as a clitoris, and the skin of the penile shaft may also be inverted to form the vagina. When procedures such as this are not possible, other procedures such as colovaginoplasty are used which do involve the removal of the penis. Issues related to the removal of the penis appear in psychology, for example in the condition known as castration anxiety. Some men have undergone penectomies as a voluntary body modification, thus including it as part of a body dysmorphic disorder. Professional opinion is divided regarding the desire for penile amputation as a pathology, much as all other forms of treatment by amputation for body dysmorphic disorder. Voluntary subincision, removal of the glans penis, and bifurcation of the penis are related topics. History of involuntary penis removal = China = In ancient China, for crimes including adultery, \\"licentious\\" and \\"promiscuous\\" activity, males had their penises removed in addition to being castrated. This was one of the Five Punishments that could be legally inflicted on criminals in China. They were designed to permanently disfigure for life. \\"Castration\\", in China, meant the severing of the penis in addition to the testicles, after which male offenders were sentenced to work in the palace as eunuchs. The punishment was called g≈çngx√≠ng (ÂÆ´Âàë), which meant \\"palace punishment\\", since castrated men would be enslaved to work in the harem of the palace. It was also called \\"f«îx√≠ng\\"(ËÖêÂàë). Husbands who committed adultery were punished with castration as required under this law. While men were castrated. The exact crime was called gong, and referred to \\"immoral\\" sex between males and females. The punishment stated, \\"If a male and female engage in intercourse without morality, their punishments shall be castration and sequestration [respectively].\\" = Japan = The removal of the penis was used as a punishment for men in the Heian period in Japan, where it replaced execution. It was called rasetsu ÁæÖÂàá („Çâ„Åõ„Å§), and was separate from castration which was called ky≈´kei ÂÆÆÂàë („Åç„ÇÖ„ÅÜ„Åë„ÅÑ). Rasetsu was done voluntarily by some Japanese Buddhist priests to ensure celibacy. Rasetsu was also known in Edo period Japan. The word rasetsu was made out of the components \\"ra\\" from \\"mara\\" which meant penis, and \\"setsu\\", which meant cutting. The word rasetsu was used in Japanese literature. Kyuukei in Japanese law referred to the punishment of castration, which was used for male offenders, and confinement for females.Meaning of ÂÆÆÂàë in Japanese.

Tangorin Japanese Dictionary =Arab slave trade= The Arab slave trade provided many eunuchs who were more highly prized, and priced. African boys were generally subject to penis removal, as well as castration. Treatment and effects of penis removal A study of penis reattachment in China found that in a group of 50 men, all but one reacquired functionality, even though some involved full reconstructive surgery using tissue and bone. Reportedly some of these men later fathered children.HEALTH CARE IN CHINA-TRANSPLANTS AND DRUGS ‚Äì China  Facts and Details =Phalloplasty= If reattachment is not an option (such as the penis not being reattached long after 24 hours), doctors can reconstruct a penis from muscle and skin grafted from another part of the body like the forearm. However, a penile implant is needed for an erection to be possible, as the reconstructed penis would look strange and would either not be able to ejaculate, or ejaculate with less force. The patients are often dissatisfied with the reconstructed penis. Since 2015, Zephyr Surgical Implants produces malleable and inflatable penile implants particularly designed for phalloplasty surgeries. Standing during urination is an advantage offered by a reconstructed penis.

The squadron was first active as a training unit during World War II. History =World War II= The squadron was activated as the 325th Fighter Squadron, one of the original squadrons of the 327th Fighter Group. Maurer, Combat Groups, pp. 208‚Äì209 It performed air defense missions, but became an operational training unit until February 1944, and afterward served as a replacement training unit until being disbanded in April 1944. =Air Defense Command= North American F-86D Sabre 51-6181, at Truax Field in 1955 The squadron was reconstituted as the 325th Fighter- Interceptor Squadron and activated at Travis Air Force Base in April 1953, where it was equipped with the radar equipped and Mighty Mouse rocket armed North American F-86D Sabres. The following February, it moved to Hamilton Air Force Base. From both bases it operated to defend the Pacific Coast. The squadron moved on paper to Truax Field, Wisconsin on 18 August 1955, where it assumed the mission, personnel and equipment of 456th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, which moved in turn to Castle Air Force Base, California as part of Project Arrow, an Air Defense Command program which was designed to bring back on the active list the fighter units which had compiled memorable records in the two world wars.Buss, Sturm, Volan & McMullen, p. 6 Two years later, it equipped with the Convair F-102 Delta Dagger. At Truax, it was responsible for the air defense of the upper Midwest until 1966. On 22 October 1962, before President John F. Kennedy told Americans that missiles were in place in Cuba, the squadron dispersed a portion of its force to Des Moines Airport at the start of the Cuban Missile Crisis.McMullen, pp. 10‚Äì12 At the beginning of the crisis, the 331st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron had deployed F-102s to Homestead Air Force Base, Florida. The 325th was the only F-102 squadron whose planes had not been modified to carry the GAR-11 Falcon nuclear missile and its planes were armed with Mighty Mouse rockets,McMullen, p. 12 which provided a superior low altitude intercept capability.NORAD/CONAD Participation in the Cuban Missile Crisis The 325th replaced the 331st at Homestead to take advantage of this capability. Following the crisis, twenty of the squadron's F-102s were kept at HomesteadMcMullen, p. 16 until Air Defense Command (ADC) decided to replace the F-102s there with F-104s.McMullen, p. 17 Although the F-104 had been removed from the ADC inventory in 1960 because of its lack of an all-weather capability, this was not a factor at Homestead because Cuba lacked a bomber force and the F-104 had a superior fighter against fighter capability. The alert responsibility at Homestead was assumed by F-104s of the 319th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron on 15 April 1963 and the 325th's planes returned to Truax.

Born in West Boylston, Massachusetts , Dyer Ball studied at Phillips Academy and at Yale College for two years. He graduate from Union College, New York, in 1826, and then studied Theology at Yale and Andover Theological Seminary. He received his licence to preach in 1828, one year after marrying Lucy Mills. After being ordained in 1831, he became an agent of the American Home Missionary Society in 1833, and settled in Florida, where he taught, among other places, at St. Augustine High School there, and among the local African- American community. Meanwhile, as his appointment to a mission abroad was delayed due to financial circumstances, he also received a medical degree from a medical institution in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1837, and learned Chinese. He was sent to Singapore by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions on 25 May 1838, and remained there until 1841, when he departed for Macao due to his wife's ailing health. He then moved to Hong Kong in 1843, where his wife died, and to Canton, China, in 1845, where he settled permanently. He remarried in 1846, his new wife, Isabella Robertson, being a missionary from Scotland. Isabella bore a son, James, who was to become Deputy Registrar of the Supreme Court in Hong Kong. His work focused mainly on performing missionary work and preaching. He ran a boys' school and opened a publishing house, where he published Chinese literature, religious tracts and a popular Chinese almanac. He also used his medical experience to help the local population. Dyer Ball died in Canton in 1866. He is buried at the Mission Cemetery in Lienchow.

The most damaging tropical disturbance was Tropical Depression 04F which also was the deadliest tropical disturbance occurring during the season. The depression caused $ (2009 USD; $ USD) in damage and killed twelve people when it caused the worst economic natural disaster in Viti Levu since the drought of 1998.http://www.met.gov.fj/documents/FICSJan20091233891588.pdf During the season tropical cyclones were monitored by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) in Nadi, Fiji, and the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (TCWC) in Wellington, New Zealand. RSMC Nadi attached a number and an F suffix to tropical disturbances that formed in or moved into the South Pacific. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also issued unofficial warnings throughout during the season, designating tropical cyclones with a number and a P suffix. RSMC Nadi and TCWC Wellington both use the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale, and measured windspeeds over a period of ten minutes, while the JTWC measured sustained winds over a period of one minute and uses the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale. This timeline includes information from post-storm reviews by RSMC Nadi, TCWC Wellington and the JTWC.

It is intended to design better ways of selling, making salespeople's efforts more productive. It has been described as \\"the systematic application of scientific and mathematical principles to achieve the practical goals of a particular sales process\\".. Paul Selden pointed out that in this context, sales referred to the output of a process involving a variety of functions across an organization, and not that of a \\"sales department\\" alone. Primary areas of application span functions including sales, marketing, and customer service. Also known as \\"sales funnel engineering\\" and \\"sales pipeline engineering\\". History As early as 1900‚Äì1915, advocates of scientific management, such as Frederick Winslow Taylor and Harlow Stafford Person, recognized that their ideas could be applied not only to manual labour and skilled trades but also to management, professions, and sales. Person promoted an early form of sales process engineering. At the time, postwar senses of the terms sales process engineering and sales engineering did not yet exist; Person called his efforts \\"sales engineering\\".. The evolution of modern corporate life in the 1920s through 1960s, sought to apply analysis and synthesis to improve the methods of all functions within a business. After the famous NBC Whitepaper in 1980 titled \\"If Japan Can... Why Can't We?\\" the 1980s and 1990s saw the emergence of a variety of approaches, such as business process reengineering, Total Quality Management, Six Sigma, and Lean Manufacturing. Inevitably some of the people involved in these initiatives tried to begin applying what they learned to sales and marketing. For instance, Cas Welch was instrumental in designing and installing Westinghouse Electric's Total Quality program. As one of the first such programs in American industry, it was emulated by other firms and government agencies. His audits of Westinghouse sales offices caused him to realize companies were mistaken in their assumption that quality applied primarily to products. \\"Their focus has been to remove the flies from the soup after the customer complains; not to cook the soup without flies in the first place ... when it would be less expensive and time-consuming for the sales person to do it right the first time.\\" James Cortada was one of IBM's management consultants on market driven quality. His book TQM for Sales and Marketing Management was the first attempt to explain the theory of TQM in a sales and marketing context. George Antoin Smith, Jr. in Naperville, IL, an Electrical Engineering graduate of Purdue University, had been a successful Field Sales Engineer and District Sales Manager of Hewlett Packard electronic components to OEMs. In 1989 George Smith received the HP President's Club Award for career excellence in HPs sales organization. In 1992, he started a consulting company to demonstrate to sales managers how they could tactically measure and improve sales productivity. He also wrote the Sales Quality Audit. Todd Youngblood, another ex-IBMer, in his book The Dolphin and the Cow (2004). emphasized \\"three core principles\\": continuous improvement of the sales process, metrics to quantitatively judge the rate and degree of improvement, and a well-defined sales process. Meanwhile, another executive from IBM, Daniel Stowell, had participated in IBM's expansion from selling hardware in the 1960s and '70s \\"the only way it knew how, through face-to-face sales\\" to the company's first use of a market channel in a project known as the \\"Alternate Channels Marketing Test.\\" The idea was to incorporate direct response marketing techniques to accomplish the job of direct salespeople, and the initiative was quite successful. Notably his story illustrated the need for \\"consensus management\\" of the sales team. Traditional ways of managing sales people did not work when team members who had to develop a new way of selling were embedded in 14 different sales offices around the US. The culture of sales was based on intuition and gut feel, not on data and mathematical logic like the culture of operational excellence. However, many people inside the quality movement could see that the scientific mindset ought to apply to sales and marketing. Paul Selden's \\"Sales Process Engineering, A Personal Workshop\\" was a further attempt to demonstrate the applicability of the theory and tools of quality management to the sales function. The book applied Deming's 14 Points and the tools of quality measurement (such as check sheets, run charts, histograms, etc.), in a sales context. While the book did a great job of explaining the management theory, like most of the other books up until this time, it suffered from a lack of real examples demonstrating how such measures had actually helped salespeople sell things. Then In 2006, Michael Webb wrote Sales and Marketing the Six Sigma Way. With more than 20 years of field sales, management and B2B sales training experience, Webb was the first to explain how the scientific, measurement orientation of process excellence could help salespeople sell. He pointed out that the purpose of sales is to get customers to take actions, and this is fundamentally different than the purpose of manufacturing. Salespeople have always known they must earn the customer's attention, their time, and their trust if they ever are to get a chance to earn any of their money. Webb pointed out the customer's actions determined whether value or waste had been created. He included case examples of B2B companies whose management used data to make changes that improved conversions by 100% or more. It proved (both to the quality community and to the sales community) that the data-oriented tools of science could help customers buy and salespeople sell. It demonstrated a valuable alternative to management's usual approach of just repeating the \\"Usual Fixes\\" such as sales training or CRM, which typically have little measurable or sustainable effect on productivity. The book earned 4.5 stars on Amazon and sold more than 21k copies. Brent Wahba, an engineer with a background in Lean at GM and Delphi Automotive, also saw that root cause thinking had not yet penetrated the culture of sales and marketing management. His book \\"The Fluff Cycle,\\" criticized business writers in sales and marketing. He observed that traditional \\"best practices\\" approach as well as the insights of sales consultants usually do not work for very long. His point was that this is precisely because they are transplanted from outside the company, rather than being the result of people inside the company improving their thinking about the problems they face. Wahba's point was not a new one, however. In his book High-Impact Consulting, Robert Shaffer made a resounding statement about all kinds of consulting - not just sales and marketing: \\"No matter how wise and creative the consultant's analysis and recommendations, they pay off only to the extent that the client does what is necessary to benefit from them. The result is that many consulting projects fail to contribute nearly as much as they might because of the implementation gap, and a great many produce virtually no lasting benefit.\\" As Edwards Deming said \\"It does not happen all at once. There is no instant pudding.\\" Scientific methods enable individuals to solve problems. When an engineer succeeds with a difficult problem, he or she can become a hero to his company. It may not really matter if no one else understands how they did it. However, companies require many different people to collaborate if sales and marketing problems are to be solved. And people cannot collaborate without learning and sharing an explicit approach for identifying evidence, generating theories, and experimenting. Most executives are not taught to pay attention to how their employees think and solve problems. Instead, as described by Brian Joiner in his book Fourth Generation Management, they tend to either dictate the activities they want their people to follow (called \\"2nd generation\\" management), or (when that fails) hand down objectives without regard for how they will be achieved (called \\"3rd generation\\" management). Sales productivity has been declining due to changes in their customer's behaviors. For example, Google and the CEB recently reported that B2B companies are avoiding salespeople until as much as 60 to 70% of their company's decision-making process is complete. Companies who study sales and marketing, such as Forrester, commonly admit that chief sales officers are expecting difficulty securing revenue targets. CSO Insights reported that the average sales forecast has a lower probability of winning than a pass bet at the craps tables in Las Vegas. Perhaps it is no wonder the turnover rates of salespeople are often 40% or more. In this environment, some companies are looking for alternatives. Robert Pryor points out in his book, Lean Selling, that \\"Lean is a methodology that revolutionizes the processes for producing products and for delivering services, and the Lean Thinking that captures its principles are the most disruptive and transformational management ideas since the Industrial Revolution that began over 100 years ago.\\" Such advanced management thinking is demonstrating that the principles underlying operational excellence are crucially important to CEOs. That's because the vocabulary and the concepts of operational excellence provides CEOs with the framework to engage their people to improve their thinking. For example, recognizing that results in business are caused by people's behaviors, The Shingo Prize for excellence in manufacturing focuses on the beliefs which cause people's behaviors. The Shingo Model does not begin by teaching people the tools used in process excellence, as has been the norm for 50 years in all forms of process improvement. Instead, it starts by helping people to understand the underlying principles that explain WHY those tools work. For example, \\"Seek Perfection\\" is a principle that capitalizes on the natural human desire to want their life to be better. \\"Embrace Scientific Thinking\\" is a principle that demonstrates how we all naturally learn. With principles as the foundation, when people find themselves in an area where the tools that were invented for manufacturing don't easily apply (like sales and marketing), they can use those principles to develop tools that are appropriate to solving the problems at hand. Such an approach does not assume (as most sales training and CRM companies assume) that a process is something handed down to a sales team from outside the company or from someone higher in the organization. Instead, it recognizes that the process must be originated by the people responsible for doing the work. It is their best understanding of how to achieve the objectives the company desires. This presents unique challenges to managers, and opportunities for businesses. The Internet has revolutionized how companies buy and sell. It is time for sales and marketing management to revolutionize itself through application of rational principles. This is what sales process engineering is about. Examples of this are found in Michael Webb's 2014 book on the topic, Sales Process Excellence. This privately published work presents more than 40 industry examples from Webb's client case files illustrating in detail why sales and marketing needs operational excellence, and how operational excellence changes and improves sales and marketing management. Future directions Most breakthroughs in performance are preceded by revolutions in measurement. Such revolutions will be enabled by two fundamentally different trends. The first trend is for businesses to be more deliberately rational in their use of language to define the evidence their marketers and sellers are seeing. No longer can business leaders afford to allow their people to throw around terms such as \\"customer\\" or \\"qualified prospect\\" without operationally defining them. Then, as the clarity and consistency of what these terms refer to in reality, the second trend will become incredibly powerful. That trend is the ability to \\"instrument\\" the interactions between salespeople and their customers in order to provide visibility to where the problems in the sales and buying processes are located. For example, today's software products are enabling sales teams to track their activities and the customer's responses at a much higher level of granularity than has ever been possible before. This kind of feedback, if used effectively by sales managers, has a powerful ability to elevate and sustain a sales team's performance. Sales process Generally speaking, a process is set of activities, through which work flows, aimed at a common result. Processes define the best known way of doing the work or of accomplishing a goal. Processes are used to create products or to deliver services to customers. Sales processes are simply a special kind of service. They differ from other service processes in one primary respect. The value created by a sales process is determined by whether or not the recipient of the service takes the action you want them to take. For example, a landing page on a website could be considered a kind of sales process. The headline, body copy, testimonials, and call to action create value to the extent they get visitors to the page to provide the requested information (usually their name and email address, etc.). Likewise a proposal presentation from a sales person creates value to the extent the recipients accept the proposal and buy what is offered. Rationale Reasons for having a well-thought-out sales process include seller and buyer risk management, standardized customer interaction during sales, and scalable revenue generation. Approaching the subject from a \\"process\\" point of view offers an opportunity to use design and improvement tools from other disciplines and process-oriented industries. Joseph Juran observed that \\"there should be no reason our familiar principles of quality and process engineering would not work in the sales process\\". Unfortunately, while this is true, he failed to also recognize the unique challenge presented by the selling environment, which has made it much less receptive to process thinking. For example, In Management of a Sales Force (12th Ed. p. 66) by Rich, Spiro and Stanton a \\"sales process\\" is presented as consisting of eight steps. These are: * Prospecting / initial contact * Preapproach - planning the sale * Identifying and cross questioning * Need assessment * Presentation * Meeting objections * Gaining commitment * Follow- up There are, however, also sales processes with other number of steps such as the one by HubSpot with five and by Vainu with seven. Such depictions of the sales process is from the seller's point of view only. This is a huge problem, because customers will not follow a process that does not create value for them. This lack of customer value presents a special dilemma for salespeople. That's because when managers assume processes are to be followed without regard to the value they create for customers, the processes become increasingly difficult to follow. Due to human nature, this arrangement generally guarantees a decay in performance over time. The more productive arrangement is to provide workers with an objective, along with a process for achieving it, and then to ask them if they can improve the process so as to exceed the objective, or achieve it more easily. This engages the minds of the participants in a self-interested manner that serves workers, managers, and customers alike. Once salespeople are challenged, as a team, to find better ways to sell, process language is the indispensable means of enabling them to measure cause and effect, identify steps that are problematic, and develop creative ways of improving. They allow the prediction of numbers of sales based on customer actions. Some recent advances in sales process thinking and innovation have resulted in processes which are non-linear, separate the process into multiple aspects which can be tracked independently, and are based purely on outcomes rather than activities - such as the Essential Sales Process. This enables sales teams to own and improve their ways of working, while providing the necessary rigour required by sales management.

The word 'canon' (from , a measuring rod or standard) was first used for this type of rule in Classical Greece, where it set a standard for body proportions, so as to produce a harmoniously formed figure. Other art styles have similar rules that apply particularly to the representation of royal or divine personalities. Ancient Egypt Danish Egyptologist Erik Iverson determined the Canon of Proportions in classical Egyptian painting. This work was based on still- detectable grid lines on tomb paintings: he determined that the grid was 18 cells high, with the base-line at the soles of the feet and the top of the grid aligned with hair line, and the navel at the eleventh line. Ivarson attempted to find a fixed (rather than relative) size for the grid, but this aspect of his work has been dismissed by later analysts. The Egyptian canon for painting specified for many centuries that heads should be shown in profile, that shoulders and chest be shown head-on, that hips and legs be again in profile, and that male figures should have one foot forward and female figures stand with feet together. Classical Greece Doryphoros (Roman copy), Minneapolis Institute of Art =Canon of Polykleitos= In Classical Greece, the sculptor Polykleitos (fifth centuy BCE) established the Canon of Polykleitos. Though his theoretical treatise is lost to history, he is quoted as saying, \\"Perfection ... comes about little by little () through many numbers\\".Philo, Mechanicus (4.1, 49.20), quoted in . By this he meant that a statue should be composed of clearly definable parts, all related to one another through a system of ideal mathematical proportions and balance. Though the Kanon was probably represented by his Doryphoros, the original bronze statue has not survived, but later marble copies exist. =Canon of Lysippos= The sculptor Lysippos (fourth century BCE) developed a more gracile style. In his , Pliny the elder wrote that Lysippos introduced a new canon into art: cited in Waldstein (1879) signifying \\"a canon of bodily proportions essentially different from that of Polykleitos\\". Lysippos is credited with having established the 'eight heads high' canon of proportion. Classical India Japan in the Heian period =Canon of J≈çch≈ç= J≈çch≈ç (ÂÆöÊúù; died 1057 CE), also known as J≈çch≈ç Busshi, was a Japanese sculptor of the Heian period. He popularised the yosegi technique of sculpting a single figure out of many pieces of wood, and he redefined the canon of body proportions used in Japan to create Buddhist imagery. He based the measurements on a unit equal to the distance between the sculpted figure's chin and hairline. The distance between each knee (in the seated lotus pose) is equal to the distance from the bottoms of the legs to the hair. Renaissance Italy alt=a picture of a man standing in two overlapping poses, so that he seems to have one head and trunk but four arms and four legs. In the first he stands in an X pose inside a circle, showing that his hands and feet touch the circle. In the second, he stands upright in a T pose inside a square, showing that his head, hands and feet all touch the same square Other such systems of 'ideal proportions' in painting and sculpture include Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man, based on a record of body proportions made by the architect Vitruvius, in the third book of his series . Rather than setting a canon of ideal body proportions for others to follow, Vitruvius sought to identify the proportions that exist in reality; da Vinci idealised these proportions in the commentary that accompanies his drawing: See also * Academic art * Beauty * Canon (basic principle), a rule or a body of rules or principles generally established as valid and fundamental in a field of art or philosophy ** Western canon * Nudity ** Depictions of nudity ** Nude (art) * Neoclassicism * Physical attractiveness Notes References Art history Aesthetic beauty ","title":"Artistic canons of body proportions"},{"id":"20595771","title":"History of the flags of Romania"},{"id":"20595774","text":"Zakal () is a dispersed settlement in the hills northwest of Kamnik in the Upper Carniola region of Slovenia.

The lent amount, often referred to as a student loan or the debts may be owed to the school (or the bank) if the student has dropped classes and withdrawn from the school, or if the student has graduated but is underemployed. Withdrawing from a school, especially if a low (or no-income student) has withdrawn with a failing grade, could deprive the student of the ability of further attendance by disqualifying the student of necessary financial aid. Student loans also differ in many countries in the strict laws regulating renegotiating and bankruptcy. Due payments may be a retroactive penalty for services rendered by the school to the individual, including room and board. As with most other types of debt, student debt may be considered defaulted after a given period of non-response to requests by the school or the lender for information, payment or negotiation. At that point, the debt is turned over to a Student Loan Guarantor or a collection agency. United States =History= Many factors are accountable for student debt. One factor is the decline in the income premium for graduates compared to non- graduates. It is not yet negative, but has declined to historic lows for those born since 1980 (with more pronounced downward trajectories for those with post-graduate degrees). Another factor is amount of interest on the loans. Yet another factor is the new guidelines developed by the federal government. There are now new rules deciding who can borrow, as well as how much debt they can take on. Colleges and universities have been increasing the costs for students to attend schools. This is subsequently increasing the amount of debt the students take on as student loans. Reports have shown that borrowers who finished college in the early 1990s were able to manage their student loans without an enormous burden. The average debt increased 58% since in the seven years from 2005 to 2012. The debt for students in the United States rose from $17,233 in 2005 to $27,253 in 2012. Some blame the economy for the debt increases, but in the same 7-year period credit card debt and auto debt have decreased. According to the American Center for Progress' report on the Student Debt Crisis, within the past three decades the cost of attaining a college degree has drastically increased by more than 1,000 percent. If student debt went in rhythm with inflation since 1992, then graduates would not be facing this immense debt pressure. From 2015 to 2017, the student loan debt in United States saw a steady ascension, where New Hampshire carried the highest average debt per student, at $27,167. https://www.ovlg.com/education/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-student-loan- debt-crisis-2017.html Newer data, as of 2018, reflects an even larger crisis and cumulative level of student debt. As of 2018, a total of 44.2 Million borrowers now owe a total of over $1.5 Trillion in student debt. In addition to more borrowers, and the total amount owed having more than doubled (up 250%) from $600 Billion to $1.5 Trillion in 10 years, according to Forbes Magazine https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2018/06/13/student-loan- debt-statistics-2018/#50a5ed8d7310, the rate of delinquency greater than 90 days, or default, has doubled to over 11% nationwide, according to the Federal Reserve.https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications/fedgazette/a-rising- mountain-of-student-debt =Student loan servicers= A student loan servicer is a company which facilitates different aspects of a loan. The servicing group will typically be responsible for maintaining records on a particular loan, handling loan distribution, and providing requested information to the loan recipient. US student loan servicers include Great Lakes Educational Loan Services, Navient, FedLoan Servicing (PHEAA), MOHELA, HESC/EdFinancial, CornerStone, Granite State - GSMR, OSLA Servicing, and Debt Management and Collections System. https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/additionalInformation.action In recent years, some student loan servicers have gone under legal scrutiny for alleged wrongdoing. Navient, formerly Sallie Mae, was charged with multiple class action lawsuits for their loan servicing methods. Navient was also sued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for improper handling of borrower relations. FedLoan has also received public pressure for possible mistreatment of loan recipients. =Statistics= Student loan debt rose from $480.1 billion (3.5% GDP) in Q1 2006 to $1,683 billion (7.8% GDP) in Q1 2020. Distribution of student loan debt in the U.S. There are two types of loans students borrow in the US: Federal loans and Private loans. Federal loans have a fixed interest rate, usually lower than private loans' interest, set annually by the congress. The direct subsidized loan with the maximum amount of $5,500 has an interest rate of 4.45%, while the direct plus loan with the maximum amount of $20,500 has an interest rate of 7%. As for private loans, there are more options like fixed interest rate, variable interest rate, and income based monthly plans whose interest rates vary depending on the lender, credit history and cosigners. The average interest rate for a private loan in 2017 was 9.66%. The Economist reported in June 2014 that U.S. student loan debt exceeded $1.2 trillion with over 7 million debtors in default. In 2014, there was approximately $1.3 trillion of outstanding student loan debt in the U.S. that affected 44 million borrowers who had an average outstanding loan balance of $37,172. As of 2018, outstanding student loan debt totals 1.5 trillion. The interest rates are a major factor in the alarming debt numbers, however, the booming of prices of college is another major factor for US tremendous student debt. The Public universities increased their fees by a total of 27% over the five years ending in 2012, or 20% adjusted for inflation. Public university students paid an average of almost $8,400 annually for in-state tuition, with out-of-state students paying more than $19,000. For two decades ending in 2012, college costs rose 1.6% more than inflation each year. Government funding per student fell 27% between 2007 and 2012. Student enrollments rose from 15.2 million in 1999 to 20.4 million in 2011, but fell 2% in 2012. Bloomberg reported in July 2014 that: \\"The biggest growth in the program came in the past decade, as student debt rose an average of 14 percent a year, to $966 billion in 2012 from $364 billion in 2004, according to New York Fed data.\\" There were around 37 million student loan borrowers with outstanding student loans in 2013. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, outstanding student loan debt in the United States lies between $902 Billion and $1 Trillion with around $864 Billion in Federal student loan debt. As of Quarter 1 in 2012, the average student loan balance for all age groups is $24,301. About one-quarter of borrowers owe more than $28,000; 10% of borrowers owe more than $54,000; 3% owe more than $100,000; and less than 1%, or 167,000 people, owe more than $200,000. Of the 37 million borrowers who have outstanding student loan balances, 14%, or about 5.4 million borrowers, have at least one past due student loan account. For every student loan borrower who defaults, at least two more borrowers become delinquent without default. In 2010 for the first time ever, student loan debt exceeded credit card debt and in 2011 student debt surpassed auto loans (both of which were decreasing). According to Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of FinAid.org, student loan debt is growing by $3,000 per second. According to a report by The Institute for College Access and Success the average debt from those who graduated in 2013 topped $30,000 in six states and was only below $20,000 in one state.The Institute for College Access and Success http://ticas.org/content/pub/average-debt-2013-grads-tops-30k-6-states- only-1-below-20k-0 Data released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed that in the fourth quarter of 2014 delinquency rates for students dipped to the point where approximately one in nine student loans is past due.Federal Reserve Bank of New York http://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/research/2015/rp150217.html As of 2015 over half of outstanding student loans are in deferral, delinquency or default.Chuck Collins (March 13, 2015).

Student loan borrowers that attended a for profit, and two year community colleges, in comparison, earn low annual salaries; an average of $22,000 for people withdrawing from schools as of 2010. This means that these people have troubles paying back their loans. The new evidence is reliable with the previous data. For example, the statistics presenting that default rates are essentially lower within the demographic of borrowers with large loans than within borrowers with small loans. However, the new evidence which goes back twenty years, shows how much the scenery of borrowing has changed. Currently, most borrowers are older and attended a for profit or two year community college. About ten years ago, the standard borrower was an established student at a four-year university. In recent years, tuition has been rising due to the cuts of government funding in education. As an example, more specifically, the University of Pittsburgh has had an increase in tuition of 3.9 percent for the academic school year of 2014‚Äì15. In 2014, the U.S. Department of Education ranked Pitt as the most expensive public university for tuition and fees at $16,240, just ahead of Penn State University. In 2005, the difference in median annual income between those with a bachelor's degree vs. those with a high school diploma was $16,638, though this varies considerably by field of study.Source: US Census Bureau. See charts at Income in the United States. In January 2019, the Federal Reserve said that student loan debt has more than doubled in the last decade, and is forcing many in the millennial generation to delay buying homes. A 2019 survey by Bankrate found that student loan debt is also forcing millennials to delay other financial and life milestones, such as building emergency savings, saving for retirement, or paying off other debts. Beth Akers, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, points out that 66% of millennials have no college debt; most who do have debt proportional to their income; and that for those who drop out or fail to get a high-income job after getting an expensive degree, there are government programs that limit payments to a reasonable percentage of income and that forgive loans after 10-20 years if they cannot be repaid.Actually, most millennials aren't drowning in college debt =Social and political reactions= The growing problem of student debt has caused many reactions from young people throughout the United States. As a result, the Occupy Colleges and Occupy Student Debt movements merged in 2012 in an effort to gain support from students around the country. There have been significant efforts made via social media for the Occupy Student Debt campaign. In particular, students all over the United States have posted their personal student debt testimonies. While some success stories of students eliminating debt have been reported on, they are met with heavy skepticism. Since last October, Occupy Student Debt has provided a platform for over 800 students to share their horror stories. Because of this, other organizations such as, Rebuild the Dream, Education Trust, and the Young Invincible, have joined in the effort and started similar platforms. The Occupy College movement itself has staged over 10 direct actions. They have also gathered over 31,000 signatures on the White House's petition site, ‚ÄúWe the People‚Äù. As a result, President Obama announced the Pay as you Earn initiative. Another petition, titled 'Support the Student Loan Forgiveness Act of 2012' on MoveOn.org, which seeks similar relief for student borrowers, has gotten over one million signatures. HR 4170: ‚ÄúThe Student Loan Forgiveness Act of 2012‚Äù would give relief to borrowers with both federal and private student loans. HR 4170 also includes the ‚Äú10-10‚Äù programs, which allows borrowers to pay 10% of their discretionary income for ten years with the remaining balance forgiven afterwards. In April 2012, student loan debt reached US$1 trillion. Severity of the student debt burden represents such a threat to the middle class that some have demanded a general bailout. Anthropologist David Graeber, author of Debt: The First 5000 Years, argues that student debt is \\"destroying the imagination of youth\\": In 2014, a Chilean activist, artist Francisco Tapia, known as \\"Papas Fritas\\" (French Fries) \\"burned $500 million worth of debt papers\\" from Vi√±a del Mar University, and displayed the ashes in a van as an art project. \\"The University was being shut down due to financial irregularities. 'It is a concrete fact that the papers were burned. They are gone, burned completely, and there's no debt,' said Papas Fritas in his first U.S. broadcast interview. 'Since these papers don't exist anymore, there's no way to charge the students.' On November 12, 2015, students organized rallies at more than 100 college campuses across the United States to protest crippling student loan debt and to advocate for tuition-free higher education at public colleges and universities. The demonstrations took place just days after fast food workers went on strike for a minimum wage of $15 an hour and union rights.Students across US march over debt, free public college. Al Jazeera America. November 12, 2015. In 2015, Central Saint Martins student Brooke Purvis announced that he would burn his student loan as a form of protest art, raising awareness about student debt. It is argued the art work addresses the subject matter of the materialism of money and brings to light the political issues of the U.K student loan system. A February 2018 research paper from the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College argues that government cancellation student debt in the United States would result in rising consumer demand, along with economic growth and increased employment. Over the following decade, the GDP would increase by between $86 billion and $108 billion annually, which would result in an increase of between 1.2 and 1.5 million jobs and a decreased unemployment rate of 0.22 to 0.36 percent. In April 2019, Elizabeth Warren, a U.S. Senator from Massachusetts seeking the nomination in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, added a proposal to her presidential platform to cancel student debt and make public colleges tuition free. In June 2019, U.S. Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders, who is also seeking the 2020 Democratic nomination, offered a plan for the cancellation of all 1.6 trillion in outstanding student loan debt which would be paid for with a tax on Wall Street speculation. According to a Hill-HarrisX poll, 58% of registered voters are in favor of making public colleges tuition free and also support abolishing all outstanding student loan debt. It was revealed in September 2019 that the U.S. Army is using the student debt crisis to boost recruitment, more so than the ongoing conflicts it is engaged in, and because of this exceeded its recruitment goals. The Head of Army Recruiting Command, Maj. Gen. Frank Muth, said that \\"one of the national crises right now is student loans, so $31,000 is [about] the average. You can get out [of the Army] after four years, 100 percent paid for state college anywhere in the United States.\\" Student loan resistance groups The most visible student loan resistance groups in the US are the Debt Collective, Strike Debt, and Student Loan Justice. https://inequality.org/great-divide/activists-moving-dial- student-loan-debt/https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/05/for-some-student-loan-debt- is-doubling-tripling-and-even-quadrupling.html Canada , Canada ranks third in the world (behind Russia and South Korea) for the percentage of people in the age group of 25-34 who have completed tertiary education. But Canadians are not prone to the rapid accumulation of student loans. As of September 2012, the average debt for a Canadian leaving university was 28,000 Canadian dollars, and that accumulated debt takes an average of 14 years to fully repay based on an average starting salary of $39,523. To temporarily help their low income struggling citizens with student debt, Canada has a program called \\"interest relief\\". It grants 6 months free of mandatory payments, for a maximum of 30 months. The Canadian government pays for the interest on those loans during the grace period, so the loan amount is the same at the end of the grace period. Also, students are relieved of their debt after 15 years. As a nation, Canadians have accumulated more than $15 billion of student loan debt as they continue to fight tuition rates from further skyrocketing. United Kingdom There is concern about the level of student debt in the United Kingdom. There is also concern about possible changes in government policy forcing graduates to pay back more.Could tuition fees really cost ¬£54,000? BBC Andrew Adonis claims most student loans will never be repaid, Adonis also states that university leaders have failed to improve teaching standards but rewarded themselves handsomely with high salaries. The Institute for Fiscal Studies claims that 75% of graduates will never repay all their debts. Andrew McGettigan, loans system expert said, ‚ÄúUntil the government removes their right to retrospectively change terms, then you as a borrower appear to be on the hook to future policy changes\\".Tuition fees should be scrapped, says 'architect' of fees Andrew Adonis The Guardian Sebastian Burnside NatWest economist, said ‚ÄúThese latest figures show student debt is becoming of greater priority with every passing year. Student debt is the fastest growing type of borrowing and is rapidly becoming economically significant.‚ÄùUK student loan debt soars to more than ¬£100bn The Guardian Germany Germany has both private and public universities with the majority being public universities, which is part of the reason their graduates do not have as much debt. For undergraduate studies, public universities are free but have an enrollment fee of no more than ‚Ç¨250 per year which is roughly US$305. Their private universities cost an average of ‚Ç¨10,000 a semester which is about US$12,000. Private universities account for 7.1% enrollment with the rest attending the public universities. The private universities have a smaller teacher to student ratio and tend to offer more specialized programs which is why Germany is experiencing a boom in private universities enrollment in recent years for majors like law and medicine. However, most students still prefer public universities due to the drastic difference in tuition cost. The only expense students take out loans for in public universities is the living cost which ranges from ‚Ç¨3600 to ‚Ç¨8,200 a year depending on the university location. However, the repayment of this loan is interest free and no borrower pays more than ‚Ç¨10,000 regardless of the borrowed amount. In 2005, the average debt at graduation was ‚Ç¨5,600 which is US$6,680. The chance to gain a bachelor's through well respected universities at a reasonable price without interest packed loans attracts many foreign students as seen through increased enrollment of students from all around the world. France The average tuition for a bachelor's degree in France is around 190 euros a year, around 620 euros a year for engineering degrees, around 260 euros a year for a master's degree and around 400 euros a year for a PhD. These prices are similar to its neighboring country, Germany. Housing, transportation and health insurance costs are not included in the tuition price. Students are able to take out loans in order to pay for these expenses. Only less than 2% students take out loans as there is financial assistance to pay for the full tuition or half of the tuition for low income families, depending on their needs. Finland Excluding students from outside Switzerland, the EU, or EEA, there is no tuition fee for students studying at Finnish Universities. There are, however, many exemptions for non-Finnish citizens studying at a Finnish University to not pay tuition as well. In addition to going to college for free, students also receive student grants from the government. These grants are generally used for housing and compensates for up to 80% of rent for students who live independently and/or not qualified to receive child benefits. Through Kela, 40% of students take out student loans in addition to student grants. Student loans average to about 650 EUR a month for higher education within Finland and an average amount of 800 EUR a month for Finnish students studying abroad. These loans are not through Kela itself, but is a guaranteed loan through the student's bank of choice. Besides, student loans and grants, Finland also compensates its citizens, and others that qualify, a meal subsidy, school transport subsidy, and a student loan compensation for students who finish schooling in a target time. In August 2017, Finland saw student loan drawdowns double to 143 million EUR from August 2016 as a result of being able to borrow 650 EUR a month from the previous 400 EUR a month. The reform for financial aid resulted in students that qualify for government- guaranteed loans to increase to over 60%.  Denmark  Analogously, the educational system in Denmark resembles the one in Finland. There are no tuition fees for Danish and EU students. Students in Denmark also receive student grants from the government to enroll into an institution of higher education. Every Dane over the age of 18 is entitled to this public support if they decide to further their education. The scheme and the conditions for grants and loans are different if they are a foreign citizen. However, financial support is still available if the applicant is from one of the EU member states. Apart from the public support there are many corporate sponsored scholarships for international students with different requirements.

Further north are large towns, including and Kouka, with Boura in the extreme north in Mali. The Bobo are far from homogeneous. They are an ancient aggregation of several peoples who have assembled around a number of core clans that do not preserve any oral traditions of immigration into the area. Their language and culture are more closely related to those of their Mand√© neighbours to the north and west, the Bamana (as well as the Minianka, also known as Mamara Senoufo, and a Gur people) than to their Voltaic neighbours the Gurunsi and Mossi, but they should be thought of as a southern extension of the Mand√© people who live in what is now Burkina Faso, rather than an intrusive Mand√© group that has recently penetrated the region. Although over 41% of Bobo lineages claim a foreign origin, they also say that they are autochthonous.  Economy  Farming among the Bobo is of primary importance. Agricultural activity is not merely a way of providing for subsistence among the Bobo, it is the essential component of their day-to-day existence. The major food crops are red sorghum, pearl millet, yams, and maize. They also cultivate cotton, which is sold to textile mills in Koudougou. The imposition of colonial rule and the construction of these mills led to the disintegration of the local co-operative labor systems, which had served to bond the members of Bobo society together.  Political system  The Bobo lineage is the fundamental social building-block. The Bobo are an inherently decentralized group of people. The concept of placing political power in the hands of an individual is foreign to the Bobo. Each village is organized according to the relationship among individual patriline. The lineage unites all descendants of a common ancestor, called the wakoma, a word whose stem, wa-, is a contraction of the Bobo word for house wasa. The Bobo lineage comprises the people who live in a common house. The head of a lineage is called the wakoma or father of the lineage. He may also be called the sapro, which is the term for ancestors. As among other peoples in Burkina, each clan has a totem, so that when a Bobo introduces himself he gives his given name, then his clan name, followed by the totem that he respects.  Religion  The creator god is called Wuro. He cannot be described and is not represented by sculptures. Bobo cosmogony describes the creation of the world by Wuro and the ordering of his creations. He is responsible for the ordering of all things in the world into opposing pairs: man/spirits, male/female, village/bush, culture/nature and so on. The balances between forces as they were created by Wuro are precarious, and it is easy for men to throw the forces out of balance. Farming, for instance, can unbalance the precarious equilibrium between culture/nature and village/bush when the crops are gathered in the bush and brought into the village. For the Bobo people there are two important epochs. The time of Wuro, when the universe was created and the historical time, when Wuro gave man his son Dwo.

Greenlaw wrote three best-selling books about life as a commercial fisher: The Hungry Ocean in 1999, The Lobster Chronicles in 2002 and All Fishermen Are Liars in 2002. Her books have climbed as high as No. 2 on the New York Times bestseller list, with The Hungry Ocean remaining on the list for three months.Linda Greenlaw bio and 2007 interview, BookReporter.comDave Weich, True Tales from Linda Greenlaw , Powells.com interview, 2004 Greenlaw lives on Isle au Haut, Maine, and was the first female sword-fishing boat captain on the American East Coast.The Perfect Storm, by Sebastian Junger Early years Greenlaw was born in Connecticut, the daughter of Jim and Martha Greenlaw. Her father was an information systems manager for Bath Iron Works. She was raised in Topsham, Maine, and her family spent their summers in Isle au Haut, a village of 70 people off the coast of Maine. Greenlaw attended Colby College, where she majored in both English and government. To help pay her way through college, Linda worked as a cook and deckhand aboard the sword-fishing boat Walter Leeman during her summers. She continued working on the boat during free time and vacations and, after her graduation in 1983, continued working for the boat's owner, Alden Leeman, who installed Greenlaw as a swordfish captain in 1986 when he acquired a second vessel. Greenlaw wrote in The Hungry Ocean: \\"Being a woman hasn't been a big deal. I never anticipated problems stemming from being female, and never encountered any. I have been surprised, even embarrassed, by the number of people who are genuinely amazed that a woman might be capable of running a fishing boat.\\" Commercial fisherman Greenlaw was the captain of the Hannah Boden in October 1991 when Andrea Gail sank in the Atlantic in the 1991 Perfect Storm. Greenlaw's efforts to warn the Andrea Gail about the impending storm were portrayed in Sebastian Junger's 1997 book The Perfect Storm and in the movie version, in which she was played by Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. Junger called Greenlaw not just the only female swordfishing captain, but \\"one of the best captains, period, on the entire East Coast.\\" In 1997, Greenlaw settled in Isle au Haut, and bought a lobster boat, the 35-foot Mattie Belle. On May 28, 2009, Greenlaw was convicted of illegally entering and illegally fishing in Canadian waters by the Provincial Court of Newfoundland and Labrador. The Crown asked for a fine of CAD$53,000, while the defense recommended a fine of half that amount. She was fined $38,000 after the judge found she did not use \\"due diligence\\". Writer Greenlaw's first book, The Hungry Ocean (1999), described a one-month swordfishing voyage, entailing, \\"among other things, treacherous weather, uncooperative fish, wildly entertaining shipmates, and the exhausting, mind-bending pressure of ten consecutive 21-hour days.\\" Subsequent books include The Lobster Chronicles: Life on a Very Small Island (2002), All Fishermen Are Liars: True Tales from the Dry Dock Bar (2004), Seaworthy: A Swordboat Captain Returns to the Sea (2010), and Lifesaving Lessons: Notes from an Accidental Mother (2013). Greenlaw has co-authored two cookbooks with her mother, Martha Greenlaw, and published four novels of detective fiction‚ÄîSlipknot (2007), Fisherman's Bend (2008), Shiver Hitch (2017) and Bimini Twist (2018) ‚Äî all the names of knots and featuring her fictional detective Jane Bunker.

It extended for from an intersection with NY 93 in the Erie County village of Akron to a junction with NY 77 in the Genesee County hamlet of Basom. Part of NY 267 in Genesee County passed through the Tonawanda Indian Reservation. The portion of NY 267 within Erie County was assigned . NY 267 was extended east to NY 77 in Basom in the late 1930s, replacing New York State Route 77A, a spur leading from NY 77 to the eastern edge of the Tonawanda Reservation. The Erie County segment of the route was transferred from the state of New York to Erie County in April 1980, leading to the total removal of the NY 267 designation in August of that year. Route description NY 267 reference marker along John Street in Akron NY 267 began at an intersection with NY 93 in the village of Akron in eastern Erie County. The route headed eastward, following John Street through downtown Akron. NY 267 broke from John Street just four blocks later. While the street continued east to serve Akron Airport, the route turned northeast to follow Bloomingdale Road out of the village. The route continued through gradually less developed areas of the town of Newstead, intersecting with County Route 250 (CR 250, named Scotland Road). NY 267 crossed into Genesee County soon afterward. In the Genesee County town of Alabama, NY 267 made a slight turn to the north as it entered the Tonawanda Indian Reservation. Once inside the reservation, the route remained on a north-northeasterly alignment for about to a junction with Parker Road. At this point, the highway turned to the east, progressing across the reservation. At an intersection with Reuben Road later, NY 267 turned to the north for another before it exited the reservation. The route continued for roughly to the hamlet of Basom, where it terminated at an intersection with NY 77. History NY 267 was assigned to a routing extending from NY 93 in Akron to the Erie‚ÄìGenesee county line by way of John Street and Bloomingdale Road. Farther east, the portion of Bloomingdale Road between the Tonawanda Indian Reservation and NY 77 was designated as NY 77A around the same time. NY 77A and the remainder of Bloomingdale Road within Genesee County became an extension of NY 267 in the late 1930s. On April 1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of the portion of NY 267 within Erie County‚Äîby this point the lone state-maintained portion of the route‚Äîwas transferred from the state of New York to Erie County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. The NY 267 designation was removed from the entirety of its routing just over four months later on August 14, 1980.

(born 11 April 1984 in Duisburg) is a German footballer who last played for 1. FC Kaiserslautern II. Dustin's father, Dirk Heun, was also a professional footballer and made 10 appearances in the Bundesliga. Career =Club career= Heun, whose father Dirk Heun was active as a professional footballer for Tennis Borussia Berlin and Rot-Wei√ü Oberhausen, started his professional career with KFC Uerdingen 05. In his first Regionalliga season in 2002/03 he scored two goals in seven games. After two more years at the KFC and 14 goals in 57 games, he moved to the 2. Bundesliga club Eintracht Braunschweig after KFC was relegated. He was used 23 times in his first season, mostly as a substituter for a few minutes. In the 2006/07 season he moved to Regionalliga club VfB L√ºbeck shortly before the end of the 2006 summer transfermarket. Heun immediately became a regular player, scoring 12 goals in his first season. In addition, he scored the winning goal in the DFB Cup against TSV 1860 Munich. During the winter break of 2007/08, Heun moved from L√ºbeck to league rivals 1. FC Union Berlin, where he initially had a promising start (with three goals in six games), but then failed due to injury for the rest of the second half of the season. In the rehabilitation phase, an appendix operation threw him back in June 2008. In September 2008 Heun was able to resume training with the third division team after a break of more than six months. On March 18, 2009 he celebrated his comeback game - after almost exactly a year break - against SV Wacker Burghausen. In May 2009 the sports management of 1. FC Union announced that the contract with Heun would end on June 30, 2009 and wouldn't be extended as originally planned. In the 2009/10 season Heun was under contract with the 1. FC Kaiserslautern II. Due to persistent injury concerns, he ended his professional career after the season. From summer 2012 to summer 2013, Heun played amateur soccer again, joining TSV Geitelde. =Later career= Heun became disabled in sports, completed a two-year retraining course, was an intern for video analysis with Lorenz-G√ºnther K√∂stner, coach of the 2nd team at VfL Wolfsburg, from 2012, and worked as a scout and analyst at VfL U23 from 2015 under Val√©rien Isma√´l and from November 2016 as video analyst for Ismael, who became the coach of the first team.Isma√´ls Adlerauge: √úber Taktik, Spieler und die Gegner wei√ü Heun Bescheid, sportbuzzer.de, 16 January 2017https://www.waz- online.de/Sportbuzzer/VfL-Wolfsburg/Tribuenenadler-Ismaels-Co-Trainer-schaut- von-oben-zu Trib√ºnenadler: Isma√´ls Co-Trainer schaut von oben zu], waz- online.de, 13 November 2016 In March 2017, he began working as a scout for VfL Wolfsburg again.

It is displayed at the Archaeological Museum of Olympia. It is traditionally attributed to Praxiteles and dated to the 4th century BC, based on a remark by the 2nd century Greek traveller Pausanias, and has made a major contribution to the definition of Praxitelean style. Its attribution is, however, the object of fierce controversy among art historians. The sculpture is unlikely to have been one of Praxiteles' famous works, as no ancient replicas of it have been identified. The documentary evidence associating the work with Praxiteles is based on a passing mention by the 2nd-century AD traveller Pausanias.  Loss  The Olympia site was hit by an earthquake during the reign of the Roman emperor Diocletian in the final years of the third century C.E, collapsing the roof of the Temple of Hera and burying the statue in rubble.  Rediscovery  In 1874, the Greek state signed an agreement with Germany for an archaeological exploration of the Olympia site, Helmut Kyrieleis, \\"Les fouilles allemandes √† Olympie\\", in Olympie, from a conference at the Louvre from 18 January to 15 March 1999, Documentation fran√ßaise, Paris, 2001, p. 50. which was first dug in the French Morea expedition of 1829. The German excavations in 1875 were led by Ernst Curtius. On 8 May 1877, in the temple of Hera, he uncovered the body (head, torso, legs, left arm) of a statue of a young man resting against a tree trunk covered by a mantle. Protected by the thick clay layer above it, it was in an exceptionally good state of preservation. It took six more separate discoveries to uncover the rest of the statue as it is displayed today. Hermes is still missing his right forearm, two fingers of his left hand, both forearms below the elbow, the left foot and his penis, whilst Dionysus is missing his arms (except the right hand on Hermes's shoulder) and the end of his right foot. Much of the tree trunk and the plinth are also lost. However, an ancient base survives, made of a grey limestone block between two blocks of marble.  Technical considerations  Head of the Hermes figure, remarkable for its highly polished finish The group is sculpted from a block of the best quality of Parian marble. Hermes measures 2.10/2.12 m, 3.70 m with the base. The right foot of Hermes is integral with a section of the base, which has undergone some adjustment in antiquity. The face and torso of Hermes are striking for their highly polished, glowing surface, which John Boardman half-jokingly attributed to generations of female temple workers.Boardman, La Sculpture grecque du second classicisme, Thames & Hudson, Paris, 1998, p. 53. The back, by contrast, shows the marks of the rasp and chisel, and the rest of the sculpture is incompletely finished. At the time of its discovery, the hair retained slight traces of cinnabar,Noted by Alfred Emerson, \\"Letter from Olympia\\", The American Journal of Archaeology and of the History of Fine Arts 3.1-2, (June 1887), p. 96.. a form of mercury sulfate with a red color, perhaps a preparation for gilding.Carpenter, p. 7. Cinnabar tints are retained on the sandal straps of the original foot, with traces of gilding. The sandal also bears the motif of a Heraclean knot, which was probably extended in paint.

SOS CVI provides a home to almost 15,000 children in 34 children's villages, located in various parts of the country. In addition to the children's villages, SOS provides indirect care to children through its 122 allied projects such as kindergartens, schools and social, medical and vocational training centres throughout India. SOS CVI provides direct and indirect care to almost 200,000 (200,000) children in the country.  Early life  Jagan Nath Kaul was born in Srinagar, and his early schooling was in Kashmir. His education continued at the Universities of the Punjab, Rajasthan and Delhi. After completing his master's degree in economics Kaul began his professional career with the city of Delhi, rising to the positions of chief of probation services and assistant director of social welfare. In 1962 he received a Fulbright scholarship, and travelled to the USA for advanced studies in child and youth care at Case Western Reserve University. In 1963 Kaul met Hermann Gmeiner (who was visiting India), and went on to establish SOS Children's Villages of India with the support of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.  SOS Children's Village  alt=Awards ceremony including Jagan Nath Kaul The 1963 meeting between Kaul and Gmeiner (who was visiting India to establish SOS Children's Villages there) was a meeting of the minds. Kaul identified completely with the SOS concept, and agreed to return to India and attempt to set up SOS Children's Villages there. He dedicated the rest of his life to caring for children, starting a movement when he established the first SOS Children's Village at Greenfields in Faridabad in 1968 with the active support of then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The first SOS Children's Village in India Greenfields cared for over 200 children. After that, Kaul's mission was to bring succour to any child suffering due to man-made tragedies or natural disasters. Kaul was village director of SOS Children's Village Greenfields from its beginning. He hoped to reach out to as many children in India as possible and to establish at least one SOS Children's Village in every province. As of 2011 India has 31 SOS Children's Villages, and 75 other projects. Kaul succeeded in involving thousands of Indians in fulfilling their social responsibilities towards children. A believer in partnership between government and the people, he did not hesitate to demand and stand up for the rights of children. Kaul served SOS Children's Villages of India in various capacities, first as a village director and rising in position and responsibility as the organisation grew to the position of Secretary-General. From 1989 to July 2007, he was honorary president and patron of the national association. He also served two terms as Senator for SOS-Kinderdorf International. While Kaul received numerous awards for his efforts and commitment to the children of India (and is possibly the most-decorated social worker in India), his favourite reward was being lovingly called Papaji (revered father) by all in the SOS family. Kaul succeeded in involving thousands of Indians in contributing to the cause of child protection, maintaining: \\"When we give a child a home, we are expressing our belief in life and the fundamental good in people\\".

Built in 1910, the Ruthmere Mansion is now open to the public as a museum, along with the neighboring Dr. Havilah Beardsley House. Ruthmere is located along the St. Joseph River in Elkhart. The architect was Enock Hill Turnock, commissioned by Albert and Elizabeth Beardsley in 1908. The Beardsleys named the mansion in memory of their only child, Ruth, who died at seven months. (\\"Mere\\" reflects the Latin root maris and refers to the home's proximity to water.) The mansion was a place of business, family, political and social gatherings until the deaths of the Beardsleys in 1924. Robert Beardsley of The Beardsley Foundation purchased the mansion in 1967 with the main goal of restoring it to its original beauty in order to create a museum for the community. Restoration took place between 1969 and 1973 when the mansion was made available to the public. The property was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978, and the Beardsley Avenue Historic District was established several years later. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs. Interior design and decor Ruthmere is a three-story house with a basement. The first floor consists of the library, drawing room, dining room and kitchen area. The second floor is private bed and bathrooms and the service quarters. The third floor is primarily for storage. The basement has a game room and working area of house (boiler, wash room). There is also a tunnel that connects the game room to the greenhouse. Cuban mahogany is the primary wood on the first floor. Pomegranates, a symbol of wealth and prosperity, are found throughout the house carved in plaster and wood as well as stenciling on ceilings. Silk wall coverings are used in a majority of the rooms instead of wallpaper. Beautiful hand painted stencils adorn many ceilings. Hand-painted murals of scenes of Italy also adorn walls and windows. The house also has a fine art collection, part of the museum's collection, displayed throughout the house. You can find Louis Comfort Tiffany lamps and windows as well as Auguste Rodin sculptures. Exterior architecture and design Ruthmere was designed by E. Hill Turnock in an eclectic Beaux-Arts style with Prairie School accents. The three-story structure is faced with buff-colored Belden brick from Ohio and native Indiana limestone. Carved stone quoins, capitals, cartouches and window surrounds add exterior interest. The covered entrance is supported by square brick pillars created by carved limestone capitals. A balustraded marble piazza across the south facade extends to the east side of the building where a porte cochere protects visitors as they arrive by carriage or car. From the east porch a covered walkway leads to a greenhouse. The garage is located to the north of the house. Originally the second floor was an apartment for the chauffeur. In 1980, it was turned into The Robert B. Beardsley Arts Reference Library of American Domestic Architecture and Decorative Arts. The library is a free facility, open to the public by appointment. While the materials do not circulate, the library provides copy services as well as reference services. The library's catalog is accessible through the Elkhart Public Library Catalog . Facts Albert and Elizabeth Beardsley moved into their home in 1910 and for 14 years, Ruthmere was a place where they entertained friends and business associates in grand style. Elizabeth and Albert both died within a few short months of each other in 1924. Albert's nephew, Arthur Beardsley and his wife Stella lived at Ruthmere until Stella's death in 1940 and Arthur's death in 1944. The Sherill and Helen Deputy family moved into Ruthmere in 1945, raising six boys in the house--the first and only children to ever call Ruthmere home. In 1969, the Deputys sold Ruthmere to the Beardsley Foundation, which restored the home to its former glory, with the express purpose of creating a museum for the community and the region.

The premises is run by the Dorak Holding.  History  Towards to the end of the 19th century, the four-storey wooden mansion was built for ≈û√ºkr√º Bey, minister of the tobacco monopoly in the Ottoman government. After the death of the owner, the great house gradually fell into a state of neglect. In 1977, the mansion up for sale, was purchased by the TTOK.Istanbul Ye≈üil Ev-History The old wooden building had to be demolished and rebuilt with the consent of the \\"Commission for Ancient Monuments\\", since it was so far beyond repair. The exterior of the house was remade as an exact replica, while the layout with nineteen rooms was carefully preserved. The restoration works, initiated by √áelik G√ºlersoy, the CEO of the TTOK, accomplished by March 1984, and the unique building opened as a hotel named \\"Ye≈üil Ev\\" after its exterior color. Combining historical style with modern standards, it very quickly gained a worldwide reputation and was awarded in 1985 the medal for the year by \\"Europa Nostra\\".

It is commonly known as the scrambled egg slime, or flowers of tan because of its peculiar yellowish, bile-colored appearance. Also known as the dog vomit slime mold, it is common with a worldwide distribution, and it is often found on bark mulch in urban areas after heavy rain or excessive watering. Their spores are produced on or in aerial sporangia and are spread by wind. History and taxonomy The first description of the species was provided by French botanist Jean Marchant in 1727, who referred to it as \\"fleur de tan\\" (bark flower); Marchant also classified it as \\"des √©ponges\\" (one of the sponges). Carl Linnaeus called it Mucor septicus in his 1763 Species Plantarum. The species was transferred to the genus Fuligo by German botanist Friedrich Heinrich Wiggers in 1780. Description and habitat Close-up of the yellow aethelia Like many slime molds, the cells of this species typically aggregate to form a plasmodium, a multinucleate mass of undifferentiated cells that may move in an ameboid-like fashion during the search for nutrients. F. septica's plasmodium may be anywhere from white to yellow-gray, typically in diameter, and thick. The plasmodium eventually transforms into a sponge-like aethalium, analogous to the spore-bearing fruiting body of a mushroom; which then degrades, darkening in color, and releases its dark-colored spores. F. septica produces the largest aethalium of any slime mold. This species is known to have its spores dispersed by beetles (family Latridiidae). The spores have a two-layered wall, with a dense outer layer with spines, and a fibrous inner layer. During germination, the outer layer splits to create an opening, and more elastic inner layer ruptures later as protoplasm emerges. A remnant of the inner layer may be persistent and adhere to the protoplast after it has emerged from the spore. A peroxidase enzyme present in the inner cell wall plays a role in germination. Fuligo septica grows on rotten wood and plant debris, but can also grow on the leaves and stems of living plants. Resistance to metal toxicity Slime molds have a high resistance to toxic levels of metals; one author was prompted to write \\"The levels of Zn in Fuligo septica were so high (4,000‚Äì20,000 ppm) that it is difficult to understand how a living organism can tolerate them.\\" The resistance to extreme levels of zinc appears to be unique to F. septica. The mechanism of this metal resistance is now understood: F. septica produces a yellow pigment called fuligorubin A, which has been shown to chelate metals and convert them to inactive forms. Bioactive compounds Extracts from F. septica show antibiotic activity against Bacillus subtilis and Candida albicans, and cytotoxic activity on KB cells (a cell line derived from a human carcinoma of the nasopharynx). Fuligo septica contains a yellow pigment called fuligorubin A that is thought to be involved in photoreception and in the process of energy conversion during its life cycle. In 2011 a Japanese research group reported isolating and characterizing a new chlorine-containing yellow pigment from a specific strain of the organism that they called dehydrofuligoic acid. Relationship to humans =Folklore= In Scandinavian folklore, Fuligo septica is identified as the vomit of troll cats. In Finland, F. septica was believed to be used by witches to spoil their neighbors' milk. This gives it the name paranvoi, meaning \\"butter of the familiar spirit\\". In Dutch, \\"heksenboter\\" refers to \\"witches' butter\\". In Latvian, the slime mold (amongst other slime molds) is called \\"ragansviests\\" as \\"witches' butter\\" or \\"raganu spƒºƒÅviens\\" as \\"witches' spit\\" but it is unclear about the origins of these names. =Human pathogenicity= This species is known to trigger episodes of asthma and allergic rhinitis in susceptible people. =Model of RNA processing= Introns are sections of DNA that must be properly cleaved, digested and processed prior to rendering functional mRNAs for protein synthesis. Because it has a large number of group I introns, F. septica is used as a model to understand the processing and evolution of RNA.

It is native to the southwest Pacific Ocean from southern Japan to the Marquesan Islands. Name The scooter dragonet is often referred to as the ocellated dragonet and, in the aquarium trade, as the scooter blenny. This often causes confusion because many then believe that the species is a member of the blenny family when it is actually not. The same species is also occasionally listed under the scientific name Neosynchiropus ocellatus, and many mistakenly believe they are separate species. Description The scooter dragonet grows to approximately long. Viewed from above, it is distinctly diamond-shaped with the horizontal pectoral fins located at its widest point. It is brown and tan with a striped or spotted pattern- males are usually more colorful and have a large sail-like dorsal fin that is bright orange at the base. Habitat The scooter dragonet is a reef-associated bottom dwelling fish that inhabits shallow, tropical waters, usually sandy lagoons or rocky reefs. They tend to form loose congregations of several individuals, but do not exhibit schooling behavior or other forms of social cooperation. Scooter dragonets' diet consists almost entirely of Copepods: small zooplankton living in the water column. However, in captivity the Scooter Dragonet can often be acclimated to consuming live, frozen or even artificial foods, such as flakes.

Some 115 examples of the type are known, of which the best known is in the Capitoline Museums. Description The Resting Satyr statue type shows a youthful satyr, sometimes referred to as a faun, who is identifiable by his clearly pointed ears and the pardalide (panther pelt) worn across his torso or placed on a post near the satyr. The satyr rests his right elbow on a tree trunk, in a relaxed pose, supported only on his left leg. His right leg is bent, with his right foot just touching his left heel. In a number of examples, a restorer has added an attribute held in the right hand, often a flute or Pan pipes, while the left hand is on the left hip holding down the pelt. The facial features are well defined and the nose slightly upturned. The hair is often heavy, curled, and held by a cord or a crown. According to E.M. Hurll, the Resting Satyr was originally displayed at the streets Tripods in Athens. As this is thought to be one of many satyr types produced by Praxiteles, this sculptures defining features are the relaxed s-shaped slant of the body as well as relaxed pose of the arms characteristic of the artist's work. Satyr origin and iconography Farnese Faun, Louvre (Ma 664) In Ancient Greek Mythology, Satyrs are male companions to Dionysus, the god of grape harvest, ritual madness, theater, and fertility. As followers of Dionysus, satyrs are known for their love of wine, women, and playing music on their pipes or flutes. Famous satyrs in mythology include Silenus, a satyr nurse to the Dionysus and a demi-god of excessive drunkenness and Tityri, a flute-playing satyr in the train of Dionysus. Satyrs are referenced in The Homeric Hymns, Aesop's Fables, The Orphic Hymns, Ovid's Metamorphoses and Fasti, and Virgil's Georgics. In early Greek art, satyrs were often portrayed as rugged, older, and ugly in art. The artist Praxiteles is credited with creating a softer and youthful satyr type in his sculptures. The presence of the panther pelt on the Satyr signifies their connection to their beastly animal nature. Satyrs were also often depicted on pottery as nude with an erect phallus to infer their savage and brutish sexual nature. The iconography involving their sexual nature did not carry over into the medium of sculpture. Satyrs are often depicted with musical instruments, usual a flute or pipes. The inclusion of musical instruments solidifies the satyr's connection with Dionysus and his festivities. Attribution The Resting Satyr is traditionally identified as the \\"satyr peribo√™tos\\" mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his Natural History XXXIV, 69: :\\"[Praxiteles produced in bronze] a Liber Pater, and a famous Drunkard, and a satyr that the Greeks call peribo√™tos :(et Liberum patrum Ebriatem nobilemque una satyrum quem Gr√¶ci periboeton cognominant) Since Winckelmann this word has traditionally been translated as \\"famous\\".\\"The whole world talks of his Satyr, object of innumerable praises ().\\" - History of the Art of Antiquity This celebrity explains the large number of examples of this type, one of the most popular in the Mediterranean - just under 115 have been found, including 15 from Rome, 4 from North Africa, 8 from Greece, two from Spain and one from Gaul.Bartman, p. 54. According to H.S. Jones, there is no documented motive for the creation of this statue type but infers that the motive was most likely purely artistic. The resting satyr type is just one of the satyr types attributed to Praxiteles. The pouring satyr type is the other most common satyr type attributed to him. The resting satyr type and pouring satyr type share much of the same satyr iconography including references to their relationship with Dionysus. The pouring satyr type depicts the satyr with one arm raised above their head with a pouring vessel. The difference in pose is the most notable difference between the two types. Other known copies According to KJ. Hartswick, two copies of Praxiteles Resting Satyr were found in the Gardens of Sallust where there were several other Dionysiac sculptures. Another copy of the statue was found at the []Villa Borghese and was initially mistaken as a sculpture of Dionysus. One-fifth of the approximately 115 surviving copies are miniatures. Compared to the large scale copies of this sculpture, the miniatures have a lack of uniformity in proportions. *Resting Satyr.

Mentions in literature American novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne's 1860 Gothic novel, The Marble Faun, centers around Donatello, a man who is believed to be a descendant of Praxiteles‚Äô Marble Faun due to his uncanny resemblance to the sculpture. The novel was inspired by Hawthorne‚Äôs visit to the Palazzo Nuovo of the Capitoline Museum in Rome after moving his family to Italy in 1858. This novel was later adapted into a 1996 opera, with music by Ellen Bender and a liberetto by Jessica Treadway.

This command was established few months after the Lebanese Army was handed to Lebanon from the French Mandate, and thus it is considered one of the oldest units in the army. History The North regional command was founded in 1946, and used to have three military bases, Youssef Rahmeh military base (located in the Cedar region), George al-Nghayweh military base (located in Andqit) and the Second Sharp Shooters Regiment. In the early 1960s up until the early 1970s, three ground forces were added to the base, which were the Seventh Sharp Shooters Regiment, the Fourth Artillery Regiment and the Third Armored Regiment. Later, a brigade previously used for operations was established, named the Second Brigade and was given its command to the regional commander. In 1983, the Second Brigade was detached from the base and became directly connected to the Lebanese army, thus the authority of the regional commander became limited to logistics, operational, and emergency missions. Currently, and in addition to the Cedar and Andqit military bases, the military regional command controls two other bases, Nohra al-Shalouhi military base in Batroun and Najib Salameh military base in Kleyate. Mission The mission of the military base includes: * Securing and defending the regional command's military barracks and facilities. * Taking over, by order from the Lebanese Army command, the place of the brigades that spread inside its territorial periphery, in order for the brigades to focus on its operational objectives. * Helping civilians in case of disasters and taking part in the differing development programs. In addition, the military base have also operational and training missions. Operational missions include peacekeeping and reinforcing the abilities of the brigades and regiments in the region, implementing a semi and full alert day and detecting all sorts of explosives, in addition to supervising development programs, supplying emergency units during national religious holidays and offering a communication system for the deployed brigades and regiments in the region. Training missions include supervising shooting ranges located in the region (taking into consideration the security precautions), giving annual physical exams to the officers, army and those who are nominated for promotion due to long periods of military service, giving preliminary exams to the educational offices and supervising the military sports stadiums located in the region. Conscription The department for conscription was founded on December 9, 1993. Its three main objectives are: # Administrative, which includes receiving new conscripts and preparing their registration procedures. # Operational, in which defensive positioning is implemented in the region where conscription takes place. # Developmental, which includes tasks such as reporting casualties, rescue and preserving archaeological remains and forests. Emblem The emblem of the North regional command is constituted of Cedar trees with snow-capped mountains, the fortress of Tripoli, and a sword in the middle, while surrounded by two laurel leaves and the Arabic inscription of the military base's name.

It generally spends the daytime buried in sand, digging itself in tail first. It has a well-developed sense of smell which it uses to locate its prey, which include crustaceans, banded snake eels and other small fish, while they are buried in the sediment. At night, it sometimes aggregates in large numbers at locations where there is artificial lighting. Little is known about the reproduction of this species; the sexes are separate and the larvae are leaf-shaped and known as leptocephali.

Since Mzoli's opened in early 2003, the restaurant has become a popular gathering spot for Cape Town residents and a tourist attraction. Amongst Gugulethu's residents, Mzoli's Place has a reputation for public drunkenness and disrespect for the local community. Mzoli's is named after the founder and owner, Mzoli Ngcawuzele.  History  The establishment opened in early 2003. Owner Mzoli Ngcawuzele obtained start-up funding from the Development Bank of South Africa, which supports black-owned businesses. In October 2006, an economic study said that Mzoli had \\"moved, from selling meat informally from a garage, to owning one of the most popular hangouts in Cape Town\\". In November 2006, more than 30 restaurant patrons, including a group of tourists and Democratic Alliance councillor Masizole Mnqasela, were arrested in a police raid for drinking in public. The restaurant did not sell alcohol, but Ngcawuzele explained that he could not stop people from bringing their own. The incident generated controversy in the local press. Tour operator Ryan Hunt claimed that police swore at the patrons and threatened people for asking questions. \\"The police created a dangerous situation. People are always encouraged to visit township attractions, but now they are turned away with that kind of situation,\\" he said.Zara Nicholson. \\"Swearing cops 'disgust' arrested tour operator\\".

Business  Located in the township of Gugulethu, a black neighbourhood southeast of the centre of Cape Town, Mzoli's is a \\"do-it-yourself\\" market and eatery, selling meat to patrons who in turn hire independent entrepreneurs running braai stalls on the grounds to grill the meat and prepare meals.

In 2016, the Travel Channel show Secret Eats with Adam Richman featured a segment at Mzoli's during an episode filmed in Cape Town. Reception by locals Some local residents near a long-planned shopping mall that is being built by a business partly owned by Mzoli's owner criticized his plans in 2008. Some businesses were legally evicted or threatened with eviction from older buildings owned by Mzoli, which were then knocked down to make room for the new property development. Other nearby residents have complained that the property developer has not hired enough local residents. Critics threatened to vandalize or burn both Mzoli's Place and Ngcawuzele's home if he did not meet their demands for jobs and permanent, guaranteed space for informal traders at the new shopping mall.

It occasionally makes its way into the aquarium trade. It grows to a maximum length of but a more common length is about . Description The chain moray is an elongated, heavy, eel-like fish that commonly grows to a length of about . The head has a rounded snout and pointed, blunt teeth, especially on the roof of the mouth. These teeth are used to crush the shells of crabs, their main source of food. The dorsal, tail and anal fins are combined into a single long fin, and there are no pectoral or ventral fins. The skin does not bear scales but is covered with a layer of clear mucus. This fish is dark brown to black, marked with an interconnecting lattice-work of yellow, chain-like lines. The eyes are yellow. Distribution and habitat The species is found in the western Atlantic Ocean where its range extends from Bermuda, Florida and the Bahamas to the Antilles and Brazil. It is common in the Caribbean, and is also reported from the eastern Atlantic (Cape Verde and Ascension Island) and some southern Atlantic islands. It is found on reefs and rocky shores in clear water at depths of less than , and usually within 2 metres (6 ft) of the surface. Ecology Mainly nocturnal, the chain moray hides in holes and crevices in shallow water during the day, often with its head projecting. It continually opens and closes its mouth to increase the flow of water over its gills. A carnivore, it feeds on such organisms as crabs, which are the mainstay of its diet, shrimps, worms and small fish. Its blunt teeth are especially adapted for feeding on crustaceans. It does not always leave its hiding place to forage, sometimes remaining where it is, ready to grab any prey that passes. It sometimes forages in tide pools and is able to survive for up to half an hour out of water. As well as ambushing prey, its feeding strategies include searching under the rims of pools, beneath rocks and in holes for prey, stalking observed prey or chasing it for a distance of up to . When close enough to its prey, usually when it is within , it strikes, an action it can perform with its body wholly or partly out of the water. When captured, large crabs are torn apart while small ones are swallowed whole.

Reception The production received considerable acclaim from critics such as Ben Brantley of the New York Times and Michael Feingold of The Village Voice.Brantley, Ben. However, Pamela Renner reviewed the premiere unfavorably in Variety, with most praise reserved for Ron Cephas Jones. Renner criticized the characters of Hanraham and Valdez as heavy-handed, and also considered the play to contain \\"awkward exposition. It is freighted by an overload of pseudo-profundity; characters upbraiding each other about the Ultimate Questions can make for rather dreary stagecraft.\\" In a review of one of Guirgis's later works, Hilton Als described Jesus Hopped the 'A' Train as \\"hysterical and irreverent\\", \\"an outstanding 2000 piece about imprisonment and moral responsibility.\\" Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter reviewed a 2017 revival favorably, praising the \\"incisive characterizations and riveting dialogue\\".

Michael Billington of The Guardian, who had given the play three out of five stars in 2002, gave the same rating after a 2019 performance and said that \\"for all the vividness of the dialogue, the play still strikes me as baffling in its exploration of guilt, faith and redemption.\\" Billington quipped that Angel's final sacrificial gesture \\"smacks more of romantic fiction than spiritual redemption [...] I enjoyed the production without fully believing in Guirgis's vision of crime and punishment.\\" J.

Originally released for Microsoft Windows only, Serious Sam rising popularity resulted in the porting of the episodes to the Xbox, GameCube, PlayStation 2, Game Boy Advance, Linux and Palm OS, as well as in the remaking of both episodes for Microsoft Windows, Linux and Xbox 360 in high-definition. The series follows the adventures of protagonist Sam \\"Serious\\" Stone and his fight against the forces of the notorious extraterrestrial overlord Mental who seeks to destroy humanity.  Gameplay  Enemies spawn frequently and attack in large waves from across the game map, and the player is intended to dodge their projectiles and charges by jumping and strafing rather than by taking cover. Health and armor are non-regenerative on most difficulty levels, and instead are replenished with the health and armor packs which are littered throughout the game. Available health is represented by a percentage number on the screen. The combat is high-paced and frenetic: The levels typically consist of a series of elaborate arenas, in which the player will defeat a set number of re-spawning enemies before proceeding to the next. Enemies range from soldiers with rocket launchers to gigantic charging robots to shrieking suicide bombers without heads and holding bombs. The environments include ancient Egyptian pyramids, tropical rainforests, and medieval castles. Serious Sam features cooperative gameplay through a split-screen mode and via the internet.  Episodes  Serious Sam consists of two episodes: Serious Sam: The First Encounter and Serious Sam: The Second Encounter. A fan-made level-pack, Dark Island, was included in Serious Sam: Gold. The games are on separate CDs (in the UK version) and are identical to their individual releases, except that the Sam character model for The First Encounter was modified to match the one used in The Second Encounter. After the release of the remakes, both titles had \\"Classic\\" added to the name to prevent confusion. = Serious Sam: The First Encounter = The First Encounter was the first game in the series; it had been in the making since 1996 and had a video showing its early game play in 2000. The First Encounter was originally developed by Croteam as a demonstrator for their engine and this is the reason why some countries saw its initial release priced at less than half the price of other games in the genre. In ancient times, Earth was involved in a massive conflict between Mental, an evil extraterrestrial being who wants to rule the universe, and the Sirians, a technologically advanced sentient alien race that left many of its artefacts to be discovered by humanity. In the 22nd century, Mental and his army of grotesquely twisted monsters return to Earth intending to destroy humanity. The humans are quickly overwhelmed and driven back to Earth. As a last resort, humanity uses the \\"Time-Lock\\". This mysterious Sirian artefact contains the power to transport a single person back to a chosen point in time. Because of his bravery in fighting these monsters, Sam \\"Serious\\" Stone is chosen to use the Time-Lock in hopes that he will defeat Mental and change the course of history. As the game opens, Sam appears in Egypt. He travels from one Egyptian monument to the next, fighting against the monsters Mental sent after him along the way. During Sam's journey, Sam is able to find and activate a hidden Sirian communicator in the shape of an obelisk located in Luxor, which summons a Sirian starship to Earth from deep space. Sam rushes to the Great Pyramids of Giza in order to rendezvous with the starship, only to be cornered by Mental's general, Ugh Zan III. After defeating the giant, Sam then teleports himself onto the starship. While Sam is aboard the \\"SSS Centerprice\\", he leaves a phone message to Mental telling him that \\"he has a special delivery package for him\\" and sets a course to Sirius, the Sirian homeworld. = Serious Sam: The Second Encounter = The Second Encounter starts where the previous game left off, with Sam traveling to Sirius on the SSS Centerprice. Unfortunately, the starship is accidentally hit by the \\"Croteam crate-bus\\" and plummets down to Earth's surface. As the starship falls, Sam reads the coordinates and frets about crash-landing into Egypt again, but instead he crashes into Central America in the Mayan age, with the starship now heavily damaged upon impact. However, not all hope is lost, since the Sirians left a \\"back-up starship\\" on Earth, which was a fail-safe in case anything ever happened to the SSS Centerprice. However, since this back-up starship is located in a different time and age than where and when Sam currently is, he will have to uncover the locations of the Sirian portals that will help him reach his destination. With this new objective, Sam storms through Mesoamerica, then travels to Mesopotamia and finally to Medieval Europe where the back-up starship is located. During his journey, Sam battles two of Mental's portal guardians: a powerful Mayan spirit named Kukulkan the Wind God and a biomechanical creature called the Exotech Larva. Finally, in front of the Cathedral of Sacred Blood, Sam confronts the last obstacle to overcome on his path to the Holy Grail, Mordekai the Summoner. After a glorious battle with Mordekai and his spawning minions, The Summoner is finally silenced forever. In the Cathedral, Sam lifts the Holy Grail in the palms of his hands, followed by his sarcastic confessions of his sins in a booth to Mental, during which he tells Mental that \\"he's coming to get him.\\" During the end credits, Sam activates the back-up starship, which turns out to be a rocket, and travels back into space toward Sirius, with the \\"Croteam Big- Heads\\" cheering him on. The story continues on to Serious Sam II. Other than the more varied locations, The Second Encounter features some additional weapons‚Äîa chainsaw, a flamethrower, a sniper rifle, and the powerful Serious Bomb‚Äîand a number of new monsters that Sam has to face. This game has also seen the release of a level-pack titled Dark Island, featuring fan-made levels for single and multiplayer mode. The Second Encounter soundtrack featured three instrumental songs from the Croatian heavy-metal band Undercode.  Development  Croteam created their own engine for use in both The First Encounter and The Second Encounter. Named the \\"Serious Engine\\", it is designed to cope with extremely large view distances and massive numbers of models by implementing level of detail rendering. Most contemporary FPS engines were developed for a limited draw distance and only a few animating models (i.e. enemies) on screen at a time. The Serious Engine is very efficient, capable of maintaining dozens of moving enemies (often stampedes) and enormous enemies, even on a modest system challenging the well known id Tech, Unreal Engine or Source engines. The \\"Serious Engine\\" can render through both Direct3D or OpenGL and, while it does not support pixel or vertex shaders, it is optimised for Direct3D 7's hardware transformation, clipping and lighting. The \\"Serious Engine\\" is available for licensing from Croteam. A more powerful iteration of the \\"Serious Engine\\" was developed for use in Serious Sam 2 and is known as \\"Serious Engine 2\\". It supports many features of modern GPUs such as pixel and vertex shaders, HDR, bloom and parallax mapping. Serious Engine 3 was used in Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter and Serious Sam HD: The Second Encounter. It includes detailed shading, and enemies are completely remodeled to look more realistic. This engine is also being developed to harness the full capacity of HDR and High Definition mapping. An updated version, Serious Engine 3.5, is used in Serious Sam 3: BFE. The latest version is the Serious Engine 4, which Croteam used in their most recent game, The Talos Principle. In March 2016, Croteam released Serious Engine v1.10 as free and open source software on GitHub under the GNU General Public License v2.Croteam Open- Sources The Serious Engine by Michael Larabel on Phoronix (11 March 2016) = Palm OS version = In November 2001, Global Star Software announced the completion of a Palm OS version of The First Encounter developed by InterActive Vision, to be released in early December. The game included 15 levels, and came in both color and monochrome. The game was released on 6 December 2001, as well as two demos for the color and the monochrome versions of the game. = Xbox version = The Xbox edition of Serious Sam had notable differences including the model of Sam being changed from the model of The First Encounter to form a more cartoon style Sam, removing the shades to make him look less like Duke Nukem and more like he does today. The Xbox version includes all of the levels from both of the PC games. As a result, weapons from The Second Encounter were added to the levels that were part of The First Encounter on PC. The levels were made smaller by removing the areas outside of the playing area. Unlike the PC version, Sam can't exit too far out of the playing area. This is due to the smaller amount of memory available in the Xbox. The gameplay was given a more arcade touch. A life system was implemented into the single-player game making use of the score. Every 100,000 points grants the player a new life, which allows respawning at the place of death rather than at a save point. Combo points were added for killing multiple enemies at the same time, which allows the player to increase his/her score at a fast pace. Further changes to the game include the addition of treasure and the tweaking of save points. Save points are designated by a red phone booth. Auto-aiming was also added to the Xbox version to compensate for the degree of control usually offered by a keyboard and mouse setup.  Remake  Croteam took their publishing rights from 2K Games to new startup Devolver Digital, after 2K Games became uninterested in Serious Sam, waiting for their long rival Duke Nukem Forever to finish. Both episodes were remade using Serious Engine 3 featuring updated visuals, better performance and lush environments, all in high-definition. The remakes featured 16-player online co-op (4-player in the Xbox Live Arcade version), deathmatch and a new game- mode called \\"Co-Op Tournament\\". The remake of the first episode, Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter, was released on 24 November 2009 for Microsoft Windows through Steam, on 13 January 2010 for Xbox 360 through the Xbox Live Arcade and on 20 March 2017 for Linux through Steam thanks to the Fusion Engine. The remake of the second episode, Serious Sam HD: The Second Encounter, was released on 28 April 2010 for Microsoft Windows through Steam, on 22 September 2010 for Xbox 360 through the Xbox Live Arcade and on 4 April 2017 for Linux through Steam, again thanks to the Fusion Engine. On 14 January 2011, the DLC titled \\"Fusion\\" was released on Steam, which merged the levels of The First Encounter into The Second Encounter. This DLC was free for everyone who owned both encounters on Steam. Additionally, The Second Encounter HD was expanded with new piece of DLC called \\"Legend of the Beast\\". Released on 15 May 2012, it contained new maps for the Survival and Multiplayer modes and a new, short set of campaign missions.  Reception  =The First Encounter= Kevin Rice reviewed the Windows version of the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"Hmmm, should you get Deer Hunter XXII Extreme Plus [...] or Serious Sam for the same price? This is a no-brainer purchase for any FPS gamer.\\" In the United States, Serious Sam: The First Encounter sold 83,000 copies by October 2001. The First Encounter was the recipient of various editorial and consumer praise, with an overall review ratio of 87/100 on Metacritic. It also received numerous awards, including multiple Game of the Year awards. The First Encounter won The Electric Playgrounds \\"Best Independent PC Game\\" prize, and was a nominee in the show's \\"Best Shooter for PC\\", \\"Best Graphics in a PC Game\\" and \\"Best Action Game for PC\\" categories. * Game of the Year 2001 ‚Äî GameSpot * Game of the Month April 2001 ‚Äî PC Gamer UK * Best Value Priced Game 2001 ‚Äî GameSpy * Best End Boss 2001 ‚Äî GameSpy * Premier Awards 2001 ‚Äî Computer Gaming World * Action Vault Award 2001 (Outstanding Achievement in Technology) ‚Äî IGN * Action Vault Award 2001 (Surprise of the Year) ‚Äî IGN * Platinum 2001 Award ‚Äî Gamer's Pulse * Editors' Choice Award 2001 ‚Äî IGN * #1 PC Games of 2001 ‚Äî EB Games * PC Action Cream of the Crop Award ‚Äî GamePen * Best First Person Shooter 2001 ‚Äî Christian Computer Gaming Review =The Second Encounter= The Second Encounter was also met with critical acclaim, with an overall ratio of 85/100 on Metacritic, and the Game of the Month February 2002 by GameSpot. * Game of the Month February 2002 ‚Äî GameSpot  Notes   References   External links  * 2001 video games Episodic video games First-person shooters Multiplayer and single-player video games Multiplayer online games Palm OS games Serious Sam Video games developed in Croatia Video games set in Egypt Video games set in Iran Video games set in Mexico Video games set in Poland Video games set in South America Video games about time travel Windows games Linux games Xbox 360 games Xbox 360 Live Arcade games Xbox games Xbox Live Arcade games Commercial video games with freely available source code Devolver Digital games ","title":"Serious Sam (video game)"},{"id":"20596454","text":"Woodstock Studios is a Recording studio Located in Balaclava, Melbourne.

The Chamorro name of the eel is t√≠tugi. Description left The species is pale with purplish speckles, which gather together with age. Young of the species have no spots or bars; they are pale purplish with white bellies. Its maximum length is 140 cm. The peppered moray eats small fish and crustaceans. G. pictus is similar to Gymnothorax griseus. While hunting for prey, they may be completely out of the water or may leap out of water. It is dangerous to eat because it is poisonous. Taxonomy The peppered moray was named and described by Solander in an unpublished manuscript. Richardson said the fish might be Muraena siderea. Richardson later proved the fish was different by pointing out the difference in coloration. When the names were published as separate species, it was unknown if they were really different species. Kuep gave the species name as Sidera pantherina. Blecker later changed it to its current name. The reason why the name is still the same is because of all three people's work. Habitat The peppered moray can commonly be found in tropical marine waters of the Indo-Pacific and from islands of the tropical Eastern Pacific. They can also be found in very shallow water on reef flats. Places where the species has been found include Suva Reef, the Fiji Islands, Clarion Island, and the Revillagigedo Islands.

Biography  Coming to public attention in the late 1990s with folk rock band Angelou this Norfolk based singer-songwriter earned comparisons to Jeff Buckley and Beth Orton. Her music has also been featured in the American TV show Close to Home and the indie film Fish Without a Bicycle, starring Jenna Mattison, Brian Austin Green and Jennifer Blanc. Lerski was born in London, daughter of a sound engineer and ex-St Martins School of Art student. She grew up around music, and began playing guitar at the age of six. When she was nine her family relocated to Norfolk. It was in this transitional period, with the aid of her 'Beatles Complete' book, Lerski first began to write songs. Lerski played bass and guitar in various bands throughout her teens and whilst studying at Art School. Upon graduation she joined folk rock band The Rainbyrds, and began songwriting and performing again.  Music career  Lerski formed Angelou with guitarist Jo Baker in 1996. They recorded their first demo in the winter of that year, which included a cover of the Leonard Cohen song \\"Hallelujah\\". Inspired by Jeff Buckley's version, Lerski had been a fan of Buckley's, corresponding with the artist. Local Norwich label Haven Records heard the demo and signed Angelou in the beginning of 1997, scheduling the release of the Hallelujah EP to coincide with a UK summer tour supporting Eddi Reader and Boo Hewerdine. \\"Hallelujah\\" came out a week after Jeff Buckley's untimely death, ending the year on novelist Nick Hornby's 'Best of 97' compilation. In 1998 Angelou released their first album Automiracles. Now including drummer Phil Di Palma, the album was written by Lerski, and recorded in 10 days by producer Calum MacColl. The album featured guest vocals from Eddi Reader and Boo Hewerdine and received comparisons to The Sundays' debut Reading, Writing and Arithmetic. Their second album While You Were Sleeping, released in 2000, received further acclaim and established Lerski as one of the new crop of up and coming female folk artists. Written and produced by Lerski, and recorded in studio down-time, the album finished with a moving tribute to Jeff Buckley. Lerski went on to contribute this to the Buckley documentary 'Amazing Grace'. In 2001 Spanish label El Diablo released an Angelou compilation called Midnight Witcheries. Now joined by new drummer Cath Evans and bassist Anne Richardson, this record allowed the band to be heard for the first time throughout Europe. They completed two extensive tours of Spain, appearing on national TV and radio. They also went on to release a further EP and two videos. On hearing of their success abroad, UK music independent giant Sanctuary Records offered Lerski a recording and publishing agreement and at the end of 2001 Lerski finally signed a major deal. Angelou were soon off on the road again, this time as a duo touring Scandinavia and Europe with John Hiatt & The Goners. On their return from Europe the band went into rehearsals for the third album, staying in a wooden hunting lodge in Derbyshire. Recorded both in Denmark and Manchester throughout 2002, Life Is Beautiful was a much poppier record. It was finally released in 2003 under Lerski's own name. With the launch of the album came lives dates with The Cranberries, Jason Mraz and Josh Rouse, and support from BBC Radio 2 and most notably Wake Up To Wogan producer Paul Walters. In 2004, after disagreements with Sanctuary over lack of promotion for the record, Lerski was forced to leave the label and her songs behind. In the summer of 2004, tired of the music industry and following a break up, Lerski relocated to Manchester where she began to write new material with the intention of releasing on her own imprint Laundry Label. Greetings From N.Y. was Laundry's first release. Featuring on the cover a hand written postcard to Lerski from Jeff Buckley, 'Greetings' was a 'best of' CD showcasing Lerski and the band's music to date. BBC Radio 2's Wake Up To Wogan once again championed the record and \\"More Than A Storm\\" featured weekly on his show. Starbucks at the time was also featuring tracks from Life Is Beautiful on their in-store compilation. By 2006, following the news that Sanctuary had been bought out by Universal Music Group, Lerski returned to Norwich to begin a new chapter.  Solo career  Going it alone now, Lerski played her first solo date in New York's The Living Room in 2007. That same week \\"Hallelujah!\\" was featured in the finale episode of CBS TV drama Close to Home. In September 2009, Lerski announced the launch of her own label, Laundry Label. From 2012 until 2014, she recorded a new album in her garden shed. The Wooden House was released on 1 June 2015.

His American Securities Corporation invested in other business including AMETEK and Western Union International. Biography He was a philanthropist who helped establish the nationwide United Jewish Appeal in 1939 and made other charitable grants through the William Rosenwald Family Fund. His father was Julius Rosenwald, the former chairman of Sears, Roebuck and Company and a leading philanthropist whose Rosenwald Fund built 5,000 schools for black children in the South a few decades after the Civil War. William Rosenwald was born in Wilmette, Illinois in 1903, he was the second son of Julius Rosenwald and the former Augusta Nusbaum. He attended the MIT Sloan School of Management, where he earned a bachelor of science degree in 1924. Rosenwald also attended Harvard University for a year as well as the London School of Economics. He was employed by Sears, Roebuck starting in 1928, and was a director of the firm from 1934 to 1938. It was also in 1928 that Rosenwald married his first wife, Renee Scharf, daughter of Austrian painter Viktor Scharf II. He organized a family effort in the mid-1930s to provide assistance to relatives in Europe affected by the rise of Nazi Germany. By 1948 over 300 individuals had been brought to the United States and provided with work and places to live. An additional 300 family members in Europe were also provided for. In a 1935 interview, Rosenwald stated that \\"There is the thought in my mind -- and that I would like to get across to the Jews of America -- that to the extent that the Jews as a whole help their suffering brethren, we will fortify the Jews of all countries against anti-Semitic onslaughts.\\" He organized the National Refugee Service (later a part of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society) in 1939, to help resettle refugees. In 1938, Rosenwald married Mary Kurtz, his second wife, with whom he had three daughters. Kurtz died in 1985. In January 1939, Rosenwald's National Coordinating Committee Fund joined with Rabbi Jonah Wise of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, Rabbi Abba Hillel Silver of the United Palestine Appeal, to form the United Jewish Appeal for Refugees and Overseas Needs. The founders emphasized that the funds needed to support Jews in Europe and Palestine would be triple to quadruple the amount raised in the previous year. While the organizations would raise funds together, the Joint Distribution Committee would assist Jews in Europe, the United Palestine Appeal would aid the Jewish community in Palestine, including refugees from Europe arriving there and the National Coordinating Committee Fund would assist refugees arriving in the United States.Staff. \\"3 JEWISH GROUPS UNITE FOR REFUGEES; Combined Appeal to Be Offered to Nation for Fund 3 or 4 Times That Given Last Year HEIGHTENED CRISIS CITED Agencies to Retain Separate Duties in Pressing Common Cause for Victims\\", The New York Times, January 13, 1939.

From 1942 to 1946, Rosenwald was one of the UJA's three national chairmen, leading the first campaign to raise more than $100 million, and led campaigns again from 1955 to 1957. In 1974, Rosenwald oversaw the merger of the joint campaign between United Jewish Appeal of Greater New York and the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies and was named as the first president of the combined campaign.Spiegel, Irving. \\"U.J.A., Federation Merge to Improve Campaign Efforts\\", The New York Times, July 10, 1974.

Rosenwald served on the board of the Tuskegee Institute for 40 years and was a longtime board member of the New York Philharmonic. He served on the executive committee of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee for five decades and was an active leader of the American Jewish Committee and the Council of Jewish Federations, among many other organizations.

In 1882, he was appointed to replace Hermann Theodor Hettner as curator of the sculpture collection at the Albertinum and served in this position until 1915. He worked to expand the collection, acquiring vases and works in terracotta as well as sculptures. Treu's grave When the Cabinet of Curiosities belonging to the former Electorate of Saxony was broken up, he took the opportunity to integrate Renaissance and Baroque sculptures into the collection. Several works were acquired through his contacts with contemporary artists such as Auguste Rodin, Constantin Meunier and Max Klinger, adding a modern perspective. In 1891, he opened a collection of casts, which served as a model when Ivan Vladimirovich Tsvetayev established the Pushkin Museum. Finally, in 1900, he opened the Sammlung Treus (Treu's Collection) to document the history of sculpture. In addition to his duties at the Albertinum, he taught at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts and the Royal Saxon Polytechnic, where he also managed the art collection. He received an honorary doctorate from the University of Aberdeen in 1906 and one from the Polytechnic in 1913. His grave in the is decorated with a relief by the sculptor Robert Diez. The area between the Albertinum and the Art Academy was named the Georg-Treu-Platz in his honor.

It connected Pomeroy, Pennsylvania to Newark, Delaware, and has mostly been abandoned. History Delaware City Station (Collection, Delaware City Heritage Assn) The Pomeroy and Newark Railroad was the final step in a series of consolidations and a foreclosure. The earliest predecessors were the Delaware and Pennsylvania Railroad, incorporated February 1857 in Delaware, and the Pennsylvania and Delaware Railroad, incorporated August 1868 in Pennsylvania as the Doe Run and White Clay Creek Railroad, and renamed August 1870. The two companies completed a line from Pomeroy, on the Pennsylvania Railroad's Main Line, south to Newark and southeast to Delaware City on the Delaware Bay, in about 1873, and merged in May of that year to form the Pennsylvania and Delaware Railway. This company's property was sold at foreclosure in August 1879 to two new companies, the Pomeroy and State Line Railroad (incorporated February 1880 in Pennsylvania) and the Newark and Delaware City Railroad (incorporated April 1880 in Delaware). After the former sold the line southeast of Newark to the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad (PW&B;), which it crossed at Newark, in 1881, those two companies merged in December as the Pomeroy and Newark Railroad. It became part of the Pennsylvania Railroad system, and in December 1917 the line was sold to the Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington Railroad, Pennsylvania subsidiary and successor to the PW&B.;Interstate Commerce Commission, 22 Val. Rep. 1: Valuation Docket No. 928, The Pennsylvania Railroad Company et al. (1929) The last passenger trains ran over the line in September 1928, and abandonment for freight began in 1936. By the mid-1940s, it existed only at Newark and north of Chatham.Christopher T. Baer, PRR Chronology (Pennsylvania Railroad Technical and Historical Society), accessed December 2008 These segments would remain to the end of Penn Central Transportation in 1976, except for a 1960s truncation from Chatham to Doe Run, but Conrail only acquired the short stub at Newark. It did operate subsidized contract service on between Pomeroy and Buck Run,Conrail, System Map , as of August 31, 1978William Richard Black, Railroads for Rent: The Local Rail Service Assistance Program, Indiana University Press, 1986, p. 224 but this was discontinued in about 1980. Operation of the short piece at Newark, by then owned by Amtrak, went to the Norfolk Southern Railway in the 1999 breakup of Conrail. The Pomeroy and Newark Rail Trail north of East Main Street in Newark Parts of the line have been re-purposed as trail. From the mainline in Newark to Hopkins Road in White Clay Creek State Park, the right-of-way is used for the Pomeroy and Newark rail trail, sometimes just called the Pomeroy Trail. After crossing into Pennsylvania, part of the right-of-way is used for parts of the Charlie Bailey and Penndel Trails in White Clay Creek Preserve. In Landenberg, PA parts of the right of way are use for parts of the Mill Race Trail and the Landeberg Junction Trail. Ownership of the line between Newark and Delaware City also went to the Norfolk Southern.Consolidated Rail Corporation, System Map Showing the Proposed Acquisition of Conrail Lines & Rights (reformatted by Norfolk Southern Engineering Systems), July 9, 1997 The line is still used as far as the oil refinery west of Delaware Cityhttp://www.pbfenergy.com/refineries, and the section of roadbed which once extended past the refinery to the waterfront is Delaware City was abandoned.

ET52 is essentially the A244-S torpedo with technologies of US Mk 46 Mod. 2 torpedo incorporated. PNS Zulfiquar frigate. Picture taken during the ship's goodwill visit to Malaysia in August 2009. China purchased around 40 Italian Alenia A244-S light ASW torpedo in 1987 for evaluation and reverse engineering. At the time, China was in the process of mastering the license production of the US Mk 46 Mod. 2 torpedo according to the deal first signed between China and United States in 1985. The 705th Institute (also known as Xi'an Precision Machinery Research Institute, Ë•øÂÆâÁ≤æÂØÜÊú∫Ê¢∞Á†îÁ©∂ÊâÄ), tasked to evaluate and reverse engineering the A244-S torpedo, was also responsible for Mk 46 Mod. 2 torpedo program in China, with many of the team members working on both projects. Chinese researchers suggested that since Otto fuel II powered torpedo could cost as much as three times of electrically powered torpedo, the cheaper electrically powered torpedo should be developed as well. The suggestion was accepted, and it was decided that the technologies of both the Mk 46 Mod. 2 torpedo and A244-S torpedo should be applied to each other to enhance their performances, and 705th Institute was put in charge of A244-S torpedo project in addition to the Mk 46 Mod. 2 torpedo project. Although incorporating the best features to each other certainly improved the performance for both torpedoes, the greatest benefit by far was that due to many shared components, production techniques, and other technologies, the logistic support was significantly reduced and the overall cost was also significantly lowered. A derivative of ET52 has been exhibited at various defense exhibitions by China Shipbuilding Co., and this derivative uses Otto fuel instead of battery.

Distribution These damselfish can be found in the Eastern Central Pacific, in the southeastern Oceania, including Society Islands, Tuamoto Islands, Pitcairn Islands, and Rapa Nui. It occasionally makes its way into the aquarium trade. Habitat This tropical species is reef-associated and non-migratory. It occurs in coral and rocky reefs at depths of 3 to 40 m. Description Dascyllus flavicaudus can grow to a size of 12 cm in length. These fishes have a very height body, with a ratio of 1 / 1.4-1.6 (body height / body length). With the exception of the yellowish to yellowish-white tail and the bright rear portion of the dorsal fin, their body is dark, blackish-brown to blackish-bluish. The dark edges of the scales make a net drawing. They show 12 dorsal spines, 15-16 dorsal soft rays, 2 anal spines and 13-14 anal soft rays. During matings time the males usually turn a shade or two darker, sometimes with white spots. Whatsthatfish Biology These fishes have just one of at least two distinct sexes in any one individual organism (Gonochorism). They are oviparous and non-functional hermaphrodite. They mainly feed on copepods, other small planktonic crustaceans and algae. Adults form a permanent harem, with one male and several females close to coral heads. They are substrate spawners and stick their spawn in a cave or hidden niche. Males guard and aerate the eggs that adhere to the substrate. Bibliography *Eschmeyer, William N., ed. 1998.

The film is based on David Mamet's 1975 play American Buffalo. The film was produced by Gregory Mosher, who also directed the theatrical version of American Buffalo. Plot Donny runs a junk shop in a sparsely populated and decaying neighborhood. Teach, who has no visible means of support, spends many hours a day at the shop, as does Bobby, a young man who is eager to please Donny in any way he can. Teach comes up with a scheme to rob the home of a man whose safe is said to contain rare coins. Bobby is often sent on errands for food or information. Teach's nerves are already on edge when Bobby suddenly returns to say that a third man involved in that night's robbery can't go through with it because he is in the hospital. Donny distrusts what he is hearing and is unable to locate the man in the hospital, whereupon Teach angrily turns on Bobby. Cast * Dustin Hoffman as Teach * Dennis Franz as Donny * Sean Nelson as Bobby Production Al Pacino, who originated the role of Teach on Broadway, was the first choice to play the role in the adaptation; however, Pacino did not respond in a timely fashion so Corrente offered the role to Dustin Hoffman. The film was shot on location in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, Corrente's home town. Reception Stephen Holden called it an \\"ugly fable of American free enterprise at the bottom of the food chain,\\" adding, \\"With its staccato, profanity-laced language and metaphorically potent setting, American Buffalo folds a stylized parody of American gangster movies into a bleak Samuel Beckett vision that is wide enough to accommodate many interpretations....In filming American Buffalo, Mr. Corrente has taken as conventionally naturalistic an approach as the play permits, playing down its social metaphors to concentrate on the characters' psychology.\\" Lisa Schwarzbaum gave the film a \\"B\\", saying \\"American Buffalo is about nothing less Mametian than commerce, friendship, betrayal, despair, and American hustle. Director Michael Corrente (Federal Hill) works at getting the story off the stage (it's set in a junk shop) by occasionally moving to an empty, decrepit city street. But mostly he just locks on to Hoffman and Franz.\\" Roger Ebert gave the film 2 and a half out of four stars, saying \\"It is a clich√©, but true, that some plays have their real life on the stage. American Buffalo is a play like that--or, at least, it is not a play that finds its life in this movie....Because the film never really brings to life its inner secrets, it seems leisurely, and toward the end, it seems long. It doesn't have the energy or the danger of James Foley's film version of Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross. The language is all there, and it is a joy, but the irony is missing. Or, more precisely, the irony about the irony.\\" Two months later, upon the film's UK release, Anne Billson of The Daily Telegraph concluded \\"The film's principal interest lies, as it always does with Mamet, in the hypnotic language; repeat your sentences about 20 times, shuffling the word order, repeat the first name of whomever you're talking to as though it were a mantra, add a judicious sprinkling of obscenities, and you've got the general idea. Franz, of television's NYPD Blue, is terrific, but Hoffman, performing in 'street' mode, complete with long greasy hair, never allows you to forget that he's reciting lines. Eventually the hypnotic repetitiveness of the language and the total lack of action did their work, and the dreaded Sandman, who hovers constantly at the shoulder of all film reviewers, paid me one of his visits.\\" Soundtrack The score was composed and orchestrated by Thomas Newman. In addition to Newman on piano, musicians included Steve Kujala (reeds); George Doering, Bill Bernstein, Rick Cox, (guitars); Harvey Mason (drums); and Mike Fisher (percussion).

The squadron evaluates the total air-to-air weapons system including aircraft, weapon delivery system, weapon, aircrew, support equipment, technical data and maintenance actions. The squadron hosts 38 air-to-air WSEP deployments annually at Tyndall AFB. The annual firing of 300 missiles evaluates all Air Force air-to-air missile capabilities for the AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile, AIM-7 Sparrow missile, AIM-9 Sidewinder missile and aircraft guns, and also provides live missile training for combat Air Force crews as a secondary objective. Squadron personnel verify weapon system performance, determine reliability, evaluate capability and limitations, identify deficiencies, recommend corrective action, and maintain Combat Air Force-wide data. The squadron investigates missile envelopes and evaluates capabilities and limitations to determine future firing requirements. They provide liaison support for pre-deployment, employment, and redeployment of Air Combat Command, United States Air Forces Europe, Pacific Air Forces, Air National Guard, U.S. Air Force Reserve and Canadian Forces participating in WSEP, William Tell and WIC missile firing programs. History =World War II= Pilots of the 83rd Fighter Squadron, 78th Fighter Group, 8th Air Force on 5 July 1944. It was established in early 1942 as a IV Fighter Command squadron, and equipped with P-38 Lightnings. After training in California it was deployed overseas to the European Theater of Operations (ETO) in England. It was assigned to RAF Goxhill for European transition training with the Royal Air Force, and then assigned to its operational station at RAF Duxford. It was assigned to VIII Fighter Command for heavy bomber escort duties of B-17 Flying Fortress and B-24 Liberators, engaged in long range strategic bombardment of military and industrial targets in Occupied Europe and Nazi Germany. It engaged in air-to-air combat with Luftwaffe interceptors over France and the Low Countries; the extended range of the P-38 could not extend over Germany. It replaced P-38s with P-47 Thunderbolts in mid-1943; later with P-51D Mustangs in 1944 which enabled the squadron to fly escort missions deep into Germany and also engage in fighter sweeps over enemy airfields, bridges, railroads, road transport and other targets of opportunity. It continued combat operations until the German capitulation in May 1945. The squadron demobilized in England during the summer of 1945, returned to the United States and was inactivated largely as a paper unit in October 1945. It was reactivated by the United States Air Forces in Europe in 1946 as an occupation unit at Army Air Force Station Straubing, Germany in 1946‚Äì1947. =Air Defense Command= 83 FIS Patch North American F-86L Sabre 53-0950, at Hamilton AFB in 1957 83d FIS YF-104A Starfighter 55-2969 deployment to operational service 83d FIS F-104 56-0791 Deployed to Taiwan during 1958 Quemoy Crisis The 83d was transferred from USAFE to Air Defense Command (ADC) in June 1947, and stationed at Mitchell Field, New York. Prior to being equipped it was transferred to Hamilton Air Force Base, California, where it received F-51D Mustangs and F-84B Thunderjets. In the fall of 1950 it was upgraded to F-84Ds, and in August 1951 it transitioned into F-89B Scorpions. In July 1952 the squadron moved to Paine Field, Washington, and received F-86D Sabres. In August 1955 the 83d FIS designation was transferred back to Hamilton AFB to another F-86D squadron, and the organization at Paine Field was reassigned. In December 1957, the 83d FIS received AIM-9 Sidewinder-armed Lockheed F-l04A Starfighters and become the first operational F-104 squadron in ADC. In addition, the squadron received the two-seat, dual-control combat trainer F-104B. The performance of the F-104B was almost identical to that of the F-104A, but the lower internal fuel capacity reduced its effective range considerably. It was found that the F-104A was not very well-suited for service as an interceptor. ADC released all its F-104s to the Air National Guard in 1960 because its fire control system was not sophisticated enough to operating in conjunction with the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment system to make it an all-weather interceptor.McMullen, pp. 10‚Äì12NORAD/CONAD Participation in the Cuban Missile Crisis, p. 6 Service with the F-104s was consequently quite brief, and the Starfighters were replaced by the more heavily armed all-weather McDonnell F-101B Voodoo in July 1960. The F-101B proved to be a quite successful interceptor. Assigned alongside the F-101B interceptor was the F-101F operational and conversion trainer. The two-seat trainer version was equipped with dual controls, but carried the same armament as the F-101B and were fully combat-capable. On 22 October 1962, before President John F. Kennedy told Americans that missiles were in place in Cuba, the squadron dispersed one-third of its force, equipped with nuclear-tipped missiles, to Kingsley Field at the start of the Cuban Missile Crisis.McMullen, p. 16 These planes returned to Hamilton after the crisis. Although the number of ADC interceptor squadrons remained almost constant in the early 1960s, the number of planes assigned to each squadron gradually dropped from 24 to typically 18 by 1964. This drop a result of aircraft attrition as well as the fact that production lines had closed in 1961.McMullen, pp. 41, 43‚Äì45 The 83d was inactivated to make up for attrition losses of F-101s in other units, but six aircraft remained at Hamilton as the 84th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron strength increased from 18 to 24 Voodoos.McMullen, p. 42 The 83d FIS was reactivated at Loring Air Force Base, Maine, in July 1971 when it absorbed the mission, personnel, and Convair F-106 Delta Darts of the 27th Fighter- Interceptor Squadron. The 83d FIS was inactivated in June 1972 as part of the draw-down of Air Defense Command. =Training and weapons evaluation= It was reactivated in 1972 as a T-38 Talon Undergraduate Pilot Training squadron at Webb AFB, Texas. It was inactivated with the closing of Webb in 1977. It was reactivated at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida as a weapons evaluation squadron in 1983.

(with all capital letters and an exclamation point a few weeks later). With Jacques Parizeau's Parti Qu√©b√©cois rising and the imminence of a referendum on Quebec's independence, the main platform of the CANADA! Party was to guarantee that any riding that elected one of its candidates would stay in Canada even if Quebec voted in favour of sovereignty in the 1995 referendum. Kondaks had trouble with the Chief Electoral Officer of Quebec because he used a 1-900 phone line to finance his party's activities with money from other provinces. Justice Roland Tremblay forbade Kondaks to use this tactic in July 1994, saying it violated Quebec's electoral law.Le Devoir (July 29, 1994) Pierre-F. C√¥t√© aux trousses du Parti Canada! The CANADA! Party ran 10 candidates and gathered 2,567 votes (0.07% of all votes cast) in the 1994 provincial election and lost its official status for not running any candidate in the 1998 provincial election. Kondaks has since moved to the United States and now lives in Mesa, Arizona, but keeps in touch with Canadian politics by sending regular letters to the editor to Montreal's English-language daily newspaper The Gazette.

In 1892 the intense competition between two Pittsburgh-area clubs, the Allegheny Athletic Association and the Pittsburgh Athletic Club, led to William (Pudge) Heffelfinger becoming the first known professional football player. Heffelfinger was paid $500 by Allegheny to play in a game against Pittsburgh on November 12, 1892. As a result, Heffelfinger became the first person to be paid to play football. Allegheny would go on to win the game, 4-0, when Heffelfinger picked up a Pittsburgh fumble and ran it 35 yards for a touchdown.http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1869-1910 In 1893, Pittsburgh again made history when it signed one of its players, probably halfback Grant Dibert, to the first known pro football contract, which covered all of the team's games for the year.http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1869-1910 History =Origins= 1893 Pittsburgh Athletic Club football team In 1891 the Pittsburgh Athletic Club, then called the East End Gymnasium Club, decided to field a football team. Their rival, the Allegheny Athletic Association, started up a football team in 1890 that brought a lot of publicity to their club. In most sports, Allegheny provided little competition for the older East End Gymnasium Club. However, in 1890, Allegheny found that it could compete in football. The team soon gave the Allegheny Athletic Association a strong following, since East End did not field a team. The Association's focus on football increased the prestige of the club, which led to an increase in their membership. Soon Allegheny's membership expanded to more than 330 persons and now equalled East End's. During the late 1800s, if an athletic club exhibited signs of fame and glory, increased revenues to the club soon followed. Therefore, publicity, and football victories, were important to the clubs and new members were attracted to clubs with stature. The quest for club prestige led to the recruiting of football players, at first with indirect financial inducements. The East Ends formed their team around the clubs physical director, William Kirschner, an offensive lineman. During Kirschner's stint with the football team, it was noted in the Pittsburgh newspapers that Kirschner's salary nearly doubled during football season, while his classes he taught at the club were cut in half. The papers at times hinted to Kirschner's suspiciously professional status, although no one accused him outright. =1891= The East Enders' completed their first season with 7-0 record. Harry Fry, who held memberships at both Allegheny and the East End, chose to play for the East Enders, and his performance in the season opener earned the respect of the local press. After their undefeated season, each member of the East End team was presented with a gold watch in the shape of a miniature football which also served as a trophy. However, when play began the East End and Allegheny did not play each other. Efforts were made by local media to schedule a game between the two clubs. However O. D. Thompson, Allegheny's manager, carefully avoided a game. He feared a one-sided loss to Pittsburgh because his team lacked the time needed to practice together that the East End team already had. However a game would occur in 1892. =Issues with professionalism= The first game between Allegheny and the now renamed Pittsburgh Athletic Club was played on Columbus Day 1892 in East Liberty. The game ended in a tie: 6‚Äì6. There were accusations of dirty play and unprofessionalism, that added fuel to an already bitter rivalry. Pittsburgh accused Allegheny of purposely trying to injure Kirschner, who had been forced out of the game with an ankle injury. Meanwhile, Allegheny countered that Kirschner was a professional and should not have been playing anyway. Allegheny even announced it was willing to bet anyone that Pittsburgh had used a pro, other than Kirschner. In fact, the team's captain, Charley Aull, found Pittsburgh a new center prior to the team's game against Allegheny, when he supposedly ran into an old friend on the street known only as \\"Stayer\\". A few weeks after the game, it was discovered that \\"Stayer\\" was actually A. C. Read, the captain of the Penn State Nittany Lions football team. While no one could prove that Read had been paid, and Pittsburgh had not tried to present him as a member, his presence escalated the situation. Now neither club would hesitate to take the final step to professionalism. A rematch was scheduled for that November at Recreation Park, which is not far from where Heinz Field stands today. The spot is marked by a historic marker.http://www.explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=1000 In preparation, both clubs went into full-scale behind-the-scenes talks with the top players of the era to strengthen their teams. Cash offers and other inducements were made to players from New York City to Chicago. =First professional player= The first known professional player was William \\"Pudge\\" Heffelfinger, an All-American offensive guard from Yale. Heffelfinger was paid $500 (US dollars) to play for Allegheny against Pittsburgh on November 12, 1892. Heffelfinger, who was working as a railroad clerk in Chicago, and playing for Chicago Athletic Association Football team between arguments with its management, had earlier turned down an offer to play for the Pittsburgh Athletic Club for $250. This set off quite a controversy as Pittsburgh protested the presence of Heffelfinger and other Chicago players. Allegheny retaliated with the fact that Pittsburgh had imported players as well. Allegheny won the game 4-0, in front of 3,000 spectators, when Heffelfinger picked up a fumble, that he forced himself, and ran it in for a touchdown.http://www.profootballhof.com/history/general/chronology/1869-1939.jsp It later turned out that Heffelfinger received $500 plus $25 in expenses for the game. Two of his Chicago teammates received ‚Äúliberal‚Äù expense money. Thus, William (Pudge) Heffelfinger now is acknowledged as the first professional football player anywhere. =First pro football contract= In 1893, the Allegheny and Pittsburgh split two games, with the Pittsburgh winning 6-0 at Exposition Park and the Alleghenys winning, 8-4, in East Liberty. The year was far more significant for several other reasons, however. On October 4, Pittsburgh, represented by George Barbour, signed a player to a formal pro football contract which stated that the player must participate in all Pittsburgh games and will not play for anyone else during those games. In return the player was paid $50 per game by the Pittsburgh club. While contract has been torn at the signature line, it is believed that the first contracted player was Grant Dibert who played halfback and was a member of the Pittsburgh A. C. since 1890. =1894‚Äì1898= Pittsburgh continued to play until 1901. However, the club lost its major rival, Allegheny, in 1896 when the Amateur Athletic Union suspended the Allegheny team for its flagrant violations of amateur rules. After successful seasons in 1896 and 1897, the pro football turmoil had upset Allegheny club so greatly that the sport was dropped. By that time the new Duquesne Country and Athletic Club became the dominating force in Pittsburgh-area football. However, the Pittsburgh A. C. also lost ground to the Latrobe Athletic Association, located in neighboring Westmoreland County. In 1898, Pittsburgh put together a roster of local stars to play against Duquesne. However, the Pittsburgh A. C. lost the game 34‚Äì0. Pittsburgh finally decided the cost of paying football players only to watch them lose to Duquesne was a poor investment for the club's treasury. They quietly disappeared from the Pittsburgh football scene.

It is also known as the Via Tiburtina Sarcophagus, though other sarcophagi have been found there. It is known for its densely populated, anti-classical composition of \\"writhing and highly emotive\\"Fred S. Kleiner, A History of Roman Art (Wadsworth, 2007, 2010, enhanced ed.), p. 272. Romans and Goths, and is an example of the battle scenes favored in Roman art during the Crisis of the Third Century. Discovered in 1621 and named for its first modern owner, Ludovico Ludovisi, the sarcophagus is now displayed at the Palazzo Altemps in Rome, part of the National Museum of Rome as of 1901.Christopher S. Mackay, Ancient Rome: A Military and Political History (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 178. The sarcophagus is a late outlier in a group of about twenty-five late Roman battle sarcophagi, the others all apparently dating to 170-210, made in Rome or in some cases Athens. These derive from Hellenistic monuments from Pergamon in Asia Minor showing Pergamene victories over the Gauls, and were all presumably commissioned for military commanders. The Portonaccio sarcophagus is the best known and most elaborate of the main Antonine group and shows both considerable similarities to the Great Ludovisi sarcophagus, and a considerable contrast in style and mood.Donald Strong et al., Roman Art, 1995 (2nd edn.), p. 205, Yale University Press (Penguin/Yale History of Art), Description Detail of the central figure, his forehead marked with an X The sarcophagus measures 1.53m in height and is made from Proconnesian marble, a medium characterized by dark gray stripes and a medium to coarse grain.Frances Van Keuren, Donatio Attanasio, John J.

Peter Gromet, \\"Multimethod Analyses of Roman Sarcophagi at the Museo Nazionale Romano, Rome,\\" in Life, Death and Representation: Some New Work on Roman Sarcophagi (De Gruyter, 2011), p. 181. This was imported from Proconnesus and was the most common source of marble imported into Italy during the imperial period. It is decorated in a very high relief with many elements of the composition cut completely free of the background. Overlapping figures entirely fill the image space, allowing no room to depict a background. In many battle sarcophagi the side panels show more tranquil scenes, but here the battle continues round both sides. The lid of the sarcophagus has a center plaque for inscription and is flanked by two masks showing the side profile of men. Their facial features are idealized, similar to the Romans in the battle scene, but their hair and beards are untamed like the Barbarians. The inscription plaque is now blank, but was thought to be inscribed with paint. The scene to the left of the plaque depicts barbarian children handed over to a Roman general by men presumably their fathers.Jeannine Diddle Uzzi, \\"The Power of Parenthood in Official Roman Art,\\" in Constructions of Childhood in Ancient Greece and Italy (American School of Classical Studies at Athens, 2007), p. 76. This act was referred to as clemency, where children were sometimes taken into Roman custody as pledges of peace, and might be reeducated as Romans. The right side of the lid shows a half length portrait of a woman, wearing a tunic and palla, and holding a scroll. A curtain is draped above her, being supported by two figures. The woman head is turned sharply to the right, mirroring the general in the center of the frontal panel of the sarcophagus, suggesting that she is either his wife or mother. The lid was broken in 1945 while on display in Mainz. From the left most side of the frontal panel the battle scene begins with a Roman in full military amour charging into battle. To his right is a Roman soldier who has captured a Barbarian and bound his hands, but is lifting his chin and cradling his head. This action portrays a sense of mercy between the Romans and the Barbarians who are being defeated, and presents the Roman soldier with a choice of whether to slay his opponent or act mercifully. The central figure of the tortuous composition on the front is a young Roman military commander on horseback, presumed to represent the deceased. His face is serene, and his arm is extended confidently in a \\"gesture which is difficult to interpret but seems to be one of farewell\\". He does not hold any weapon and is bareheaded, unlike the other Roman soldiers. This implies that he does not need any protection or weaponry to win the battle. An X-mark on his forehead has been interpreted as the cross received by initiates into the Mithraic mysteries as a sign of the god Mithras' favor. The Mithraic religion was popular among Roman soldiers. The valor (virtus) shown by the horseman may represent real- life bravery on the battlefield, but the religious connotation of the X may suggest victory over death, a theme of mounted warriors in funerary art.Katherine Welch, \\"Roman Sculpture,\\" in The Oxford History of Western Art (Oxford University Press, 2000), p. 51; Linda Maria Gigante, \\"Funerary art,\\" in The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome (Oxford University Press, 2010), pp. 250‚Äì251. It could also have marked the figure as the \\"savior of humanity, the bringer of light to a world of tumult, and the guarantor of eternity.\\" Although the barbaric figures are usually identified as Goths, their features are too generic to warrant and proper identification. The figures do not have any specific ethnic or racial features that would usually differentiate the groups of non-Roman barbarians. Historical context such as identification of a key figure or a specific battle being depicted in the artwork is usually how historians are able to identify barbarians. However, it is typically for these features to be lacking on privately commissioned works like sarcophagi. By the second century AD most reliefs would use a generic barbaric figure because they valued the general theme of Roman conquest over non-Roman enemies more than an accurate portrayal of the Barbarians. This practice is described by Jane Francis: > For the purchaser of a battle sarcophagus, the desire to ally himself with > the glories of Rome and the part that whether directly or indirectly, was > more important than specific foe. This attitude would have been particularly > convenient for men who had seen no significant military action but who could > still claim to be part of the war machine of the empire. Roman wearing mail, and above him a cornicen, a junior officer who communicated signals with the military horn The sarcophagus contains many precise depictions of military details such as the draco military standard and a detailed mail shirt of the longer length characteristic of the period.Pat Southern and Karen R. Dixon, The Late Roman Army (Yale University Press, 1996), pp. 98, 126. The figures towards the bottom of the scene have fallen to the ground and are mostly the Barbarians who have been slain. They lay in agony with their horses, and are trampled by the ongoing battle above them. These figures are the bottom of the relief are smaller in proportion to the humans and horses above. Technique and style Since the reliefs was often very deep and intricate the sarcophagi were shipped with only a rough carving blocked out to prevent damage. The sculptor would either travel with the sarcophagi, or finish the carving in their permanent workshop in Italy. The Ludovisi sarcophagus came shortly after a trend where reliefs would be made in the same style of Marcus Aurelius‚Äô column, with very deep cutting. This was the trend of pictorial reliefs in the 2nd century. The scene on the sarcophagus depicts Roman values of heroic struggle and glorification of the hero, as well as themes of good over evil and civilized men over barbarians. The inclusion of Barbarians in the relief expresses how Romans viewed themselves as preservers of the civilization, much like the Greeks were. The undercutting of the deep relief exhibits virtuosic and very time-consuming drill work, and differs from earlier battle scenes on sarcophagi in which more shallowly carved figures are less convoluted and intertwined.Welch, \\"Roman Sculpture\\", in The Oxford History of Western Art, p. 41; Mackay, Ancient Rome, p. 178. Describing it as \\"the finest of the third-century sarcophagi\\", art historian Donald Strong says:Donald Strong et al., Roman Art, 1995 (2nd edn.), p. 257, Yale University Press (Penguin/Yale History of Art), The carving is so deep that the forms are almost completely offset from the background resulting in three or four layers of various figures and forms. Overlapping figures fill the image space entirely, allowing no room to depict a background. Thus, the sense of space has been eliminated, giving rise to chaos and a sense of weary, open-ended victory. The effect of movement in the scene is evident and, unlike many battle sarcophagi which have more tranquil scenes on the side panels, the battle events continue all the way around the sarcophagus. The perspective constructed is also notable, although certainly not linear. Detail of a barbarian pierced by a lance, From the time of the reign of the Antonine emperors, Roman art increasingly depicted battles as chaotic, packed, single-plane scenes presenting dehumanized barbarians mercilessly subjugated by Roman military might, at a time when in fact the Roman Empire was undergoing constant invasions from external threats that led to the fall of the empire in the West.Patrick Coleman, \\"Barbarians: Artistic Representations\\", in The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome, p. 371; Allan, Life, Myth, And Art In Ancient Rome, p. 52. Although armed, the barbarian warriors, usually identified as, are depicted as helpless to defend themselves.Coleman, \\"Barbarians: Artistic Representations\\", p. 371.The theme of depicting a battle between the Goths and Romans was popular in the mid second century, during the reign of Marcus Aurelius. After this period there was a transition from mythological battle scenes to historical battles where the deceased person in the sarcophagus was specifically commemorated in the relief. Various aspects of the execution of the work accentuate the contrast between the Romans and the Goths. The Roman figures are all clean-shaven and wear armour and helmets, which distinguish them clearly from the Goths, who are unarmoured and wear distinctive clothing, beards, and hairstyles. The Romans are given a more noble appearance with idealized physical features which contrast with the Goths who are almost caricatures, with enlarged noses, pronounced cheekbones, and wild expressions on their faces. The alternation of light/dark accentuates the contrast between the two groups. Shadows and deep carving are mostly found in the faces and hair of the Goths whereas the smooth surface of the marble is reserved for the Romans, who are less deeply carved. Differences in scale between the figures, though present, are far less marked than in the earlier Portonaccio sarcophagus, such that the general is only slightly larger than his troops or enemies. Nor is the general seen wearing a helmet or in actual combat, as in the earlier sarcophagi. The viewer is able to discern who the general is because he is placed in the top center of the relief. He extends outwards with a raised right arm and overlaps his horse. In contrast to his wild horse, he looks very calm amongst the chaos of the scene.

History  = 1886‚Äì1900: Brown Shoe Company = Previous logo The company was created in St. Louis and was originally named Bryan, Brown & Company after its founders George Warren Brown and Alvin Bryan. The company began business in 1878 and incorporated in 1881 as Bryan-Brown Shoe Company. Founder George Warren Brown moved from New York to St. Louis in 1873 to work in his older brother‚Äôs shoe business, and saw potential for shoe manufacturing in St. Louis. At that point, most shoes were manufactured in New England. After four years in his brother‚Äôs wholesale shoe business, Brown had the funds to found Bryan, Brown and Company to make women‚Äôs shoes, with Alvin L. Bryan and Jerome Desnoyers also as investors. The company hired five skilled shoemakers from Rochester, New York, to start the factory in St. Louis, and it grew quickly. In 1878, it had sales of $110,000. In 1881, it was incorporated as the Bryan Brown Shoe Company. In 1886, the company became the Brown-Desnoyers Shoe Company, after Mr. Bryan retired. In 1893, Mr. J.B. Desnoyers also retired, and the name was changed to Brown Shoe Company. In 1895, the Brown Shoe Company factory had about six hundred employees who could make five thousand pairs of shoes and boots a day. The company competed as Brown shoes were sold throughout the Midwest at prices lower than New England shoes, and by 1900 the company was growing at a rate of $1 million a year. Four years later the company bought the rights to Buster Brown, a character developed by cartoonist Richard F. Outcault they would use for marketing. = 1901-1920s: Growth and labor issues = As Brown Shoes grew, St. Louis became increasingly known as a center for shoe manufacturing, and competing factories set up in the city. In 1904, a deadly elevator accident occurred at a Brown Shoe factory in St. Louis. It happened on January 13 when a crowd of employees was waiting for the elevator at the factory and someone raised the elevator gate, causing 10 people to fall down the shaft. At least 8 people were killed and the other 2 were described as \\"fatally injured.\\" It's unclear if they succumbed to their injuries. By 1902, Brown Shoe had five factories operating in St. Louis, and in 1907, the company set up its first plant out of the city, where labor was cheaper in Moberly, Missouri. In 1907, the company moved its headquarters to a building in downtown St. Louis. During this time of high competition, Brown Shoes kept profits high by keeping labor costs as low as possible, as the cost of plant equipment and materials were somewhat fixed. As the work became more mechanized, shoe factory jobs required less skill, and in the industry at large, positions were increasingly filled by women and children, who could be paid less. In 1911, a survey of shoe workers in St. Louis found that over half were between the ages of 14 and 19, with an average wage for a girl under 16 less than $10 a week. In response to the poor working conditions at shoe factories in the St. Louis area, including Brown Shoes', workers formed unions; the moderate Boot and Shoe Workers Union was followed by the more radical United Shoe Workers of America. The latter was associated with the Industrial Workers of the World. Strikes led to anti-union activities among workers as well, and the creation of the anti-union propaganda organization Citizens Industrial Association in St. Louis. Partly in response to the union activity, Brown Shoe Company increasingly turned to labor in the small towns in the surrounding area. With management remaining in St. Louis, the company secured tax subsidies from various towns to open factories in rural Missouri and Illinois. Brown Shoe Company debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in 1913.\\"Brown Shoe Company, Inc.,\\" Funding Universe, fundinguniverse.com ‚ÄîExtensive and detailed company history Starting in 1917, the company secured lucrative military contracts with the United States government. The company encountered a crisis in 1920, when a rise in hemlines made much of Brown's high-topped shoes unfashionable and overstocked. The company had to go to Boston to secure credit from a bank, and the company then did well until the stock market crash of 1929. = 1930s: Great Depression and bankruptcy = During the Great Depression of the 1930s the company struggled to keep costs down, and workers' wages dropped, with a government investigation finding that workers at one plant were paid as little as \\"$2.50 and $3.00 for a 60-hour week.\\" During this time the company also remained fiercely anti-union, even closing a plant in Vincennes, Indiana in 1933 when the workers there held a strike for recognition. The company also reportedly used physical intimidation against union organizers, hiring a strike-breaking agency and infiltrating the unions themselves. The Illinois Federation of Labor forced a grand-jury investigation into Brown in 1935, after a union representative was almost tarred and feathered. There were no resultant indictments, although the Regional Labor Board in St. Louis did later issue a complaint, where they cited Brown for intimidation of employees using agents and officers, and unfair labor practices. The subsequent hearing revealed that John A. Bush had hired the A.A. Ahner detective agency in 1934, an agency known for strike- breaking. In 1936, Brown was cited by the National Labor Relations Board for violating the Wagner Act over the company dissolving the Salem local union, but Brown would not reinstate workers fired for union activity. The Fair Labor Standard Act of 1938 mandated that the remaining Brown workers received higher wages. The company went bankrupt in June 1939, after a failure to raise fresh capital for a reorganization. Stock of the company was suspended on the St. Louis Stock Exchange on June 23, 1939. The last transaction saw shares sold for 20 cents each, after a peak when its stock sold for up to $60 a share. = 1940s-1960s: Push into retail = Opening a plant in Dyer, Tennessee in 1941, Brown began moving south for production, where it was traditionally non-Union. In the 1940s, Brown's third president Clark Gamble began pushing the company into retailing. Becoming president in 1948 after John Bush, Gamble in 1950 initiated a merger with Wohl Shoes, which wholesaled mostly women's shoes in 2,500 stores in North America and Cuba. In 1953 Brown acquired the large retail chain Regal Shoes, and in 1956 Brown acquired G. R. Kinney Corporation, then the largest operator of family shoe stores. At the time, Brown was the fourth-largest shoe manufacturer in the United States. In 1959, a U.S. District Court in St. Louis deemed Brown guilty of anti-trust violations, and the company was ordered to sell Kinney. The ruling was upheld in 1962, at which point Brown was the number-one manufacturer in the shoe industry. Afterwards, Kinney was sold to F. W. Woolworth. For a time, the Hamilton-Brown Shoe Company was the largest manufacturer of shoes in America. In 1959, the company had acquired Perth Shoe Company in Canada. In 1965, Brown bought the Samuels Shoe Company. = 1970s-1990s: Diversification as Brown Group = After doing well in the 1960s, in 1969 Brown's earnings dropped 25% after a wealth of imports flooded the US shoe industry the year before. W. L. Hadley Griffin became the company's president in 1969, and began diversifying into areas beyond shoes. In 1970 Brown acquired the importer Italia Bootwear, Ltd. After acquiring Eagle Rubber Company, Kent Sporting Goods, and other companies, in 1972 it changed its name to the Brown Group, Inc. It continued to acquire companies in children's products and sports and recreation. In the 1970s, Brown operated Famous Footwear, Cloth World fabric stores, Bottom Half jeans stores, and Meis department stores.http://stlcin.missouri.org/history/peopledetail.cfm?Master_ID=1724 In February 1979, it was reported that Brown Group, then the largest American producer of namebrand footwear, was petitioning for price relief from the federal government. After closing its St. Louis warehouse in 1980, Brown began adjusting its business strategy to deal with pressure from cheap imports in the 1980s. In 1985 the company divested itself of its recreational products operations, leaving the company focused largely on shoe retailing and manufacturing, with a quarter of operations in other stores. Around that time, Brown moved more into shoe importing, acquiring Arnold Dunn, Inc., an importer, in 1984. In 1986, the company acquired Pagoda Trading Company, an importing firm based in Asia, in a move away from manufacturing. In 1988, Brown began concentrating marketing on its well-known brands such as Connie, Naturalizer, and Buster Brown, while discontinuing marginal lines. Excluding the Cloth World chain, in 1989 the company sold all of its nonfootwear retail operations. In the early 1990s, Brown closed six of its domestic shoe plants, and in 1993 it began to close its Wohl Leased Shoe Department operation. In 1995, the last Brown Group-owned shoe factory in the United States closed, and the company only had two manufacturing plants in Canada remaining. It sold three of its five headquarters buildings, and its Cloth World chain. 35 percent of the overall workforce at Brown was fired, coming to 8,500 jobs. Brown acquired the Larry Stuart Collection and the Le Coq Sportif brand in 1995. The following year, Brown signed license agreements to market athletic footwear under the Russell and Penn brand names. After operating from 1972 until 1999 as the Brown Group, it became Brown Shoe again in 1999. = 2000-present: Name changes = As part of a restructuring, in 2002 the company closed 100 Naturalizer stores, and 700 Famous Footwear outlets were remodeled. The company had a loss of $4 million in 2001, and a $45.2 million profit in 2002. In the first half of 2003, Brown's stock value increased nearly 80 percent. At the end of that year, Brown signed a licensing deal to design and market footwear under Phillips-Van Heusen Corp.'s Bass label. On May 27, 2015, Brown Shoe changed its name to Caleres, retaining the \\"Brown Shoe\\" name for a future line of men's footwear.Our History Caleres purchased Allen Edmonds for $255 million in December 2016 from Brentwood Associates.

It sets out the duties owed by a bailee ‚Äì someone in possession of property owned by another. Facts William BernardProbably a small businessman and a fishmonger's porter. It may have been that he had servants who were responsible for this accident. undertook to carry several barrels of brandy belonging to John CoggsProbably a goldsmith banker, who ran a business from the King's Head on the Southwest corner of Chancery Lane from Brooks Market, Holborn to Water Street, just south of the Strand (about half a mile). Bernard's undertaking was gratuitous; he was not offered compensation for his work. As the brandy was being unloaded at the Water Street cellar, a barrel was staved and 150 gallons were lost. Coggs brought an action on the case against Bernard, alleging he had undertaken to carry the barrels but had spilled them through his negligence. Judgment Holt CJ at the London Guildhall found that Mr Bernard, the defendant, was negligent in carrying the casks and was therefore liable as a bailee. Holt made clear that Bernard's responsibility to Coggs was not formally contractual in nature, since he received no consideration. Instead, his responsibility rested on the trust that Coggs placed in him to use due care in transporting the casks, and by his tacit acceptance of that trust by taking the casks into his custody. Thus, because Bernard acted negligently when he was under a responsibility to use care, he was held to be in breach of a trust. In the course of his judgment, Holt gave this well-known statement of the categories of bailment: The case overturned the then leading case in the law of bailments, Southcote's Case (1601), which held that a general bailee was strictly liable for any damage or loss to the goods in his possession (e.g., even if the goods were stolen from him by force). Under the ruling in Coggs v Bernard, a general bailee was only liable if he had been negligent. Despite his reappraisal of the standard of liability for general bailees, Holt CJ refused to reconsider the long-standing common law rule that held common carriers strictly liable for any loss or damage to bailed property in their possession. Although admitting that the rule was \\"hard,\\" Holt CJ justified it by stating: > This [rule] is a politik establishment, contrived by the policy of the law, > for the safety of all persons, the necessity of whose affairs oblige them to > trust these sorts of persons [i.e. carriers], that they may be safe in their > ways of dealing: for else these carriers might have an opportunity of > undoing all persons that had any dealings with them, by combining with > thieves etc; and yet doing it in such a clandestine manner, as would not be > possible to be discovered. And this is the reason the law is founded upon > that point. Sir John Powell concurred. He began his decision by saying, echoing Sir Edward Coke's famous dictum, \\"Let us consider the reason of the case. For nothing is law that is not reason.\\"(1703) 92 ER 107, 109 See also *Ball v Coggs (1710) 1 Brown PC 140, 1 ER 471 and Ball v Lord Lanesborough (1713) 5 Brown PC 480, 2 ER 809, show that Mr Coggs was made bankrupt (Stat 8 Anne c 28 (1709)) after litigation from a former manager of a brass wire works, of which Coggs had been partner and treasurer.

Under the Roman Republic, Hispania was divided into two provinces: Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior. During the Principate, Hispania Ulterior was divided into two new provinces, Baetica and Lusitania, while Hispania Citerior was renamed Hispania Tarraconensis. Subsequently, the western part of Tarraconensis was split off, first as Hispania Nova, later renamed \\"Callaecia\\" (or Gallaecia, whence modern Galicia). From Diocletian's Tetrarchy (AD 284) onwards, the south of remaining Tarraconensis was again split off as Carthaginensis, and probably then too the Balearic Islands and all the resulting provinces formed one civil diocese under the vicarius for the Hispaniae (that is, the Celtic provinces). The name Hispania was also used in the period of Visigothic rule. The modern place names Spain and Caribbean Island Hispaniola are both derived from Hispania. Etymology The origin of the word Hispania is much disputed. The evidence for the various speculations is based merely upon what are at best mere resemblances, likely to be accidental, and suspect supporting evidence. The most commonly held theory holds it to be of Punic origin, from the Phoenician language of colonizing Carthage.pg14 Specifically, it may derive from a Punic cognate ƒ´ shƒÅpƒÅn of Hebrew ƒ´ shƒÅfƒÅn (◊ê◊Ö◊ô ◊©÷∏◊Å◊§÷∏◊ü) meaning \\"island of the hyrax\\", referring to the European rabbit (Phoenician-Punic and Hebrew are both Canaanite languages and therefore closely related to each other).Zvi Herman, ◊ß◊®◊™◊í◊ï ◊î◊û◊¢◊¶◊û◊î ◊î◊ô◊û◊ô◊™ [= ‚ÄúCarthage, the Maritime Empire‚Äù] (Massadah Ltd, 1963), 105. Some Roman coins of the Emperor Hadrian, born in Hispania, depict Hispania and a rabbit.

Isidore of Sevilla considered Hispania of Iberian origin and derived it from the pre-Roman name for Seville, Hispalis.pg 292 This was revived for instance by the etymologist Eric Partridge (in his work Origins) who felt that this might strongly hint at an ancient name for the country of *Hispa, presumably an Iberian or Celtic root whose meaning is now lost. Hispalis may alternatively derive from Heliopolis (Greek for \\"city of the sun\\"). However, according to modern research by Manuel Pellicer Catal√°n, the name derives from Phoenician spal \\"lowland\\", rendering the above explanations of Hispania highly unlikely. Occasionally Hispania was called Hesperia ultima \\"farthest western land\\" by Roman writers since the name Hesperia \\"western land\\" had already been used by the Greeks to refer to the Italian peninsula. During the 18th and 19th centuries, Jesuits scholars like Larramendi and Jos√© Francisco de Isla tied the name to the Basque word ezpain ‚Äòlip‚Äô, but also ‚Äòborder, edge‚Äô, thus meaning the farthest area or place.Charles Anthon, A System of Ancient and Medi√¶val Geography for the Use of Schools and Colleges (New York, 1849), 14.pg 253-254 During Antiquity and Middle Ages, the literary texts derive the term Hispania from an eponymous hero named Hispan, who is mentioned for the first time in the work of the Roman historian Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus, in the 1st century BC. Although \\"Hispania\\" is the Latin root for the modern name \\"Spain\\", substituting Spanish for Hispanicus or Hispanic, or Spain for Hispania, should be done carefully and taking into account the correct context. The Estoria de Espa√±a (\\"The History of Spain\\") written on the initiative of Alfonso X of Castile \\"El Sabio\\" (\\"the Wise\\"), between 1260 and 1274, during the Reconquista ('reconquest') of Spain, is believed to be the first extended history of Spain in Old Spanish using the words \\"Espa√±a\\" (\\"Spain\\") and \\"Espa√±oles\\"(\\"Spaniards\\") to refer to Medieval Hispania. The use of Latin \\"Hispania\\", Castilian \\"Espa√±a\\", Catalan \\"Espanya\\" and French \\"Espaigne\\", among others, to refer to Roman Hispania or Visigothic Hispania was common throughout all the Late Middle Ages. A document dated 1292 mentions the names of foreigners from Medieval Spain as \\"Gracien d'Espaigne\\".Paul Lebel, Les noms de personnes en France, 1946, p. 108 Latin expressions using \\"Hispania\\" or \\"Hispaniae\\" (e.g. \\"omnes reges Hispaniae\\") were often used in the Middle Ages, while the Spain Romance languages of the Reconquista use the Romance version interchangeably. In the James Ist Chronicle Llibre dels fets, written between 1208 and 1276, there are many instances of this. Since the borders of modern Spain do not coincide with those of the Roman province of Hispania or of the Visigothic Kingdom, it is important to understand the context of medieval Spain versus modern Spain. The Latin term Hispania, often used during Antiquity and the Low Middle Ages as a geographical name, starts to be used also with political connotations, as shown in the expression laus Hispaniae, \\"Praise to Hispania\\", to describe the history of the peoples of the Iberian Peninsula of Isidore of Seville's Historia de regibus Gothorum, Vandalorum et Suevorum: > You are, Oh Spain, holy and always happy mother of princes and peoples, the > most beautiful of all the lands that extend far from the West to India. You, > by right, are now the queen of all provinces, from whom the lights are given > not only the sunset, but also the East. You are the honor and ornament of > the orb and the most illustrious portion of the Earth ... And for this > reason, long ago, the golden Rome desired you In modern history, Spain and Spanish have become increasingly associated with the Kingdom of Spain alone, although this process took several centuries. After the union of the central peninsular Kingdom of Castile with the eastern peninsular Kingdom of Aragon in the 15th century under the Catholic Monarchs in 1492, only Navarra and Portugal were left to complete the whole peninsula under one monarchy. Navarre followed soon after in 1512, and Portugal, after over 400 years as an independent and sovereign nation, in 1580. During this time, the concept of Spain was still unchanged. It was after the restoration of Portugal's independence in 1640 when the concept of Spain started to shift and be applied to all the Peninsula except Portugal. Pre-Roman history The Iberian peninsula has long been inhabited, first by early hominids such as Homo erectus, Homo heidelbergensis and Homo antecessor. In the Paleolithic period, the Neanderthals entered Iberia and eventually took refuge from the advancing migrations of modern humans. In the 40th millennium BC, during the Upper Paleolithic and the last ice age, the first large settlement of Europe by modern humans occurred. These were nomadic hunter-gatherers originating on the steppes of Central Asia. When the last Ice Age reached its maximum extent, during the 30th millennium BC, these modern humans took refuge in Southern Europe, namely in Iberia, after retreating through Southern France. In the millennia that followed, the Neanderthals became extinct and local modern human cultures thrived, producing pre-historic art such as that found in L'Arbreda Cave and in the C√¥a Valley. In the Mesolithic period, beginning in the 10th millennium BC, the Aller√∏d Oscillation occurred. This was an interstadial deglaciation that lessened the harsh conditions of the Ice Age. The populations sheltered in Iberian Peninsula (descendants of the Cro-Magnon) migrated and recolonized all of Western Europe. In this period one finds the Azilian culture in Southern France and Northern Iberia (to the mouth of the Douro river), as well as the Muge Culture in the Tagus valley. The Neolithic brought changes to the human landscape of Iberia (from the 5th millennium BC onwards), with the development of agriculture and the beginning of the European Megalith Culture. This spread to most of Europe and had one of its oldest and main centres in the territory of modern Portugal, as well as the Chalcolithic and Beaker cultures. During the 1st millennium BC, in the Bronze Age, the first wave of migrations into Iberia of speakers of Indo-European languages occurred. These were later (7th and 5th centuries BC) followed by others that can be identified as Celts. Eventually urban cultures developed in southern Iberia, such as Tartessos, influenced by the Phoenician colonization of coastal Mediterranean Iberia, with strong competition from the Greek colonization. These two processes defined Iberia's cultural landscape - Mediterranean towards the southeast and Continental in the northwest. Languages Linguistic map: This shows the Linguistic variation of the Iberian Peninsula at about 200 BC (at the end of the Second Punic War). Latin was the official language of Hispania during the Roman Empire's rule, which exceeded 600 years. By the empire's end in Hispania around 460 AD, all the original Iberian languages, except the ancestor of modern Basque, were extinct. Even after the fall of Rome and the invasion of the Germanic Visigoths and Suebi, Latin was spoken by nearly all of the population, but in its common form known as Vulgar Latin, and the regional changes which led to the modern Iberian Romance languages had already begun. Carthaginian Hispania Carthaginian influence sphere before the First Punic War. After its defeat by the Romans in the First Punic War (264 BC-241 BC), Carthage compensated for its loss of Sicily by rebuilding a commercial empire in Hispania. The major part of the Punic Wars, fought between the Punic Carthaginians and the Romans, was fought on the Iberian Peninsula. Carthage gave control of the Iberian Peninsula and much of its empire to Rome in 201 BC as part of the peace treaty after its defeat in the Second Punic War, and Rome completed its replacement of Carthage as the dominant power in the Mediterranean area. By then the Romans had adopted the Carthaginian name, romanized first as Ispania. The term later received an H, much like what happened with Hibernia, and was pluralized as Hispaniae, as had been done with the Three Gauls. Roman Hispania Hispania under Caesar Augustus's rule after the Cantabrian Wars in 29 BC Roman armies invaded the Iberian peninsula in 218 BC and used it as a training ground for officers and as a proving ground for tactics during campaigns against the Carthaginians, the Iberians, the Lusitanians, the Gallaecians and other Celts. It was not until 19 BC that the Roman emperor Augustus (r. 27 BC-AD 14) was able to complete the conquest (see Cantabrian Wars). Until then, much of Hispania remained autonomous. Romanization proceeded quickly in some regions where we have references to the togati, and very slowly in others, after the time of Augustus, and Hispania was divided into three separately governed provinces (nine provinces by the 4th century). More importantly, Hispania was for 500 years part of a cosmopolitan world empire bound together by law, language, and the Roman road. But the impact of Hispania in the newcomers was also big. Caesar wrote on the Civil Wars that the soldiers from the Second Legion had become Hispanicized and regarded themselves as hispanici. Some of the peninsula's population were admitted into the Roman aristocratic class and they participated in governing Hispania and the Roman Empire, although there was a native aristocracy class who ruled each local tribe. The latifundia (sing., latifundium), large estates controlled by the aristocracy, were superimposed on the existing Iberian landholding system. The Romans improved existing cities, such as Lisbon (Olissipo) and Tarragona (Tarraco), established Zaragoza (Caesaraugusta), M√©rida (Augusta Emerita), and Valencia (Valentia), and reduced other native cities to mere villages. The peninsula's economy expanded under Roman tutelage. Hispania served as a granary and a major source of metals for the Roman market, and its harbors exported gold, tin, silver, lead, wool, wheat, olive oil, wine, fish, and garum. Agricultural production increased with the introduction of irrigation projects, some of which remain in use today. The Romanized Iberian populations and the Iberian-born descendants of Roman soldiers and colonists had all achieved the status of full Roman citizenship by the end of the 1st century. The emperors Trajan (r. 98-117), Hadrian (r. 117-138), and Theodosius (r. 379-395) were of Hispanic origin. The Iberian denarii, also called argentum oscense by Roman soldiers, circulated until the 1st century BC, after which it was replaced by Roman coins. Hispania was separated into two provinces (in 197 BC), each ruled by a praetor: Hispania Citerior (\\"Hither Hispania\\") and Hispania Ulterior (\\"Farther Hispania\\"). The long wars of conquest lasted two centuries, and only by the time of Augustus did Rome managed to control Hispania Ulterior. Hispania was divided into three provinces in the 1st century BC. In the 4th century, Latinius Pacatus Drepanius, a Gallic rhetorician, dedicated part of his work to the depiction of the geography, climate and inhabitants of the peninsula, writing: > This Hispania produces tough soldiers, very skilled captains, prolific > speakers, luminous bards. It is a mother of judges and princes; it has given > Trajan, Hadrian, and Theodosius to the Empire. With time, the name Hispania was used to describe the collective names of the Iberian Peninsula kingdoms of the Middle Ages, which came to designate all of the Iberian Peninsula plus the Balearic Islands. =The Hispaniae = Roman Hispania in 125 During the first stages of Romanization, the peninsula was divided in two by the Romans for administrative purposes. The closest one to Rome was called Citerior and the more remote one Ulterior. The frontier between both was a sinuous line which ran from Cartago Nova (now Cartagena) to the Cantabrian Sea. Hispania Ulterior comprised what are now Andalusia, Portugal, Extremadura, Le√≥n, a great portion of the former Castilla la Vieja, Galicia, Asturias, and the Basque Country. Hispania Citerior comprised the eastern part of former Castilla la Vieja, and what are now Aragon, Valencia, Catalonia, and a major part of former Castilla la Nueva. In 27 BC, the general and politician Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa divided Hispania into three parts, namely dividing Hispania Ulterior into Baetica (basically Andalusia) and Lusitania (including Gallaecia and Asturias) and attaching Cantabria and the Basque Country to Hispania Citerior. The emperor Augustus in that same year returned to make a new division leaving the provinces as follows: *Provincia Hispania Ulterior Baetica (or Hispania Baetica), whose capital was Corduba, presently C√≥rdoba. It included a little less territory than present-day Andalusia--since modern Almer√≠a and a great portion of what today is Granada and Ja√©n were left outside--plus the southern zone of present-day Badajoz. The river Anas or Annas (Guadiana, from Wadi-Anas) separated Hispania Baetica from Lusitania. *Provincia Hispania Ulterior Lusitania (Lusitania), whose capital was Emerita Augusta (now M√©rida) and without Gallaecia and Asturias. *Provincia Hispania Citerior (or Tarraconensis), whose capital was Tarraco (Tarragona). After gaining maximum importance this province was simply known as Tarraconensis and it comprised Gallaecia (modern Galicia and northern Portugal) and Asturias. In AD 69, the province of Mauretania Tingitana was incorporated into the Diocesis Hispaniarum. By the 3rd century the emperor Caracalla made a new division which lasted only a short time. He split Hispania Citerior again into two parts, creating the new provinces Provincia Hispania Nova Citerior and Asturiae-Calleciae. In the year 238 the unified province Tarraconensis or Hispania Citerior was re-established. Provinces of Hispania under the Tetrarchy In the 3rd century, under the Soldier Emperors, Hispania Nova (the northwestern corner of Spain) was split off from Tarraconensis, as a small province but the home of the only permanent legion is Hispania, Legio VII Gemina. After Diocletian's Tetrarchy reform in AD 293, the new Diocese of Hispania became one of the four dioceses--governed by a vicarius--of the praetorian prefecture of Gaul (also comprising the provinces of Gaul, Germania and Britannia), after the abolition of the imperial Tetrarchs under the Western Emperor (in Rome itself, later Ravenna). The diocese, with capital at Emerita Augusta (modern M√©rida), comprised the five peninsular Iberian provinces (Baetica, Gallaecia and Lusitania, each under a governor styled consularis; and Carthaginiensis, Tarraconensis, each under a praeses), the Insulae Baleares and the North African province of Mauretania Tingitana. Christianity was introduced into Hispania in the 1st century and it became popular in the cities in the 2nd century. Little headway was made in the countryside, however, until the late 4th century, by which time Christianity was the official religion of the Roman Empire. Some heretical sects emerged in Hispania, most notably Priscillianism, but overall the local bishops remained subordinate to the Pope. Bishops who had official civil as well as ecclesiastical status in the late empire continued to exercise their authority to maintain order when civil governments broke down there in the 5th century. The Council of Bishops became an important instrument of stability during the ascendancy of the Visigoths. The last vestiges of (Western) Roman rule ended in 472. Germanic Hispania Iberian Peninsula (AD 530-AD 570) The Iberian Peninsula in the year 560 AD The undoing of Roman Spain was the result of four tribes crossing the Rhine New Year's Eve 407. After three years of depredation and wandering about northern and western Gaul the Germanic Buri, Suevi and Vandals, together with the Sarmatian Alans moved into Iberia in September or October 409 at the request of Gerontius a Roman usurper. Thus began the history of the end of Roman Spain which came in 472. The Suevi established a kingdom in Gallaecia in what is today modern Galicia and northern Portugal. The Alans' allies, the Hasdingi Vandals, also established a kingdom in another part of Gallaecia. The Alans established a kingdom in Lusitania - modern Alentejo and Algarve, in Portugal. The Silingi Vandals briefly occupied parts of South Iberia in the province of Baetica. In an effort to retrieve the region the western Roman emperor, Honorius (r. 395-423), promised the Visigoths a home in southwest Gaul if they destroyed the invaders in Spain. They all but wiped out the Silingi and Alans. The remnant joined the Asding Vandals who had settled first in the northwest with the Sueves but south to Baetica. It is a mystery why the Visigoths were recalled by patrician Constantius (who in 418 married Honorius' sister who had been married briefly to the Visigothic king Ataulf). The Visigoths, the remnants of the two tribes who joined them and the Sueves were confined to a small area in the northwest of the peninsula. The diocese may even have been re-established with the capital at M√©rida in 418.Kulikowski, M. The Career of the 'comes Hispanarum' Asterius, Phoenix, 2000a,54: 123-141. The Roman attempt under General Castorius to dislodge the Vandals from Cordoba failed in 422. The Vandals and Alans crossed over to North Africa in 429, an event which is considered to have been decisive in hastening the decline of the Western Empire. However their departure allowed the Romans to recover 90% of the Iberian peninsula until 439. After the departure of the Vandals only the Sueves remained in a northwest corner of the peninsula. Roman rule which had survived in the eastern quadrant was restored over most of Iberia until the Sueves occupied M√©rida in 439, a move which coincides to the Vandal occupation of Carthage late the same year. Rome made attempts to restore control in 446 and 458. Success was temporary. After the death of emperor Majorian in 461 Roman authority collapsed except in Tarraconensis the northeastern quadrant of the peninsular. The Visigoths, a Germanic people, whose kingdom was located in southwest Gaul, took the province when they occupied Tarragona in 472. They also confined the Sueves who had ruled most of the region to Galicia and northern Portugal. In 484 the Visigoths established Toledo as the capital of their kingdom. Successive Visigothic kings ruled Hispania as patricians who held imperial commissions to govern in the name of the Roman emperor. In 585 the Visigoths conquered the Suebic Kingdom of Galicia, and thus controlled almost all of Hispania. A century later, taking advantage of a struggle for the throne between the Visigothic kings Agila and Athanagild, the eastern emperor Justinian I sent an army under the command of Liberius to take back the peninsula from the Visigoths. This short-lived reconquest recovered only a small strip of land along the Mediterranean coast roughly corresponding to the ancient province of Baetica, known as Spania. Under the Visigoths, culture was not as highly developed as it had been under Roman rule, when a goal of higher education had been to prepare gentlemen to take their places in municipal and imperial administration. With the collapse of the imperial administrative super-structure above the provincial level (which was practically moribund) the task of maintaining formal education and government shifted to the Church from the old ruling class of educated aristocrats and gentry. The clergy, for the most part, emerged as the qualified personnel to manage higher administration in concert with local powerful notables who gradually displaced the old town councils. As elsewhere in early medieval Europe, the church in Hispania stood as society's most cohesive institution. The Visigoths are also responsible for the introduction of mainstream Christianity to the Iberian peninsula; the earliest representation of Christ in Spanish religious art can be found in a Visigothic hermitage, Santa Maria de Lara. It also embodied the continuity of Roman order. Romans continued to run the civil administration and Latin continued to be the language of government and of commerce on behalf of the Visigoths.E.A. Thompson, The Visigoths in Spain, 1969 pp. 114‚Äì131. Religion was the most persistent source of friction between the Chalcedonian (Catholic) Romans and their Arian Visigothic overlords, whom the former considered heretical. At times this tension invited open rebellion, and restive factions within the Visigothic aristocracy exploited it to weaken the monarchy. In 589, Recared, a Visigothic ruler, renounced his Arianism before the Council of Bishops at Toledo and accepted Chalcedonian Christianity (Catholic Church), thus assuring an alliance between the Visigothic monarchy and the Romans. This alliance would not mark the last time in the history of the peninsula that political unity would be sought through religious unity. Court ceremonials - from Constantinople - that proclaimed the imperial sovereignty and unity of the Visigothic state were introduced at Toledo. Still, civil war, royal assassinations, and usurpation were commonplace, and warlords and great landholders assumed wide discretionary powers. Bloody family feuds went unchecked. The Visigoths had acquired and cultivated the apparatus of the Roman state but not the ability to make it operate to their advantage. In the absence of a well-defined hereditary system of succession to the throne, rival factions encouraged foreign intervention by the Greeks, the Franks, and finally the Muslims in internal disputes and in royal elections. According to Isidore of Seville, it is with the Visigothic domination of the zone that the idea of a peninsular unity is sought after, and the phrase Mother Hispania is first spoken. Up to that date, Hispania designated all of the peninsula's lands. In Historia Gothorum, the Visigoth Suinthila appears as the first monarch where Hispania is dealt with as a Gothic nation. Muslim conquest and Christian Reconquest of Hispania Al-Andalus under the Caliph of Cordoba (ca.1000) The North African Muslims, referred to as Moors, conquered Hispania () (711‚Äì719), and called the area they controlled 'Al-Andalus' (). In the chronicles and documents of the High Middle Ages the terms derived from Hispania, Spania, Espa√±a or Espanha, continued to be used by the Christians but only in reference to Muslim controlled areas. King Alfonso I of Aragon (1104-1134) says in his documents that \\"he reigns over Pamplona, Aragon, Sobrarbe and Ribagor√ßa\\", and that when in 1126 he made an expedition to M√°laga he \\"went to the lands of Espa√±a\\". In the last years of the 12th century the whole Iberian Peninsula, Muslim and Christian, became known as \\"Spain\\" (Espa√±a, Espanya or Espanha) and the denomination \\"the Five Kingdoms of Spain\\" became used to refer to the Muslim Kingdom of Granada and the Christian kingdoms of Aragon, Castile, Portugal, and Navarre. Economy Before the Punic Wars, Hispania was a land with much untapped mineral and agricultural wealth, limited by the primitive subsistence economies of her native peoples outside of a few trading ports along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. Occupations by the Carthaginians and then by the Romans for her abundant silver deposits developed Hispania into a thriving multifaceted economy. Several metals, olives, oil from Baetica, salted fish and garum, and wines were some of the goods produced in Hispania and traded throughout the Empire. The gold mining was the most important activity in the north-west parts of the peninsula. This activity is attested in archaeological sites as Las M√©dulas (Spain) and Casais (Ponte de Lima, Portugal).Encadr√© 5.2 de Silva, A. J. M. (2012), Vivre au-del√† du fleuve de l'Oubli.

Climate Unusually high precipitation levels were during the so-called Iberian‚ÄìRoman Humid Period. The Roman Spain experienced its three phases: the most humid interval in 550‚Äì190 BC, an arid interval in 190 BC‚Äì150 AD and another humid period in 150‚Äì350. In 134 BC the army of Scipio Aemilianus in Spain had to march at night due to extreme heat, when some of its horses and mules died of thirst (even though earlier, in 181 BC, heavy spring rains prevented the Celtiberians from relieving the Roman siege of Contrebia). Through the 2nd century AD warm temperatures dominated particularly in the mountains along the north coast, punctuated by further cool spells from to 180. After about 200 the temperatures fluctuated, trending toward cool.

It was directed by Sandip Ray and written by his father Satyajit Ray. This film was released eleven years after its predecessor. Plot Goopy Gyne and Bagha Byne ruled the kingdom of Shundi and got bored of enjoying the royal luxuries. They want to get back to the days of adventure they had enjoyed all their lives, but age comes in the way. They leave the kingdom in search of new experiences. Finally, they reach Anandapur and win the king's heart with their musical abilities and powers. In the court room they meet Brahmananda Acharya, who invites Goopy and Bagha to come to Anandagarh fort. When they go to his place he offers them a job to steal three valuable stones, making use of their miraculous powers gifted by Bhuter Raja (King of Ghosts). In return he promises to make them 20 years younger. But he couldn't make younger anyone. He tell lie. They steal two rare stones with a hope to become young again. However, in their dream the King of Ghost appears and advises them to keep off injustice. They apologise to him and return the stones to the respective owners. Brahmananda Acharya had gained immense powers, as shown when he was not rendered motionless when they sang in front of the court. But, due to his greed of gaining rare and valuable stones, he was denied immortality. It was foretold that a 12-year boy, named Bikram, with divine powers, would defeat him. To prevent his death, Brahmananda Acharya had all the boys in Anandapur, who were 12 years old and were named Bikram, kidnapped by his soldiers. He hypnotized them, making them his servants. In the end, Goopy and Bagha find out that one boy named Kanu was previously named Bikram. At that time of meeting Kanu and Goopy Bagha, Goopy sang a song. But Kanu was not hypnotized by Goopy's song. He was to receive divine powers at the age of 12. He, along with Goopy and Bagha, goes towards Anandagarh fort. There, as Bikram entered the fort and came close to Brahmananda Acharya, the Acharya sinks beneath the ground, signifying that he had been destroyed. His valuable stones also vanish.

It has been written in C++ and use OpenGL cross-platform libraries. Its first application is the visualization of events in the Compact Muon Solenoid detector.  Introduction  FROG has been firstly written by Lo√Øc Quertenmont and Vincent Roberfroid in order to view, in a matter of seconds, events in the Compact Muon Solenoid detector. This detector is located at CERN and is dedicated to measure emitted particles produced by the collisions of high energetic protons accelerated by the Large Hadron Collider. Two other tools already exists in order to view events in the CMS detector : IGUANA and Fireworks. However, FROG has the advantage to have been implemented as such that any particular physics experiments or detector designs can be visualized. Moreover, in comparison with the 2 other event displayers, FROG is very light and very fast and can run on various Operating System (Windows, Linux, Mac OS). In addition, FROG is self-consistent and does not require installation of big libraries generally used by High Energy physic experiments such as ROOT.A full comparison of the three event displayer can be found here The article describes the principle of the algorithm and its many functionalities such as : 3D and 2D visualization, graphical user interface, mouse interface, configuration files, production of pictures of various format, integration of personal objects...

He is currently the head coach at the University of Maryland football team and former offensive coordinator at the University of Alabama. After serving as an assistant coach for several college football squads, he became the head coach of the University of New Mexico in 2009, coming back to Maryland as an offensive coordinator after his dismissal from UNM in 2011. In 2015, Locksley was named the interim head coach at Maryland after Randy Edsall was relieved of his duties. Locksley did not return to Maryland after that season, joining the University of Alabama as an offensive analyst. Locksley was promoted to offensive coordinator for the 2018 season, and that year received the Broyles Award, given to the nation's top assistant coach. Locksley returned to Maryland in December 2018 as head coach, following the firing of D. J. Durkin. Early life Locksley grew up in inner-city Washington D.C., and attended Ballou High School. College playing career Locksley played college football at Towson State University, now Towson University. He redshirted his first year on the Towson State Tigers and then spent two seasons sharing time at safety and then cornerback, backing up Towson veteran Bryant Hall. For the 1990 season he had 43 tackles and two interceptions at safety, after he filled in for the injured Aaron Bates. He was named the Tigers' Defensive Player of the Year for his senior season. He graduated in the spring of 1992 with a degree in marketing. Coaching career He served as defensive backs coach and special teams coach at Towson State for the 1992 season, then defensive coordinator at Naval Academy Preparatory School in 1993 (defensive backs) and 1994 (defensive line), was outside linebackers coach at the University of the Pacific for 1995, then spent the 1996 season coaching tight ends and split ends at Army. Locksley became the running backs coach for the University of Maryland under head coach Ron Vanderlinden in February 1997. Ron Vanderlinden named Locksley to the additional post of recruiting coordinator, replacing Chris Cosh who left to take the defensive coordinator's job at Michigan State, in February 1998. After Vanderlinden was fired, in 2000, and Ralph Friedgen was named head coach, Locksley and wide receivers coach James Franklin were the only two assistants to be retained by Maryland. In February 2003, after six years at Maryland, he was named as running backs coach and recruiting coordinator at the University of Florida under Ron Zook, replacing Tyke Tolbert, who left to be a coach with the Arizona Cardinals of the NFL. Locksley was named offensive coordinator at Illinois in January 2005, replacing Larry Fedora who went to Oklahoma State University, pairing Locksley again with head coach Ron Zook. He is credited with luring at least nine players from the Washington D.C. area for Illinois from 2005 through 2008, including wide receiver Arrelious Benn, 2007 Big Ten Freshman of the Year. =New Mexico= He was named head coach of the New Mexico Lobos on December 9, 2008. He signed a six-year contract worth $750,000 annually. In late May 2009, a former administrative assistant at New Mexico filed an age and sex discrimination complaint against Locksley with the Equal Opportunity Commission. The complaint was filed by Locksley's former administrative assistant Sylvia Lopez, who claimed to have been subjected to age and sexual discrimination before being transferred out of Locksley's office. The claims were later withdrawn. In late September 2009, Locksley was reprimanded for an altercation with an assistant coach. He was subsequently suspended without pay for ten days. He was not on the sideline for the game against UNLV on October 24, 2009. Locksley led his Lobos to 1‚Äì11 records his first and second seasons. The high buyout was a large reason UNM chose at first not to fire him. New Mexico athletic director Paul Krebs, who made the decision to retain Locksley, expected improvement in the 2011 season. On September 25, 2011, Locksley was relieved of his duties following an 0‚Äì4 start that culminated in a loss at home to FCS Sam Houston State as well as the arrest of a minor for a DWI while driving a car registered to Locksley's 19-year-old son Meiko, a member of the Lobo Football team. After an internal investigation by UNM, it was found the minor was not a recruit as erroneously reported. Instead, the minor was a childhood friend of Meiko Locksley from his Champaign, IL days, when his dad served as Offensive Coordinator for the Illini from 2005-2008. =Maryland= On December 22, 2011, Locksley returned to the University of Maryland to join Randy Edsall's staff as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. Locksley was named interim head coach at Maryland on October 11, 2015, after Edsall was terminated. =Alabama= On March 1, 2016 Locksley joined the University of Alabama staff as an offensive analyst. On January 13, 2017, he was promoted to an on-field coaching role helping the Tide win their 17th national championship. The following year, on January 17, 2018, he was promoted to offensive coordinator.

Locksley led Maryland to a strong offensive start. In the first game of the 2019 season, Maryland defeated FCS affiliate Howard 79-0, following that up with a victory against 21st-ranked Syracuse 63-20. The 142 points in its first two games marked the Terps‚Äô highest-ever scoring output in consecutive games, and the 63 points scored against Syracuse were the most points scored by a Maryland football team against a ranked opponent in program history. Personal life Locksley along with his wife Kia have four children, three sons, Mike Jr., Meiko, and Kai, and a daughter, Kori. On September 3, 2017, Meiko was fatally shot in Columbia, Maryland.

History Conference Center Building Penn State Great Valley, founded in 1963 to provide graduate engineering programs to employees of local businesses, was housed in a rented school building in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania and was known as the King of Prussia Graduate Center. In 1974, the center began offering courses off-site at area businesses. In 1978, the center moved to an old elementary school building in Radnor, Pennsylvania. In 1982 the center moved back to King of Prussia and became the King of Prussia Center for Graduate Studies and Continuing Education. In 1987, the university acquired within the Great Valley Corporate Center in Malvern, Pennsylvania. A new facility was built on the site earning the distinction of being the first permanent campus in the country located within a corporate park. The campus moved to the new location in 1988, introduced a graduate management program, and changed its name to Penn State Great Valley. In 1998, the Board of Trustees approved the Great Valley campus as a distinct School of Graduate Professional Studies.

It is near the North Sea coast and Flamborough Head, and is situated about north of Bridlington. It lies on the B1229 road between Speeton and Flamborough. It is served by Bempton railway station which is on the Yorkshire Coast Line that runs between Hull and Scarborough. The parish of Bempton also contains Buckton village, which is situated directly next to Bempton. According to the 2011 UK census, Bempton parish had a population of 1,040, a slight decrease on the 2001 UK census figure of 1,050.  History  Bronze Age pit dwellings have been discovered near Bempton. From the mediaeval era until the 19th century Bempton was part of Dickering Wapentake. Between 1894 and 1974 Bempton was a part of the Bridlington Rural District, in the East Riding of Yorkshire. Between 1974 and 1996 it was part of the Borough of North Wolds (later Borough of East Yorkshire), in the county of Humberside. Amenities The parish church of St Michael is a Grade II* listed building and dates back to the 13th century. The village is well known for its cliffs. Bempton Cliffs is an RSPB nature reserve, best known for its breeding seabirds, including northern gannet, Atlantic puffin, razorbill, common guillemot, black-legged kittiwake and fulmar. Bempton also used to be home to RAF Bempton, an early warning station. Some of the old buildings are still visible from the cliff top. Bempton has a post office and general store, a garage, a hairdresser, antique shop and snooker club. It is home to Bempton Primary School, which was completely rebuilt in 2004 at a cost of over ¬£1 million. It also has a public house, The White Horse, which has a distinctive blue tiled roof.

History The G√ºnzburg (Cyrillic: –ì–∏–Ω–∑–±—É—Ä–≥, –ì–∏–Ω—Ü–±—É—Ä–≥, , Ginzburg, Gintsburg) family originated in the town of G√ºnzburg, Bavaria. It is believed that the family went there from the city of Ulm, W√ºrttemberg, and that for this reason the best-known progenitor of the family and some of his immediate descendants, as well as certain others, called themselves \\"Ulma- G√ºnzburg\\".Rabbi Jair Chajim Bacharach und Seine Ahnen, p. 45, Treves, 1894) proves that \\"Gunz\\" and \\"Gaunz\\" are simply variants of \\"G√ºnzburg. It is also an Ashkenazi Jewish surname. When, early in the emancipation period, the Jews of Russia and of Austria were ordered by their governments to adopt family names, it was natural that many of them should choose a name so respected and pleasing as that of G√ºnzburg. There is on record a lawsuit instituted by Baer G√ºnzburg of Grodno against a Jewish family of that city who had adopted the same name under the decree of 1804.Maggid, \\"Toledot Mishpechoth Gintzburg,\\" p. 239, St. Petersburg, 1899. The court sustained the right of Jewish families to adopt any name they chose, and the number of G√ºnzburg families accordingly increased. The name is composed of two German elements. Burg means \\"castle\\" or \\"citadel\\". This commonly was also used to describe a walled settlement or town, hence common usage in town names such as Hamburg (from Old German: Hammaburg, lit. \\"castle above the river bend\\").Duden, Geographische Namen in Deutschland. Mannheim, 1999. p. 134. Developments of the word include B√ºrger (\\"town dweller\\") or B√ºrgermeister (\\"town master\\" or \\"mayor\\"). The river name G√ºnz is ultimately derived from the Indo-European root ', meaning \\"to pour\\". Thus, G√ºnzburg refers to a \\"fortified town by the river G√ºnz\\".Duden, Geographische Namen in Deutschland. Mannheim, 1999. p. 130.

Originating from ancient Rome, it continued for almost five centuries. Roman portraiture is characterised by unusual realism and the desire to convey images of nature in the high quality style often seen in ancient Roman art. Some busts even seem to show clinical signs.Engmann B: Neurologic diseases in ancient Roman sculpture busts. Neurol Clin Pract December 2013 vol.3 no.6:539-541. doi: 10.1212/CPJ.0b013e3182a78f02 Several images and statues made in marble and bronze have survived in small numbers. Roman funerary art includes many portraits such as married couple funerary reliefs, which were most often made for wealthy freedmen rather than the patrician elite. Portrait sculpture from the Republican era tends to be somewhat more modest, realistic, and natural compared to early Imperial works. A typical work might be one like the standing figure \\"A Roman Patrician with Busts of His Ancestors\\" (c. 30 B.C.).Janson, p. 197 By the imperial age, though they were often realistic depictions of human anatomy, portrait sculpture of Roman emperors were often used for propaganda purposes and included ideological messages in the pose, accoutrements, or costume of the figure. Since most emperors from Augustus on were deified, some images are somewhat idealized. The Romans also depicted warriors and heroic adventures, in the spirit of the Greeks who came before them. Ideology =Religious functions and origins= Veristic portrait bust of an old man, head covered (capite velato), either a priest or paterfamilias (marble, mid-1st century BC) The origin of the realism of Roman portraits may be, according to some scholars, because they evolved from wax death masks. These death masks were taken from bodies and kept in a home altar. Besides wax, masks were made from bronze, marble and terracotta. The molds for the masks were made directly from the deceased, giving historians an accurate representation of typically Roman features. =Politics= In the days of the Republic, full-size statues of political officials and military commanders were often erected in public places. Such an honor was provided by the decision of the Senate, usually in commemoration of victories, triumphs and political achievements. These portraits were usually accompanied by a dedicatory inscription. If the person commemorated with a portrait was found to have committed a crime, the portrait would be destroyed. Roman leaders favored the sense of civic duty and military ability over beauty in their portraiture. Veristic portraits, including arguably ugly features, was a way of showing confidence and of placing a value on strength and leadership above superficial beauty. This type of portraiture sought to show what mattered to the Romans; powerful character valued above appearances. Similarly to Greek rulers, Roman leaders borrowed recognizable features from the appearances of their predecessors. For instance, rulers coming after Alexander the Great copied his distinct hairstyle and intense gaze in their own portraits.Stewart, Andrew F. ‚ÄúThe Alexander Mosaic: A Reading.‚Äù Faces of Power: Alexander's Image and Hellenistic Politics, University of California Press, 1993, pp. 140‚Äì141. This was commonly practiced to suggest their likeness to them in character and their legitimacy to rule; in short, these fictitious additions were meant to persuade their subjects that they would be as great and powerful a leader as the previous ruler had been, even if they did not see eye to eye on all issues. Choosing to proudly display imperfections in portraiture was an early departure from the idealistic tradition handed down from the Greeks. The apparent indifference toward perfection in physical appearance seems to have led to the eventual abandonment of realism altogether, as we see in the very late Portrait of the Four Tetrarchs. =Social and psychological aspect= Development of the Roman portrait was associated with increased interest in the individual, with the expansion of the social circle portrayed. At the heart of the artistic structure of many Roman portraits is the clear and rigorous transfer of unique features of the model, while still keeping the general style very similar. Unlike the ancient Greek portraits that strived for idealization (the Greeks believed that a good man must be beautiful), Roman portrait sculpture was far more natural and is still considered one of the most realistic samples of the genre in the history of art. Historical development =Republican period= Portraiture in Republican Rome was a way of establishing societal legitimacy and achieving status through one's family and background. Exploits wrought by one's ancestors earned them and their families public approbation, and more; a pompous state funeral paid for by the state. Wax masks would be cast from the family member while they were still living, which made for hyper-realistic visual representations of the individual literally lifted from their face. These masks would be kept in the houses of male descendants in memory of the ancestors once they had passed. These masks served as a sort of family track record, and could get the descendants positions and perks, similar to a child of two alumni attending their alma mater. Republican Rome embraced imperfection in portraiture because, though there were different levels of power each class of society had, everybody had little insecurities, this type of untouched physical representation fostered a sense of community by implying that while there were existing inequalities, that did not change the fact that they were Romans.

Hellenistic Greek style and leadership expectations carried over into Roman leadership portraiture. One significant example is the Severan Period marble portrait of the emperor Caracalla. Nearly all representations of Caracalla reflect his military prowess through his frighteningly aggressive expression. Caracalla borrowed the precedent Alexander set; the piercing gaze. His arresting confidence exudes from his features to show that he is not a man to be trifled with. The intense sculptural execution of this piece in particular reflects a shift toward more geometric renderings of the human face to better convey messages to the public, often strong implications of power and authority to keep peace in the Roman Empire. Emperors coming after Caracalla saw the respect he commanded of his subordinate governing party as well as the Roman population as a whole. Seeing his success as a ruler, subsequent emperors sought to have portraits similar to Caracalla's to suggest that they were on the same level as him, both in terms of military tenacity and authoritarian control. This facilitated more and more geometric, less idealized figural representations of leaders to constantly emphasize the ruler's strength and image. This geometric style proved to be useful to the Roman Tetrarchs that divided rule of the empire among themselves after the reign of the emperors. The geometric style of the Portrait of the Four Tetrarchs is not realistic, but the style applied to all four figures sent a message of steadiness and agreements between the four rules, reassuring Roman citizens while simultaneously sending an unmistakable message of power and authority reminiscent of the previous emperors. Presenting variance in the appearance of the tetrarchs may have contributed to viewers favoring one ruler over the others. Instead, the Tetrarchy chose to show themselves as visually synonymous in this particular piece to show their ontological equality and show the unity and strength of the empire through this representation of all four together. Using near-identical geometric forms to represent their likenesses was the easiest way to show their equality and common will. The abstraction of human form made for a clearer understanding of the expectations Roman Tetrarchs had for their subjects and how Roman citizens expected the Tetrarchs to rule.

His father died in 1911.www.courts.state.ny.us He attended the public schools in New York City. On April 9, 1927, 19-year-old Charles married 18-year-old Jeanne S. Hollander (1909-1996), who was also to become a lawyer. He earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Michigan in 1929, and a law degree from Columbia University Law School. The Breitels have had two daughters: Eleanor (Breitel) Alter (1938-), a lawyer in Manhattan; and Vivian Hollander Breitel (1945-), who lives in Houston, Texas. Career From 1934 to 1950 he worked for Thomas E. Dewey. While Dewey was, successively, New York City's Special Prosecutor of Rackets, District Attorney of New York County, briefly in private law practice, and from 1943 on Governor of New York, Breitel was Assistant D.A., Dewey's law partner, and Counsel to the Governor. In 1950, Dewey appointed him a justice of the New York Supreme Court to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Samuel Null. In December 1950, Dewey re-appointed Breitel to the Supreme Court to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Ferdinand Pecora. In November 1951, he was elected on the Republican and Democratic tickets to a 14-year term, and re-elected in 1965. He was on the Appellate Division from 1952 to 1966. In January 1967, he was appointed a judge of the New York Court of Appeals to fill the vacancy caused by the election of Stanley H. Fuld as Chief Judge. In November 1967, he was elected to a 14-year term. In November 1973, he was elected on the Republican and Liberal tickets Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, defeating Democrat Jacob D. Fuchsberg and Conservative James J. Leff. As Chief Judge, he was a strong proponent of changing the way of choosing the Court of Appeals' judges from popular election, which had been the system since its establishment in 1846, to having them appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the New York State Senate. New York State voters approved the constitutional amendment. He retired from the bench at the end of 1978 when he reached the constitutional age limit of 70 years. His successor as Chief Judge was Lawrence H. Cooke, appointed by Governor Hugh L. Carey in 1979. Death He had a stroke in September 1990, and two months later entered the Mary Manning Walsh Nursing Home in Manhattan where he died of heart failure the next year, aged 82.

It is 8 miles east of the county capital, Leicester, and 90 miles north of London. Geography Lowesby parish is located 500 metres above sea level in a relatively hilly region. Other than Queniborough brook there are no other sites of topographic interest in Lowesby, partially due to the intensive farming in the area. Local farming may have been influenced by the geology of the area which is predominantly serpentine rock. Lowesby Hall was first owned by Richard Wallaston from the mid 17th century and remained in his family until Anne Wallaston married into the Fowke family, in whose hands the Hall remained well into the 20th century. It is now under private ownership. Governance The Rutland and Melton District, which includes Lowesby, is represented by Alicia Kearns (Conservative), who has held the seat since 2019. The councillor for Harborough is Michael Rook (Conservative), who was elected in May 2007. The county councillor for Lowesby is Simon Galton (Liberal Democrat). History The name Lowesby stems from Old Norse and is thought to mean Lausi's farm or settlement, which refers to the owner and subsequent land use. The manor of Lowesby is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as containing two plough teams consisting of five men each. The manor was held from Countess Judith, a niece of William the Conqueror, by a Norman named Hugh Burdet (or Bourdet/Bordet), originally from Cuilly in Normandy, who made Loseby his seat for many generations. The Burdets founded Loseby parish church and gave its advowson to the Order of St Lazarus based at Burton Lazars which they supported for many generations until relations soured in about 1290 when the Order started to appropriate part of the parish's tithes. Riots broke out over the ensuing years, Loseby's vicar was excommunicated and William Burdet's actions \\"polluted\\" the churchyard by bloodshed in 1297. Gradually calm was restored to the parish and in 1298 Sir William Burdet agreed to pay for the reconsecration of the church and reconfirmed his family's grants to the Order but relations were never the same again. Graph Showing the Occupational statistics of 1831 In 1831 agriculture was by far the most prominent industry, with 64% of the male population of the age of 20 employed in this sector. However, fifty years later, this number had dropped to 40%, and while agriculture was still the most common employment, the remainder of the population was working in other occupations, including as coachmen, gardeners for the manor, or as machinists. The parish's main land use in 2001 is still farming but just 9% of the population now work in agriculture and the manor no longer provides employment. Transport Lowesby railway station has been closed since 7 December 1953, and is now part of a farm. It was the first station to open on the Great Northern Railway route to Leicester on 15 May 1882. Economy The tertiary sector, otherwise described as the service sector, is the dominant area of employment in Lowesby with 62% (50 people) of the population working in this area. There has also been a movement into scientific and technical industries, which employs 10% of those working in tertiary industry in Lowesby. Demography Graph describing the relationship between the Population of Lowesby and time The population of Lowesby Parish was 127 in 2011. This level of population has not always been constant throughout the parish's history. The population of Lowesby grew by almost 100 people during the first fifty years of the 19th century. By the time of the 1851 census, a UK-wide railway network had almost been completed. Coupled with minor depressions and a second phase of British industrialisation, it may have led to a decline in the local population. The population has not recovered since then, with Lowesby having averaged approximately one hundred inhabitants during the 20th century.

She was the wife of the governor of Syria, Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso. The couple was accused of poisoning Germanicus, the nephew and adopted son of the Emperor Tiberius. At first, Munatia Plancina was acquitted, but when the trial was renewed she committed suicide.  Biography  Often Munatia Plancina is simply called Plancina. She was probably the daughter of a certain Munatius, who was the Comes of Tiberius during his diplomatic mission in the East. In this case she was the granddaughter of Lucius Munatius Plancus, who had been consul in 42 BC.Der Neue Pauly, vol. 7, col. 468 Munatia Plancina was a rich woman and very self-confident because of her noble descent.Tacitus, The Annals 2.43 She was probably the second wife of Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso. They had two sons: Gnaeus, who later changed his first name to Lucius, and Marcus Calpurnius Piso.Tacitus, The Annals 3.16 Munatia Plancina was also a close friend of Livia, the wife of the Emperor Augustus and mother of his successor, Tiberius. When her husband was elected governor of Syria Munatia Plancina accompanied him to his province (18 AD). At this time Germanicus was given overall command in the east of the Roman Empire. Germanicus and his wife Agrippina the Elder subsequently travelled to Syria where they became involved in a serious quarrel with the governor Piso and his wife. The Roman historian Tacitus states that like Agrippina, Munatia Plancina was sometimes present at military parades. Munatia Plancina was said to openly insult Germanicus and his wife.Tacitus, The Annals 2.55 Tacitus goes on to say that Livia secretly ordered Munatia Plancina to take this action against Germanicus and Agrippina.Tacitus, The Annals 2.43Tacitus, The Annals 2.82 Munatia Plancina was supposed to have been in contact with a Syrian called Martina who prepared the poison to be used to kill Germanicus.Tacitus, The Annals 2.74 As Germanicus was dying (10 October 19 AD) he was said to have suspected Piso and his wife of having him poisoned.Tacitus, The Annals 2.71Cassius Dio, Roman History 57.18.9 The death of Germanicus supposedly gave Munatia Plancina a lot of pleasure.Tacitus, The Annals 2.75Tacitus, The Annals 3.13 Then she supported her husband Piso in taking possession of Syria through military force.Tacitus, The Annals 2.80 In autumn 20 AD Munatia Plancina and her husband returned to Rome.Tacitus, The Annals 3.9 The couple had to answer to the Roman Senate for their alleged murder of Germanicus. Munatia Plancina was convicted but Livia exerted pressure on Tiberius to acquit her. Munatia Plancina then dissociated herself from her husband Piso who committed suicide.Tacitus, The Annals 3.15 compare 3.17 A recently discovered senate resolution has confirmed that Munatia Plancina owed her acquittal to a recommendation of Tiberius, who had been persuaded by Livia to act in this way.Senatus Consultum de Cn. Pisone patre, lines 109-120 But after the death of Livia, Munatia Plancina lost a powerful protectress. In 33 AD, Tiberius renewed the charge of murder against her. Munatia Plancina committed suicide before the judgement.Tacitus, The Annals 6.26Cassius Dio, Roman History 58.22 It has been noted that the family of Munatia Plancina was poorly regarded during the reign of Tiberius because of the very negative characterization of her grandfather, Lucius Munatius Plancus, by the historian Marcus Velleius Paterculus.Marcus Velleius Paterculus, Roman History 2.83  References   Sources  * Rudolf Hanslik: Munatius 44).

An herbivore, Amphicoelias was moderately sized at about long‚Äìroughly the same length as Diplodocus, to which it was related. Its hindlimbs were very long and thin, and its forelimbs were proportionally longer than in relatives. The namesake fossil of the type species Amphicoelias altus, American Museum of Natural History 5764, is uncertain in included material. When described by Edward Drinker Cope shortly after its discovery in 1877, Amphicoelias was noted to include many back vertebrae, a single pubis, and a femur. However, after purchase and cataloging of the material by the AMNH, Henry Fairfield Osborn and Charles Mook described that the specimen had only two vertebrae, a pubis, femur, tooth, scapula, coracoid, ulna and a second femur. The additional material, not mentioned by Cope, was found close in proximity to the holotype and was similar to Diplodocus, a relative of Amphicoelias. Their assignment was questioned by subsequent authors Emanuel Tschopp et al. in an analysis of Diplodocidae. During the description of Amphicoelias altus in 1877, Cope additionally named A. latus, for a femur and tail vertebrae. Following its description, Osborn and Mook in 1921 reidentified the material as a specimen of Camarasaurus, an assignment followed by other authors who reviewed the material. A year later 1878, Cope named the third species of Amphicoelias, A. fragillimus for a gigantic dorsal vertebra that was subsequently lost. Measuring approximately if reconstructed based on Diplodocus, early estimates for the length of the animal in life were between long. Due to the incomplete nature, such lengths‚Äìthe longest of any known dinosaur and sauropod‚Äìwere largely ignored. In 2018, Kenneth Carpenter renamed Amphicoelias fragillimus as the new genus Maraapunisaurus, and reclassified it from Diplodocidae to Rebbachisauridae. Description Restoration of A. altus Henry Fairfield Osborn and Charles Craig Mook noted the overall close similarity between Amphicoelias and Diplodocus, as well as a few key differences, such as proportionally longer forelimbs in Amphicoelias than in Diplodocus. The femur of Amphicoelias is unusually long, slender, and round in cross section; while this roundness was once thought to be another distinguishing characteristic of Amphicoelias, it has since been found in some specimens of Diplodocus as well. A. altus was also similar in size to Diplodocus, estimated to be about long. The dorsal vertebrae of Amphicoelias are mostly incomplete, but their anatomy is discernible from the known remains. The centrum is very compressed in the middle in all dimensions, with a large pleurocoel set inside a large lateral . In Amphicoelias the is very tall, and along its side there is a prominent lamina extending from the posterior centrum to the (articular surfaces with the neural arch of the preceding vertebra). From directly behind the prezygapophyses, the (lateral processes for rib articulation) project slightly upwards and outwards, surrounded by shallow fossae and a large lamina extending up the . The neural spine is thin, with a pair of ridges going up along either side on the edges. The end is wide compared to the main spine, but approximately subequal in length and width. A partial forelimb, provisionally referred to Amphicoelias by Osborn & Mook in 1921, resembles Diplodocus but is more robust overall. The distal end of the scapula, while only partially preserved, show that the expansion of the was smaller than Camarasaurus but larger than Apatosaurus. long as preserved, the bone is noticeably thicker than in Diplodocus, but not quite as thick as in Camarasaurus. The coracoid found alongside the scapula is far more similar to Diplodocus than Camarasaurus, being round and longer than tall. However, it is also thicker than in Diplocodus. The in the coracoid is large and centered on the short axis of the bone. The ulna is more elongate than any comparable bone known from Diplocodus. It has prominent articular faces for the humerus and radius, and narrows toward the incomplete distal end. The pubis of Amphicoelias is very fragmentary, and the only discernible characteristics are that it is long but thick, and has a small surface for articulation with the . A single, slender right femur of Amphicoelias is known from the holotype, long. It is slightly longer than the femur of Camarasaurus supremus, but significantly less robust, being approximately round in cross- section and only wide. The shaft of the femur is gently curved towards the hip articulation, and straight close to the prominent articular . A second, partial left femur was also found in the collections of the AMNH, and was assigned to the holotype specimen, while it was not mentioned by Cope. It lacks a majority of the upper bone, but the known shaft and end are very similar to the one figured by Cope, and it may be the left femur of the same individual. Discovery and history E.D. Cope's original sketch of Amphicoelias altus as an \\"amphibious lizard\\", c. 1897 In 1877, a number of fossils were discovered by Oramel William Lucas in rock outcrops in Colorado close to Canyon City. These bones, including some named Laelaps trihedrodon, Camarasaurus supremus and Caulodon, were assumed to be from the Cretaceous Dakota Formation by paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope, from the same age as other Laelaps fossils. Among the assortment of fossils discovered, a specimen including multiple dorsal vertebrae, a pubis, and a femur was found by Aaron Ripley, Lucas' brother-in-law, in Quarry XII. They were sent to Cope on 21 October 1877.J.S. McIntosh, 1998, \\"New information about the Cope collection of sauropods from the Garden Park, Colorado\\", In: Carpenter, K., Chure, D. and Kirkland, J.I. (eds.) The Morrison Formation: An Interdisciplinary Study. Part 2. Modern Geology 23(1-4): 481-506 Cope concluded they belonged to a new taxon within Sauropoda, which Cope named Amphicoelias altus in December, 1877. Cope determined that the taxon would have been a sauropod related to Camarasaurus found nearby, both being large animals with lightly built vertebrae and solid limbs. Cope sold his collection of fossils to the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) in 1895. Shortly before his death in 1897, he worked with the museum's artist Charles R. Knight to produce illustrations and paintings depicting some of his species in life, including Amphicoelias. Based on notes accompanying his sketches provided to Knight as reference material, Cope evidently considered both Amphicoelias and Brontosaurus junior synonyms of Camarasaurus supremus at this time. The specimen was given the accession number AMNH 5764, then including two dorsals, a pubis, a femur, a tooth, a scapula, coracoid and an ulna. While the forelimb material was not originally assigned to Amphicoelias, paleontologists Henry Fairfield Osborn and Charles Mook in 1921 added them to the holotype specimen on the basis that they were found in the same strata not far away, and bore differences from the Camarasaurus they were found alongside. Because of the uncertainty about the referral of these remains, in 2015 Emanuel Tschopp and colleagues hesitantly rejected the referral of the tooth, scapula and coracoid, but accepted the ulna referral. Based on collection data, the specimen was determined to have come from the Late Jurassic Morrison Formation, in the youngest layers, separate from those that held the Camarasaurus fossils also described by Cope. 1897 restoration of aquatic A. altus, by Charles R. Knight, based on Cope's original. Cope listed multiple features to separate Amphicoelias and A. altus from their relatives. Unlike in Camarasaurus, the of dorsals did not have an , where the front end has a ball that fits into the socket of the preceding vertebra. Instead, Amphicoelias had vertebrae, where both ends are mildly to moderately concave. Because of this difference, Cope named two separate families to contain the different morphs of vertebral centra, one being Camarasauridae and the other being Amphicoeliidae. As well, Camarasaurus possessed (openings in the side of the centrum) that were taller than long- contrasting to the condition in Amphicoelias- and a more robust pubis and femur. However, both families also had accessory articulations in the , which Cope termed the , limiting the motion of vertebrae respective to one another. Amphicoeliidae and Amphicoelias were both found to be intermediate and poorly defined by paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh in 1881, wherein the primary feature-two mildly concave articular faces-was shown to be widespread and also found in sauropods like Brontosaurus excelsus. =Previously assigned species= Amphicoelias latus was named in the same description as the type species, Amphicoelias altus. It was named for a series of four caudal vertebrae and a femur (AMNH 5765), in relatively good preservation. The caudals are bi-concave like the dorsals of A. altus, with short centra, long prezygapophyses and shallow pleurocoels. The femur is extremely robust, as well as being wide but short front-to-back. The femur is long, but the very end is not fully preserved. Due to the robusticity of the femur Osborn & Mook in 1921 referred Amphicoelias latus to Camarasaurus supremus, making C. supremus the valid name for the material once called A. latus. The third named Amphicoelias species, A. fragillimus, was known only from a single, incomplete tall neural arch, either last or second to last in the series of back vertebrae. Based only on an illustration published in 1878, this vertebra would have measured tall in life. However, it has been argued that the scale bar in the published description contained a typographical error, and the fossil vertebra was in fact only tall. In addition to this vertebra, Cope's field notes contain an entry for an \\"[i]mmense distal end of femur‚Äù, located only a few tens of meters away from the giant vertebra. It is likely that this undescribed leg bone belonged to the same individual animal as the neural spine, but it was never collected or described. In 2018, A. fragillimus was given its own genus, Maraapunisaurus, and reclassified as a primitive rebbachisaurid. Three skeletons informally assigned to \\"A. brontodiplodocus\\" in 2010, now labelled as diplodocids in Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum, Singapore In 2010, an article was made available, but not formally published, by Henry Galiano and Raimund Albersdorfer in which they referred to the new species \\"A. brontodiplodocus\\" to Amphicoelias, based on several complete specimens found in the Dana Quarry of Big Horn Basin, Wyoming and held in a private collection. The specific name referred to their hypothesis based on these specimens that nearly all Morrison diplodocid species are either growth stages or represent sexual dimorphism among members of the genus Amphicoelias, but this analysis has been met with skepticism and the publication itself has been disclaimed by its lead author, explaining that it is \\"obviously a drafted manuscript complete with typos, etc., and not a final paper. In fact, no printing or distribution has been attempted\\". Osborn and Mook, in 1921, provisionally synonymized A. fragillimus with A. altus, while sinking A. latus into Camarasaurus supremus, and suggesting also that A. fragillimus is just a very large individual of A. altus, a position that most subsequent studies, including McIntosh 1998, Foster (2007), and Woodruff and Foster (2015) have agreed with. Carpenter (2006) disagreed about the synonymy of A. altus and A. fragillimus, however, citing numerous differences in the construction of the vertebra also noted by Cope, and suggested these differences are enough to warrant a separate species or even a separate genus for A. fragillimus. However, he went on to caution that the validity of A. fragillimus as a separate species is nearly impossible to determine without the original specimen to study. Although Amphicoelias latus is clearly not Amphicoelias, it is probably synonymous with Camarasaurus grandis rather than C. supremus because it was found lower in the Morrison Formation and the deeply concave articular faces on the caudal vertebrae are more consistent with C. grandis. Classification In 2007, John Foster suggested that the differences usually cited to differentiate Amphicoelias altus from the more well known Diplodocus are not significant and may be due to individual variation. Foster argued that Amphicoelias is probably the senior synonym of Diplodocus, and that if further research bears this out, the familiar name Diplodocus would need to be abandoned in favor of Amphicoelias, as was the case with Brontosaurus and its senior synonym Apatosaurus. In 2015, Woodruff and Foster reiterated this conclusion, stating that there is only one species of Amphicoelias and that it could be referred to Diplodocus as Diplodocus altus. They considered the name Amphicoelias to be a nomen oblitum. This conclusion was disputed by Emanuel Tschopp et al. in 2015, where Amphicoelias was analysed as part of an extensive specimen-level phylogenetic analysis of Diplodocidae. There were two strongly supported placements found for Amphicoelias, as the basalmost genus within Apatosaurinae, and as an apatosaurine nested between Brontosaurus excelsus and Brontosaurus yahnahpin. There were no unambiguous characters found to support an assignment within Apatosaurinae, so the authors instead opted to classify Amphicoelias as the basalmost diplodocid outside Apatosaurinae and Diplodocinae, having primitive features, minimal significant differences from either subfamily, a slightly more parsimonious apatosaurine phylogeny, but a slightly more diplodocine morphology. The following cladogram of the Diplodocidae follows the species-level agreement tree of Tschopp et al. (2015) showing A. altus as the basalmost diplodocid. Skeletal mount of potentially closely related Brontosaurus excelsus holotype YPM 1980 Paleoecology In his 2006 re-evaluation, Carpenter examined the paleobiology of giant sauropods, including Amphicoelias, and addressed the question of why this group attained such a huge size. He pointed out that gigantic sizes were reached early in sauropod evolution, with very large sized species present as early as the late Triassic Period, and concluded that whatever evolutionary pressure caused large size was present from the early origins of the group. Carpenter cited several studies of giant mammalian herbivores, such as elephants and rhinoceros, which showed that larger size in plant-eating animals leads to greater efficiency in digesting food. Since larger animals have longer digestive systems, food is kept in digestion for significantly longer periods of time, allowing large animals to survive on lower-quality food sources. This is especially true of animals with a large number of 'fermentation chambers' along the intestine, which allow microbes to accumulate and ferment plant material, aiding digestion. Throughout their evolutionary history, sauropod dinosaurs were found primarily in semi-arid, seasonally dry environments, with a corresponding seasonal drop in the quality of food during the dry season. The environment of Amphicoelias was essentially a savanna, similar to the arid environments in which modern giant herbivores are found, supporting the idea that poor-quality food in an arid environment promotes the evolution of giant herbivores. Carpenter argued that other benefits of large size, such as relative immunity from predators, lower energy expenditure, and longer life span, are probably secondary advantages. Paleoenvironment restoration of a young diplodocid feeding on ferns The Morrison Formation environment in which Amphicoelias lived would have resembled a modern savanna, though since grass did not appear until the Late Cretaceous, ferns were probably the dominant plant and main food source for Amphicoelias. Though Engelmann et al. (2004) dismissed ferns as a sauropod food source due to their relatively low caloric content, Carpenter argued that the sauropod digestive system, well adapted to handle low-quality food, allows for the consumption of ferns as a large part of the sauropod diet. Carpenter also noted that the occasional presence of large petrified logs indicate the presence of tall trees, which would seem to conflict with the savanna comparison. However, the trees are rare, and since tall trees require more water than the savanna environment could generally provide, they probably existed in narrow tracts or \\"gallery forests\\" along rivers and gulleys where water could accumulate. Carpenter speculated that giant herbivores like Amphicoelias may have used the shade of the gallery forests to stay cool during the day, and done most of their feeding on the open savanna at night.

Overview ACHD covers the entirety of Ada County, including the six cities within it, and it is responsible for short-range planning, construction, maintenance and improvements to Ada County's local roads and bridges (excluding state highways like Eagle Road, Interstate 84, the Connector and overpasses, which are operated by the Idaho Transportation Department). The district maintains and operates approximately of roads and streets in Ada County, with an estimated value of $3 billion. This infrastructure includes facilities that range from multi-lane, arterial streets with a computerized signal system, to narrow, farm-to-market roadways. Organization Five commissioners govern the district. Together, they are responsible for guiding the planning, development and implementation of transportation facilities throughout the county. Elections are held every two years on a rotating basis, and each commissioner represents a separate subdistrict. Because strong public involvement is crucial to the transportation planning process, the commissioners and staff regularly host and attend meetings and public hearings to gather feedback from citizens. The commissioners also hold regular public meetings at the district's headquarters, and participate in joint meetings with municipal and county officials. An appointed director, who serves as chief administrator, manages the district on a day-to-day basis. The director is responsible for managing five departments: Administration, Engineering, Maintenance and Operations, Traffic, and Planning and Development, which combined total nearly 300 employees.

He committed suicide, when he realized that he would not be able to return to his hometown. Bilyk was a graduate of a high school in Brze≈ºany, where he got to know another student of the school, Edward Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy (both went to the same class and shared a bench). They became friends, joining together the Riflemen's Association and later, the Polish Legions. After World War I, Bilyk was nominated to the rank of major of the newly created Polish Army (on June 1, 1919) but following the Polish-Soviet War, he left the army and began studying law at the Jan Kazimierz University in Lw√≥w. In 1923 or 1924, he opened a lawyer's office in Lw√≥w. A close associate of Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy, Bi≈Çyk took advantage of the relationship, and was nominated to the post of Voivode of Tarnopol Voivodeship (15 July 1936). A year later, on 16 April 1937, he advanced even further, becoming the Voivode of Lw√≥w Voivodeship.Polish Voivodes On 12 September 1939, when first tanks of the Wehrmacht approached Lw√≥w (see: Polish September Campaign, Battle of Lvov (1939)), Bilyk gave a famous speech, which was transmitted by the local radio station. He emphasized that Lw√≥w, the city known as Semper Fidelis, would defend itself and that he himself would not abandon his post.Jerzy Janicki - \\"Czkawka\\" However, three days later, the Prime Minister Felicjan Slawoj-Skladkowski ordered Bilyk to leave for Kuty, where the government of Poland was temporarily seated. From Kuty, Bilyk left Poland for Munkacs, which then belonged to Hungary. On 17 September, following the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, units of the Red Army, allied with the Nazis, crossed eastern border of Poland. Facing little resistance, as bulk of the Polish Army was engaged in the West, the Soviets quickly moved westwards. Bilyk twice tried to return to his native city, but failed. Upon realizing that fate of Lw√≥w had been settled, he committed suicide on 19 September 1939 in room number 5 of the Csillag Hotel. Before shooting himself, Bilyk wrote a farewell note, which is now kept in the Polish Institute and Sikorski Museum in London.

W. Williston. The generic name, coined by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1878, is a neo-Latin term derived from Greek Œ¥ŒπœÄŒªœåœÇ (diplos) \\"double\\" and Œ¥ŒøŒ∫œåœÇ (dokos) \\"beam\\", in reference to the double-beamed chevron bones located in the underside of the tail, which were then considered unique. This genus of dinosaurs lived in what is now mid-western North America at the end of the Jurassic period. It is one of the more common dinosaur fossils found in the middle to upper Morrison Formation, between about 154 and 152 million years ago, during the late Kimmeridgian age. The Morrison Formation records an environment and time dominated by gigantic sauropod dinosaurs, such as Apatosaurus, Barosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Brontosaurus, and Camarasaurus. Its great size may have been a deterrent to the predators Allosaurus and Ceratosaurus: their remains have been found in the same strata, which suggests that they coexisted with Diplodocus. Diplodocus is among the most easily identifiable dinosaurs, with its typical sauropod shape, long neck and tail, and four sturdy legs. For many years, it was the longest dinosaur known. Description Sizes of Diplodocus carnegii (orange) and D. hallorum (green) compared with a human. Among the best-known sauropods, Diplodocus were very large, long-necked, quadrupedal animals, with long, whip-like tails. Their forelimbs were slightly shorter than their hind limbs, resulting in a largely horizontal posture. The skeletal structure of these long-necked, long- tailed animals supported by four sturdy legs have been compared with suspension bridges. In fact, Diplodocus carnegii is currently one of the longest dinosaurs known from a complete skeleton, with a total length of . Modern mass estimates for Diplodocus carnegii have tended to be in the range.Foster, J.R. (2003). Paleoecological Analysis of the Vertebrate Fauna of the Morrison Formation (Upper Jurassic), Rocky Mountain Region, U.S.A. New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science:Albuquerque, New Mexico. Bulletin 23. Diplodocus hallorum, known from partial remains, was even larger, and is estimated to have been the size of four elephants. When first described in 1991, discoverer David Gillette calculated it may have been up to 52 m (171 ft) long, making it the longest known dinosaur (excluding those known from exceedingly poor remains, such as Amphicoelias). Some weight estimates of this time ranged as high as . The estimated length was later revised downward to and later on to Carpenter, K. (2006). \\"Biggest of the big: a critical re- evaluation of the mega-sauropod Amphicoelias fragillimus.\\" In Foster, J.R. and Lucas, S.G., eds., 2006, Paleontology and Geology of the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation. New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin 36: 131‚Äì138. based on findings that show that Gillette had originally misplaced vertebrae 12‚Äì19 as vertebrae 20‚Äì27. The nearly complete Diplodocus carnegii skeleton at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on which size estimates of D. hallorum are mainly based, also was found to have had its 13th tail vertebra come from another dinosaur, throwing off size estimates for D. hallorum even further. While dinosaurs such as Supersaurus were probably longer, fossil remains of these animals are only fragmentary.Wedel, M.J. and Cifelli, R.L. Sauroposeidon: Oklahoma's Native Giant. 2005. Oklahoma Geology Notes 65:2. Caudal vertebrae of D. carnegii showing the double-beamed chevron bones to which the genus name refers, Natural History Museum, London Diplodocus had an extremely long tail, composed of about 80 caudal vertebrae, which are almost double the number some of the earlier sauropods had in their tails (such as Shunosaurus with 43), and far more than contemporaneous macronarians had (such as Camarasaurus with 53). Some speculation exists as to whether it may have had a defensive or noisemaking (by cracking it like a coachwhip) function. The tail may have served as a counterbalance for the neck. The middle part of the tail had \\"double beams\\" (oddly shaped chevron bones on the underside, which gave Diplodocus its name). They may have provided support for the vertebrae, or perhaps prevented the blood vessels from being crushed if the animal's heavy tail pressed against the ground. These \\"double beams\\" are also seen in some related dinosaurs. Chevron bones of this particular form were initially believed to be unique to Diplodocus; since then they have been discovered in other members of the diplodocid family as well as in non-diplodocid sauropods, such as Mamenchisaurus. Restoration of D. carnegii with horizontal neck, flexible whip tail, keratinous spines and nostrils low on the snout Like other sauropods, the manus (front \\"feet\\") of Diplodocus were highly modified, with the finger and hand bones arranged into a vertical column, horseshoe-shaped in cross section. Diplodocus lacked claws on all but one digit of the front limb, and this claw was unusually large relative to other sauropods, flattened from side to side, and detached from the bones of the hand. The function of this unusually specialized claw is unknown. No skull has ever been found that can be confidently said to belong to Diplodocus, though skulls of other diplodocids closely related to Diplodocus (such as Galeamopus) are well known. The skulls of diplodocids were very small compared with the size of these animals. Diplodocus had small, 'peg'-like teeth that pointed forward and were only present in the anterior sections of the jaws. Its braincase was small. The neck was composed of at least 15 vertebrae and may have been held parallel to the ground and unable to be elevated much past horizontal. The discovery of partial diplodocid skin impressions in 1990 showed that some species had narrow, pointed keratinous spines, much like those on an iguana and up to long, on the \\"whiplash\\" portion of their tails, and possibly along the back and neck as well, as in hadrosaurids.Czerkas, S. A. (1994). \\"The history and interpretation of sauropod skin impressions.\\" In Aspects of Sauropod Paleobiology (M. G. Lockley, V. F. dos Santos, C. A. Meyer, and A. P. Hunt, Eds.), Gaia No. 10. (Lisbon, Portugal). The spines have been incorporated into many recent reconstructions of Diplodocus, notably Walking with Dinosaurs.Haines, T., James, J. Time of the Titans . ABC Online. The original description of the spines noted that the specimens in the Howe Quarry near Shell, Wyoming were associated with skeletal remains of an undescribed diplodocids \\"resembling Diplodocus and Barosaurus.\\" Specimens from this quarry have since been referred to Kaatedocus siberi and Barosaurus sp., rather than Diplodocus. Discovery and species Hatcher's original restoration of the skeleton of D. carnegii, 1901 Several species of Diplodocus were described between 1878 and 1924. The first skeleton was found at Ca√±on City, Colorado, by Benjamin Mudge and Samuel Wendell Williston in 1877, and was named Diplodocus longus ('long double-beam') by paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh in 1878. Although not the type species, D. carnegii is the most completely known and most famous species due to the large number of casts of its skeleton in museums around the world. Diplodocus remains have since been found in the Morrison Formation of the western U.S. states of Colorado, Utah, Montana, and Wyoming. Fossils of this animal are common, except for the skull, which has never been found with otherwise complete skeletons. D. hayi, known from a partial skeleton and skull discovered by William H. Utterback in 1902 near Sheridan, Wyoming, was described in 1924.Holland WJ. The skull of Diplodocus. Memoirs of the Carnegie Museum IX; 379‚Äì403 (1924). In 2015, it was renamed as the separate genus Galeamopus, and several other Diplodocus specimens were referred to that genus, leaving no definite Diplodocus skulls known. The two Morrison Formation sauropod genera Diplodocus and Barosaurus had very similar limb bones. In the past, many isolated limb bones were automatically attributed to Diplodocus, but may, in fact, have belonged to Barosaurus. Fossil remains of Diplodocus have been recovered from stratigraphic zone 5 of the Morrison Formation.Foster, J. (2007). \\"Appendix.\\" Jurassic West: The Dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation and Their World.

This was reconsidered as type-species for Diplodocus. * D. hallorum, first described in 1991 by Gillette as Seismosaurus halli from a partial skeleton comprising vertebrae, pelvis and ribs, specimen NMMNH P-3690, was found in 1979. As the specific name honours two people, Jim and Ruth Hall, George Olshevsky later suggested to emend the name as S. hallorum, using the mandatory genitive plural; Gillette then emended the name,Gillette, D.D., 1994, Seismosaurus: The Earth Shaker. New York, Columbia University Press, 205 pp which usage has been followed by others, including Carpenter (2006). In 2004, a presentation at the annual conference of the Geological Society of America made a case for Seismosaurus being a junior synonym of Diplodocus.Lucas S, Herne M, Heckert A, Hunt A, and Sullivan R. Reappraisal of Seismosaurus, A Late Jurassic Sauropod Dinosaur from New Mexico. The Geological Society of America, 2004 Denver Annual Meeting (November 7‚Äì10, 2004). Retrieved on May 24, 2007. This was followed by a much more detailed publication in 2006, which not only renamed the species Diplodocus hallorum, but also speculated that it could prove to be the same as D. longus. The position that D. hallorum should be regarded as a specimen of D. longus was also taken by the authors of a redescription of Supersaurus, refuting a previous hypothesis that Seismosaurus and Supersaurus were the same. A 2015 analysis of diplodocid relationships noted that these opinions are based on the more complete referred specimens of D. longus. The authors of this analysis concluded that those specimens were indeed the same species as D. hallorum, but that D. longus itself was a nomen dubium. =Nomina dubia (doubtful species)= USNM 2672, a skull formerly thought to have belonged to the holotype of D. longus * D. longus, the type species, is known from two complete and several fragmentary caudal vertebrae from the Morrison Formation (Felch Quarry) of Colorado. Though several more complete specimens have been attributed to D. longus, detailed analysis has suggested that the original fossil lacks the necessary features to allow comparison with other specimens. For this reason, it has been considered a nomen dubium, which is not an ideal situation for the type species of a well-known genus like Diplodocus. A petition to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature was being considered which proposed to make D. carnegii the new type species. This proposal was rejected by the ICZN and D. longus has been maintained as the type species. * D. lacustris (\\"of the lake\\") is a nomen dubium, named by Marsh in 1884 based on specimen YPM 1922 found by Arthur Lakes, consisting of the snout and upper jaw of a smaller animal from Morrison, Colorado. These remains are now believed to have been from an immature animal, rather than from a separate species. In 2015, it was concluded that the specimen actually belonged to Camarasaurus. Classification Diplodocus is both the type genus of, and gives its name to, the Diplodocidae, the family to which it belongs. Members of this family, while still massive, are of a markedly more slender build than other sauropods, such as the titanosaurs and brachiosaurs. All are characterised by long necks and tails and a horizontal posture, with fore limbs shorter than hind limbs. Diplodocids flourished in the Late Jurassic of North America and possibly Africa. A subfamily, the Diplodocinae, was erected to include Diplodocus and its closest relatives, including Barosaurus. More distantly related is the contemporaneous Apatosaurus, which is still considered a diplodocid, although not a diplodocine, as it is a member of the sister subfamily Apatosaurinae. The Portuguese Dinheirosaurus and the African Tornieria have also been identified as close relatives of Diplodocus by some authors. The Diplodocoidea comprise the diplodocids, as well as dicraeosaurids, rebbachisaurids, Suuwassea, Amphicoelias and possibly Haplocanthosaurus, and/or the nemegtosaurids. This clade is the sister group to Macronaria (camarasaurids, brachiosaurids and titanosaurians).

Many aspects of its lifestyle have been subjects of various theories over the years. Comparisons between the scleral rings of diplodocines and modern birds and reptiles suggest that they may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day at short intervals. Marsh and then HatcherHatcher JB. \\"Diplodocus (Marsh): Its osteology, taxonomy, and probable habits, with a restoration of the skeleton\\". Memoirs of the Carnegie Museum, vol. 1 (1901), pp. 1‚Äì63 assumed that the animal was aquatic, because of the position of its nasal openings at the apex of the cranium. Similar aquatic behavior was commonly depicted for other large sauropods, such as Brachiosaurus and Apatosaurus. A 1951 study by Kenneth A. Kermack indicates that sauropods probably could not have breathed through their nostrils when the rest of the body was submerged, as the water pressure on the chest wall would be too great. Since the 1970s, general consensus has the sauropods as firmly terrestrial animals, browsing on trees, ferns, and bushes.Gangewere, J.R. (1999). \\"Diplodocus carnegii \\". Carnegie Magazine. Scientists have debated as to how sauropods were able to breathe with their large body sizes and long necks, which would have increased the amount of dead space. They likely had an avian respiratory system, which is more efficient than a mammalian and reptilian system. Reconstructions of the neck and thorax of Diplodocus show great pneumaticity, which could have played a role in respiration as it does in birds. =Posture= An outmoded depiction by Oliver P. Hay (1910), with sprawled limbsHay, O. P., 1910, Proceedings of the Washington Academy of Sciences, vol. 12,, pp. 1‚Äì25 Diplodocus carnegii in the reconstruction of Gustav Tornier, 1909. Drawing by Paul Flanderky (1872-1937) The depiction of Diplodocus posture has changed considerably over the years. For instance, a classic 1910 reconstruction by Oliver P. Hay depicts two Diplodocus with splayed lizard-like limbs on the banks of a river. Hay argued that Diplodocus had a sprawling, lizard-like gait with widely splayed legs,Hay, Dr. Oliver P., \\"On the Habits and Pose of the Sauropod Dinosaurs, especially of Diplodocus.\\" The American Naturalist, Vol. XLII, Oct. 1908 and was supported by Gustav Tornier. This hypothesis was contested by William Jacob Holland, who demonstrated that a sprawling Diplodocus would have needed a trench through which to pull its belly. Finds of sauropod footprints in the 1930s eventually put Hay's theory to rest. Upright neck pose for D. carnegii based on Taylor et al. (2009) Later, diplodocids were often portrayed with their necks held high up in the air, allowing them to graze from tall trees. Studies looking at the morphology of sauropod necks have concluded that the neutral posture of Diplodocus neck was close to horizontal, rather than vertical, and scientists such as Kent Stevens have used this to argue that sauropods including Diplodocus did not raise their heads much above shoulder level. A nuchal ligament may have held the neck in this position. A 2009 study found that all tetrapods appear to hold the base of their necks at the maximum possible vertical extension when in a normal, alert posture, and argued that the same would hold true for sauropods barring any unknown, unique characteristics that set the soft tissue anatomy of their necks apart from other animals. The study found faults with Stevens' assumptions regarding the potential range of motion in sauropod necks, and based on comparing skeletons to living animals the study also argued that soft tissues could have increased flexibility more than the bones alone suggest. For these reasons they argued that Diplodocus would have held its neck at a more elevated angle than previous studies have concluded. As with the related genus Barosaurus, the very long neck of Diplodocus is the source of much controversy among scientists. A 1992 Columbia University study of diplodocid neck structure indicated that the longest necks would have required a 1.6-ton heart ‚Äì a tenth of the animal's body weight. The study proposed that animals like these would have had rudimentary auxiliary \\"hearts\\" in their necks, whose only purpose was to pump blood up to the next \\"heart\\". Some argue that the near-horizontal posture of the head and neck would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain, as it would not be elevated. =Diet and feeding= Cast of a diplodocid skull that may belong to a species of Diplodocus (CM 11161) Diplodocines have highly unusual teeth compared to other sauropods. The crowns are long and slender, and elliptical in cross-section, while the apex forms a blunt, triangular point. The most prominent wear facet is on the apex, though unlike all other wear patterns observed within sauropods, diplodocine wear patterns are on the labial (cheek) side of both the upper and lower teeth. This implies that the feeding mechanism of Diplodocus and other diplodocids was radically different from that of other sauropods. Unilateral branch stripping is the most likely feeding behavior of Diplodocus,Norman, D.B. (1985). The illustrated Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs. London: Salamander Books Ltd as it explains the unusual wear patterns of the teeth (coming from tooth‚Äìfood contact). In unilateral branch stripping, one tooth row would have been used to strip foliage from the stem, while the other would act as a guide and stabilizer. With the elongated preorbital (in front of the eyes) region of the skull, longer portions of stems could be stripped in a single action. Also, the palinal (backwards) motion of the lower jaws could have contributed two significant roles to feeding behavior: (1) an increased gape, and (2) allowed fine adjustments of the relative positions of the tooth rows, creating a smooth stripping action. Young et al. (2012) used biomechanical modelling to examine the performance of the diplodocine skull. It was concluded that the proposal that its dentition was used for bark-stripping was not supported by the data, which showed that under that scenario, the skull and teeth would undergo extreme stresses. The hypotheses of branch-stripping and/or precision biting were both shown to be biomechanically plausible feeding behaviors. Diplodocine teeth were also continually replaced throughout their lives, usually in less than 35 days, as was discovered by Michael D'Emic et al. Within each tooth socket, as many as five replacement teeth were developing to replace the next one. Studies of the teeth also reveal that it preferred different vegetation from the other sauropods of the Morrison, such as Camarasaurus. This may have better allowed the various species of sauropods to exist without competition. Diplodocus (green) and various sauropods in a tripodal posture; The white dots showing the approximate center of mass, as estimated in studies. The flexibility of Diplodocus neck is debated but it should have been able to browse from low levels to about 4 m (13 ft) when on all fours. However, studies have shown that the center of mass of Diplodocus was very close to the hip socket; this means that Diplodocus could rear up into a bipedal posture with relatively little effort. It also had the advantage of using its large tail as a 'prop' which would allow for a very stable tripodal posture. In a tripodal posture Diplodocus could potentially increase its feeding height up to about . The neck's range of movement would have also allowed the head to graze below the level of the body, leading some scientists to speculate on whether Diplodocus grazed on submerged water plants, from riverbanks. This concept of the feeding posture is supported by the relative lengths of front and hind limbs. Furthermore, its peg-like teeth may have been used for eating soft water plants. Matthew Cobley et al. (2013) dispute this, finding that large muscles and cartilage would have limited neck movements. They state that the feeding ranges for sauropods like Diplodocus were smaller than previously believed and the animals may have had to move their whole bodies around to better access areas where they could browse vegetation. As such, they might have spent more time foraging to meet their minimum energy needs. The conclusions of Cobley et al. were disputed in 2013 and 2014 by Mike Taylor, who analysed the amount and positioning of intervertebral cartilage to determine the flexibility of the neck of Diplodocus and Apatosaurus. Taylor found that the neck of Diplodocus was very flexible, and that Cobley et al. were incorrect, in that flexibility as implied by bones is less than in reality. In 2010, Whitlock et al. described a juvenile skull at the time referred to Diplodocus (CM 11255) that differed greatly from adult skulls of the same genus: its snout was not blunt, and the teeth were not confined to the front of the snout. These differences suggest that adults and juveniles were feeding differently. Such an ecological difference between adults and juveniles had not been previously observed in sauropodomorphs. =Reproduction and growth= Restoration of a narrow snouted juvenile (based on specimen CMC VP14128) feeding alongside broad snouted adults While the long neck has traditionally been interpreted as a feeding adaptation, it was also suggested that the oversized neck of Diplodocus and its relatives may have been primarily a sexual display, with any other feeding benefits coming second. A 2011 study refuted this idea in detail. While no evidence indicates Diplodocus nesting habits, other sauropods, such as the titanosaurian Saltasaurus, have been associated with nesting sites.Walking on Eggs: The Astonishing Discovery of Thousands of Dinosaur Eggs in the Badlands of Patagonia, by Luis Chiappe and Lowell Dingus. June 19, 2001, Scribner The titanosaurian nesting sites indicate that they may have laid their eggs communally over a large area in many shallow pits, each covered with vegetation. Diplodocus may have done the same. The documentary Walking with Dinosaurs portrayed a mother Diplodocus using an ovipositor to lay eggs, but it was pure speculation on the part of the documentary author. For Diplodocus and other sauropods, the size of clutches and individual eggs were surprisingly small for such large animals. This appears to have been an adaptation to predation pressures, as large eggs would require greater incubation time and thus would be at greater risk. Based on a number of bone histology studies, Diplodocus, along with other sauropods, grew at a very fast rate, reaching sexual maturity at just over a decade, and continued to grow throughout their lives. Paleoecology Restoration of two D. hallorum The Morrison Formation is a sequence of shallow marine and alluvial sediments which, according to radiometric dating, ranges between 156.3 million years old (Ma) at its base, and 146.8 million years old at the top, which places it in the late Oxfordian, Kimmeridgian, and early Tithonian stages of the Late Jurassic period. This formation is interpreted as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons. The Morrison Basin, where dinosaurs lived, stretched from New Mexico to Alberta and Saskatchewan, and was formed when the precursors to the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains started pushing up to the west. The deposits from their east-facing drainage basins were carried by streams and rivers and deposited in swampy lowlands, lakes, river channels, and floodplains. This formation is similar in age to the Lourinha Formation in Portugal and the Tendaguru Formation in Tanzania. Saurophaganax and D. hallorum, New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science The Morrison Formation records an environment and time dominated by gigantic sauropod dinosaurs.Foster, J. (2007). \\"Appendix.\\" Jurassic West: The Dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation and Their World. Indiana University Press. pp. 327‚Äì329. Dinosaurs known from the Morrison include the theropods Ceratosaurus, Koparion, Stokesosaurus, Ornitholestes, Allosaurus and Torvosaurus, the sauropods Apatosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Camarasaurus, and Diplodocus, and the ornithischians Camptosaurus, Dryosaurus, Othnielia, Gargoyleosaurus and Stegosaurus. Diplodocus is commonly found at the same sites as Apatosaurus, Allosaurus, Camarasaurus, and Stegosaurus. Allosaurus accounted for 70 to 75% of theropod specimens and was at the top trophic level of the Morrison food web. Many of the dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation are the same genera as those seen in Portuguese rocks of the Lourinha Formation (mainly Allosaurus, Ceratosaurus, Torvosaurus, and Stegosaurus), or have a close counterpart (Brachiosaurus and Lusotitan, Camptosaurus and Draconyx). Other vertebrates that shared this paleoenvironment included ray-finned fishes, frogs, salamanders, turtles like Dorsetochelys, sphenodonts, lizards, terrestrial and aquatic crocodylomorphans such as Hoplosuchus, and several species of pterosaur like Harpactognathus and Mesadactylus. Shells of bivalves and aquatic snails are also common. The flora of the period has been revealed by fossils of green algae, fungi, mosses, horsetails, cycads, ginkgoes, and several families of conifers. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of tree ferns, and ferns (gallery forests), to fern savannas with occasional trees such as the Araucaria-like conifer Brachyphyllum.

Developed at the Baldwin Locomotive Works, it featured two pistons moving in parallel, driving a common crosshead and controlled by a common valve gear using a single, complex piston valve. Advantages and disadvantages The claimed advantage for this arrangement, as with other compounding arrangements, was greater economy due to lower fuel and water consumption. In practice uneven forces at the crosshead produced excess wear, with increased maintenance costs thus offsetting any fuel economies. The integration of the compounding system into the smokebox saddle made conversion to conventional engines straightforward, so most Vauclain compounds were so converted and led normal lives thereafter. The only known operable example is Manitou and Pikes Peak Railway No. 4, which is preserved on-site along with the static display of its sister #5. Design Steam flow in the valve and cylinders near the beginning of the stroke; note how the low-pressure steam flows through the center of the valve The key to the Vauclain compound is its valve system. In essence, there is an extra system of valves, concentric with the usual middle steam passage in conventional single expansion piston valves. This passage connects the high- pressure cylinder exhaust to the low-pressure cylinder intake. The driving pistons are rigidly connected to either side of the crosshead, so that they move in concert. As high-pressure steam is admitted to one side of the high- pressure cylinder, the low-pressure steam exhausted from the other side is passed through the valves to the opposite side of the engine and into the low- pressure cylinder; finally the exhaust steam from the opposite side of the low-pressure cylinder escapes through the center part of the valve to the blastpipe.International Library of Technology, pp. 19‚Äì21 The high- and low- pressure cylinders were mounted in vertical line with each other, with the piston rods in parallel. Usually the low-pressure cylinder was on the bottom, but clearance issues sometimes caused it to be put on the top. In the former case, the valve cylinder was mounted directly inboard from the high-pressure cylinder; in the latter case, the valves were also placed inboard, but at a level between the two power cylinders.Catalogue, p. 149 The placement of the valves necessitated an inside-connected valve gear, and the Stephenson pattern was used (being the dominant type of the era anyway). One extra appliance required was a starting valve, manually controlled, which allowed admission of high-pressure boiler steam directly to the low-pressure intake. Without this, the low-pressure cylinders would have to actually work against atmospheric pressure.International Library of Technology, pp. 21‚Äì24 Each side of the locomotive had its own separate engine, as with conventional locomotives. This eliminated the connections between sides characteristic of cross-compound engines, where the low- and high-pressure cylinders were on opposite sides. The direct flow of steam between the high- and low-pressure cylinders on each side of the locomotive eliminated the need for a receiving chamber to store the steam. It also avoided subjecting the locomotive frame to unequal forces from separate high- and low-pressure sides. The whole package was compact and took up little more space than conventional equipment. Indeed, at first glance from the side the Vauclain compound can be mistaken for a conventional simple locomotive; the only giveaways are the unusual arrangement of the crosshead and (viewed from the front) the extra cylinder. The scheme did not produce a more powerful locomotive; the maximum practical tractive force was governed by the weight on the drivers, and this did not change. The advantage was efficiency: the compounding reduced the steam required for the same performance. According to Baldwin's standard sizing tables, the high-pressure cylinder on the compound was about 70% the diameter of the single cylinder of the conventional engine; therefore, steam consumption for the same stroke and degree of cutoff was about half that of the conventional engine.Catalogue, p. 145 In practice lesser results were generally achieved, with Baldwin in 1900 reporting trials by various railroads showing fuel savings of 17% to 45%.Catalogue, pp.189‚Äì203 In order to produce symmetrical forces, the low- pressure cylinders had to be about 66% larger in diameter than the high, or about 20% larger than conventional cylinders; for small drivers this could lead to the clearance issues mentioned earlier, thus requiring the low- pressure cylinders to be on top. History Image from the 1889 U.S. patent issued to cover the Vauclain compound. The Vauclain compound was introduced in 1889 through by its namesake and the then general superintendent of Baldwin and eventually president of the company, Samuel M. Vauclain. Soon most Baldwin customers were operating some examples; a brochure from 1900 lists sales to 140 customers, including large fleets to such Class I railroads as the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway, the Erie Railroad, the Lehigh Valley Railroad, the Norfolk and Western Railway, and the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad.Catalogue, pp.179‚Äì189 Many other lines purchased one or two as samples. Vauclain was awarded the Elliott Cresson Medal of the Franklin Institute in 1891 for the locomotive design; in recommending award, the reviewing committee wrote, > \\"Your committee, in conclusion, find that in view of the state of art, the > Vauclain compound locomotive is a distinctly new and original type of > locomotive. It is the most marked departure from the usual construction of > engines, that has elicited general satisfaction wherever introduced, and in > view of the reliable and satisfactory performance in service under the > largest variations of conditions, immunity from total disablement, ready > adaptability within limits of space incapable of accommodating other > compound engines, and general applicability to and utility in railway > service, it is, in the opinion of your committee, deserving of recognition > by the award of the Elliott Cresson Medal of the Franklin Institute, which > they hereby recommend.\\" This popularity, however, was short-lived. Significant maintenance difficulties appeared, particularly with uneven forces wear on the crosshead guides. The two cylinders were supposed to be proportioned so as to do equal work (with the low pressure being three times larger than the high); but since the steam passed between the low- and high-pressure cylinder is always expanded, even before cutoff, the force produced in the low-pressure cylinder varies differently from that in the high-pressure cylinder. The complex valve assembly and the starter valve also led to increased maintenance costs. The introduction of the superheater further increased efficiency and made it much easier to maintain. WAGR L class locomotive created by rebuilding class Ec compound All of the compounding machinery was contained in the valve chest, which in American locomotives (in the days before one piece cast frames) was integral with the smokebox saddle. The whole unit therefore could be unbolted and replaced with conventional single expansion cylinders. That was the typical fate of Vauclain compounds: when the time came for a major overhaul, the compound machinery and Stephenson valve gear were removed, and the engine was rebuilt with superheating, Walschaerts valve gear, and conventional cylinders.For example, see conversion of UP 428, a 2-8-0 built in 1900 and converted in 1915. M&PP; No. 5, showing the less common configuration with the low-pressure cylinder on top. The valve cylinder is hidden behind the two power cylinders. Ironically, two of the four surviving Manitou and Pike's Peak Railway locomotives were converted to compounding after experience with M&PP; No. 4, built in 1893 and at present the only operating Vauclain compound. (Vauclain himself had travelled to the line to deal with operational issues with the original engines in their pre-compounding state.) All six steam locomotives of the line were of this type. =Usage in other countries= The Vauclain system was also used in Europe and a Danish example (DSB 996) is preserved at Railworld, Peterborough, England. 88 Baldwin-built locomotives, from 1912 designated as V class (for Vauclain, –í in Russian), were used in Russia from 1896 until the 1920s on several railroads.Rakov, V.A. (1995), Lokomotivy otechestvennyh zheleznyh dorog 1845‚Äì1955, Moscow, , p.221-222 (in Russian) Seven Vauclain compounds were supplied to the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company (WMR) which operated the Wellington - Manawatu Line in New Zealand. WMR No. 13, built in 1894, was the first compound in New Zealand and the first narrow-gauge compound in the world. In 1908 No. 13 was classified as the NZR Oa class when the WMR was nationalised. Later Vauclain compounds purchased by the WMR were the NZR Na class (No. 14 of 1894 & No. 15 of 1896); NZR Nc class (No. 5 (1901) & No. 18 of 1904); NZR Oc class (No. 16 of 1896); and NZR Bc class (No. 17 of 1901). These had the lower pressure cylinder on top for greater clearance from platforms. The Gyeongbu Railway, one of the predecessors of the Chosen Government Railway in Korea, bought six in 1906, which were designated Tehoi-class in the CGR's 1938 classification scheme. Victorian Railways (Australia) operated 16 Vauclain Compound locomotives designated V Class, with the first, imported from Baldwin Locomotive Works, entering service in 1900. The remaining 15 locomotives were built locally to the same design and entered service over the next two years. They were all rebuilt as simple expansion locomotives between 1912 and 1913. The Victorian Steam Locomotive Company, based in Maldon, is undertaking a project to build and operate a replica of the Vauclain Compound V Class locomotives.

Official Roman art of the military anarchy which followed, ending in 253 with Gallienus, has no character of its own and so can be seen as a continuation of Severan art, and so that art can be seen as running for the whole first half of the 3rd century. In this period began the process that ended in the rupture between Roman art and that of Late Antiquity, the watershed between classical art and that of Byzantium and the Middle Ages. Some of Severan art's products saw the emergence of obvious elements from plebeian art and provincial art, whilst in other areas traditionally Hellenistic elements were kept alive longer, such as in portraiture, which flourished in this period with masterpieces of great psychological depth. Historical context Sculpture Arch of Septimius Severus, Rome, relief of the Siege and capture of Ctesiphon Reliefs of the Arcus Argentariorum, Rome The most important works in Severian art were the Arch of Septimus Severus in the Roman Forum (erected for the Parthian triumph of 203); the Forum, the basilica and the Arch of Leptis Magna, the birthplace of the emperor (completed by 216); and the Arcus Argentariorum in Rome, erected in honor of the emperor by the bankers of the Forum Boarium in 204. =Leptis Magna= =Rome= =Portraits= The Roman portrait in the third century was one of the most significant art forms of the period. The artists, now free from the constraints linked to the Hellenistic tradition, implemented expressive characteristics into physiognomic portraits in marble and bronze. From this new style of portrait one could infer the socio-economic situation, and the difficulties of life faced by farmers soldiers. The imperial portraits are fundamental, from which the main artistic currents of the time can be outlined. The chronology of the most important works is: *Portrait of Caracalla, 211-217 *Portrait of Severus Alexander, 222-235 *Portrait of Maximinus Thrax, 235-238 *Portrait of Gordian III, 238-244 *Portrait of Philip the Arab, 244-249 *Portrait of Decius, 251 *Portrait of Treboniano Gallo, 251-254 Also important are some portraits of empresses, including that of the influential Julia Domna, wife of Septimius Severus and patron of Syrian artists in Rome, and that of Sallustia Orbiana, wife of Severus Alexander. Typical of the time is the \\"engraving\\" process, with small superficial chisel strokes that draw the short hair and the hair of the beard, which was neither fashionable nor shaved, but kept short with scissors. These technical devices were frequent in Rome, though less often seen in the eastern provinces. Image:Maximinus Thrax Musei Capitolini MC473.jpgMaximinus Thrax Image:Gordian III Massimo.jpgGordian III Image:Bust of emperor Philippus Arabus - Hermitage Museum.jpgPhilip the Arab =Sarcophagi= The great Ludovisi Battle sarcophagus Monumental sarcophagi are also very representative of the artistic methods in use during the period. In Rome, there are various specimens imported from Asia Minor, while works of Roman manufacture were exported to the western provinces. One of the best known works of this period is the Ludovisi Battle sarcophagus, where the figure of the young commander on horseback was recognized as Hostilian. Typical is the production of sarcophagi with lion hunting scenes, datable between 220 and 270, added to the recent stoic concept of life as a militia. Other types are instead linked to the Cult of Dionysus adorned with symbolism that alludes to regeneration after death, just crushed grapes or wine. Indicative of the moral thinking of individuals of the time are sarcophagi where the deceased are depicted as philosophers or muses. From these representations, born in a context strongly anchored to paganism, evolved the typologies of crypto-Christian sarcophagi of the end of the third century. Figures representing Christ and the apostles were depicted. =Reliefs= Arch of Leptis Magna Architecture In Rome, in the wake of the fire of 191, Septimius Severus instituted a new phase of construction: the Temple of Peace, the Horrea Piperiana, and the Porticus Octaviae were rebuilt; a wing was added to the imperial palace on the Palatine Hill, with a new monumental facade towards the Via Appia; and the Septizodium, the arch of Septimius Severus and the Baths of Caracalla were raised. It is likely that the Temple of Serapis was rebuilt by the Severans. Painting There are few remaining paintings from the period, and dates can only hypothesized. The best studied examples are the Fayum mummy portraits, dated from the late 1st century BC or the early 1st century AD onwards. It is not clear when their production ended, but recent research suggests the middle of the 3rd century.

Both sexes have tusks, which erupt when they are 1‚Äì3 years old and grow throughout life. It is distributed across 37 African countries and inhabits forests, grasslands and woodlands, wetlands and agricultural land. Since 2004, it has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. It is threatened foremost by habitat destruction, and in parts of its range also by poaching for meat and ivory. It is a social mammal, traveling in herds composed of cows and their offspring. Adult bulls usually live alone or in small bachelor groups. It is a herbivore, feeding on grasses, creepers, herbs, leaves and bark.  Taxonomy  Elephas africanus was the scientific name proposed by Johann Friedrich Blumenbach in 1797. Loxodonte was proposed as generic name for African elephants by Georges Cuvier in 1824. This name refers to the lozenge-shaped enamel of the molar teeth, which differs significantly from the shape of the Asian elephant's molar enamel. In the 19th and 20th centuries, several zoological specimens were described by naturalists and curators of natural history museums from various parts of Africa, including: *Elephas (Loxodonta) oxyotis and Elephas (Loxodonta) knochenhaueri by Paul Matschie in 1900. The first was a specimen from the upper Atbara River in northern Ethiopia, and the second a specimen from the Kilwa area in Tanzania. *Elephas africanus toxotis, selousi, peeli, cavendishi, orleansi and rothschildi by Richard Lydekker in 1907 who assumed that ear size is a distinguishing character for a race. These specimens were shot in South Africa, Mashonaland in Zimbabwe, Aberdare Mountains and Lake Turkana area in Kenya, in Somaliland and in western Sudan, respectively. *North African elephant (L. a. pharaohensis) by Paulus Edward Pieris Deraniyagala in 1948 was a specimen from Fayum in Egypt. Today, these names are all considered synonyms. = Phylogeny = A genetic study based on mitogenomic analysis revealed that the African and Asian elephant genetically diverged about 7.6 million years ago. Phylogenetic analysis of nuclear DNA of African bush and forest elephants, Asian elephant, woolly mammoth and American mastodon revealed that the African bush elephant and the African forest elephant form a sister group that genetically diverged at least 1.9 million years ago. They are therefore considered distinct species. Gene flow between the two species however, might have occurred after the split.

Its large ears cover the whole shoulder. They can grow as large as . Large ears help to reduce body heat; flapping them creates air currents and exposes the ears' inner sides where large blood vessels increase heat loss during hot weather. The African bush elephant's ears are pointed and triangular shaped. Its occipital plane slopes forward. Its back is shaped markedly concave. Its sturdy tusks are curved out and point forward. = Size = Average size of adults with the largest recorded individual included The African bush elephant is the largest and heaviest land animal on Earth, with a maximum recorded shoulder height of an adult bull of and an estimated weight of up to . On average, males are about tall at the shoulder and weigh , while females are much smaller at about tall at the shoulder and in weight. Elephants attain their maximum stature when they complete the fusion of long-bone epiphyses, occurring in males around the age of 40 and females around the age of 25. = Trunk = The trunk is a prehensile elongation of the upper lip and nose. Short tactile hair grows on the trunk, which has two finger-like processes on the tip. This highly sensitive organ is innervated primarily by the trigeminal nerve, and thought to be manipulated by about 40‚Äì60,000 muscles. Because of this muscular structure, the trunk is so strong that elephants can use it for lifting about 3% of their own body weight. They use it for smelling, touching, feeding, drinking, dusting, producing sounds, loading, defending and attacking. Functional loss of the trunk due to flaccid trunk paralysis sometimes makes the elephant carry the trunk over the tusk and walk into deep water in order to drink. = Tusks = Tusk of an African bush elephant The tusks grow from deciduous teeth known as tushes that develop in the upper jaw and consist of a crown, root and pulpal cavity, which are completely formed soon after birth. Tushes reach a length of . The tusks erupt when elephants are 1‚Äì3 years old and grow throughout life. They are composed of dentin and coated with a thin layer of cementum. Their tips bear a conical layer of enamel that is usually worn off when the elephant is five years old. Tusks of bulls grow faster than tusks of females. Mean weight of tusks at the age of 60 years is in bulls, and in cows. The longest known tusk of an African bush elephant measured and weighed . = Molars = Molar of an adult African bush elephant The dental formula of the African bush elephant is . It develops six molars in each jaw quadrant that erupt at different ages and differ in size. The first molars grow to a size of wide by long, are worn by the age of one year and lost by the age of about 2.5 years. The second molars start protruding at the age of about six months, grow to a size of wide by long and are lost by the age of 6‚Äì7 years. The third molars protrude at the age of about one year, grow to a size of wide by long and are lost by the age of 8‚Äì10 years. The fourth molars show by the age of 6‚Äì7 years, grow to a size of wide by long and are lost by the age of 22‚Äì23 years. The dental alveoli of the fifth molars are visible by the age of 10‚Äì11 years. They grow to a size of wide by long and are worn by the age of 45‚Äì48 years. The dental alveoli of the last molars are visible by the age of 26‚Äì28 years. They grow to a size of wide by long and are well worn by the age of 65 years.  Distribution and habitat  The African bush elephant occurs in Sub-Saharan Africa including Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Zambia, and Angola. It moves between a variety of habitats, including subtropical and temperate forests, dry and seasonally flooded grasslands and woodlands, wetlands and agricultural land from sea level to mountain slopes. In Mali and Namibia, it also inhabits desert areas. In Ethiopia, the African bush elephant has historically been recorded up to an altitude of . By the late 1970s, the population had declined to a herd in the Dawa River valley and one close to the Kenyan border.  Behavior and ecology  = Social behavior = The core of elephant society is the family unit, which comprises several adult cows, their daughters of all ages and their sons of prepubertal age. Two or more family units that have close ties was termed a 'kinship group' by Iain Douglas-Hamilton who observed African bush elephants for 4.5 years in Lake Manyara National Park. The family unit is led by a matriarch who at times also leads the kinship group. Group size varies between sites and at different seasons. In Tsavo East and Tsavo West National Parks, groups are bigger in the rainy season and in areas with open vegetation. Aerial surveys in the late 1960s to early 1970s revealed an average group size of 6.3 individuals in Uganda's Rwenzori National Park and 28.8 individuals in Chambura Game Reserve. In both sites, elephants aggregated during the wet season, whereas groups were smaller in the dry season. Groups cooperate in locating food and water, in defending the group, and in caring for the group's offspring, termed allomothering. Young bulls gradually separate from the family unit when they are between 10 and 19 years old. They range alone for some time or form all-male groups. A bull elephant stretching up to break off a branch in the Okavango Delta, Botswana = Diet = The African bush elephant is herbivorous. Its diet consists mainly of grasses, creepers and herbs. Adults can consume up to per day. During the dry season, the diet also includes leaves and bark. Tree bark in particular contains a high level of calcium. Elephants in Babille Elephant Sanctuary consume leaves and fruit of cherimoya, papaya, banana, guava and leaves, stems and seeds of maize, sorghum and sugarcane. To supplement their diet with minerals, they congregate at mineral-rich water-holes, termite mounds and mineral licks. Salt licks visited by elephants in the Kalahari contain high concentrations of water-soluble sodium. Elephants drink of water daily, and seem to prefer sites where water and soil contains sodium. In Kruger National Park and on the shore of Lake Kariba, elephants were observed to ingest wood ash, which also contains sodium. Bull in musth = Musth = Observations of adult African bush elephant bulls in Amboseli National Park revealed that they experience a swelling of the temporal glands and a secretion of fluid, the musth fluid, which flows down their cheeks. They begin to dribble urine, initially as discrete drops and later in a regular stream. These manifestations of musth last from a few days to months, depending on the age and condition of the bull. When a bull has been urinating for a long time, the proximal part of the penis and the distal end of the sheath show a greenish coloration, termed the 'green penis syndrome' by Joyce Poole and Cynthia Moss. Males in musth become more aggressive. They guard and mate with females in estrus who stay closer to bulls in musth than to non-musth bulls. Urinary testosterone increases during musth. Bulls begin to experience musth by the age of 24 years. Periods of musth are short and sporadic in young bulls up to 35 years old, lasting a few days to weeks. Older bulls are in musth for 2‚Äì5 months every year. Musth occurs mainly during and following the rainy season, and when females are in estrus. Bulls in musth often chase each other and are aggressive towards other bulls in musth. When old and high-ranking bulls in musth threaten and chase young bulls in musth, the latter either leave the group or their musth ceases. Elephants and white rhinos meet in Pilanesberg National Park Young bulls in musth killed about 50 white rhinoceros in Pilanesberg National Park between 1992 and 1997. This unusual behavior was attributed to the age and socialisation of the young bulls: they were 17‚Äì25-year-old orphans remaining from culled families and grew up without the guidance of dominant bulls. When six adult bulls were introduced into the park, the young bulls did not attack rhinos any more. This experience indicates that older bulls suppress musth and aggressiveness of younger bulls. Similar incidents were recorded in Hluhluwe- Umfolozi Park, where young bulls killed five black and 58 white rhinoceros between 1991 and 2001. After the introduction of 10 up to 45-year-old bulls, the number of rhinos killed by elephants decreased considerably. = Reproduction = Spermatogenesis starts when bulls are about 15 years old. Females ovulate for the first time at the age of 11 years. They are in estrus for 2‚Äì6 days. In captivity, cows have an oestrous cycle lasting 14‚Äì15 weeks. Foetal gonads enlarge during the second half of pregnancy. African bush elephants mate during the rainy season. Bulls in musth cover long distances in search for females and associate with large family units. They listen for the females loud, very low frequency calls and attract females by calling and by leaving trails of strong-smelling urine. Females search for bulls in musth, listen for their calls and follow their urine trails. Bulls in musth are more successful at obtaining mating opportunities than non-musth bulls. Females move away from bulls that attempt to test her estrous condition. If pursued by several bulls, they run away. Once they choose their mating partners, they stay away from other bulls that are threatened and chased away by the favoured bull. Competition between bulls overrides their choice sometimes. Gestation lasts 22 months. Interval between births was estimated at 3.9 to 4.7 years in Wankie National Park. Where hunting pressure on adult elephants was high in the 1970s, cows gave birth once in 2.9 to 3.8 years. Cows in Amboseli National Park gave birth once in five years on average. The birth of a calf was observed in Tsavo East National Park in October 1990. A group of 80 elephants including eight bulls had gathered in the morning in a radius around the birth site. A small group of calves and females stood near the pregnant female, rumbling and flapping their ears. One cow seemed to assist her. While in labour, fluid streamed from her temporal and ear canals. She kept standing while giving birth. The newborn calf struggled to its feet within 30 minutes and walked 20 minutes later. The mother expelled the placenta about 100 minutes after birth and covered it with soil immediately. Captive-born calves weigh between at birth and gain about weight per day. Cows lactate for about 4.8 years. Calves exclusively suckle their mother's milk during the first three months. Thereafter, they start feeding independently and slowly increase the time spent feeding until they are two years old. During the first three years, male calves spend more time suckling and grow faster than female calves. After this period, cows reject male calves more frequently from their nipples than female calves. The maximum lifespan of the African bush elephant is between 70 and 75 years. Its generation length is 25 years. = Predators = In Botswana's Chobe National Park, subadult elephants are preyed upon by lions. They attacked and fed on elephants when smaller prey species were scarce. Between 1993 and 1996, lions successfully attacked 74 elephants; 26 were older than nine, and one was a bull of over 15 years. Most were killed at night, and hunts occurred more often during waning moon nights than during bright moon nights. In the same park, lions killed eight elephants in October 2005 that were aged between one and 11 years, two of them older than eight years. Successful hunts took place after dark when prides exceeded 27 lions and herds were smaller than five elephants.  Threats  The African bush elephant is threatened foremost by habitat loss and fragmentation following conversion of natural habitat for livestock farming, plantations of non-timber crops and building of urban and industrial areas. As a result, human-elephant conflict has increased. = Poaching = Poachers target foremost elephant bulls for their tusks, which leads to a skewed sex ratio and affects the survival chances of a population. Access of poachers to unregulated black markets is facilitated by corruption and in periods of civil war in some elephant range countries. In June 2002, a container packed with more than ivory was confiscated in Singapore. It contained 42,120 hanko stamps and 532 tusks of African bush elephants that originated in Southern Africa, centered in Zambia and neighboring countries. Between 2005 and 2006, a total of ivory plus 91 unweighed tusks of African bush elephants were confiscated in 12 major consignments being shipped to Asia. When the international ivory trade reopened in 2006, the demand and price for ivory increased in Asia. The African bush elephant population in Chad's Zakouma National Park numbered 3,900 individuals in 2005. Within five years, more than 3,200 elephants were killed. The park did not have sufficient guards to combat poaching, and their weapons were outdated. Well organized networks facilitated smuggling the ivory through Sudan. Poaching also increased in Kenya in those years. In Samburu National Reserve, 41 bulls were illegally killed between 2008 and 2012, equivalent to 31% of the reserve's elephant population. These killings were linked to confiscations of ivory and increased prices for ivory on the local black market. About 10,370 tusks were confiscated in Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Kenya and Uganda between 2007 and 2013. Genetic analysis of tusk samples showed that they originated from African bush elephants killed in Tanzania, Mozambique, Zambia, Kenya and Uganda. Most of the ivory was smuggled through East African countries. Between 2003 and 2015, illegal killing of 14,606 African bush elephants was reported by rangers across 29 range countries. Chad is a major transit country for smuggling of ivory in West Africa. This trend was curtailed by raising penalties for poaching and improving law enforcement. During the 20th century, the African bush elephant population was severely decimated.Ceballos, G.; Ehrlich, A. H.; Ehrlich, P. R. (2015). The Annihilation of Nature: Human Extinction of Birds and Mammals. Baltimore, Maryland: Johns Hopkins University Press. pp. 102. . Poaching of the elephant has dated back all the way to the years of 1970 and 1980, which was considered the largest killings in history. Unfortunately, the species is placed in harm's way due to the limited conservation areas provided in Africa. In most cases, the killings of the African bush elephant have occurred near the outskirts of the protected areas. In addition to being poached, the carcasses of elephants may get poisoned by the poachers, to avoid detection by vultures which help rangers track poaching activity by circling around dead animals, and pose a threat to those vultures or birds that scavenge on them. On 20 June 2019, the carcasses of 468 white- backed vultures, 17 white-headed vultures, 28 hooded vultures, 14 lappet-faced vultures and 10 cape vultures, altogether 537 endangered vultures, besides 2 tawny eagles, were found in northern Botswana. It is suspected that they died after eating the poisoned carcasses of 3 elephants. = Habitat changes = Vast areas in Sub-Saharan Africa were transformed for agricultural use and building of infrastructure. This disturbance leaves the elephants without a stable habitat and limits their ability to roam freely. Large corporations associated with commercial logging and mining have stripped apart the land, giving poachers easy access to the African bush elephant. As human development grows, the human population faces the trouble of contact with the elephants more frequently, due to the species need for food and water. Farmers residing in nearby areas get into conflict with the African bush elephants rummaging through their crops. In many cases, they kill the elephants instantly as they disturb a village or forage upon their crops. Deaths caused by browsing on rubber vine, an invasive alien plant, have been reported. = Pathogens = Observations at Etosha National Park indicate that African bush elephant die due to anthrax foremost in November at the end of the dry season. Anthrax spores spread through the intestinal tracts of vultures, jackals and hyaenas that feed on the carcasses. Anthrax killed over 100 elephants in Botswana in 2019. It is thought that wild bush elephants can contract fatal tuberculosis from humans. Infection of the vital organs by Citrobacter freundii bacteria has caused the death of an otherwise healthy bush elephant after capture and translocation. From April to June 2020, over 400 bush elephants died in Botswana's Okavango Delta region after drinking from desiccating waterholes that were infected with cyanobacteria. Neurotoxins produced by the cyanobacteria caused calves and adult elephants to wander around confused, emaciated and in distress. The elephants collapsed when the toxin impaired their motor functions and their legs became paralysed. Poaching, intentional poisoning and anthrax were excluded as potential causes.  Conservation  African elephants mating in Tierpark Berlin African elephant used for show in Parc arch√©ologique Asnapio, France The African bush elephants has been listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora since 1989. In 1997, Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe placed it on Appendix II. So did South Africa in 2000. Community-based conservation programmes have been initiated in several range countries, which contributed to reduce human-elephant conflict and to increase local people's tolerance towards elephants. In 1986, the African Elephant Database was initiated with the aim to collate and update information on distribution and status of elephant populations in Africa. The database includes results from aerial surveys, dung counts, interviews with local people and data on poaching. Researchers discovered that playing back the recorded sounds of African bees is an effective method to drive elephants away from settlements. = Status = In 1996, IUCN Red List assessors for the African bush elephant considered the species Endangered. Since 2004, it has been assessed Vulnerable, as the global population was estimated to be increasing at a rate of 4% per year. About 70% of its range is located outside protected areas. In 2016, the global population was estimated at 415,428 ¬± 20,111 individuals distributed in a total area of , of which 30% is protected. 42% of the total population lives in nine Southern African countries comprising 293,447 ¬± 16,682 individuals; Africa's largest population lives in Botswana with 131,626 ¬± 12,508 individuals. = In captivity = The social behavior of elephants in captivity mimics that of those in the wild. Females are kept with other females, in groups, while males tend to be separated from their mothers at a young age, and are kept apart. According to Schulte, in the 1990s, in North America, a few facilities allowed male interaction. Elsewhere, males were only allowed to smell each other. Males and females were allowed to interact for specific purposes such as breeding. In that event, females were more often moved to the male than the male to the female. Females are more often kept in captivity because they are easier and less expensive to house.

It was first described by American paleontologist Elmer S. Riggs in 1903 from fossils found in the Colorado River valley in western Colorado, United States. Riggs named the dinosaur Brachiosaurus altithorax; the generic name is Greek for \\"arm lizard\\", in reference to its proportionately long arms, and the specific name means \\"deep chest\\". Brachiosaurus is estimated to have been between 18 and 21 meters (59 and 69 ft) long; weight estimates range from 28.3 to 58 metric tons (31.2 and 64 short tons). It had a disproportionately long neck, small skull, and large overall size, all of which are typical for sauropods. Atypically, Brachiosaurus had longer forelimbs than hindlimbs, which resulted in a steeply inclined trunk, and a proportionally shorter tail. Brachiosaurus is the namesake genus of the family Brachiosauridae, which includes a handful of other similar sauropods. Most popular depictions of Brachiosaurus are in fact based on Giraffatitan, a genus of brachiosaurid dinosaur from the Tendaguru Formation of Tanzania. Giraffatitan was originally described by German paleontologist Werner Janensch in 1914 as a species of Brachiosaurus, B. brancai, but moved to its own genus in 2009. Three other species of Brachiosaurus have been named based on fossils found in Africa and Europe; two are no longer considered valid, and a third has become a separate genus, Lusotitan. The type specimen of B. altithorax is still the most complete specimen, and only a few other specimens are thought to belong to the genus, making it one of the rarer sauropods of the Morrison Formation. It is regarded as a high browser, possibly cropping or nipping vegetation as high as off the ground. Unlike other sauropods, it was unsuited for rearing on its hindlimbs. It has been used as an example of a dinosaur that was most likely ectothermic because of its large size and the corresponding need for sufficient forage, but more recent research suggests it was warm-blooded. Among the most iconic and initially thought to be one of the largest dinosaurs, Brachiosaurus has appeared in popular culture, notably in the 1993 film Jurassic Park. History of discovery =Holotype specimen= Holotype material during excavation, with dorsal vertebrae, sacrum, ilium and ribs in view The genus Brachiosaurus is based on a partial postcranial skeleton discovered in 1900 in the valley of the Colorado River near Fruita, Colorado. This specimen, which was later declared the holotype, comes from rocks of the Brushy Basin Member of the Morrison Formation, and therefore is late Kimmeridgian in age, about 154 to 153 million years old. Discovered by American paleontologist Elmer S. Riggs and his crew from the Field Columbian Museum (now the Field Museum of Natural History) of Chicago, it is currently cataloged as FMNH P 25107. Riggs and company were working in the area as a result of favorable correspondence between Riggs and Stanton Merill Bradbury, a dentist in nearby Grand Junction. In the spring of 1899, Riggs had sent letters to mayors in western Colorado, inquiring after possible trails leading from railway heads into northeastern Utah, where he hoped to find fossils of Eocene mammals. To his surprise, he was informed by Bradbury, an amateur collector himself and president of the Western Colorado Academy of Science, that dinosaur bones had been collected near Grand Junction since 1885. Riggs was skeptical of this claim, but his superior, curator of geology Oliver Cummings Farrington, was very eager to add a large sauropod skeleton to the collection to outdo other institutions, and convinced the museum management to invest five hundred dollars in an expedition. Arriving on June 20, 1900 they set camp at the abandoned Goat Ranch. During a prospecting trip on horseback, Riggs' field assistant Harold William Menke found the humerus of FMNH P 25107, on July 4, exclaiming it was \\"the biggest thing yet!\\". Riggs at first took the find for a badly preserved Brontosaurus specimen and gave priority to excavating Quarry 12, which held a more promising Morosaurus skeleton. Having secured that, on 26 July he returned to the humerus in Quarry 13, which soon proved to be of enormous size, convincing a puzzled Riggs that he had discovered the largest land animal ever. Elmer S. Riggs‚Äô preparator, H. W. Menke, lying by the humerus during the excavation in 1900 The site, Riggs Quarry 13, is located on a small hill later known as Riggs Hill; it is today marked by a plaque. More Brachiosaurus fossils are reported on Riggs Hill, but other fossil finds on the hill have been vandalized. During excavation of the specimen, Riggs misidentified the humerus as a deformed femur due to its great length, and this seemed to be confirmed when an equally-sized, well-preserved real femur of the same skeleton was discovered. In 1904, Riggs noted: \\"Had it not been for the unusual size of the ribs found associated with it, the specimen would have been discarded as an Apatosaur, too poorly preserved to be of value.\\" It was only after preparation of the fossil material in the laboratory that the bone was recognized as a humerus. The excavation attracted large numbers of visitors, delaying the work and forcing Menke to guard the site to prevent bones from being looted. On 17 August, the last bone was jacketed in plaster. After a concluding ten-day prospecting trip, the expedition returned to Grand Junction and hired a team and wagon to transport all fossils to the railway station, during five days; another week was spent to pack them in thirty-eight crates with a weight of . On 10 September, Riggs left for Chicago by train, arriving on the 15th; the railroad companies let both passengers and cargo travel for free, as a public relations gesture. The holotype skeleton consists of the right humerus (upper arm bone), the right femur (thigh bone), the right ilium (a hip bone), the right coracoid (a shoulder bone), the sacrum (fused vertebrae of the hip), the last seven thoracic (trunk) and two caudal (tail) vertebrae, and several ribs. Riggs described the coracoid as from the left side of the body, but restudy has shown it to be a right coracoid. At the time of discovery, the lower end of the humerus, the underside of the sacrum, the ilium and the preserved caudal vertebrae were exposed to the air and thus partly damaged by weathering. The vertebrae were only slightly shifted out of their original anatomical position; they were found with their top sides directed downward. The ribs, humerus, and coracoid, however, were displaced to the left side of the vertebral column, indicating transportation by a water current. This is further evidenced by an isolated ilium of Diplodocus that apparently had drifted against the vertebral column, as well as by a change in composition of the surrounding rocks. While the specimen itself was embedded in fine-grained clay, indicating low-energy conditions at the time of deposition, it was cut off at the seventh vertebra by a thick layer of much coarser sediments consisting of pebbles at its base and sandstone further up, indicating deposition under stronger currents. Based on this evidence, Riggs in 1904 suggested that the missing front part of the skeleton was washed away by a water current, while the hind part was already covered by sediment and thus got preserved. Riggs, on the right, and J. B. Abbott working on the holotype bones in 1899; the still jacketed thighbone can be seen on the left Riggs published a short report of the new find in 1901, noting the unusual length of the humerus compared to the femur and the extreme overall size and the resulting giraffe-like proportions, as well as the lesser development of the tail, but did not publish a name for the new dinosaur. In 1903, he named the type species Brachiosaurus altithorax. Riggs derived the genus name from the Greek brachion/Œ≤œÅŒ±œáŒØœâŒΩ meaning \\"arm\\" and sauros/œÉŒ±œÖœÅŒøœÇ meaning \\"lizard\\", because he realized that the length of the arms was unusual for a sauropod. The specific epithet was chosen because of the unusually deep and wide chest cavity, from Latin altus \\"deep\\" and Greek thorax/Œ∏œéœÅŒ±Œæ, \\"breastplate, cuirass, corslet\\". Latin thorax was derived from the Greek and had become a usual scientific designation for the chest of the body. The titles of Riggs' 1901 and 1903 articles emphasized that the specimen was the \\"largest known dinosaur\\". Riggs followed his 1903 publication with a more detailed description in a monograph in 1904. Preparation of the holotype began in the fall of 1900 shortly after it was collected by Riggs for the Field Museum. First the limb elements were processed. In the winter of 1904, the badly weathered vertebrae of the back and hip were prepared by James B. Abbott and C.T. Kline. As the preparation of each bone was finished, it was put on display in a glass case in Hall 35 of the Fine Arts Palace of the Worlds Columbian Exposition, the Field Museum's first location. All the bones were, solitarily, still on display by 1908 in Hall 35 when the Field Museum's newly mounted Apatosaurus was unveiled, the very specimen Riggs had found in Quarry 12, today catalogued as FMNH P25112 and identified as a Brontosaurus exemplar. No mount of Brachiosaurus was attempted because only 20% of the skeleton had been recovered. In 1993, the holotype bones were molded and cast, and the missing bones were sculpted based on material of the related Brachiosaurus brancai (now Giraffatitan) in Museum f√ºr Naturkunde, Berlin. This plastic skeleton was mounted and, in 1994, put on display at the north end of Stanley Field Hall, the main exhibit hall of the Field Museum's current building. The real bones of the holotype were put on exhibit in two large glass cases at either end of the mounted cast. The mount stood until 1999, when it was moved to the B Concourse of United Airlines' Terminal One in O'Hare International Airport to make room for the museum's newly acquired Tyrannosaurus skeleton, \\"Sue\\". At the same time, the Field Museum mounted a second plastic cast of the skeleton (designed for outside use) which is on display outside the museum on the NW terrace. Another outdoor cast was sent to Disney's Animal Kingdom to serve as a gateway icon for the \\"DinoLand, U.S.A.\\" area, known as the \\"Oldengate Bridge\\" that connects the two halves of the fossil quarry themed Boneyard play area. =Assigned material= Composite skeletal diagram, color indicating different specimens Further discoveries of Brachiosaurus material in North America have been uncommon and consist of a few bones. To date, material can only be unambiguously ascribed to the genus when overlapping with the holotype material, and any referrals of elements form the skull, neck, anterior dorsal region, or distal limbs or feet remain tentative. Nevertheless, material has been described from Colorado, Oklahoma, Utah, and Wyoming, and undescribed material has been mentioned from several other sites. In 1883, farmer Marshall Parker Felch, a fossil collector for the American paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh, reported the discovery of a sauropod skull in Felch Quarry 1, near Garden Park, Colorado. The skull was found in yellowish white sandstone, near a cervical vertebra, which was destroyed during an attempt to collect it. The skull was cataloged as YPM 1986, and sent to Marsh at the Peabody Museum of Natural History, who incorporated it into his 1891 skeletal restoration of Brontosaurus (perhaps because Felch had identified it as belonging to that dinosaur). The Felch Quarry skull consists of the cranium, the maxillae, the right postorbital, part of the left maxilla, the left squamosal, the dentaries, and a possible partial pterygoid. The bones were roughly prepared for Marsh, which led to some damage. Most of the specimens collected by Felch were sent to the National Museum of Natural History in 1899 after Marsh's death, including the skull, which was then cataloged as USNM 5730. O. C. Marsh's outdated 1891 skeletal reconstruction of Brontosaurus, with skull inaccurately based on that of the Felch Quarry Brachiosaurus In 1975, the American paleontologists Jack McIntosh and David Berman investigated the historical issue of whether Marsh had assigned an incorrect skull to Brontosaurus (at the time thought to be a junior synonym of Apatosaurus), and found the Felch Quarry skull to be of \\"the general Camarasaurus type\\", while suggesting that the vertebra found near it belonged to Brachiosaurus. They concluded that if Marsh had not arbitrarily assigned the Felch quarry skull and another Camarasaurus-like skull to Brontosaurus, it would have been recognized earlier that the actual skull of Brontosaurus and Apatosaurus was more similar to that of Diplodocus. McIntosh later tentatively recognized the Felch Quarry skull as belonging to Brachiosaurus, and brought it to the attention of the American paleontologists Kenneth Carpenter and Virginia Tidwell, while urging them to describe it. They brought the skull to the Denver Museum of Natural History, where they further prepared it and made a reconstruction of it based on casts of the individual bones, with the skulls of Giraffatitan and Camarasaurus acting as templates for the missing bones. In 1998, Carpenter and Tidwell described the Felch Quarry skull, and formally assigned it to Brachiosaurus sp. (of uncertain species), since it is impossible to determine whether it belonged to the species B. altithorax itself (as there is no overlapping material between the two specimens). They based the skull's assignment to Brachiosaurus on its similarity to that of B. brancai, later known as Giraffatitan. In 2019, American paleontologists Michael D. D'Emic and Matthew T. Carrano re-examined the Felch Quarry skull after having it further prepared and CT-scanned (while consulting historical illustrations that showed earlier states of the bones), and concluded that a quadrate bone and dentary tooth considered part of the skull by Carpenter and Tidwell did not belong to it. The quadrate is too large to articulate with the squamosal, is preserved differently from the other bones, and was found several meters away. The tooth does not resemble those within the jaws (as revealed by CT data), is larger, and was therefore assigned to Camarasaurus sp. (other teeth assignable to that genus are known from the quarry). They also found it most parsimonious to assign the skull to B. altithorax itself rather than an unspecified species, as there is no evidence of other brachiosaurid taxa in the Morrison Formation (and adding this and other possible elements to a phylogenetic analysis did not change the position of B. altithorax). Scapulocoracoid BYU 9462 has been seen as a possible Brachiosaurus bone; it was originally assigned to Ultrasauros (now a junior synonym of Supersaurus), Museum of Ancient Life A shoulder blade with coracoid from Dry Mesa Quarry, Colorado, is one of the specimens at the center of the Supersaurus/Ultrasauros issue of the 1980s and 1990s. In 1985, James A. Jensen described disarticulated sauropod remains from the quarry as belonging to several exceptionally large taxa, including the new genera Supersaurus and Ultrasaurus, the latter renamed Ultrasauros shortly thereafter because another sauropod had already received the name. Later study showed that the \\"ultrasaur\\" material mostly belonged to Supersaurus, though the shoulder blade did not. Because the holotype of Ultrasauros, a dorsal vertebra, was one of the specimens that was actually from Supersaurus, the name Ultrasauros is a synonym of Supersaurus. The shoulder blade, specimen BYU 9462 (previously BYU 5001), was in 1996 assigned to a Brachiosaurus sp. (of uncertain species) by Brian Curtice and colleagues; in 2009 Michael P. Taylor concluded that it could not be referred to B. altithorax. The Dry Mesa \\"ultrasaur\\" was not as large as had been thought; the dimensions of the shoulder's coracoid bone indicate that the animal was smaller than Riggs' original specimen of Brachiosaurus. Referred forelimb bone (humerus) from Potter Creek, USNM 21903 Several additional specimens were briefly described by Jensen in 1987. One of these finds, the humerus USNM 21903, was discovered in ca. 1943 by uranium prospectors Vivian and Daniel Jones in the Potter Creek Quarry in western Colorado, and donated to the Smithsonian Institution. Originally, this humerus was part of a poorly preserved partial skeleton that was not collected. According to Taylor in 2009, it is not clearly referable to Brachiosaurus despite its large size of . Jensen himself worked at the Potter Creek site in 1971 and 1975, excavating the disarticulated specimen BYU 4744, which contains a mid-dorsal vertebra, an incomplete left ilium, a left radius and a right metacarpal. According to Taylor in 2009, this specimen can be confidently referred to B. altithorax, as far as it is overlapping with its type specimen. Jensen furthermore mentioned a specimen discovered near Jensen, Utah that includes a rib in length, an anterior cervical vertebra, part of a scapula, and a coracoid, although he did not provide a description. In 2001, Curtice and Stadtman ascribed two articulated dorsal vertebrae (specimen BYU 13023) from Dry Mesa Quarry to Brachiosaurus. Taylor, in 2009, noted that these vertebrae are markedly shorter than those of the B. altithorax holotype, although otherwise being similar. In 2012, Jos√© Carballido and colleagues reported a nearly complete postcranial skeleton of a small juvenile approximately in length. This specimen, nicknamed \\"Toni\\" and cataloged as SMA 0009, stems from the Morrison Formation of the Bighorn Basin in north-central Wyoming. Although originally thought to belong to a diplodocid, it was later reinterpreted as a brachiosaurid, probably belonging to B. altithorax. In 2018, the largest sauropod foot ever found was reported from the Black Hills of Weston County, Wyoming. The femur is not preserved but comparisons suggest that it was about 2% longer than that of the B. altithorax holotype. Though possibly belonging to Brachiosaurus, the authors cautiously classified it as an indeterminate brachiosaurid. =Formerly assigned species= Brachiosaurus brancai and Brachiosaurus fraasi Skeleton of Giraffatitan, formerly B. brancai, Natural History Museum, Berlin Between 1909 and 1912, large-scale paleontological expeditions in German East Africa unearthed a considerable amount of brachiosaurid material from the Tendaguru Formation. In 1914, German paleontologist Werner Janensch listed differences and commonalities between these fossils and B. altithorax, concluding they could be referred to the genus Brachiosaurus. From this material Janensch named two species: Brachiosaurus brancai for the larger and more complete taxon, and Brachiosaurus fraasi for the smaller and more poorly known species. In three further publications in 1929, 1950 and 1961, Janensch compared the species in more detail, listing thirteen shared characters between Brachiosaurus brancai (which he now considered to include B. fraasi) and B. altithorax. Taylor, in 2009, considered only four of these characters as valid; six pertain to groups more inclusive than the Brachiosauridae, and the rest are either difficult to assess or refer to material that is not Brachiosaurus. There was ample material referred to B. brancai in the collections of the Museum f√ºr Naturkunde in Berlin, some of which was destroyed during World War II. Other material was transferred to other institutions throughout Germany, some of which was also destroyed. Additional material was collected by the British Museum of Natural History's Tendaguru expedition, including a nearly complete skeleton (BMNH R5937) collected by F.W.H. Migeod in 1930. This specimen is now believed to represent a new species, awaiting description. Janensch based his description of B. brancai on \\"Skelett S\\" (skeleton S) from Tendaguru, but later realized that it comprised two partial individuals: S I and S II. He at first did not designate them as a syntype series, but in 1935 made S I (presently MB.R.2180) the lectotype. Taylor in 2009, unaware of this action, proposed the larger and more complete S II (MB.R.2181) as the lectotype. It includes, among other bones, several dorsal vertebrae, the left scapula, both coracoids, both sternals (breastbones), both humeri, both ulnae and radii (lower arm bones), a right hand, a partial left hand, both pubes (a hip bone) and the right femur, tibia and fibula (shank bones). Later in 2011, Taylor realized that Janensch had designated the smaller skeleton S I as the lectotype in 1935. Diagram incorporating bones of both Brachiosaurus and Giraffatitan, by William Diller Matthew, 1915 In 1988, Gregory S. Paul published a new reconstruction of the skeleton of B. brancai, highlighting differences in proportion between it and B. altithorax. Chief among them was a distinction in the way the trunk vertebrae vary: they are fairly uniform in length in the African material, but vary widely in B. altithorax. Paul believed that the limb and girdle elements of both species were very similar, and therefore suggested they be separated not at genus, but only at subgenus level, as Brachiosaurus (Brachiosaurus) altithorax and Brachiosaurus (Giraffatitan) brancai. Giraffatitan was raised to full genus level by George Olshevsky in 1991, while referring to the vertebral variation. Between 1991 and 2009, the name Giraffatitan was almost completely disregarded by other researchers. A detailed 2009 study by Taylor of all material, including the limb and girdle bones, found that there are significant divergences between B. altithorax and the Tendaguru material in all elements known from both species. Taylor found twenty-six distinct osteological (bone-based) characters, a larger difference than between Diplodocus and Barosaurus, and therefore argued that the African material should indeed be placed in its own genus‚ÄîGiraffatitan‚Äîas Giraffatitan brancai. An important contrast between the two genera is their overall body shape, with Brachiosaurus having a 23% longer dorsal vertebral series and a 20 to 25% longer and also taller tail. The split was rejected by Daniel Chure in 2010, but from 2012 onward most studies recognized the name Giraffatitan. Brachiosaurus atalaiensis Middle caudal vertebrae of Lusotitan, formerly \\"B.\\" atalaiensis In 1947, at Atalaia in Portugal, brachiosaurid remains were found in layers dating from the Tithonian. Albert-F√©lix de Lapparent and Georges Zbyszewski named them as the species Brachiosaurus atalaiensis in 1957. Its referral to Brachiosaurus was doubted in the 2004 edition of The Dinosauria by Paul Upchurch, Barret, and Peter Dodson who listed it as an as yet unnamed brachiosaurid genus. Shortly before the publication of the 2004 book, the species had been placed in its own genus Lusotitan by Miguel Telles Antunes and Oct√°vio Mateus in 2003. De Lapparent and Zbyszewski had described a series of remains but did not designate a type specimen. Antunes and Mateus selected a partial postcranial skeleton (MIGM 4978, 4798, 4801‚Äì4810, 4938, 4944, 4950, 4952, 4958, 4964‚Äì4966, 4981‚Äì4982, 4985, 8807, 8793‚Äì87934) as the lectotype; this specimen includes twenty-eight vertebrae, chevrons, ribs, a possible shoulder blade, humeri, forearm bones, partial left pelvis, lower leg bones, and part of the right ankle. The low neural spines, the prominent deltopectoral crest of the humerus (a muscle attachment site on the upper arm bone), the elongated humerus (very long and slender), and the long axis of the ilium tilted upward indicate that Lusotitan is a brachiosaurid, which was confirmed by some later studies, such as an analysis in 2013. Brachiosaurus nougaredi Diagram showing preserved parts of the \\"B.\\" nougaredi sacrum in blue In 1958, the French petroleum geologist F. Nougar√®de reported to have discovered fragmentary brachiosaurid remains in eastern Algeria, in the Sahara Desert. Based on these, Albert-F√©lix de Lapparent described and named the species Brachiosaurus nougaredi in 1960. He indicated the discovery locality as being in the Late Jurassic‚Äìage Taouratine Series. He assigned the rocks to this age in part because of the presumed presence of Brachiosaurus. A more recent review placed it in the \\"Continental intercalaire,\\" which is considered to belong to the Albian age of the late Early Cretaceous, significantly younger. The type material moved to Paris consisted of a sacrum, weathered out at the desert surface, and some of the left metacarpals and phalanges. Found at the discovery site but not collected, were partial bones of the left forearm, wrist bones, a right shin bone, and fragments that may have come from metatarsals. \\"B.\\" nougaredi was in 2004 considered to represent a distinct, unnamed brachiosaurid genus, but a 2013 analysis by Philip D. Mannion and colleagues found that the remains possibly belong to more than one species, as they were collected far apart. The metacarpals were concluded to belong to some indeterminate titanosauriform. The sacrum was reported lost in 2013. It was not analyzed and provisionally considered to represent an indeterminate sauropod, until such time that it could be relocated in the collections of the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle. Only four out of the five sacral vertebrae are preserved. The total original length was in 1960 estimated at , compared to with B. altithorax. This would make it larger than any other sauropod sacrum ever found, except those of Argentinosaurus and Apatosaurus. Description Size compared to a human =Size= Most estimates of Brachiosaurus altithorax size are based on the related brachiosaurid Giraffatitan (formerly known as B. brancai), which is known from much more complete material than Brachiosaurus. The two species are the largest brachiosaurids of which relatively extensive remains have been discovered. There is another element of uncertainty for the North American Brachiosaurus because the type (and most complete) specimen appears to represent a subadult, as indicated by the unfused suture between the coracoid, a bone of the shoulder girdle that forms part of the shoulder joint, and the scapula (shoulder blade). Over the years, the mass of B. altithorax has been estimated at , , , , , and . The length of Brachiosaurus has been estimated at 20‚Äì21 meters (66‚Äì69 ft) and , and its height at and 12‚Äì13 meters (39‚Äì43 ft). While the limb bones of the most complete Giraffatitan skeleton (MB.R.2181) were very similar in size to those of the Brachiosaurus type specimen, the former was somewhat lighter than the Brachiosaurus specimen given its proportional differences. In studies including estimates for both genera, Giraffatitan was estimated at , , and . As with the main Brachiosaurus specimen, Giraffatitan specimen MB.R.2181 likely does not reflect the maximum size of the genus, as a fibula (specimen HM XV2) is 13% longer than that of MB.R.2181. =General build= Life restoration showing hypothetical nasal ornamentation Like all sauropod dinosaurs, Brachiosaurus was a quadruped with a small skull, a long neck, a large trunk with a high-ellipsoid cross section, a long, muscular tail and slender, columnar limbs. Large air sacs connected to the lung system were present in the neck and trunk, invading the vertebrae and ribs by bone resorption, greatly reducing the overall density of the body. The neck is not preserved in the holotype specimen, but was very long even by sauropod standards in the closely related Giraffatitan, consisting of thirteen elongated cervical (neck) vertebrae. The neck was held in a slight S-curve, with the lower and upper sections bent and a straight middle section. Brachiosaurus likely shared with Giraffatitan the very elongated neck ribs, which ran down the underside of the neck, overlapping several preceding vertebrae. These bony rods were attached to neck muscles at their ends, allowing these muscles to operate distal portions of the neck while themselves being located closer to the trunk, lightening the distal neck portions. Brachiosaurus and Giraffatitan probably had a small shoulder hump between the third and fifth dorsal (back) vertebra, where the sideward- and upward- directed vertebral processes were longer, providing additional surface for neck muscle attachment. The ribcage was deep compared to other sauropods. Though the humerus (upper arm bone) and femur (thigh bone) were roughly equal in length, the entire forelimb would have been longer than the hindlimb, as can be inferred from the elongated forearm and metacarpus of other brachiosaurids. This resulted in an inclined trunk with the shoulder much higher than the hips, and the neck exiting the trunk at a steep angle. The overall build of Brachiosaurus resembles a giraffe more than any other living animal. In contrast, most other sauropods had a shorter forelimb than hindlimb; the forelimb is especially short in contemporaneous diplodocoids. Brachiosaurus differed in its body proportions from the closely related Giraffatitan. The trunk was about 25‚Äì30% longer, resulting in a dorsal vertebral column longer than the humerus. Only a single complete caudal (tail) vertebra has been discovered, but its great height suggests that the tail was larger than in Giraffatitan. This vertebra had a much greater area for ligament attachment due to a broadened neural spine, indicating that the tail was also longer than in Giraffatitan, possibly by 20‚Äì25%. In 1988, paleontologist Gregory S. Paul suggested that the neck of Brachiosaurus was shorter than that of Giraffatitan, but in 2009, paleontologist Mike P. Taylor pointed out that two cervical vertebrae likely belonging to Brachiosaurus had identical proportions. Unlike Giraffatitan and other sauropods, which had vertically oriented forelimbs, the arms of Brachiosaurus appear to have been slightly sprawled at the shoulder joints, as indicated by the sideward orientation of the joint surfaces of the coracoids. The humerus was less slender than that of Giraffatitan, while the femur had similar proportions. This might indicate that the forelimbs of Brachiosaurus supported a greater fraction of the body weight than is the case for Giraffatitan. = Postcranial skeleton = Vertebral anatomy of the holotype skeleton. Top: Sixth dorsal vertebra in back (A) and right side view (B). Bottom: Second caudal vertebra in back (C) and side view (D). Though the vertebral column of the trunk or torso is incompletely known, the back of Brachiosaurus most likely comprised twelve dorsal vertebrae; this can be inferred from the complete dorsal vertebral column preserved in an unnamed brachiosaurid specimen, BMNH R5937. Vertebrae of the front part of the dorsal column were slightly taller but much longer than those of the back part. This is in contrast to Giraffatitan, where the vertebrae at the front part were much taller but only slightly longer. The centra (vertebral bodies), the lower part of the vertebrae, were more elongated and roughly circular in cross-section, while those of Giraffatitan were broader than tall. The foramina (small openings) on the sides of the centra, which allowed for the intrusion of air sacs, were larger than in Giraffatitan. The diapophyses (large projections extending sideways from the neural arch of the vertebrae) were horizontal, while those of Giraffatitan were inclined upward. At their ends, these projections articulated with the ribs; the articular surface was not distinctly triangular as in Giraffatitan. In side view, the upward-projecting neural spines stood vertically and were twice as wide at the base than at the top; those of Giraffatitan tilted backward and did not broaden at their base. When seen in front or back view, the neural spines widened toward their tops. In Brachiosaurus, this widening occurred gradually, resulting in a paddle-like shape, while in Giraffatitan the widening occurred abruptly and only in the uppermost portion. At both their front and back sides, the neural spines featured large, triangular and rugose surfaces, which in Giraffatitan were semicircular and much smaller. The various vertebral processes were connected by thin sheets or ridges of bone, which are called laminae. Brachiosaurus lacked postspinal laminae, which were present in Giraffatitan, running down the back side of the neural spines. The spinodiapophyseal laminae, which stretched from the neural spines to the diapophyses, were conflated with the spinopostzygapophyseal laminae, which stretched between the neural spines and the articular processes at the back of the vertebrae, and therefore terminated at mid-height of the neural spines. In Giraffatitan, both laminae were not conflated, and the spinodiapophyseal laminae reached up to the top of the neural spines. Brachiosaurus is further distinguished from Giraffatitan in lacking three details in the laminae of the dorsal vertebrae that are unique to the latter genus. Anatomy of the sacrum, ilium, and coracoid. Top: Sacrum in bottom (A) and right side view (B). Bottom: Right ilium in side view (C) and left coracoid in side view (D). Air sacs not only invaded the vertebrae, but also the ribs. In Brachiosaurus, the air sacs invaded through a small opening on the front side of the rib shafts, while in Giraffatitan openings were present on both the front and back sides of the tuberculum, a bony projection articulating with the diapophyses of the vertebrae. Paul, in 1988, stated that the ribs of Brachiosaurus were longer than in Giraffatitan, which was questioned by Taylor in 2009. Behind the dorsal vertebral column, the sacrum consisted of five co-ossified sacral vertebrae. As in Giraffatitan, the sacrum was proportionally broad and featured very short neural spines. Poor preservation of the sacral material in Giraffatitan precludes detailed comparisons between both genera. Of the tail, only the second caudal vertebra is well preserved. As in Giraffatitan, this vertebra was slightly amphicoelous (concave on both ends), lacked openings on the sides, and had a short neural spine that was rectangular and tilted backward. In contrast to the second caudal vertebra of Giraffatitan, that of Brachiosaurus had a proportionally taller neural arch, making the vertebra around 30% taller. The centrum lacked depressions on its sides, in contrast to Giraffatitan. In front or back view, the neural spine broadened toward its tip to approximately three times its minimum width, but no broadening is apparent in Giraffatitan. The neural spines were also inclined backward by about 30¬∞, more than in Giraffatitan (20¬∞). The caudal ribs projected laterally and were not tilted backward as in Giraffatitan. The articular facets of the articular processes at the back of the vertebra were directed downward, while those of Giraffatitan faced more toward the sides. Besides the articular processes, the hyposphene-hypantrum articulation formed an additional articulation between vertebrae, making the vertebral column more rigid; in Brachiosaurus, the hyposphene was much more pronounced than in Giraffatitan. Femur (left) and humerus of the holotype The coracoid was semicircular and taller than broad. Differences from Giraffatitan are related to its shape in side view, including the straighter suture with the scapula. Moreover, the articular surface that forms part of the shoulder joint was thicker and directed more sideward than in Giraffatitan and other sauropods, possibly indicating a more sprawled forelimb. The humerus, as preserved, measures in length, though part of its lower end was lost to erosion; its original length is estimated at . This bone was more slender in Brachiosaurus than in most other sauropods, measuring only in width at its narrowest part. It was, however, more robust than that of Giraffatitan, being around 10% broader at the upper and lower ends. At its upper end, it featured a low bulge visible in side view, which is absent in Giraffatitan. Distinguishing features can also be found in the ilium of the pelvis. In Brachiosaurus, the ischiadic peduncle, a downward projecting extension connecting to the ischium, reaches farther downward than in Giraffatitan. While the latter genus had a sharp notch between the ischiadic peduncle and the back portion of the ilium, this notch is more rounded in Brachiosaurus. On the upper surface of the hind part of the ilium, Brachiosaurus had a pronounced tubercle that is absent in other sauropods. Of the hindlimb, the femur was very similar to that of Giraffatitan although slightly more robust, and measured long. As in Giraffatitan, it was strongly elliptical in cross-section, being more than twice as wide in front or back view than in side view. The fourth trochanter, a prominent bulge on the back side of the femoral shaft, was more prominent and located further downward. This bulge served as anchor point for the most important locomotory muscle, the caudofemoralis, which was situated in the tail and pulled the upper thigh backward when contracted. At the lower end of the femur, the pair of condyles did not extend backward as strongly as in Giraffatitan; the two condyles were similar in width in Brachiosaurus but unequal in Giraffatitan. =Skull= Reconstruction of the Felch Quarry Brachiosaurus skull, Denver Museum of Nature & Science As reconstructed by Carpenter and Tidwell, the assigned Felch Quarry skull was about long from the occipital condyle at the back of the skull to the front of the premaxillae (the front bones of the upper jaw), making it the largest sauropod skull from the Morrison Formation. D'Emic and Carrano instead estimated the skull to have been long, and if proportionally similar to that of Giraffatitan, about tall, and wide. Overall, the skull was tall as in Giraffatitan, with a snout that was long (about 36% of the skull length according to Carpenter and Tidwell) in front of the nasal bar between the nostrils ‚Äì typical of brachiosaurids. The snout was somewhat blunt when seen from above (as in Giraffatitan), and since it was set at an angle relative to the rest of the skull, gave the impression of pointing downward. The dorsal and lateral temporal fenestrae (openings at the upper rear and sides of the skull) were large, perhaps due to the force imparted there by the massive jaw adductor musculature. The frontal bones on top of the skull were short and wide (similar to Giraffatitan), fused and connected by a suture to the parietal bones, which were also fused together. The surface of the parietals between the dorsal fenestrae was wider than that of Giraffatitan, but narrower than that of Camarasaurus. The skull differed from that of Giraffatitan in its U-shaped (instead of W-shaped) suture between frontal and nasal bones, a shape which appears more pronounced by the frontal bones extending forward over the orbits (eye sockets). Similar to Giraffatitan, the neck of the occipital condyle was very long. Diagram of the Felch Quarry skull, with known material in white The premaxilla appears to have been longer than that of Camarasaurus, sloping more gradually toward the nasal bar, which created the very long snout. Brachiosaurus had a long and deep maxilla (the main bone of the upper jaw), which was thick along the margin where the alveoli (tooth sockets) were placed, thinning upward. The interdental plates of the maxilla were thin, fused, porous, and triangular. There were triangular nutrient foramina between the plates, each containing the tip of an erupting tooth. The narial fossa (depression) in front of the bony nostril was long, relatively shallow, and less developed than that of Giraffatitan. It contained a subnarial fenestra, which was much larger than those of Giraffatitan and Camarasaurus. The dentaries (the bones of the lower jaws that contained the teeth) were robust, though less than in Camarasaurus. The upper margin of the dentary was arched in profile, but not as much as in Camarasaurus. The interdental plates of the dentary were somewhat oval, with diamond shaped openings between them. The dentary had a Meckelian groove that was open until below the ninth alveolus, continuing thereafter as a shallow trough. Each maxilla had space for about 14 or 15 teeth, whereas Giraffatitan had 11 and Camarasaurus 8 to 10. The maxillae contained replacement teeth that had rugose enamel, similar to Camarasaurus, but lacked the small denticles (serrations) along the edges. Since the maxilla was wider than that of Camarasaurus, Brachiosaurus would have had larger teeth. The replacement teeth in the premaxilla had crinkled enamel, and the most complete of these teeth did not have denticles. It was somewhat spatulate (spoon-shaped), and had a longitudinal ridge. Each dentary had space for about 14 teeth. The maxillary tooth rows of Brachiosaurus and Giraffatitan ended well in front of the antorbital fenestra (the opening in front of the orbit), whereas they ended just in front of and below the fenestra in Camarasaurus and Shunosaurus. Classification Replica skeleton outside the FMNH Riggs, in his preliminary 1903 description of the not yet fully prepared holotype specimen, considered Brachiosaurus to be an obvious member of the Sauropoda. To determine the validity of the genus, he compared it to the previously named genera Camarasaurus, Apatosaurus, Atlantosaurus, and Amphicoelias, whose validity he questioned given the lack of overlapping fossil material. Because of the uncertain relationships of these genera, little could be said about the relationships of Brachiosaurus itself. In 1904, Riggs described the holotype material of Brachiosaurus in more detail, especially the vertebrae. He admitted that he originally had assumed a close affinity with Camarasaurus, but now decided that Brachiosaurus was more closely related to Haplocanthosaurus. Both genera shared a single line of neural spines on the back and had wide hips. Riggs considered the differences from other taxa significant enough to name a separate family, Brachiosauridae, of which Brachiosaurus is the namesake genus. According to Riggs, Haplocanthosaurus was the more primitive genus of the family while Brachiosaurus was a specialized form. When describing Brachiosaurus brancai and B. fraasi in 1914, Janensch observed that the unique elongation of the humerus was shared by all three Brachiosaurus species as well as the British Pelorosaurus. He also noted this feature in Cetiosaurus, where it was not as strongly pronounced as in Brachiosaurus and Pelorosaurus. Janensch concluded that the four genera must have been closely related to each other, and in 1929 assigned them to a subfamily Brachiosaurinae within the family Bothrosauropodidae. During the twentieth century, several sauropods were assigned to Brachiosauridae, including Astrodon, Bothriospondylus, Pelorosaurus, Pleurocoelus, and Ultrasauros. These assignments were often based on broad similarities rather than unambiguous synapomorphies, shared new traits, and most of these genera are currently regarded as dubious. In 1969, in a study by R.F. Kingham, B. altithorax, \\"B.\\" brancai and \\"B.\\" atalaiensis, along with many species now assigned to other genera, were placed in the genus Astrodon, creating an Astrodon altithorax. Kingham's views of brachiosaurid taxonomy have not been accepted by many other authors. Since the 1990s, computer-based cladistic analyses allow for postulating detailed hypotheses on the relationships between species, by calculating those trees that require the fewest evolutionary changes and thus are the most likely to be correct. Such cladistic analyses have cast doubt on the validity of the Brachiosauridae. In 1993, Leonardo Salgado suggested that they were an unnatural group into which all kinds of unrelated sauropods had been combined.Leonardo Salgado, 1993, \\"Comments on Chubutisaurus insignis del Corro (Saurischia, Sauropoda)\\", Ameghiniana 30(3): 265‚Äì270 In 1997, he published an analysis in which species traditionally considered brachiosaurids were subsequent offshoots of the stem of a larger grouping, the Titanosauriformes, and not a separate branch of their own. This study also pointed out that B. altithorax and B. brancai did not have any synapomorphies, so that there was no evidence to assume they were particularly closely related.Salgado, L., R. A. Coria, and J. O. Calvo. 1997. \\"Evolution of titanosaurid sauropods. I: phylogenetic analysis based on the postcranial evidence\\". Ameghiniana 34: 3-32 Fifth dorsal vertebra in front of the pelvis of the holotype, compared to the same region of a human vertebral column Many cladistic analyses have since suggested that at least some genera can be assigned to the Brachiosauridae, and that this group is a basal branch within the Titanosauriformes. The exact status of each potential brachiosaurid varies from study to study. For example, a 2010 study by Chure and colleagues recognized Abydosaurus as a brachiosaurid together with Brachiosaurus, which in this study included B. brancai. In 2009, Taylor noted multiple anatomical differences between the two Brachiosaurus species, and consequently moved B. brancai into its own genus, Giraffatitan. In contrast to earlier studies, Taylor treated both genera as distinct units in a cladistic analysis, finding them to be sister groups. Another 2010 analysis focusing on possible Asian brachiosaurid material found a clade including Abydosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Cedarosaurus, Giraffatitan, and Paluxysaurus, but not Qiaowanlong, the putative Asian brachiosaurid. Several subsequent analyses have found Brachiosaurus and Giraffatitan not to be sister groups, but instead located at different positions on the evolutionary tree. A 2012 study by D'Emic placed Giraffatitan in a more basal position, in an earlier branch, than Brachiosaurus, while a 2013 study by Philip Mannion and colleagues had it the other way around. The cladogram of the Brachiosauridae below follows that published by Michael D. D'Emic in 2012: Cladistic analyses also allow scientists to determine which new traits the members of a group have in common, their synapomorphies. According to the 2009 study by Taylor, B. altithorax shares with other brachiosaurids the classic trait of having an upper arm bone that is at least nearly as long as the femur (ratio of humerus length to femur length of at least 0.9). Another shared character is the very flattened femur shaft, its transverse width being at least 1.85 times the width measured from front to rear. Paleobiology Life restoration =Habits= It was believed throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries that sauropods like Brachiosaurus were too massive to support their own weight on dry land, and instead lived partly submerged in water. Riggs, affirming observations by John Bell Hatcher, was the first to defend in length that most sauropods were fully terrestrial animals in his 1904 account on Brachiosaurus, pointing out that their hollow vertebrae have no analogue in living aquatic or semiaquatic animals, and their long limbs and compact feet indicate specialization for terrestrial locomotion. Brachiosaurus would have been better adapted than other sauropods to a fully terrestrial lifestyle through its slender limbs, high chest, wide hips, high ilia and short tail. In its dorsal vertebrae the zygapophyses were very reduced while the hyposphene- hypanthrum complex was extremely developed, resulting in a stiff torso incapable of bending sideways. The body was only fit for quadrupedal movement on land. Though Riggs' ideas were gradually forgotten during the first half of the twentieth century, the notion of sauropods as terrestrial animals has gained support since the 1950s, and is now universally accepted among paleontologists. In 1990 the paleontologist Stephen Czerkas stated that Brachiosaurus could have entered water occasionally to cool off (thermoregulate). =Neck posture= Assigned neck vertebra BYU 12866, BYU Museum of Paleontology Ongoing debate revolves around the neck posture of brachiosaurids, with estimates ranging from near-vertical to horizontal orientations. The idea of near-vertical postures in sauropods in general was popular until 1999, when Stevens and Parrish argued that the sauropod neck was not flexible enough to be held in an upright, S-curved pose, and instead was held horizontally. Reflecting this research, various newspapers ran stories criticizing the Field Museum Brachiosaurus mount for having an upward curving neck. Museum paleontologists Olivier Rieppel and Christopher Brochu defended the posture in 1999, noting the long forelimbs and upward sloping backbone. They also stated that the most developed neural spines for muscle attachment being positioned in the region of the shoulder girdle would have permitted the neck to be raised in a giraffe-like posture. Furthermore, such a pose would have required less energy than lowering its neck, and the inter-vertebral discs would not have been able to counter the pressure caused by a lowered head for extended periods of time (though lowering its neck to drink must have been possible). Some recent studies also advocated a more upward directed neck. Christian and Dzemski (2007) estimated that the middle part of the neck in Giraffatitan was inclined by 60‚Äì70 degrees; a horizontal posture could be maintained only for short periods of time. With their heads held high above the heart, brachiosaurids would have had stressed cardiovascular systems. It is estimated that the heart of Brachiosaurus would have to pump double the blood pressure of a giraffe to reach the brain, and possibly weighed . The distance between head and heart would have been reduced by the S-curvature of the neck by more than in comparison to a totally vertical posture. The neck may also have been lowered during locomotion by 20 degrees. In studying the inner ear of Giraffatitan, Gunga & Kirsch (2001) concluded that brachiosaurids would have moved their necks in lateral directions more often than in dorsal- ventral directions while feeding. =Feeding and diet= Replica skeleton showing the neck pointing upward, at O'Hare International Airport (formerly housed in the Field Museum) Brachiosaurus is thought to have been a high browser, feeding on foliage well above the ground. Even if it did not hold its neck near vertical, and instead had a less inclined neck, its head height may still have been over above the ground. It probably fed mostly on foliage above . This does not preclude the possibility that it also fed lower at times, between up. Its diet likely consisted of ginkgos, conifers, tree ferns, and large cycads, with intake estimated at of plant matter daily in a 2007 study. Brachiosaurid feeding involved simple up-and-down jaw motion. As in other sauropods, animals would have swallowed plant matter without further oral processing, and relied on hindgut fermentation for food processing. As the teeth were not spoon-shaped as with earlier sauropods but of the compressed cone-chisel type, a precision-shear bite was employed. Such teeth are optimized for non-selective nipping, and the relatively broad jaws could crop large amounts of plant material. Even if a Brachiosaurus of forty tonnes would have needed half a tonne of fodder, its dietary needs could have been met by a normal cropping action of the head. If it fed sixteen hours per day, biting off between a tenth and two-thirds of a kilogram, taking between one and six bites per minute, its daily food intake would have equaled roughly 1.5% of its body mass, comparable to the requirement of a modern elephant. As Brachiosaurus shared its habitat, the Morrison, with many other sauropod species, its specialization for feeding at greater heights would have been part of a system of niche partitioning, the various taxa thus avoiding direct competition with each other. A typical food tree might have resembled Sequoiadendron. The fact that such tall conifers were relatively rare in the Morrison might explain why Brachiosaurus was much less common in its ecosystem than the related Giraffatitan, which seems to have been one of the most abundant sauropods in the Tendaguru. Brachiosaurus, with its shorter arms and lower shoulders, was not as well-adapted to high-browsing as Giraffatitan. It has been suggested that Brachiosaurus could rear on its hind legs to feed, using its tail for extra ground support. A detailed physical modelling-based analysis of sauropod rearing capabilities by Heinrich Mallison showed that while many sauropods could rear, the unusual body shape and limb length ratio of brachiosaurids made them exceptionally ill-suited for rearing. The forward position of its center of mass would have led to problems with stability, and required unreasonably large forces in the hips to obtain an upright posture. Brachiosaurus would also have gained only 33% more feeding height, compared to other sauropods, for which rearing may have tripled the feeding height.Mallison, H. (2011). \\"Rearing Giants ‚Äì kinetic-dynamic modeling of sauropod bipedal and tripodal poses.\\" In Klein, N., Remes, K., Gee, C. & Sander M. (eds): Biology of the Sauropod Dinosaurs: Understanding the life of giants. Life of the Past (series ed. Farlow, J.). Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press. A bipedal stance might have been adopted by Brachiosaurus in exceptional situations, like male dominance fights. The downward mobility of the neck of Brachiosaurus would have allowed it to reach open water at the level of its feet, while standing upright. Modern giraffes spread their forelimbs to lower the mouth in a relatively horizontal position, to more easily gulp down the water. It is unlikely that Brachiosaurus could have attained a stable posture this way, forcing the animal to plunge the snout almost vertically into the surface of a lake or stream. This would have submerged its fleshy nostrils if they were located at the tip of the snout as Witmer hypothesized. Hallett and Wedel therefore in 2016 rejected his interpretation and suggested that they were in fact placed at the top of the head, above the bony nostrils, as traditionally thought. The nostrils might have evolved their retracted position to allow the animal to breathe while drinking. =Nostril function= The fleshy external nostril would have been placed at the front of the nasal fossa, here demarcated by a dashed line The bony nasal openings of neosauropods like Brachiosaurus were large and placed on the top of their skulls. Traditionally, the fleshy nostrils of sauropods were thought to have been placed likewise on top of the head, roughly at the rear of the bony nostril opening, because these animals were erroneously thought to have been amphibious, using their large nasal openings as snorkels when submerged. The American paleontologist Lawrence M. Witmer rejected this reconstruction in 2001, pointing out that all living vertebrate land animals have their external fleshy nostrils placed at the front of the bony nostril. The fleshy nostrils of such sauropods would have been placed in an even more forward position, at the front of the narial fossa, the depression which extended far in front of the bony nostril toward the snout tip. Czerkas speculated on the function of the peculiar brachiosaurid nose, and pointed out that there was no conclusive way to determine where the nostrils where located, unless a head with skin impressions was found. He suggested that the expanded nasal opening would have made room for tissue related to the animal's ability to smell, which would have helped smell proper vegetation. He also noted that in modern reptiles, the presence of bulbous, enlarged, and uplifted nasal bones can be correlated with fleshy horns and knobby protuberances, and that Brachiosaurus and other sauropods with large noses could have had ornamental nasal crests. It has been proposed that sauropods, including Brachiosaurus, may have had proboscises (trunks) based on the position of the bony narial orifice, to increase their upward reach. Fabien Knoll and colleagues disputed this for Diplodocus and Camarasaurus in 2006, finding that the opening for the facial nerve in the braincase was small. The facial nerve was thus not enlarged as in elephants, where it is involved in operating the sophisticated musculature of the proboscis. However, Knoll and colleagues also noted that the facial nerve for Giraffatitan was larger, and could therefore not discard the possibility of a proboscis in this genus. =Metabolism= Like other sauropods, Brachiosaurus was probably homeothermic (maintaining a stable internal temperature) and endothermic (controlling body temperature through internal means) at least while growing, meaning that it could actively control its body temperature (\\"warm-blooded\\"), producing the necessary heat through a high basic metabolic rate of its cells. Russel (1989) used Brachiosaurus as an example of a dinosaur for which endothermy is unlikely, because of the combination of great size (leading to overheating) and great caloric needs to fuel endothermy. Sander (2010) found that these calculations were based on incorrect body mass estimates and faulty assumptions on the available cooling surfaces, as the presence of large air sacs was unknown at the time of the study. These inaccuracies resulted in the overestimation of heat production and the underestimation of heat loss. The large nasal arch has been postulated as an adaptation for cooling the brain, as a surface for evaporative cooling of the blood. =Air sacs= Dorsal vertebrae of the holotype; the openings at their lower sides are , through which air sacs invaded the bone and connected with air cells inside The respiration system of sauropods, like that of birds, made use of air sacs. There was not a bidirectional airflow as with mammals, in which the lungs function as bellows, first inhaling and then exhaling air. Instead the air was sucked from the trachea into an abdominal air sac in the belly which then pumped it forward through the parabranchi, air loops, of the stiff lung. Valves prevented the air from flowing backward when the abdominal air sac filled itself again; at the same time a cervical air sac at the neck base sucked out the spent air from the lung. Both air sacs contracted simultaneously to pump the used air out of the trachea. This procedure guaranteed a unidirectional airflow, the air always moving in a single forward direction in the lung itself. This significantly improved the oxygen intake and the release of carbon dioxide. Not only was dead air removed quickly but also the blood flow in the lung was counterdirectional in relation to the airflow, leading to a far more effective gas exchange. In sauropods, the air sacs did not simply function as an aid for respiration; by means of air channels they were connected to much of the skeleton. These branches, the diverticula, via pneumatic openings invaded many bones and strongly hollowed them out. It is not entirely clear what the evolutionary benefit of this phenomenon was but in any case it considerably lightened the skeleton. They might also have removed excess heat to aid thermoregulation. In 2016, Mark Hallett and Mathew Wedel for the first time reconstructed the entire air sac system of a sauropod, using B. altithorax as an example of how such a structure might have been formed. In their reconstruction a large abdominal air sac was located between the pelvis and the outer lung side. As with birds, three smaller sacs assisted the pumping process from the underside of the breast cavity: at the rear the posterior thoracic air sac, in the middle the anterior thoracic air sac and in front the clavicular air sac, in that order gradually diminishing in size. The cervical air sac was positioned under the shoulder blade, on top of the front lung. The air sacs were via tubes connected with the vertebrae. Diverticula filled the various fossae and that formed depressions in the vertebral bone walls. These were again connected with inflexible air cells inside the bones. =Growth= Juvenile B. sp. specimen SMA 0009 (the skull is reconstructed following the initial diplodocoid identification), Sauriermuseum Aathal The ontogeny of Brachiosaurus has been reconstructed by Carballido and colleagues in 2012 based on SMA 0009, a postcranial skeleton of a young juvenile with an estimated total body length of just . This skeleton shares some unique traits with the B. altithorax holotype, indicating it is referable to this species. These commonalities include an elevation on the rear blade of the ilium; the lack of a postspinal lamina; vertical neural spines on the back; an ilium with a subtle notch between the appendage for the ischium and the rear blade; and the lack of a side bulge on the upper thighbone. There are also differences; these might indicate that the juvenile is not a B. altithorax individual after all, but belongs to a new species. Alternatively, they might be explained as juvenile traits that would have changed when the animal matured. Such ontogenetic changes are especially to be expected in the proportions of an organism. The middle neck vertebrae of SMA 0009 are remarkably short for a sauropod, being just 1.8 times longer than high, compared with a ratio of 4.5 in Giraffatitan. This suggests that the necks of brachiosaurids became proportionally much longer while their backs, to the contrary, experienced relative negative growth. The humerus of SMA 0009 is relatively robust: it is more slender than that of most basal titanosauriforms but thicker than the upper arm bone of B. altithorax. This suggests that it was already lengthening in an early juvenile stage and became even more slender during growth. This is in contrast to diplodocoids and basal macronarians, whose slender humeri are not due to such allometric growth. Brachiosaurus also appears to have experienced an elongation of the metacarpals, which in juveniles were shorter compared to the length of the radius; SMA 0009 had a ratio of just 0.33, the lowest known in the entire Neosauropoda. Another plausible ontogenetic change is the increased pneumatization of the vertebrae. During growth, the diverticula of the air sacs invaded the bones and hollowed them out. SMA 0009 already has pleurocoels, pneumatic excavations, at the sides of its neck vertebrae. These are divided by a ridge but are otherwise still very simple in structure, compared with the extremely complex ridge systems typically shown by adult derived sauropods. Its dorsal vertebrae still completely lack these. Two traits are not so obviously linked to ontogeny. The neural spines of the rear dorsal vertebrae and the front sacral vertebrae are extremely compressed transversely, being eight times longer from front to rear than wide from side to side. The spinodiapophyseal lamina or \\"SPOL\\", the ridge normally running from each side of the neural spine toward each diapophysis, the transverse process bearing the contact facet for the upper rib head, is totally lacking. Both traits could be autapomorphies, unique derived characters proving that SMA 0009 represents a distinct species, but there are indications that these traits are growth-related as well. Of the basal sauropod Tazoudasaurus a young juvenile is known that also lacks the spinodiapophyseal lamina, whereas the adult form has an incipient ridge. Furthermore, a very young juvenile of Europasaurus had a weak SPOL but it is well developed in mature individuals. These two cases represent the only finds in which the condition can be checked; they suggest that the SPOL developed during growth. As this very ridge widens the neural spine, its transverse compression is not an independent trait and the development of the SPOL plausibly precedes the thickening of the neural spine with more mature animals. Sauropods were likely able to sexually reproduce before they attained their maximum individual size. The maturation rate differed between species. Its bone structure indicates that Brachiosaurus was able to reproduce when it reached 40% of its maximal size. Paleoecology Map showing locations of brachiosaurid remains from the Morrison Formation (gray); 5 (middle left) is the B. altithorax type locality Brachiosaurus is known only from the Morrison Formation of western North America (following the reassignment of the African species). The Morrison Formation is interpreted as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons, and flat floodplains. Several other sauropod genera were present in the Morrison Formation, with differing body proportions and feeding adaptations.Foster, J. (2007). \\"Appendix.\\" Jurassic West: The Dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation and Their World. Indiana University Press. pp. 327‚Äì329. Among these were Apatosaurus, Barosaurus, Camarasaurus, Diplodocus, Haplocanthosaurus, and Supersaurus. Brachiosaurus was one of the less abundant Morrison Formation sauropods. In a 2003 survey of over 200 fossil localities, John Foster reported 12 specimens of the genus, comparable to Barosaurus (13) and Haplocanthosaurus (12), but far fewer than Apatosaurus (112), Camarasaurus (179), and Diplodocus (98). Brachiosaurus fossils are found only in the lower- middle part of the expansive Morrison Formation (stratigraphic zones 2‚Äì4), dated to about 154‚Äì153 million years ago,Turner, C.E. and Peterson, F., (1999). \\"Biostratigraphy of dinosaurs in the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation of the Western Interior, U.S.A.\\" Pp. 77‚Äì114 in Gillette, D.D. (ed.), Vertebrate Paleontology in Utah. Utah Geological Survey Miscellaneous Publication 99-1. unlike many other types of sauropod which have been found throughout the formation. If the large foot reported from Wyoming (the northernmost occurrence of a brachiosaurid in North America) did belong to Brachiosaurus, the genus would have covered a wide range of latitudes. Brachiosaurids could process tough vegetation with their broad-crowned teeth, and might therefore have covered a wider range of vegetational zones than for example diplodocids. Camarasaurids, which were similar in tooth morphology to brachiosaurids, were also widespread and are known to have migrated seasonally, so this might have also been true for brachiosaurids. Other dinosaurs known from the Morrison Formation include the predatory theropods Koparion, Stokesosaurus, Ornitholestes, Ceratosaurus, Allosaurus and Torvosaurus, as well as the herbivorous ornithischians Camptosaurus, Dryosaurus, Othnielia, Gargoyleosaurus and Stegosaurus. Allosaurus accounted for 70 to 75% of theropod specimens and was at the top trophic level of the Morrison food web. Ceratosaurus might have specialized in attacking large sauropods, including smaller individuals of Brachiosaurus. Other vertebrates that shared this paleoenvironment included ray-finned fishes, frogs, salamanders, turtles like Dorsetochelys, sphenodonts, lizards, terrestrial and aquatic crocodylomorphans such as Hoplosuchus, and several species of pterosaur like Harpactognathus and Mesadactylus. Shells of bivalves and aquatic snails are also common. The flora of the period has been revealed by fossils of green algae, fungi, mosses, horsetails, cycads, ginkgoes, and several families of conifers. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests in otherwise treeless settings (gallery forests) with tree ferns, and ferns, to fern savannas with occasional trees such as the Araucaria-like conifer Brachyphyllum. Cultural significance Child with the Potter Creek humerus, 1959 Riggs in the first instance tried to limit public awareness of the find. When reading a lecture to the inhabitants of Grand Junction, illustrated by lantern slides, on 27 July 1901, he explained the general evolution of dinosaurs and the exploration methods of museum field crews but did not mention that he had just found a spectacular specimen. He feared that teams of other institutions might soon learn of the discovery and take away the best of the remaining fossils. A week later, his host Bradbury published an article in the local Grand Junction News announcing the find of one of the largest dinosaurs ever. On 14 August, The New York Times brought the story. At the time sauropod dinosaurs appealed to the public because of their great size, often exaggerated by sensationalist newspapers. Riggs in his publications played into this by emphasizing the enormous magnitude of Brachiosaurus. Brachiosaurus has been called one of the most iconic dinosaurs, but most popular depictions are based on the African species B. brancai which has since been moved to its own genus, Giraffatitan. A main belt asteroid, , was named 9954 Brachiosaurus in honor of the genus in 1991. Brachiosaurus was featured in the 1993 movie Jurassic Park, as the first computer generated dinosaur shown. These effects were considered ground-breaking at the time, and the awe of the movie's characters upon seeing the dinosaur for the first time was mirrored by audiences. The movements of the movie's Brachiosaurus were based on the gait of a giraffe combined with the mass of an elephant. A scene later in the movie used an animatronic head and neck, for when a Brachiosaurus interacts with human characters. The digital model of Brachiosaurus used in Jurassic Park later became the starting point for the ronto models in the 1997 special edition of the film Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope.

Career  = 1980‚Äì1994: Youth and rise with Union = Patschinski began to play ice hockey in SC Dynamo Berlin's youth department. He was inspired by his father who himself had been a successful ice hockey player. Two years later, Patschinski switched sports and took up football, joining BFC Dynamo. In 1988, Patschinski moved to 1. FC Union Berlin. = 1994‚Äì2000: Rambler = Patschinski made his debut in the senior team in 1994 and established himself as a regular in the following season. But in 1997, Union were hit hard by financial troubles and Patschinski took up the offer of Potsdam-based SV Babelsberg 03. Patschinski did not have a good time in Potsdam, even though he played regularly. The fans had an inherent distrust of Berlin-born players and were quick to criticize them. In the summer of 1998, Patschinski left the club and signed a contract with Dynamo Dresden. In a match with his new club in Babelsberg, Patschinski scored and subsequently showed the fans the bird. Patschinski spent one year in Dresden, scoring 11 goals in 31 matches He then moved to SpVgg Greuther F√ºrth to finally play in a fully professional league. He gained some experience in the 2. Bundesliga with F√ºrth, but did neither score a goal nor become a regular starter. Therefore, he sought a move away from F√ºrth after only one season. Additionally, Berlin-born Patschinski did not feel at home in rural F√ºrth. = 2000‚Äì2003: Success with St. Pauli = Patschinski's new club was FC St. Pauli where he would have his biggest success in the next three years. With Hamburg-based St. Pauli, Patschinski gained promotion to the Bundesliga and scored the second goal in St. Pauli's 2‚Äì1 victory over Intercontinental Cup holders FC Bayern Munich. FC St. Pauli created a T-shirt to commemorate the event, naming the club \\"Weltpokalsieger-Besieger\\" (German for Intercontintal Cup winner beaters). However, St. Pauli's stay in the top flight was short when the team was relegated at the end of the 2001‚Äì02 season St. Pauli were also relegated from the 2. Bundesliga in the following season and Patschinski found himself on the bench after the winter break, as new manager Franz Gerber did not value him. = 2003‚Äì2006: Relegation and the national team = Following the relegation, Patschinski signed for SV Eintracht Trier 05 in the 2. Bundesliga. But relegation hit Patschinski's club again, and after two years he moved on to another 2. Bundesliga club, LR Ahlen. The club were relegated at the end of the season, and Patschinski had managed a rather curious feat: in five seasons his clubs had been relegated four times. Patschinski would describe his move to Ahlen as a mistake he \\"would never make again\\". During his spell at Ahlen the football magazine RUND discovered that Patschinski's grandparents were Polish and he would be eligible to play for Poland national football team. However, the interest cooled off as the Polish manager had already selected his team of the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Even though the PZPN president had signaled interest for matches after the World Cup, Patschinski did not hear anything from them again. = 2006 bis 2009: Return to Berlin = At the start of the 2006‚Äì07 season, Patschinski returned to the club of his youth, Union Berlin. His team had a mixed season, alternating between promotion hope and relegation fight. In the end, Union Berlin saved themselves from relegation and Patschinski scored a Goal of the Week against his former club FC St. Pauli. Patschinski admitted that he had meant to cross the ball. In the following season Patschinski and Union Berlin qualified for the newly created 3. Liga. Citing a lack of trust, Union dissolved the player's contract on 4 March 2009. = Return to BFC = On 28 July 2009, Patschinski joined BFC Dynamo.  Personal life  Patschinski has three children. He and Mariana Kautz were married in December 2006. Their relationship ended in winter 2009. Since July 2015, Patschinski has worked as a funeral director in the Hamburg area.

It was directed by the pianist Aida Diestro (1924-1973) in 1952. Three brilliant young singers - Elena Burke, Omara Portuondo and her sister Haydee Portuondo - came to Diestro with the idea of the quartet, which originally would include one male singer. Thinking that the quartet would sound better, Diestro replaced the proposed male singer with another woman, Moraima Secada. Of this original group, only one, Omara is still alive and performing today. Her career kind of languishing, Omara was brought back to popularity thanks to the fact that she made part of the Buena Vista Club phenomenon, a group integrated by old musicians forgotten by the public and the music-industry-controlling government. The Cuarteto d'Aida was part of a post World War II blend of jazz and Cuban bolero movement in Cuba known as \\"feeling\\" or \\"filin\\", which renovated the traditional harmonies and lyrics of the music on the island. The quartet could basically sing any type of song, from standards like Maxwell's \\"Ebb Tide\\" to a guaracha and a rhumba, though the bolero was central to their style. The group was heard on the radio, had many TV presentations, as well as in all the major and all the important cabarets of Havana and abroad. They also toured many countries both before and after the Cuban revolution of 1959. Amazingly, the original group recorded only one LP, Victor LP 1532 Cuarteto d'Aida con la orquesta de Chico O'Farrill in 1957 titled \\"An evening at the Sans Souci\\". Recordings after 1960 included just one of the original singers, Omara, who left the quartet en 1967. Elena Burke was the first to become a soloist, followed a couple of years later by Moraima Secada. Omara's sister, Haydee, stayed in the United States after the quartet finished a gig in the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami. Throughout the years, when any of the singers left the group or were otherwise unavailable substitutes were found, many of them also very talented. Teresa \\"Tete\\" Garc√≠a Caturla joined them in 1963, and led them after Aida's death in 1973.

History Antonio Salieri, Italian composer who worked mainly in Austria. Kapellmeister from 1788 to 1824. Since the Middle Ages, Austria had a great influence over the Italian states, especially in the north of the country. On the other side Italy influenced Austria culture, architecture and cuisine, many artists and architects like Santino Solari, Martino Altomonte, Giovanni Zucalli, Vincenzo Scamozzi worked and contributed to the Baroque in Austria and most notable in Salzburg. Nicol√≤ Pacassi, an Austrian architect of Italian descent. After the Congress of Vienna, Austrian control of the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia, with its key cities of Venice and Milan, created the conditions in which Italian nationalism and Austrian interests clashed in the three Wars of Italian Independence between 1848 and 1866 ultimately leading to Italian victory. Tensions remained throughout the 1870s as continued Austrian rule over Italian inhabited lands such as in Trentino and Istria, inflamed Italian nationalism which in turn threatened Austrian integrity; as a result the Austrians built further fortifications along the Italian border.Rothenburg, G. The Army of Francis Joseph. West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 1976. p 98-99. In 1876, the Austrian Archduke Albrecht advocated a preventive war against Italy. Despite entering into the Triple Alliance of 1882 (along with Germany), areas of clashing interest remained. Italy's improving relations with France, Italian interests in the Balkans, and continuing nationalism among Italians within Austria-Hungary concerned leaders in Vienna. Italy's adherence to the Triple Alliance in the event of war was doubted and from 1903 plans for a possible war against Rome were again maintained by the Austrian general staff. Mutual suspicions led to reinforcement of the frontier and speculation in the press about a war between the two countries into the first decade of the twentieth century. As late as 1911 Count Franz Conrad von H√∂tzendorf, chief of the Austrian general staff, was advocating a military strike against Austria's supposed Italian allies. During World War I, Italy fought against Austria‚ÄìHungary despite their defensive alliance signed some decades earlier. By World War I's end, Italy emerged victorious and gained new territories from Austria and border agreements were secured. Today Matteo Renzi with Werner Faymann Both countries are full members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and of the European Union.

A 1936 Academy Award co-nominee for best art direction on The Great Ziegfeld, Imazu worked with Hollywood luminaries including Spencer Tracy, John Wayne and Marlon Brando. He was born in Yamaguchi, Japan and died in Los Angeles. Early life Imazu was born 12 November 1897 in Yamaguchi, Japan. As a teenager, he emigrated with his parents to Los Angeles. Employed as a houseboy while attending Hollywood High School, Imazu studied architecture and became the school's first Japanese graduate. Afterward, Imazu attended the University of California, Berkeley and majored in architecture. During his sophomore year, Imazu vacationed in Los Angeles and attended a party hosted by Sessue Hayakawa, the famous Japanese actor. While circulating at the party, Imazu met a supervising art director at the old Metro studios. This art director offered Imazu a job‚Äîeither being a cameraman or working in the art field. Because of his interest in architecture, Imazu chose the latter. Career Imazu joined Metro studios as a draftsman in 1920. He remained at the studio until its merger with Goldwyn Pictures to form Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in 1924. In 1929, MGM promoted him from draftsman to art director. During the early 1930s, Imazu met Aiko Kondo, a cousin of Mary Yuriko Kochiyama (n√©e Nakahara), who became a prominent civil rights activist. Because she was beautiful, Aiko attracted many suitors, mostly naval officers whose ship had docked in San Pedro harbor. Aiko‚Äôs father didn‚Äôt trust these young sailors, so he asked a pre-teen Mary Nakahara to accompany Aiko on her dates. Mary, later known as \\"Yuri,\\" recalled feeling awkward about her third-wheel presence but relieved that Aiko never showed the slightest irritation. Yuri also recalled that Aiko Kondo was a portrait artist from an artistic family. When Yuri and her two brothers visited the Kondos, the siblings ran straight to the wastebaskets. They would rifle through the contents to retrieve discarded art, which they would take home. A young Eddie Imazu discussing set design with brother-in-law Takashi \\"Teek\\" KondoDuring the mid-1930s, Eddie Imazu married Aiko Kondo, creating a very happy, artistic union. In a 1947 interview with Pacific Citizen, Aiko Imazu said she preferred to make \\"rough sketches executed mostly in charcoal,\\" whereas her husband created more complicated and detailed renderings. Aiko's brother Takashi \\"Teek\\" Kondo, an accomplished cartoonist, eventually became an MGM employee in the art department. Eddie and Aiko Imazu raised two daughters, Joyce and Darleen. On 7 December 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, and President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, purportedly for security reasons. The Order required all Japanese Americans and Japanese immigrants to evacuate from the west coast and relocate at isolated, inland detention centers surrounded by barbed wire and guard towers. To retain Imazu as an art director, MGM offered him living accommodations inside the studio. But the government required Aiko Imazu and daughters to report to the Santa Anita Assembly Center and later to the Jerome and Rohwer relocation camps. So Imazu chose to accompany his family into relocation. After release from detention, Imazu returned home to Culver City in the Los Angeles area. The next day, Cedric Gibbons, supervising art director at MGM, wired Imazu to offer him his old job. Studio head, Louis B. Mayer, usually inaccessible to Hollywood VIPs, personally greeted Imazu back to work. Well-liked and respected by colleagues, Imazu worked at MGM Studios for 35 years. During the 1950s, Imazu became a naturalized American citizen. An inside-page interview of Imazu, at age 50, appeared in the edition of 20 December 1947 of Pacific Citizen, a Japanese- American newspaper. The headline reads, \\"Hollywood Story: A Portrait of Eddie Imazu, Art Director at MGM Studios.\\" And the byline reads, By Alice Sumida. In the 24-inch profile, Imazu describes how he works. Eddie Imazu (second from right) discusses set designs with Fred MacMurray (far left) and MGM Studio executives. First, he reads the script. If the movie must be shot on location, Imazu travels to an appropriate area and selects a site. For a studio movie, Imazu spends one or two months breaking the story into sets, estimating costs, making layouts, sketching and drawing models, and consulting the director. Imazu lines up the sets needed to ensure they're built in the proper order. He does a \\"roughing out,\\" followed by a drafting. The set of A Hole in the Head, on location in Florida, Eddie Imazu, lower left, Frank Sinatra, bottom center After the models are drawn, the director studies them and may suggest changes. If the proposed budget is suitable and the director is satisfied, the set plans go from the draftsman's workroom to the mill, where the units are made. After they're built, the sets are assembled on the stage and set up. Lastly, each set is painted, dressed and made ready to shoot. In Technicolor movies, the set's colors must beautifully offset the costumes, so wardrobe designers contribute ideas. Imazu's budget is 12% to 15% of total production cost, usually about $250,000. A studio movie costs at the very least $1.5 million. In 1936, Eddie Imazu was an Academy Award co-nominee for Best Art Direction on The Great Ziegfeld. Imazu's film credits include: McLintock! (1963); The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962); The Teahouse of the August Moon (1956); Go For Broke! (1951); and Three Wise Fools (1946). His television credits include: The Twilight Zone (1964); Combat! (1963-1964); and The Thin Man (1958). Death After retiring from MGM in the late 1960s, Imazu fell into poor health. He died 29 May 1979 at age 81 in Los Angeles. Aiko Kondo Imazu died in April 1983.

The plant is located in the Fremont River Ranger District of the Fishlake National Forest at the western edge of the Colorado Plateau in south- central Utah, United States, around southwest of Fish Lake. Pando occupies and is estimated to weigh collectively , making it the heaviest known organism. The root system of Pando is estimated to be several thousand years old, placing Pando among the oldest known living organisms. Pando's long term survival is uncertain due to a combination of factors including drought, human development, grazing, and fire suppression. The Western Aspen Alliance is studying the tree in an effort to save it in collaboration with the United States Forest Service. In areas of Pando lacking adequate protective fencing, grazing animals have prevented Pando from developing enough young stems to fully replace existing older stems as they die. This decline in recruitment of young stems began in the 1980s and has been attributed primarily to mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), though Pando also undergoes restricted grazing by domestic cattle (Bos taurus) and is potentially browsed by elk (Cervus elaphus). History Pando was identified in 1976 by Jerry Kemperman and Burton Barnes. Michael Grant, Jeffrey Litton, and Yin Linhart of the University of Colorado at Boulder re-examined the clone in 1992, naming it Pando and claiming it to be the world's largest organism by weight. Both teams of researchers described Pando as a single organism based on its morphological characteristics. Genetic sampling and analysis in 2008 by Jennifer DeWoody, Carol Rowe, Valerie Hipkins, and Karen Mock of Utah State University and the University of Southampton confirmed the earlier analyses and increased the clone's estimated size from 43.3 to 43.6 ha. Paul Rogers and Darren McAvoy, also with Utah State University, completed the first comprehensive assessment of Pando's status in 2018 and stressed the importance of reducing herbivory by mule deer to conserving Pando for the future. Rogers and Jan ≈†ebesta surveyed other vegetation within Pando besides aspen in 2019, finding additional support for their 2018 conclusion interactions between browsing and past and ongoing management have had adverse effects on Pando's long-term resilience to change. While Pando is the largest known aspen clone and its age has received considerable attention, other large and old clones exist. According to an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report in 2000: In 2006 the United States Postal Service published a stamp in commemoration of the aspen, calling it one of the forty \\"Wonders of America\\". Size and age The clonal colony encompasses , weighs nearly , and has over 40,000 stems (trunks), which die individually and are replaced by new stems growing from its roots. The root system is estimated to be several thousand years old with habitat modeling suggesting a maximum age of 14,000 years. Individual aspen stems typically do not live beyond 100‚Äì130 years and mature areas within Pando are approaching this limit. Mitton and Grant summarize the development of stems in aspen clones: =Range of age estimates= Due to the progressive replacement of stems and roots, the overall age of an aspen clone cannot be determined from tree rings. In Pando's case, ages up to 1 million years have therefore been suggested. An age of 80,000 years is often given for Pando, but this claim derives from a National Park Service web page which does not provide a source for its number and is inconsistent with the Forest Service's post ice-age estimate. Glaciers repeatedly formed on the Fish Lake Plateau over the past several hundred thousand years and the Fish Lake valley occupied by Pando was partially filled by ice as recently as the last glacial maximum. Ages greater than approximately 16,000 years therefore require Pando to have survived at least the Pinedale glaciation, something which appears unlikely under current genetic estimates of Pando's age and modeling of variation in Pando's local climate. Estimates of Pando's age have also been influenced by changes in the understanding of establishment of aspen clones in western North America. Earlier sources argued germination and successful establishment of aspen on new sites was rare in the last 10,000 years and, therefore, Pando's root system was likely over 10,000 years old. However, more recent observations have shown seedling establishment of new aspen clones is a regular occurrence and can be abundant on sites exposed by wildfire.

It is the largest member of the clade Pinnipedia and the order Carnivora, as well as the largest extant marine mammal that is not a cetacean. It gets its name from its massive size and the large proboscis of the adult male, which is used to produce very loud roars, especially during the breeding season. A bull southern elephant seal is about 40% heavier than a male northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris), more than twice as heavy as a male walrus (Odobenus rosmarus), and 6‚Äì7 times heavier than the largest living terrestrial carnivorans, the polar bear (Ursus maritimus) and the Kodiak bear (Ursus arctos middendorffi). Taxonomy The southern elephant seal was one of the many species originally described by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his Systema Naturae, where it was given the binomial name of Phoca leonina. John Edward Gray established the genus Mirounga in 1827. In the nineteenth century the species was often called \\"bottle-nosed seal\\".e.g. Cuvier 1827-1835.

Description Skeleton of a southern elephant seal Close-up of juvenile southern elephant seal, showing face and mouth detail The southern elephant seal is distinguished from the northern elephant seal (which does not overlap in range with this species) by its greater body mass and a shorter proboscis. The southern males also appear taller when fighting, due to their tendency to bend their backs more strongly than the northern species. This species may also exhibit the greatest sexual dimorphism of any mammal in terms of mass ratio, with males typically five to six times heavier than females. On average female southern elephant seals weigh and measure long, whereas bulls can range from and grow to in length. For comparison, among the northern elephant seal and the sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus)‚Äîtwo other large marine mammals that are highly sexual dimorphic by size‚Äîmales typically outweigh females by a factor of three; exceptionally massive bulls may weigh four times as much as females. Southern elephant seal size also varies regionally. Studies have indicated elephant seals from South Georgia are around 30% heavier and 10% longer on average than those from Macquarie Island. The record-sized bull, shot in Possession Bay, South Georgia, on 28 February 1913, measured long and was estimated to weigh , although it was only partially weighed piecemeal. The maximum size of a female is and . The eyes are large, round, and black. The width of the eyes, and a high concentration of low-light pigments, suggest sight plays an important role in the capture of prey. Like all seals, elephant seals have hind limbs whose ends form the tail and tail fin. Each of the \\"feet\\" can deploy five long, webbed fingers. This agile dual palm is used to propel water. The pectoral fins are used little while swimming. While their hind limbs are unfit for locomotion on land, elephant seals use their fins as support to propel their bodies. They are able to propel themselves quickly (as fast as ) in this way for short-distance travel, to return to water, to catch up with a female, or to chase an intruder. Pups are born with fur and are completely black. Their coats are unsuited to water, but protect infants by insulating them from the cold air. The first moulting accompanies weaning. After moulting, the coats may turn grey and brown, depending on the thickness and moisture of hair. Among older males, the skin takes the form of a thick leather which is often scarred. Like other seals, the vascular system of elephant seals is adapted to the cold; a mixture of small veins surround arteries, capturing heat from them. This structure is present in extremities such as the hind legs. Range and population The world population was estimated at 650,000 animals in the mid-1990s, and was estimated in 2005 at between 664,000 and 740,000 animals. Studies have shown the existence of three geographic subpopulations, one in each of the three oceans. Tracking studies have indicated the routes traveled by elephant seals, demonstrating their main feeding area is at the edge of the Antarctic continent. While elephant seals may come ashore in Antarctica occasionally to rest or to mate, they gather to breed in subantarctic locations. Southern elephant seal harem on a beach on the Kerguelen Islands The largest subpopulation is in the South Atlantic, with more than 400,000 individuals, including about 113,000 breeding females on South Georgia; the other breeding colonies of the Atlantic subpopulation are located on the Falkland Islands and Valdes Peninsula in Argentina (the only continental breeding population). The second subpopulation, in the south Indian Ocean, consists of up to 200,000 individuals, three-quarters of which breed in the Kerguelen Islands and the rest in the Crozet Islands, Marion and Prince Edward Islands, and Heard Island. Some individuals also breed on Amsterdam Island. King penguins and southern elephant seal at South Georgia Island The third subpopulation of about 75,000 seals is found in the subantarctic islands of the Pacific Ocean south of Tasmania and New Zealand, mainly Macquarie Island. Colonies once existed in Tasmania, Saint Helena, and the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands off the coast of Chile. Some individuals at the time of moulting have been found in South Africa or Australia. Lost animals have also been reported from time to time on the shores of Mauritius, with two reports from the R√≠o Guayas estuary area in Ecuador. Reality of the creature so called Manatee of Helena had been pointed out as possible misidentification of elephant seals historically present on Saint Helena.Shuker K., 2014, The Beasts That Hide from Man: Seeking the World's Last Undiscovered Animals, pp.138, Cosimo, Inc. After the end of large-scale seal hunting in the 19th century, the southern elephant seal recovered to a sizable population in the 1950s; since then, an unexplained decline in the subpopulations of the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean has occurred. The population now seems to be stable; the reasons for the fluctuation are unknown. Suggested explanations include a phenomenon of depression following a rapid demographic rebound that depletes vital resources, a change in climate, competition with other species whose numbers also varied, or even an adverse influence of scientific monitoring techniques. Lifestyle =Social behavior and reproduction= Bull elephant seals fighting Elephant seals are among the seals that can stay on land for the longest periods of time, as they can stay dry for several consecutive weeks each year. Males arrive in the colonies earlier than the females and fight for control of harems when they arrive. Large body size confers advantages in fighting and the agonistic relationships of the bulls gives rise to a dominance hierarchy, with access to harems and activity within harems being determined by rank. The dominant bulls (‚Äúharem masters‚Äù) establish harems of several dozen females. The least successful males have no harems, but may try to copulate with a harem male's females when the male is not looking. The majority of primiparous females and a significant proportion of multiparous females mate at sea with roaming males away from harems. An elephant seal must stay in his territory to defend it, which could mean months without eating, having to live on his blubber storage. Two fighting males use their weight and canine teeth against each other. The outcome is rarely fatal, and the defeated bull will flee; however, bulls can suffer severe tears and cuts. Some males can stay ashore for more than three months without food. Males commonly vocalize with a coughing roar that serves in both individual recognition and size assessment. Conflicts between high-ranking males are more often resolved with posturing and vocalizing than with physical contact. Females (one giving birth) Generally, pups are born rather quickly in the breeding season. After being born, a newborn will bark or yap and its mother will respond with a high-pitched moan.Link, J. K.; Bryden. M. M. (1992). \\"Mirounga leonina\\". Mammalian Species 391:1‚Äì8. The newborn begins to suckle immediately. Lactation lasts an average of 23 days. Throughout this period, the female fasts. Newborns weigh about at birth, and reach by the time they are weaned. The mother loses significant weight during this time. Young weaned seals gather in nurseries until they lose their birth coats. They enter the water to practice swimming, generally starting their apprenticeship in estuaries or ponds. In summer, the elephant seals come ashore to moult. This sometimes happens directly after reproduction. =Feeding and diving= Southern elephant seal (just weaned pup): first bath Satellite tracking revealed the seals spend very little time on the surface, usually a few minutes for breathing. They dive repeatedly, each time for more than 20 minutes, to hunt their prey‚Äîsquid and fish‚Äîat depths of . They are the deepest diving air-breathing non-cetaceans and have been recorded at a maximum of in depth. Southern elephant seal (young males): collective mudbath during moulting As for the duration, depth and sequence of dives, the southern elephant seal is the best performing seal. In many regards, they exceed even most cetaceans. These capabilities result from nonstandard physiological adaptations, common to marine mammals, but particularly developed in elephant seals. The coping strategy is based on increased oxygen storage and reduced oxygen consumption. In the ocean, the seals apparently live alone. Most females dive in pelagic zones for foraging, while males dive in both pelagic and benthic zones. Individuals will return annually to the same hunting areas. Due to the inaccessibility of their deep-water foraging areas, no comprehensive information has been obtained about their dietary preferences, although some observation of hunting behavior and prey selection has occurred.2002\\\\. Elephant Seal. Columbia Encyclopedia, Vol. 1, sixth Edition. New York: Columbia University Press. While hunting in the dark depths, elephant seals seem to locate their prey, at least in part, using vision; the bioluminescence of some prey animals can facilitate their capture. Elephant seals do not have a developed system of echolocation in the manner of cetaceans, but their vibrissae (facial whiskers), which are sensitive to vibrations, are assumed to play a role in search of food. When at the subantarctic or Antarctic coasts, the seals forage largely on deep-sea cephalopod species such as Psychroteuthis glacialis, Alluroteuthis antarcticus', Histeoteuthis eltaninae, Onykia ingens, Gonatus antarcticus.

Cases where weaned pups have been attacked and killed by leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx) and New Zealand sea lions (Phocarctos hookeri), exclusively small pups in the latter case, have been recorded. Great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) have hunted elephant seals near Campbell Island, while bite marks from a southern sleeper shark (Somniosus antarcticus) have been found on surviving elephant seals in the Macquarie Islands.Van Den Hoff, J., & Morrice, M. G. (2008). Sleeper shark (Somniosus antarcticus) and other bite wounds observed on southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) at Macquarie Island. Marine mammal science, 24(1), 239‚Äì247.McMahon, C.

Conservation thumb After their near extinction due to hunting in the 19th century, the total population was estimated at between 664,000 and 740,000 animals in 2005, but as of 2002, two of the three major populations were declining.Perrin, Wursig, and Thewissen, p. 371. The reasons for this are unclear, but are thought to be related to the distribution and declining levels of the seals' primary food sources. Most of their important breeding sites are now protected by international treaty, as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, or by national legislation. Minazo One of the most famous southern elephant seals is Minazo, who lived in Japan's Enoshima Aquarium from when he was a half-year old until his death in 2005 at age 11. Minazo became popular for his signature bucket-holding, tongue-lolling pose. In 2006, Minazo was memorialized by the Japanese noise musician Masami Akita, also known as Merzbow, in a two-volume album, with artwork by Jenny Akita showing Minazo holding his beloved bucket. In 2007, Minazo became the subject of an image macro similar to lolcat called \\"lolrus\\". In his liner notes, Masami Akita suggested Minazo's frequent and demanding performances left him exhausted, contributing ultimately to his death. Akita's intention in celebrating Minazo was to highlight the plight of captive animals used for performance before public audiences. Minazo has also been featured on several T-shirt designs.

Although a fairly new term, financial intelligence has its roots in organizational development research, mostly in the field of employee participation.Lawler, E.E. III (1986). High Involvement Management. Jossey- Bass:San Francisco. Financial intelligence has emerged as a best practice and core competency in many organizations leading to improved financial results, increased employee morale, and reduced employee turnover. Many organizations include financial intelligence programs in their leadership development curriculum. Financial intelligence is not an innate skill, rather it is a learned set of skills that can be developed at all levels.Berman, K., Knight, J., Case, J., (2006). Financial Intelligence: A Managers Guide to Knowing What the Numbers Really Mean. Massachusetts: Harvard Business School Press.  Areas of understanding  The four areas of understanding that make up financial intelligence are: Understanding the foundation. Financial intelligence requires an understanding of the basics of financial measurement including the income statement, the balance sheet, and the cash flow statement. It also requires knowing the difference between cash and profit and why a balance sheet balances. Understanding the art. Finance and accounting are an art as well as a science. The two disciplines must try to quantify what can't always be quantified, and so must rely on rules, estimates, and assumptions. Financial intelligence ensures people are able to identify where the artful aspects of finance have been applied to the numbers, and know how applying them differently might lead to different conclusions. Understanding analysis. Financial intelligence includes the ability to analyze the numbers in greater depth. This includes being able to calculate profitability, leverage, liquidity and efficiency ratios and understanding the meaning of the results. Conducting ROI analysis and interpreting the results are also part of financial intelligence. Understanding the big picture. Financial intelligence also means being able to understand a business's financial results in context - that is, within the framework of the big picture. Factors such as the economy, the competitive environment, regulations and changing customer needs and expectations as well as new technologies all affect how the numbers are interpreted. Financial intelligence is not just theoretical book learning. It also requires practice and real world application. In the corporate world, managers can display financial intelligence by speaking the language, that is, asking questions about the numbers when something doesn't make sense, reviewing financial reports and using the information to understand the company's strengths and weaknesses, using ROI analysis, working capital management, and ratio analysis to make decisions, and identifying where the art of finance has been applied.  Roots of financial intelligence  In 1954, Peter F. Drucker, in his groundbreaking book, The Practice of Management, wrote the following. > \\"[The worker] should know how his work relates to the work of the whole. He > should know what he contributes to the enterprise...if he lacks information, > he will lack both incentive and means to improve his performance.\\" > \\"It is in the best interest of the organization that the worker have the > information.\\" The concept of financial intelligence in organizations comes from the research of several well-known organizational development academics, including Dennis Denison, Edward Lawler and Jeffrey Pfeffer. For example, the research of Lawler, Mohrman and Ledford Lawler, E. E. III, Mohrman, S.A., Ledford, G.E. Jr. (1995)., Creating High Performance Organizations. (1995) Jossey -Bass: San Francisco. found that the indices that have the most impact on both direct performance outcomes in organizations (productivity, customer satisfaction, quality and speed) and on profitability and competitiveness were sharing information and developing knowledge. Karen Berman's research,Karen R. Berman, \\"Information and the Effectiveness of Employee Participation in Organizations\\" (PhD dissertation, California School of Professional Psychology, 1997) asked specifically if information (operationalized by teaching business basics to improve financial intelligence and sharing information on a regular basis) improves the results of employee participation, as seen through organizational performance improvement and employee attitude improvement. The results of the study found that certain financial performance measures improved and that employee turnover decreased. Financial literacy also has its roots in open book management.Case, John. (1995) Open Book Management: The Coming Business Revolution. HarperBusiness:New York A core tenet of open-book management is business literacy, that is, ensuring everyone understands how the business measures financial success.  Financial intelligence in organizations  Many companies, (Southwest Airlines being a prime example) consider financial intelligence a core competency or best practice. Several universities, including Harvard Business School, Wharton and Stanford have programs targeted at the corporate world, mostly at the leadership level, to increase the financial intelligence in organizations. There are a variety of methods to increase financial intelligence in organizations, including classroom training, webinar training, and business simulations. Proponents of financial intelligence in organizations believe that if employees, managers and leaders understand financial information and how financial success is measured, they will make decisions and take action based on an understanding of the financial impact of those decisions. If everyone knows the financial goals of the company, for example, and knows how to make decisions that support those financial goals, then the company is going to be more financially successful.Dolezalek, H, \\"Working Smart\\", Training Magazine, April 2006. Employee owned companies are one group of organizations that are focused on ensuring everyone in the company is financially intelligent, as employees are owners and therefore must understand the financial side of the business.

Hollander Company Building is a building located at 3 East 57th Street near the corner with Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. The structure, completed in 1930, began as a shop for women, as reflected in its delicate and rich design, which features feminine motifs. Its name was changed to the Weber & Heilbroner Building in August 1934. Site The Hollander Building is situated on a plot of land that had been occupied by the Stuyvesant home, a private residence in the 57th Street district. In 1939, the property was owned by Augustus Van Horne Stuyvesant Jr. and the estate of Anne W. Stuyvesant. Upon its 1930 completion, it adjoined the New York Trust Company building at the corner of Fifth Avenue, which had also recently been completed. A structure known as the old Hollander Building stood at 550‚Äì552 Fifth Avenue at this time. Design The structure is composed of a two-story silver-clad base, a shaft made of a series of vertical lines composed of stone, and an upper panel framed horizontally but with the vertical motifs of the shaft. The whole, along with its various portions, are framed in black granite. The edifice possessed a gray, silver, and black color scheme. The silver hue is made up of aluminum metal parts, gray of the limestone mullions, and black of the granite frame. Two small side doors, one for service and another which acted as a fire exit, are utilized as flanking motifs for a primary show window. The doors are plates pierced for light, grilles in reverse. Window backgrounds of the Hollander building are the work of Jock D. Peters, in collaboration with Eleanor Lemaire. Tenants On March 15, 1933, fashion boutique Joseph's opened shops at the Hollander Building. The store was directed by Milton Wolf who had been president of Joseph and Benjamin Pitman, and vice-president of the original L.P. Hollander Company. Joseph's featured a number of small shops assembled under one roof. Their merchandise selection offered items as diverse as swirling gowns for spring, and swanky bags.Display Ad 17--No Title\\", The New York Times, March 12, 1933, pg. F17.

Religion =Ancient Egypt= Egyptian statuette of Osiris with phallus and amulets The phallus played a role in the cult of Osiris in ancient Egyptian religion. When Osiris' body was cut in 14 pieces, Set scattered them all over Egypt and his wife Isis retrieved all of them except one, his penis, which was swallowed by a fish; Isis made him a wooden replacement. The phallus was a symbol of fertility, and the god Min was often depicted as ithyphallic, that is, with an erect penis. Ithyphallic man with a harp, Romano-Egyptian, 3rd‚Äì4th century, Brooklyn Museum =Classical antiquity= Polyphallic wind chime from Pompeii; a bell hung from each phallus Herm In traditional Greek mythology, Hermes, god of boundaries and exchange (popularly the messenger god) is considered to be a phallic deity by association with representations of him on herms (pillars) featuring a phallus. There is no scholarly consensus on this depiction and it would be speculation to consider Hermes a type of fertility god. Pan, son of Hermes, was often depicted as having an exaggerated erect phallus. Priapus is a Greek god of fertility whose symbol was an exaggerated phallus. The son of Aphrodite and Dionysus, according to Homer and most accounts, he is the protector of livestock, fruit plants, gardens, and male genitalia. His name is the origin of the medical term priapism. The city of Tyrnavos in Greece holds an annual Phallus festival, a traditional event celebrating the phallus on the first days of Lent.\\"The Annual Phallus Festival in Greece\\", Der Spiegel, English edition, Retrieved on the 15-12-08 The phallus was ubiquitous in ancient Roman culture, particularly in the form of the fascinum, a phallic charm.R. Joy Littlewood, A Commentary on Ovid: Fasti Book 6 (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 73; T.P. Wiseman, Remus: A Roman Myth (Cambridge University Press, 1995), p. 61 online.Joseph Rykwert, The Idea of a Town: The Anthropology of Urban Form in Rome, Italy, and the Ancient World (MIT Press, 1988), pp. 101 and 159 online. The ruins of Pompeii produced bronze wind chimes (tintinnabula) that featured the phallus, often in multiples, to ward off the evil eye and other malevolent influences. Statues of Priapus similarly guarded gardens. Roman boys wore the bulla, an amulet that contained a phallic charm, until they formally came of age. According to Augustine of Hippo, the cult of Father Liber, who presided over the citizen's entry into political and sexual manhood, involved a phallus. The phallic deity Mutunus Tutunus promoted marital sex. A sacred phallus was among the objects considered vital to the security of the Roman state which were in the keeping of the Vestal Virgins. Sexuality in ancient Rome has sometimes been characterized as \\"phallocentric\\".David J. Mattingly, Imperialism, Power, and Identity: Experiencing the Roman Empire (Princeton University Press, 2011), p. 106. = Ancient India = Traditional flower offering to a Lingam in Varanasi Shiva, the most widely worshipped and edified male deity in the Hindu pantheon, is worshipped much more commonly in the form of the lingam, or the phallus. Evidence of the lingam in India dates back to prehistoric times. Stone Lingams with several varieties of stylized \\"heads\\", or the glans, are found to this date in many of the old temples, and in museums in India and abroad. The famous \\"man-size\\" lingam in the Parashurameshwar Temple in Gudimallam, Chitoor District of Andhra Pradesh known as the Gudimallam Lingam, is about in height, carved in polished black granite. It is one of the existing lingams from the pre-Buddhist period. The almost naturalistic giant lingam is distinguished by its prominent, bulbous \\"glans\\", and an anthropomorphic form of Parashurama carved in high relief on the shaft.Rao, T. A. Gopinatha, Elements Of Hindu Iconography, Vol II Part 1, 1916, Law Printing House, Madras (Chennai), Internet Archive (fully online), p. 65 on; thenewsminute.com Shiva Lingams in India have tended to become more and more stylized over the centuries, and existing lingams from before the 6th century show more leaning towards a naturalistic style, with the glans clearly indicated. The earliest depictions of Shiva as a figure humjan form are ithyphallic, as for example in coins of the Kushan Empire. Some figures up to about the 11th century AD have erect phalluses, although they become increasingly rare.  Etymology of \\"linga\\", or \\"lingam\\"  The word \\"linga\\", while ubiquitous in the Austro-Asiatic world, cannot be seen originally to be occurring in the Indo-European languages. Chakravarti further says that when these two words entered Sanskrit, they, along with another word \\"langula\\" (tail) were derivations of the same root syllable \\"lang\\" or \\"lng\\". If this correlation is accepted on the basis of the obvious phonetic proximity between the three words linga ~ langala ~ langula, then it is not hard to recognize the semantic evolution of the words ‚Äì because the usage of the phallus or the male generative organ in human procreation and the usage of a tool/implement like the ploughshare (langula) to till the earth for its fertility to bring forth life-supporting vegetation have a natural and spontaneous symbolical parallel and similarity to each other. Stone lingams have been found in several Indus Valley Civilization sites, varying in size from 3 feet in length to very small pieces. These are found to be of steatite, sandstone and burnt clay. Some among these are unmistakably naturalistic in their rendition. Phallic worship was prevalent in India from the Chalcolithic period itself, and it was closely associated with magical rites based religion of that time. =Indonesia= According to the Indonesian chronicles of the Babad Tanah Jawi, Prince Puger gained the kingly power from God, by ingesting sperm from the phallus of the already-dead Sultan Amangkurat II of Mataram. =Bhutan= The phallus is commonly depicted in its paintings. =Ancient Scandinavia= Husavik Phallusmuseum (Icelandic Phallological Museum), H√∫sav√≠k *The Norse god Freyr is a phallic deity, representing male fertility and love. *The short story V√∂lsa √æ√°ttr describes a family of Norwegians worshiping a preserved horse penis. *Some image stones, such as the Stora Hammers and T√§ngelg√•rda stones, were phallic shaped. =Japan= The Mara Kannon Shrine (È∫ªÁæÖË¶≥Èü≥) in Nagato, Yamaguchi prefecture is one of many fertility shrines in Japan that still exist today. Also present in festivals such as the Danjiri Matsuri („Å†„Çì„Åò„ÇäÁ•≠)Danjiri Matsuri Festival in Kishiwada, Osaka prefecture, the Kanamara Matsuri, in Kawasaki, and the H≈çnen Matsuri (Ë±äÂπ¥Á•≠ Harvest Festival), in Komaki (Â∞èÁâßÂ∏Ç Komaki-shi), Aichi Prefecture (ÊÑõÁü•Áúå Aichi-ken), though historically phallus adoration was more widespread. =Balkans= Phallus representation, Cucuteni Culture, 3000 BC Kuker is a divinity personifying fecundity, sometimes in Bulgaria and Serbia it is a plural divinity. In Bulgaria, a ritual spectacle of spring (a sort of carnival performed by Kukeri) takes place after a scenario of folk theatre, in which Kuker's role is interpreted by a man attired in a sheep- or goat-pelt, wearing a horned mask and girded with a large wooden phallus. During the ritual, various physiological acts are interpreted, including the sexual act, as a symbol of the god's sacred marriage, while the symbolical wife, appearing pregnant, mimes the pains of giving birth. This ritual inaugurates the labours of the fields (ploughing, sowing) and is carried out with the participation of numerous allegorical personages, among which is the Emperor and his entourage.Kernbach, Victor (1989). Dic≈£ionar de Mitologie GeneralƒÉ. Bucure≈üti: Editura ≈ûtiin≈£ificƒÉ ≈üi EnciclopedicƒÉ. . =Switzerland= The bear on the arms of Portein, Switzerland has a clearly visible red phallus, in accordance with the long- held tradition. In Switzerland, the heraldic bears in a coat of arms had to be painted with bright red penises, otherwise they would have been mocked as being she-bears. In 1579, a calendar printed in St. Gallen omitted the genitals from the heraldic bear of Appenzell, nearly leading to war between the two cantons. =The Americas= Figures of Kokopelli and Itzamna (as the Mayan tonsured maize god) in Pre-Columbian America often include phallic content. Additionally, over forty large monolithic sculptures (Xkeptunich) have been documented from Terminal Classic Maya sites with the majority of examples occurring in the Puuc region of Yucat√°n (Amrhein 2001). Uxmal has the largest collection with eleven sculptures now housed under a protective roof on site. The largest sculpture was recorded at Almuchil measuring more than 320 cm high with a diameter at the base of the shaft measuring 44 cm.Amrhein, Laura Marie (2001). An Iconographic and Historic Analysis of Terminal Classic Maya Phallic Imagery. Unpublished PhD dissertation, Richmond: Virginia Commonwealth University. =Alternative sects= St. Priapus Church (French: √âglise S. Priape) is a North American new religion that centres on the worship of the phallus. Founded in the 1980s in Montreal, Quebec, by D. F. Cassidy, it has a following mainly among homosexual men in Canada and the United States. Semen is also treated with reverence and its consumption is an act of worship.J. Gordon Melton (1996, 5th ed.). Encyclopedia of American Religions (Detroit, Mich.: Gale) p. 952. Semen is esteemed as sacred because of its divine life-giving power. Psychoanalysis Phallic-Head Plate, Gubbio, Italy, 1536 The symbolic version of the phallus, a phallic symbol is meant to represent male generative powers. According to Sigmund Freud's theory of psychoanalysis, while males possess a penis, no one can possess the symbolic phallus. Jacques Lacan's Ecrits: A Selection includes an essay titled The Signification of the Phallus in which sexual differentiation is represented in terms of the difference between \\"being\\" and \\"having\\" the phallus, which for Lacan is the transcendent signifier of desire. Men are positioned as men insofar as they wish to have the phallus. Women, on the other hand, wish to be the phallus. This difference between having and being explains some tragicomic aspects of sexual life. Once a woman becomes, in the realm of the signifier, the phallus the man wants, he ceases to want it, because one cannot desire what one has, and the man may be drawn to other women. Similarly, though, for the woman, the gift of the phallus deprives the man of what he has, and thereby diminishes her desire. In Gender Trouble, Judith Butler explores Freud's and Lacan's discussions of the symbolic phallus by pointing out the connection between the phallus and the penis. She writes, \\"The law requires conformity to its own notion of 'nature'. It gains its legitimacy through the binary and asymmetrical naturalization of bodies in which the phallus, though clearly not identical to the penis, deploys the penis as its naturalized instrument and sign\\". In Bodies that Matter, she further explores the possibilities for the phallus in her discussion of The Lesbian Phallus. If, as she notes, Freud enumerates a set of analogies and substitutions that rhetorically affirm the fundamental transferability of the phallus from the penis elsewhere, then any number of other things might come to stand in for the phallus. Modern use of the phallus The phallus is often used to advertise pornography, as well as the sale of contraception. It has often been used in provocative practical jokes and has been the central focus of adult- audience performances. The phallus had a new set of art interpretations in the 20th century with the rise of Sigmund Freud, the founder of modern psychoanalysis of psychology. One example is \\"Princess X\\"Philamuseum.org by the Romanian modernist sculptor Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi. He created a scandal in the Salon in 1919 when he represented or caricatured Princess Marie Bonaparte as a large gleaming bronze phallus. This phallus likely symbolizes Bonaparte's obsession with the penis and her lifelong quest to achieve vaginal orgasm. page 66f, page 73 See also the Most Phallic Building contest for examples of phallic architecture.

Featuring interviews, commentary, and award-winning dramas from the perspective of Judaism, it began on radio in 1944 and continued as a weekly radio program through 1989. A 1946 program, for example, dramatized humanitarian Lilian Wald's founding of New York City's Henry Street Settlement in 1895. The May 31, 1959 program featured a tour of the Holy Land narrated by Ralph Bellamy. Beginning in 1952, The Eternal Light was also televised by NBC as part of its Sunday morning religious programming, along with Frontiers of Faith (produced in conjunction with the National Council of Churches) and The Catholic Hour. By the mid-1950s, the program had an audience of more than six million weekly on radio and television. Milton E. Krents (1912‚Äì2000) was executive producer of The Eternal Light radio program for 44 years. NBC television's director for The Eternal Light, along with its other Sunday morning televised religious programs, was Martin Hoade (1916‚Äì2006). The program's editor was Moshe Davis of the Jewish Theological Seminary, who explained its purpose to a New York Times interviewer: \\"The common man is always the hero in our show. We try to put a contemporary subject in a concept of eternity.\\" NBC donated the air time and the Jewish Theological Seminary budgeted the show's production expenses. Spurning potential sponsorship offers, Davis told one persistent business executive, \\"My good man, God needs no sponsor\\". Among the notables appearing on the series were Alan Arkin, Joseph Cotten, Joan Crawford, Mel Ferrer, Sam Levene, E. G. Marshall, Raymond Massey, Alexander Scourby, Maureen Stapleton, Elie Wiesel, and Gene Wilder. The program won numerous awards, including two Emmy Awards and many Emmy nominations and Peabody Awards in 1962, 1967, and 1973.

Besides the natural variability of human penises in general, there are factors that lead to minor variations in a particular male, such as the level of arousal, time of day, room temperature, and frequency of sexual activity. Compared to other primates, including large examples such as the gorilla, the human penis is thickest, both in absolute terms and relative to the rest of the body. Measurements vary, with studies that rely on self-measurement reporting a significantly higher average than those with a health professional measuring. , a systematic review of 15,521 men, and the best research to date on the topic, as the subjects were measured by health professionals, rather than self-measured, has concluded that the average length of an erect human penis is 13.12 cm (5.17 inches) long, while the average circumference of an erect human penis is 11.66 cm (4.59 inches). Flaccid penis length can sometimes be a poor predictor of erect length. Most human penis growth occurs between infancy and the age of five, and between about one year after the onset of puberty and, at latest, approximately 17 years of age. A statistically significant correlation between penis size and the size of other body parts has not been found in research. Some environmental factors in addition to genetics, such as the presence of endocrine disruptors, can affect penis growth. An adult penis with an erect length of less than , but otherwise formed normally, is referred to in medicine as a micropenis. Studies Distribution of penis sizes by length. 45% of erect penises are between 12 and 14 cm long. Distribution of penis sizes by circumference. 81% of erect penises (green) are between 10 and 13 cm in circumference. While results vary slightly across reputable studies, the consensus is that the mean human penis, when erect, is in the range in length. A 2015 systematic review published by Veale et al. of medical research on the topic over the previous 30 years published in BJU International showed similar results, giving mean flaccid, stretched non-erect, and erect lengths of 9.16 cm, 13.24 cm, and 13.12 cm respectively, and mean flaccid and erect circumferences of 9.31 cm and 11.66 cm respectively. Erect lengths in the included studies were measured by pushing the pre-pubic fat pad to the bone, and flaccid or erect girth (circumference) was measured at the base or mid- shaft of the penis. =Length= Flaccid One study found the mean flaccid penis length to be (measured by staff). A review of several studies found average flaccid length to be . Length of the flaccid penis does not necessarily correspond to length of the erect penis; some smaller flaccid penises grow much longer, while some larger flaccid penises grow comparatively less. The penis and scrotum can contract involuntarily in reaction to cold temperatures or nervousness, referred to by the slang term \\"shrinkage\\", due to action by the cremaster muscle. The same phenomenon affects cyclists and exercise bike users, with prolonged pressure on the perineum from the bicycle saddle and the straining of the exercise causing the penis and scrotum to contract involuntarily. An incorrect saddle may ultimately cause erectile dysfunction (see crotch pressure for more information). Stretched Neither age nor size of the flaccid penis accurately predicted erectile length. Stretched length has correlated with erect length in some cases. However, studies have also shown drastic differences between stretched and erect length. One study found that a minimal tension force of approximately 450 g during stretching of the penis was required to reach a full potential erection length. this study also found that tension forces exerted in this study by the urologist were shown to be significantly (P<0.01) lower than 450g. This may account for differences between stretched and erect length. *The 2015 study of 15,521 men, found that the average length of a stretched flaccid penis was 13.24 cm (5.21 inches) long, which is near identical to the average length of an erect human penis which is 13.12 cm (5.17 inches) long. *An 2001 study of about 3,300 men published in European Urology concluded that flaccid stretched length was measured on average to about . In addition, they checked for correlations in a random subset of the sample consisting of 325 men. They found a few statistically significant Spearman's correlations: between flaccid length and height of 0.208, ‚àí0.140 with weight, and ‚àí0.238 with BMI, flaccid circumference and height 0.156, stretched length and height 0.221, weight ‚àí0.136, BMI ‚àí0.169. They also reported a few non-significant correlations. Erect Scientific studies have been performed on the erect length of the adult penis. Studies that have relied on self-measurement, including those from Internet surveys, consistently reported a higher average length than those that used medical or scientific methods to obtain measurements. The following staff-measured studies are composed of different subgroups of the human population (in other words, specific age range or race; selection of those with sexual medical concerns or self-selection) that could cause a sample bias. *In a study of 80 healthy males published in the September 1996 Journal of Urology an average erect penis length of was measured. The purpose of the study was to \\"provide guidelines of penile length and circumference to assist in counseling patients considering penile augmentation.\\" Erection was pharmacologically induced in 80 physically normal American men (varying ethnicity, average age 54). It was concluded: \\"Neither patient age nor size of the flaccid penis accurately predicted erectile length.\\" *A study published in the December 2000 International Journal of Impotence Research found that average erect penis length in 50 Jewish Caucasian males was (measured by staff). The study intended \\"to identify clinical and engineering parameters of the flaccid penis for prediction of penile size during erection.\\" Erection was pharmacologically induced in 50 Jewish Caucasian patients who had been evaluated for erectile dysfunction (ED) (average age 47¬±14y). Patients with penis abnormalities or whose ED could be attributed to more than one psychological origin were omitted from the study. *A review published in the 2007 issue of BJU International showed the average erect penis length to be and girth to be . The paper compared results of twelve studies conducted on different populations in several countries. Various methods of measurements were included in the review. *An Indian study of 500 men ages 18 to 60 published in the International Journal of Impotence Research found flaccid, stretched and erect length to be , and , respectively. *A Korean study (published in 1971) of 702 men ages 21 to 31 identified the average erect penile length to be . Another study (from 1998) of 150 Koreans found the average erect penile length to be . A third study (published in 1999) of 279 Korean males found the average erect penile length to be . The most recent study (published in 2016) of 248 Korean men identified the average erect penile length to be . =Erect circumference= Similar results exist regarding studies of the circumference of the adult fully erect penis, with the measurement usually taken mid-shaft. As with length, studies that relied on self-measurement consistently reported a significantly higher average than those with staff measuring. In a study of penis size where measurements were taken in a laboratory setting, the average penis circumference when erect was 11.66 cm (4.59 inches). =Size at birth= The average stretched penile length at birth is about , and 90% of newborn boys will be between . Limited growth of the penis occurs between birth and 5 years of age, but very little occurs between 5 years and the onset of puberty. The average size at the beginning of puberty is with adult size reached about 5 years later. W.A. Schonfeld published a penis growth curve in 1943. =Size with ageing= Authors of a paper reviewing research on area of penis sizes conclude that \\"flaccid penile length is just under at birth and changes very little until puberty, when there is marked growth.\\" Age is not believed to negatively correlate with penis size. \\"Individual research studies have... suggested that penis size is smaller in studies focusing on older men, but Wylie and Eardley found no overall differences when they collated the results of various studies [over a 60 year period].\\" =Size and height= A 2015 review of the literature found two studies finding height and stretched or flaccid length to be moderately correlated, seven studies finding weak correlation for flaccid, stretched, or erect length, and two studies that found no correlation between flaccid length and height. =Size and hands= One study investigated the relationship with digit ratio and found that men with longer ring fingers than index fingers had slightly longer penises. However, the common misconception that hand size predicts penis size has been widely discredited. =Size and other body parts= A statistically significant correlation between penis size and the size of other body parts has not been found in research. One study, Siminoski and Bain (1988), found a weak correlation between the size of the stretched penis and foot size and height; however, it was too weak to be used as a practical estimator. Another investigation, Shah and Christopher (2002), which cited Siminoski and Bain (1988), failed to find any evidence for a link between shoe size and stretched penis size, stating \\"the supposed association of penile length and shoe size has no scientific basis\\". There may be a link between the malformation of the genitalia and the human limbs. The development of the penis in an embryo is controlled by some of the same Hox genes (in particular HOXA13 and HOXD13) as those that control the development of the limbs. Mutations of some Hox genes that control the growth of limbs cause malformed genitalia (hand-foot-genital syndrome). =Size and race= The belief that penis size varies according to race is not supported by scientific evidence. A 2005 study reported that \\"there is no scientific background to support the alleged 'oversized' penis in black people\\". A study of 253 men from Tanzania found that the average stretched flaccid penis length of Tanzanian males is 11 cm (4.53 inches) long, smaller than the worldwide average, stretched flaccid penis length of 13.24 cm (5.21 inches), and average erect penis length of 13.12 cm (5.17 inches). A recent 2016 study of 248 Korean men identified the average erect penile length to be . A study of 115 men from Nigeria found that the average flaccid stretched penis length of Nigerian males is 13.37 cm (5.26 inches) long, which is near identical to the worldwide average, stretched flaccid penis length of 13.24 cm (5.21 inches) and average erect penis length of 13.12 cm (5.17 inches). A 2015 systematic review of 15,521 men found \\"no indications of differences in racial variability\\", and stated that it was not possible to draw any conclusions about size and race from the available literature and that further research needed to be conducted. According to Aaron Spitz, a urologist, many websites and studies promoting variation of penis size between races use unscientific methods of collecting information and often ignore contradictory evidence. He concludes that \\"when you really take a good look at the naked data, there‚Äôs not a whole lot there [showing racial variation in penis size].\\" =Size preferences among sexual partners= In a small study conducted by University of Texas‚ÄìPan American and published in BMC Women's Health, 50 undergraduate women were surveyed by two popular male athletes on campus about their perceptions of sexual satisfaction and it was concluded that the width of a penis feels better than the length of a penis, when subjects are asked to choose between the two (size was left unspecified). It was also concluded that this may show that penis size overall affects sexual satisfaction since women chose between the two options they were given. In a cover story by Psychology Today, 1,500 readers (about two-thirds women) were surveyed about male body image. Many of the women were not particularly concerned with penis size, and over 71% thought men overemphasized the importance of penis size and shape. Generally, the women polled cared more about width than men thought, and less about length than men thought, although the strength of caring for either among women showed a similar pattern. Another study, conducted at Groningen University Hospital, asked 375 sexually active women (who had recently given birth) the importance of penis size the results of which showed that 21% of women felt length was important and 32% felt that girth was important. A study conducted at the Australian National University, published in early 2013, showed that penis size influences a man's sex appeal, and the taller the man, the bigger the effect. The study showed 3D computer generated images at life- size, altering the height and other physical attributes, with women typically registering preferences in under 3 seconds. A preference for taller men's larger penis size was notable. A U.S. study published in 2015 of the stated preferences of a panel of 75 women using 3D-printed models as scale references showed a preferred penis length of 16 cm and a preferred circumference of 12.2 cm for long-term sexual partners, with slightly larger preferred sizes of a length of 16.3 cm and circumference of 12.7 cm for one-time sexual encounters. =Condom use= One Australian study of 184 men looked at penis length and circumference in relationship to condom breakage or slippage. 3,658 condoms were used. The study found that when used correctly, condoms had a breakage rate of 1.34% and a slippage rate of 2.05%, for a total failure rate of 3.39%. Penile dimensions did not influence slippage, although penis circumference and broken condoms were strongly correlated, with larger sizes increasing the rate of breakage. Biochemistry Androgens like testosterone are responsible for penis enlargement and elongation during puberty. Penis size is positively correlated with increasing testosterone levels during puberty. But after puberty, administration of testosterone does not affect penis size, and androgen deficiency in adult men only results in a small decrease in size. Growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) are also involved in penis size, with deficiency (such as that observed in growth hormone deficiency or Laron syndrome) at critical developmental stages having the potential to result in micropenis. Variance =Genetics= There are certain genes, like homeobox (Hox a and d) genes, which may have a role in regulating penis size. In humans, the AR gene, located on the X chromosome at Xq11-12, may affect penis size. The SRY gene located on the Y chromosome may have a role to play. Variance in size can often be attributed to de novo mutations. Deficiency of pituitary growth hormone or gonadotropins or mild degrees of androgen insensitivity can cause small penis size in males and can be addressed with growth hormone or testosterone treatment in early childhood. =Conditions= An adult penis with an erect length of less than 7 cm or 2.76 inches but otherwise formed normally is referred to in a medical context as having the micropenis condition. \\"Whereas the average size of the human penis is around 12.5 cm or 5 inches, a micropenis spans less than 7 cm or just over two inches.\\" The condition affects 0.6% of men. Some of the identifiable causes are deficiency of pituitary growth hormone or gonadotropins, mild degrees of androgen insensitivity, a variety of genetic syndromes and variations in certain homeobox genes. Some types of micropenis can be addressed with growth hormone or testosterone treatment in early childhood. Operations are also available to increase penis size in cases of micropenis in adults. Measuring erect micropenis =Environmental influence= It has been suggested that differences in penis size between individuals are caused not only by genetics, but also by environmental factors such as culture, diet and chemical or pollution exposure. Endocrine disruption resulting from chemical exposure has been linked to genital deformation in both sexes (among many other problems). Chemicals from both synthetic (e.g., pesticides, anti- bacterial triclosan, plasticizers for plastics) and natural (e.g., chemicals found in tea tree oil and lavender oil) sources have been linked to various degrees of endocrine disruption. Both PCBs and the plasticizer DEHP have been associated with smaller penis size. DEHP metabolites measured from the urine of pregnant women have been significantly associated with the decreased penis width, shorter anogenital distance and the incomplete descent of testicles of their newborn sons, replicating effects identified in animals. Approximately 25% of US women have phthalate levels similar to those in the study. A 2007 study by the University of Ankara, Faculty of Medicine found that penile size may decrease as a result of some hormonal therapy combined with external beam radiation therapy. In addition, some estrogen-based fertility drugs like diethylstilbestrol (DES) have been linked to genital abnormalities or a smaller than normal penis (microphallus). A 2016 Korean study found that newborn male circumcision is associated with shorter penile length. Historical perceptions =Prehistory and early civilizations= Perceptions of penis size are culture-specific. Some prehistoric sculptures and petroglyphs depict male figures with exaggerated erect penises. Ancient Egyptian cultural and artistic conventions generally prevented large penises from being shown in art, as they were considered obscene, but the scruffy, balding male figures in the Turin Erotic Papyrus are shown with exaggeratedly large genitals. The Egyptian god Geb is sometimes shown with a massive erect penis and the god Min is almost always shown with an erection. =Antiquity= The ancient Greeks believed that small penises were ideal. Scholars believe that most ancient Greeks probably had roughly the same size penises as most other Europeans, but Greek artistic portrayals of handsome youths show them with inordinately small, uncircumcised penises with disproportionately large foreskins, indicating that these were seen as ideal. Large penises in Greek art are reserved exclusively for comically grotesque figures, such as satyrs, a class of hideous, horse-like woodland spirits, who are shown in Greek art with absurdly massive penises. Actors portraying male characters in ancient Greek comedy wore enormous, fake, red penises, which dangled underneath their costumes; these were intended as ridiculous and were meant to be laughed at. In Aristophanes's comedy The Clouds, \\"Mr. Good Reason\\" gives the character Pheidippides a description of the ideal youth: \\"A glistening chest and glowing skin / Broad shoulders, a small tongue /A mighty bottom and a tiny prong.\\" In Greek mythology, Priapus, the god of fertility, had an impossibly large penis that was always permanently erect. Priapus was widely seen as hideous and unattractive. A scholion on Apollonius of Rhodes's Argonautica states that, when Priapus's mother Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty, gave birth to him, she was so horrified by the size of his penis, his massive potbelly, and his huge tongue that she abandoned him to die in the wilderness. A herdsman found him and raised him as his son, later discovering that Priapus could use his massive penis to aid in the growth of plants. Nonetheless, there are indications that the Greeks had an open mind about large penises. A statue of the god Hermes with an exaggerated penis stood outside the main gate of Athens and in Alexandria in 275 BC, a procession in honor of Dionysus hauled a 180-foot phallus through the city and people venerated it by singing hymns and reciting poems. The Romans, in contrast to the Greeks, seem to have admired large penises and large numbers of large phalli have been recovered from the ruins of Pompeii. Depictions of Priapus were very popular in Roman erotic art and literature. Over eighty obscene poems dedicated to him have survived. Penis size is alluded to in the Bible: > 18When she carried on her whoring so openly and flaunted her nakedness, I > turned in disgust from her, as I had turned in disgust from her sister.19Yet > she increased her whoring, remembering the days of her youth, when she > played the whore in the land of Egypt20and lusted after her lovers there, > whose members were like those of donkeys, and whose issue was like that of > horses. , English Standard Version. Ancient Chinese legend holds that a man named Lao Ai had the largest penis in history and that he had an affair with Queen Dowager Zhao ( 280‚Äì228 BC), the mother of Qin Shi Huang, by pretending to be a eunuch. Ancient Koreans admired large penises and King Jijeung (437‚Äì514 AD) of the Silla Dynasty is said to have had a forty-five-centimeter penis that was so large his subordinates had to search for a woman that fit him. Traditional Japanese erotic paintings usually show genitals as exaggeratedly large. The oldest known painting of this type, found in the H≈çry≈´-ji Temple in Ikaruga, dates to the eighth century AD and depicts a fairly large penis. The ancient Indian sexual treatise Kama Sutra, originally written in Sanskrit, probably between the second and fourth centuries AD, divides men into three classes based on penis size: \\"hare\\" size (5‚Äì7 cm when erect), \\"bull\\" size (10‚Äì15 cm), and \\"horse\\" size (18‚Äì20 cm). The treatise also divides women's vaginas into three sizes (\\"deer\\", \\"mare\\", and \\"elephant\\") and advises that a man match the size of the vagina of the woman he is having sex with to the size of his own penis. It also gives medically dubious advice on how to enlarge one's penis using wasp stings. =Middle Ages and Renaissance= Angelo Bronzino shows a codpiece peeking from underneath the young man's jacket. Larger codpieces were regarded as more fashionable. In medieval Arabic literature, a longer penis was preferred, as described in an Arabian Nights tale called \\"Ali with the Large Member\\". As a witty satire of this fantasy, the 9th-century Afro-Arab author Al-Jahiz wrote: \\"If the length of the penis were a sign of honor, then the mule would belong to the Quraysh\\" (the tribe to which Muhammad belonged and from which he descended). The medieval Norsemen considered the size of a man's penis as the measure of his manliness, and a thirteenth-century Norse magic talisman from Bergen, a wooden stave inscribed with writing in runic script, promises its wearer: \\"You will fuck Rannveig the Red. It will be bigger than a man's prick and smaller than a horse's prick.\\" A late fourteenth century account of the life of Saint √ìl√°fr from the Flateyjarb√≥k describes a pagan ritual, which centered around a preserved horse's penis used as a cult artifact, which members of the cult would pass around in a circle, making up verses in praise of it, encouraging it and the other members of the group to behave in sexually suggestive ways. During the Renaissance, some men in Europe began to wear codpieces, which accentuated their genitals. There is no direct evidence that it was necessarily worn to enhance the apparent size of the wearer's penis, but larger codpieces were seen as more fashionable. Contemporary perceptions Sign in South Africa advertising penis enlargement =Male self-perception= Males may quite easily underestimate the size of their own penis relative to those of others. A survey by sexologists showed that many men who believed that their penis was of inadequate size had average-sized penises.\\"Men Worry More About Penile Size Than Women, Says 60-Year-Old Research Review\\". ScienceDaily. 31 May 2007. Another study found sex education of standard penile measurements to be helpful and relieving for patients concerned about small penis size, most of whom had incorrect beliefs of what is considered medically normal.Education The Best Treatment For Penis Size Concerns. Altpenis.com (11 July 2005). Retrieved on 2013-04-07. The perception of having a large penis is often linked to higher self-esteem. Fears of shrinking of the penis in folklore have led to a type of mass hysteria called penis panic, though the penis legitimately can shrink in size due to scar tissue formation in the penis from a medical condition called Peyronie's disease.Peyronie's disease. Mayo Clinic Marketers of penis enlargement products exploit fears of inadequacy, but there is no consensus in the scientific community of any non-surgical technique that permanently increases either the thickness or length of the erect penis that already falls into the normal range. =Shrinking and enlarging= Widespread private concerns related to penis size have led to a number of folklore sayings and popular culture reflections related to penis size. Penis panic is a form of mass hysteria involving the believed removal or shrinking of the penis, known as genital retraction syndrome. The penis can significantly shrink due to scar tissue formation from a condition called Peyronie's disease which affects up to 10% of men. Products such as penis pumps, pills, and other dubious means of penis enlargement are some of the most marketed products in email spam. At present there is no consensus in the scientific community of any non-surgical technique that permanently increases either the thickness or length of the erect penis that already falls into the normal range (4.5\\" to 7\\"). =Among male homosexuals= A study undertaken at Utrecht University found that the majority of homosexual men in the study regarded a large penis as ideal, and having one was linked to self-esteem. One study analysing the self-reported Kinsey data set found that the average penis of a homosexual man was larger than the average penis of their heterosexual counterparts (6.32 inches [16.05 cm] in length amongst gay men versus 5.99 in [15.21 cm] in heterosexuals, and 4.95 inches [12.57 cm] circumference amongst gay men versus 4.80 in [12.19 cm] in heterosexual men). Evolution The human penis is thicker than that of any other primate, both in absolute terms and relative to the rest of the body. Early research, based on inaccurate measurements, concluded that the human penis was also longer. In fact, the penis of the common chimpanzee is no shorter than in humans, averaging 14.4 cm (5.7 inches), and some other primates have comparable penis sizes relative to their body weight. The evolutionary reasons for the increased thickness have not been established. One explanation is that thicker penises are an adaptation to a corresponding increase in vaginal size. The vaginal canal is believed to have expanded in humans to accommodate the larger size of a newborn's skull. Women may then have sexually selected men with penises large enough to fit their vagina, to provide sexual stimulation and ensure ejaculation.

Priapus is marked by his oversized, permanent erection, which gave rise to the medical term priapism. He became a popular figure in Roman erotic art and Latin literature, and is the subject of the often humorously obscene collection of verse called the Priapeia. Relationship with other deities Priapus was described in varying sources as the son of Aphrodite by Dionysus; as the son of Dionysus and Chione;Scholia on Theocritus, 1. 21 as perhaps the father or son of Hermes;Kerenyi, Gods of the Greeks, 1951, p. 175, noting G.

The Oxford Companion to World Mythology. David Leeming. Oxford University Press, 2004. According to legend, Hera cursed him with inconvenient impotence (he could not sustain an erection when the time came for sexual intercourse), ugliness and foul-mindedness while he was still in Aphrodite's womb, in revenge for the hero Paris having the temerity to judge Aphrodite more beautiful than Hera.An elaboration on a scholium on Apollonius of Rhodes' Argonautica i. Kereny remarks of the jealousy of Hera in this case, \\"a cheap theme, and certainly not an ancient one\\" (Kerenyi 1951, p.176). The other gods refused to allow him to live on Mount Olympus and threw him down to Earth, leaving him on a hillside. He was eventually found by shepherds and was brought up by them. Priapus joined Pan and the satyrs as a spirit of fertility and growth, though he was perennially frustrated by his impotence. In a ribald anecdote told by Ovid,Ovid, Fasti, vi.319ff he attempted to rape the goddess Hestia but was thwarted by an ass, whose braying caused him to lose his erection at the critical moment and woke Hestia. The episode gave him a lasting hatred of asses and a willingness to see them destroyed in his honour.\\"Priapus.\\" Who's Who in Classical Mythology, Routledge. 2002. The emblem of his lustful nature was his permanent erection and his large penis. Another myth states that he pursued the nymph Lotis until the gods took pity on her and turned her into a lotus plant.\\"Priapus.\\" Bloomsbury Dictionary of Myth. 1996. Worship and attributes Mercury in a fresco found at Pompeii Bronze Bust of Priapus, Roman 100 BC found in the Villa di Papiri in Herculaneum The first extant mention of Priapus is in the eponymous comedy Priapus, written in the 4th century BC by Xenarchus. Originally worshipped by Greek colonists in Lampsacus in Asia Minor, the cult of Priapus spread to mainland Greece and eventually to Italy during the 3rd century BC.Robert Christopher Towneley Parker. \\"Priapus\\". The Oxford Classical Dictionary. Ed. Simon Hornblower and Anthony Spawforth. Oxford University Press 2003. Lucian (De saltatione) tells that in Bithynia Priapus was accounted as a warlike god, a rustic tutor to the infant Ares, \\"who taught him dancing first and war only afterwards,\\" Karl Kerenyi observed.Kerenyi, Gods of the Greeks, 1951, p. 154, also pp. 175‚Äì77. Arnobius is aware of the importance accorded Priapus in this region near the Hellespont.In ridiculing the literal aspects of pagan gods given human form, he mentions \\"the Hellespontian Priapus bearing about among the goddesses, virgin and matron, those parts ever prepared for encounter.\\" (Arnobius, Seven Books against the Heathen III.10 (on-line text). Also, Pausanias notes: In later antiquity, his worship meant little more than a cult of sophisticated pornography.Mark P.O. Morford, Robert J. Lenardon, Michael Sham. (2011, 9th ed.). \\"Classical Mythology\\" (New York, NY.: Oxford University Press) Outside his \\"home\\" region in Asia Minor, Priapus was regarded as something of a joke by urban dwellers. However, he played a more important role in the countryside, where he was seen as a guardian deity. He was regarded as the patron god of sailors and fishermen and others in need of good luck, and his presence was believed to avert the evil eye.\\"Priapus.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2007 Priapus does not appear to have had an organized cult and was mostly worshiped in gardens or homes, though there are attestations of temples dedicated to the god. His sacrificial animal was the ass, but agricultural offerings (such as fruit, flowers, vegetables and fish) were also very common. Long after the fall of Rome and the rise of Christianity, Priapus continued to be invoked as a symbol of health and fertility. The 13th century Lanercost Chronicle, a history of northern England and Scotland, records a \\"lay Cistercian brother\\" erecting a statue of Priapus (simulacrum Priapi statuere) in an attempt to end an outbreak of cattle disease.Yves Bonnefoy, Roman and European Mythologies, pp. 139‚Äì142. University of Chicago Press, 1992. In the 1980s, D. F. Cassidy founded the St. Priapus Church as a modern church centred on worship of the phallus.J. Gordon Melton (1996, 5th ed.). Encyclopedia of American Religions (Detroit, Mich.: Gale) p. 952.Andy Nyberg, \\"St. Priapus Church: The Organized Religion\\", The Advocate, Sep. 1983, pp. 35‚Äì37. Depictions Gallo-Roman bronze statuette (ca 1st century AD) of Priapus (or a Genius cucullatus?) discovered in Picardy, northern France, made in two parts, with the top section concealing a giant phallus. Priapus' iconic attribute was his priapism (permanently erect penis); he probably absorbed some pre-existing ithyphallic deities as his cult developed. He was represented in a variety of ways, most commonly as a misshapen gnome-like figure with an enormous erect phallus. Statues of Priapus were common in ancient Greece and Rome, standing in gardens. The Athenians often conflated Priapus with Hermes, the god of boundaries, and depicted a hybrid deity with a winged helmet, sandals, and huge erection. Another attribute of Priapus was the sickle which he often carries in his right hand. This too was used to threaten thieves, doubtless with castration:deMause, Lloyd (ed.) (1976), The History of Childhood, p. 46.For the sickle used for the castration of sacrificial animals, see Burkert, Walter (1983) Homo Necans: The Anthropology of Ancient Greek Ritual and Myth, translated by Peter Bing, p. 68, quoting Martial 3.24. Horace (Sat. 1.8.1‚Äì7) writes:Moul, V. A. (2016). \\"The Source for Priapus in Cowley‚Äôs Ode ‚ÄúTo The Royal Society‚Äù (1667)\\", p. 3. :Olim truncus eram ficulnus, inutile lignum, cum faber, incertus scamnum faceretne Priapum, maluit esse deum. deus inde ego, furum aviumque maxima formido; nam fures dextra coercet obscenoque ruber porrectus ab inguine palus; ast importunes volucres in vertice harundo terret fixa vetatque novis considere in hortis. :\\"Once I was a trunk of fig, a useless piece of wood, when a carpenter, unsure whether he should make a bench or a Priapus, decided to make a god. So I am a god, of thieves and birds a very great scarer; for my right hand curbs thieves, as does the red pole which projects from my indecent groin; but as for the importunate birds, the reed fixed on my head terrifies them and forbids them to settle in the new gardens.\\" A number of epigrams, apparently written as if to adorn shrines of Priapus, were collected in the Priapeia. In these, Priapus frequently threatens sexual assault against potential thieves:Craig A. Williams, Roman Homosexuality: Ideologies of Masculinity in Classical Antiquity, p. 21. Oxford University Press US, 1999. :Percidere, puer, moneo; futuere, puella; barbatum furem tertia poena manet. :\\"I warn you, boy, you will be screwed; girl, you will be laid with; a third penalty awaits the bearded thief.\\" :Femina si furtum faciet mihi virve puerve, haec cunnum, caput hic praebeat, ille nates. :\\"If a woman steals from me, or a man, or a boy, let the first give me her cunt, the second his head, the third his buttocks.\\" :per medios ibit pueros mediasque puellas mentula; barbatis non-nisi summa petet. :\\"My dick will go through the middle of boys and the middle of girls, but with bearded men it will aim only for the top.\\" A number of Roman paintings of Priapus have survived. One of the most famous images of Priapus is that from the House of the Vettii in Pompeii. A fresco depicts the god weighing his phallus against a large bag of coins. In nearby Herculaneum, an excavated snack bar has a painting of Priapus behind the bar, apparently as a good-luck symbol for the customers. In literature As well as the collection known as the Priapeia mentioned above, Priapus was a frequent figure in Latin erotic or mythological verse. In Ovid's Fasti,Fasti, 6.319ff. the nymph Lotis fell into a drunken slumber at a feast, and Priapus seized this opportunity to advance upon her. With stealth he approached, and just before he could embrace her, Silenus's donkey alerted the party with \\"raucous braying\\". Lotis awoke and pushed Priapus away, but her only true escape was to be transformed into the lotus tree. To punish the donkey for spoiling his opportunity, Priapus bludgeoned it to death with his gargantuan phallus. In later versions of the story, Lotis is replaced with the virginal goddess Hestia. Ovid's anecdote served to explain why donkeys were sacrificed to Priapus in the city of Lampsacus on the Hellespont, where he was worshipped among the offspring of Hermes.Hyginus, Fabulae, 160. Priapus is repeatedly mentioned in Petronius's Satyricon. William Arrowsmith, in the introduction and notes to his translation of the work, draws parallels between his hounding of the protagonist and that of Poseidon in Homer's Odyssey. Priapus is mentioned in Geoffrey Chaucer's \\"The Merchant's Tale\\", part of The Canterbury Tales. During a description of a garden that the protagonist, Januarie, creates, Priapus is invoked in his form as God of gardens: > Ne Priapus ne myghte nat suffise, Though he be God of gardyns, for to telle > The beautee of the gardyn and the welle, That stood under a laurer alwey > grene.G. Chaucer, The Merchant's Prologue and Tale, (Cambridge University > Press, Cambridge, 2006), p63 (Priapus might not suffice, Though he be god of > gardens, to tell Of the beauty of the garden and the well That stood under > the laurel, always green.) Priapus serves to remind the reader, or listening audience, that Januarie's intentions are driven by lust and not love. Priapus is mentioned in Pericles, Prince of Tyre, which was partially written by William Shakespeare. A brothel owner referred to as a 'Bawd' says that Pericles' daughter Marina is \\"able to freeze the god Priapus, and undo a whole generation.\\" Priapus is mentioned in William Carlos Williams's poem \\"Paterson\\". Priapus is also mentioned in John Steinbeck's East of Eden: \\"She conducted her house like a cathedral dedicated to a sad but erect Priapus.\\" Priapus is referred to in Henry Miller's 1939 novel Tropic of Capricorn, in a passage railing against society's refusal to talk about sex as an act of pleasure. T.S. Eliot refers to Priapus in his poem \\"Mr. Appolinax\\" (published in Prufrock and Other Observations, 1920): > When Mr. Apollinax visited the United States His laughter tinkled among the > teacups. I thought of Fragilion, that shy figure among the birch-trees, And > of Priapus in the shrubbery Gaping at the lady in the swing. Priapus is also mentioned in Vladimir Nabokov's Invitation to a Beheading: \\"Or when you, with eyes closed tight, devouring a spurting peach and then, having finished, but still swallowing, with your mouth still full, you cannibal, your glazed eyes wandered, your fingers were spread, your inflamed lips were all glossy, your chin trembled, all covered with drops of the cloudy juice, which trickled down onto your bared bosom, while the Priapus who had nourished you suddenly, with a convulsive oath, turned his back to me, who had entered the room at the wrong moment.\\" Priap[us] is mentioned as well in Nabokov's Lolita: \\"She was the loveliest nymphet green-red-blue Priap himself could think up\\". He's mentioned in Jack Kerouac's novel On the Road: \\"He wrote of Dean as a 'child of the rainbow' who bore his torment in his agonized priapus.\\"  Patron of merchant sailing  Priapus' role as a patron god for merchant sailors in ancient Greece and Rome is that of a protector and navigational aide. Recent shipwreck evidence contains apotropaic items carried on board by mariners in the forms of a terracotta phallus, wooden Priapus figure, and bronze sheath from a military ram. Coinciding with the use of wooden Priapic markers erected in areas of dangerous passage or particular landing areas for sailors, the function of Priapus is much more extensive than previously thought.Neilson III, Harry R. 2002. \\"A terracotta phallus from Pisa Ship E: more evidence for the Priapus deity as protector of Greek and Roman navigators.\\" The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology 31.2: 248‚Äì253. Although Priapus is commonly associated with the failed attempts of rape against the nymphs Lotis and Vesta in Ovid's comedy FastiFantham, Elaine. 1983. \\"Sexual Comedy in Ovid's Fasti: Sources and Motivation.\\" Harvard Studies in Classical Philology 87: 185. and the rather flippant treatment of the deity in urban settings, Priapus' protection traits can be traced back to the importance placed on the phallus in ancient times (particularly his association with fertility and garden protection). In Greece, the phallus was thought of to have a mind of its own, animal-like, separate from the mind and control of the man.Csapo, Eric. 1997. \\"Riding the Phallus for Dionysus: Iconology, Ritual, and Gender-Role De/Construction.\\" Phoenix 51.3/4: 260. The phallus is also associated with \\"possession and territorial demarcation\\" in many cultures, attributing to Priapus' other role as a navigational deity.

Nominated for three Emmys during his 35-year career with NBC (1949-1984), Balderson won an Emmy in 1977 for \\"Outstanding Individual Achievement\\", in recognition of his work on NBC's The First 50 Years special program. Early years Born near Montross, Virginia, in 1926 as the youngest of nine children, Balderson attended Washington and Lee High School there until 1944, when he joined the Navy during World War II. After serving aboard the destroyer USS George K. MacKenzie in 1945-1946, he studied radio and television engineering at Central Technical Institute in Kansas City, Missouri. Broadcasting career Balderson began his broadcasting career in 1949 as an engineer with NBC owned- and-operated radio station WRC-AM in Washington, D. C. Desiring to be a part of the nascent television industry at the network level, he moved in 1950 to NBC's New York City headquarters studios at 30 Rockefeller Plaza to work as an engineer and cameraman, spanning news, entertainment, and sports programming. In addition to such New York-originated live entertainment shows of the period as Milton Berle's Texaco Star Theater, Balderson covered news events such as the inauguration of Dwight D. Eisenhower as President of the U.S. in 1953, and was selected to be the sole pool cameraman inside the White House for Ike's meeting with outgoing President Harry S. Truman on Inauguration Day. Balderson later recalled the occasion in a newspaper interview: \\"I think this was probably my greatest thrill. I was feeding pictures to NBC, CBS, ABC. The only thing that concerned me was that something might happen to the camera. \\" With the beginning of color television in the early 1950s, Balderson was cameraman for the Bob Hope Special, the first NBC color broadcast after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) formally approved the compatible color system developed by NBC's then-owner, RCA. He later recalled that the gigantic RCA TK-40 and TK-41 color cameras required more than an hour to set up and were comparatively unstable, making frequent adjustment necessary to maintain correct registration of the red, green, and blue primary colors. These cameras also required complicated control consoles and rack-mounted power supplies for the camera's many vacuum tubes and ventilator fans cooling their large image orthicon tubes. During his career with NBC, Balderson covered every Democratic and Republican convention between 1952-1984\\\\. In the mid-1960s, he flew with President Lyndon B. Johnson across the Pacific Ocean, covering LBJ's Vietnam War visit to that war-torn southeast Asian country. Beginning in the 1960s, Balderson was chief videotape editor for the Huntley-Brinkley Report and later worked with NBC News Department's anchormen John Chancellor and Tom Brokaw as videotape editor of the Nightly News. He once described the two hours before the live network telecast as \\"very hectic, there's a lot of running around and hollering. Sometimes we go right up to 6:29 pm before the package is ready to televise at 6:30 pm.\\" Among his notable video engineering assignments for NBC were such New York-originated programs as the Perry Como Show, The Tonight Show starring Steve Allen and then Jack Paar followed by Johnny Carson, and the celebrated Bell Telephone Hour during network television's \\"Golden Age\\". Balderson engineered NBC's first electronically edited show, Kraft Music Hall. He also edited the popular quiz show Twenty One for its two-year run (1956-1958), which was later exposed as fixed during the quiz show scandals of the late 1950s. Balderson subsequently told a newspaper reporter that although he was video tape editor for the program's entire run, he \\"had no idea it was rigged\\". He described producer Dan Enright standing next to him in the control room once becoming enraged when contestant Charles Van Doren missed an answer (which Enright had supplied in advance to assure Van Doran's winning). Only after the scandal was later revealed did Balderson realize the true reason for Enright's anger. Balderson was one of the first editors to use videotape for instant replay in sports events televised by NBC in the early 1960s. He was tapped as on-location videotape editor by NBC for many of the network's premier sports events during the 1960s-1980s, including baseball's World Series, NFL and college football, and the 1972 Winter Olympics from Sapporo, Japan. Awards Balderson garnered three Emmy nominations during his 35-year career with NBC and in 1977 won the Emmy for \\"Outstanding Individual Achievement\\" for editing NBC's 50th anniversary special in 1976, \\"The First 50 Years\\". In 1973, he was nominated for an Emmy for outstanding achievement in videotape editing of NBC Nightly News. He was also Emmy-nominated for his work on The Eternal Light, an acclaimed NBC Sunday morning religious program. Later years After retirement from NBC in 1984, Balderson moved from New York to Florida, where he currently lives in Clearwater.

Early life and education Earl Larkin Williams was born August 22, 1903. He received his A.B. in 1924 and his A.M. a year later, both from Swarthmore College. He also studied at the University of Pennsylvania, Ohio State University, and the University of Michigan. Career In addition to working at The George Washington University, Williams held positions as an Instructor in Mathematics and Astronomy at Muhlenberg College (1925‚Äì26), Instructor of Astronomy at Ohio State University (1920‚Äì1931) and Assistant Professor of Astronomy at Denison University for one semester in 1931. Beyond his employment as a professor, Williams also held a position as the Assistant Latitude Observer of U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey operating an observatory at Gaithersburg, Md. from 1932 to 1941. He was a member of the American Astronomical Society, the International Astronomical Union, the American Geophysical Union, Gamma Alpha, Sigma Xi (associate), and Pi Delta Epsilon. Earl Larkin Williams wrote a few newspaper articles in 1941 on total solar eclipse expeditions. He also wrote in the Transactions of the International Astronomical Union in 1935 On the Instrumental Adjustment of a Zenith Telescope, in which he proposed a new method of offsetting the effect of flexure by making the middle thread of the telescope follow the meridian precisely at all zenith distances. Williams was appointed as an Associate of Mathematics at The George Washington University in 1941. In 1945, he became a Lecturer in Mathematics until 1948. He again became an Associate of Mathematics from 1948 through 1949. Williams then became and remained a Lecturer in Mathematics from 1949 until his resignation from the university January 31, 1955. Death and afterward According to the obituary in the Washington Post, Williams died on February 7, 1974 and was buried in the Gartner Sandison Funeral Home in Maryland. Because Earl Larkin Williams was only employed by The George Washington University for fourteen years and only as a Lecturer and Associate in Mathematics, there is a limited knowledge about his accomplishments. Williams is mentioned in the 1946 Cherry Tree Yearbook as a member of the math faculty and he is mentioned in the 1946 George Washington University Bulletin. The only information on Williams‚Äô achievements at George Washington is found in his personal records in the archives section of the library. Marriage and children Williams married Helen Ball Shawaker on June 9, 1931 in Columbus, Ohio. Helen was born May 12, 1905 in Columbus, Franklin County, Ohio. She died March 29, 1972 in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Helen was the daughter of Frank Albert Schauweker. Helen and Earl had four children: Judith Jane, Keith, Linda A. and Greg.

He was a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. Career Hoffmann joined the military service of the Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) on 1 April 1912 as a Seekadett (midshipman) and took his first ship training on the cruiser . On 1 April 1913 he underwent further training at the Naval Academy M√ºrwik and on 12 April 1913 was promoted to F√§hnrich zur See (ensign at sea). Battleship Scharnhorst, 1939 He relinquished command of the Coastal Artillery School and was appointed commander of the light cruiser on 27 June 1939. After the outbreak of World War II, he initially remained in command of K√∂nigsberg. On 21 September 1939 he took over command from Kapit√§n zur See Otto Ciliax of the battleship Scharnhorst. Scharnhorsts first operation began on 21 November 1939 lasting until 27 November 1939. Accompanied by her sister , the light cruiser , and nine destroyers, Scharnhorst patrolled the area between Iceland and the Faroe Islands. The intent of the operation was to draw out British units and ease the pressure on the heavy cruiser , which was being pursued in the South Atlantic. Two days later, the German flotilla, under the command of Admiral Wilhelm Marschall aboard Gneisenau, intercepted the auxiliary cruiser . At 16:07, lookouts aboard Scharnhorst spotted the British vessel, and less than an hour later Scharnhorst had closed the range. At 17:03, Scharnhorst opened fire, and three minutes later a salvo of her 28 cm guns hit Rawalpindis bridge, killing the captain and the majority of the staff. During the brief engagement, Rawalpindi managed to score a hit on Scharnhorst, which caused minor splinter damage. Rawalpindi was sunk within 40 minutes. After this Hoffmann remained at the helm of the Scharnhorst until after the \\"Channel Dash\\" in February 1942, thus captaining the ship through Operation Weser√ºbung, Operation Juno and Operation Berlin. On 28 March 1942 Hoffmann became the commanding Admiral of the German Navy in the Baltic and was promoted to Konteradmiral on 1 April. From 1 July 1942 until 4 March 1943 he was the commanding naval officer of the German Navy in the Netherlands. On being promoted to Vizeadmiral on 1 April 1943, Hoffmann became the head of department for artillery development and construction in the naval armaments office of the German Navy. On 23 May 1945, after the collapse of Germany, Hoffmann was arrested by British forces but released on 20 February 1947. Hoffmann joined the newly formed West German Navy (Marine), and from 26 June 1956 to 31 August 1957 was first deputy head of the Maritime Office Hamburg, thereafter head of administration until his retirement on 31 March 1965.

They lived after Serapion of Alexandria, and before Menodotus, and therefore lived in the 2nd or 1st century BC.Galen, Introd., c. 4. vol. xiv. One of them is probably the physician called Apollonius Empiricus; the other may be Apollonius Senior. *Apollonius Archistrator, was the author of a medical prescription quoted by Andromachus,ap. Galen, De Compos. Medicam. sec. Gen., v. 12, vol. xiii. and must therefore have lived in or before the 1st century BC. Nothing is known about the events of his life. *Apollonius Biblas, lived probably in the 2nd century BC, and wrote, after Zeno's death, a book in answer to a work he composed on the meaning of certain marks (charakteres) that are found at the end of some chapters in the third book of the Epidemics of Hippocrates.Galen, Comm. II, in Hippocr. Epid. III., 5, vol. xvii. It seems likely that he is not the same person as Apollonius Empiricus. His name is probably connected with the word bibliakos, and suggests that he was a \\"book worm\\". *Apollonius Cittensis, (or Apollonius of Citium), 1st century BC, the oldest commentator on Hippocrates whose works are still extant. See Apollonius of Citium. *Apollonius Claudius, must have lived in or before the 2nd century AD, as one of his antidotes is quoted by Galen.Galen, De Antid., ii. 11, vol. xiv. Nothing is known of his life. *Apollonius Cyprius, (or Apollonius of Cyprus), was the pupil of Olympicus, and the tutor to Julianus. He was a native of Cyprus, belonged to the Methodic school, and probably lived in the 1st century AD.Galen, De Meth. Med., i. 7, vol. x. Nothing more is known of his life. *Apollonius Empiricus, perhaps one of the physicians called Apollonius Antiochenus. He lived, according to Celsus,Celsus, De Med., i. praef. after Serapion of Alexandria, and before Heraclides of Tarentum, and therefore probably lived in the 2nd century BC. He belonged to the Empiric school, and like Apollonius Biblas, wrote a book in answer to Zeno's work on the marks (charakteres) in Hippocrates. This was answered by Zeno, and it was this second work that drew from Apollonius Biblas his treatise on the subject after Zeno's death.Galen, Comm. II. in Hipp. Epid. III., 5, vol. xvii. He is also mention by Galen.Galen, De Meth. Med., ii. 7, vol. x. *Apollonius Glaucus, must have lived in or before the 2nd century AD, as his work On Internal Diseases is quoted by Caelius Aurelianus.Caelius Aurelianus, De Morb. Chron., iv. 8 Nothing is known of his life. *Apollonius Herophileius, is perhaps the same person as Apollonius Mus. He wrote a pharmaceutical work entitled Peri Euporiston, (),Galen, De Compos. Medicam. sec. Loc., vi. 9, vol. xii. and of which some fragments are quoted in Cramer's Anecd. Graeca Paris, as still existing in manuscript in the Royal Library in Paris. He lived earlier than Andromachus who quotes him,ap Galen, De Compos. Medicam. sec. Loc., vol. xiii. and also before Archigenes;Galen, ibid., vol. xii. hence he may have lived in or before the 1st century BC. He was a follower of Herophilus, and is said by Galen to have lived for some time at Alexandria. His work, Peri Myron, On Ointments, is quoted by Athenaeus,Athenaeus, xv. 688 and he is also mentioned by Caelius Aurelianus.Caelius Aurelianus, De Morb. Acut., ii. 28 *Apollonius Hippocraticus, is said by Galen,Galen, De Secta Opt., c. 14, vol. i.; Comment. III. in Hippocr. De Rat. Vict. in Morb. Ac., c. 38, vol. xv. to have been a pupil of Hippocrates, and must therefore have lived in the 4th century BC. He is blamed by Erasistratus for his excessive severity in restricting the quantity of drink allowed to his patients.Erasistratus ap. Galen, l. c. *Apollonius Memphites (or Apollonius of Memphis), was born at Memphis in Egypt, and was a follower of Erasistratus.Galen, Introd., c. 10, vol. xiv. He must therefore have lived around the 3rd century BC, and is probably the same person as Apollonius Stratonicus. He wrote a work On the Names of the Parts of the Human Body,Galen, l. c., and Definit., prooem., vol. xix. and is quoted by Erotianus,Erotianus, Gloss. Hipp. Galen,Galen, De Antid. ii., 14, vol. xiv. Nicolaus Myrepsus,Nicolaus Myrepaus, De Aur., cc. 11, 16 and other ancient writers. *Apollonius Mus, a follower of Herophilus. Nothing is known about his life, but he must have lived in the 1st century BC, as Strabo mentions him as a contemporary.Strabo, xiv. 1 He was a fellow-pupil of Heraclides of Erythrae, and composed a long work on the opinions of the sect founded by Herophilus.Caelius Aurelianus, De Morb. Acut., ii. 13; Galen, De Differ. Puls., iv. 10, vol. viii. He also wrote on pharmacy,Celsus, De Med., v. praef; Pallad. Comm. in Hipp. Epid. VI; Galen, De Antid., ii. 7, 8, vol. xiv. and is perhaps the same person as Apollonius Herophileius. *Apollonius Ophis, is said by Erotianus, to have made a compilation from the Glossary of difficult Hippocratic words by Bacchius; he must therefore have lived about the 2nd or 1st century BC. He may be the same person as Apollonius Pergamenus, or Apollonius Ther. *Apollonius Organicus, is quote by Galen,Galen, De Compos. Medicam. sec. Loc., v. 15, vol. xiii. and must therefore have lived in or before the 2nd century AD. Nothing is known of his life. *Apollonius Pergamenus (or Apollonius of Pergamon), is perhaps the same person as Apollonius Ophis, or Apollonius Ther. He was born at Pergamon in Mysia, but his date is uncertain; he is quoted by Oribasius, and must have lived before the 4th century AD.Oribasius, Eupor. ad Eun., i. 9 He is probably the author of a long extract on Scarification preserved by Oribasius.Oribasius, Med. Coll., vii. 19, 20 *Apollonius Pitaneus (or Apollonius of Pitane), was born at Pitane in Aeolia, and must have lived in to before the 1st century AD, as an absurd and superstitious remedy is attributed to him by Pliny.Pliny, H. N., xxix. 38 *Apollonius Senior, is quoted by Erotianus, and must therefore have lived in or before the 1st century AD. He may be one of the physicians called Apollonius Antiochenus. *Apollonius Stratonicus, was probably not the son, but the pupil, of Strato of Beryta. He is likely the same person as Apollonius Memphites, and may have lived about the 3rd century BC. He was a follower of Erasistratus, and wrote a work on the Pulse, which is quoted by Galen.Galen, De Differ. Puls., iv. 17, vol. viii. *Apollonius Tarensis (or Apollonius of Tarsus), was born at Tarsus in Cilicia, and lived perhaps in the 1st or 2nd century AD. His prescriptions are several times quoted by Galen.Galen, De Compos. Medicam. sec. Gen., v. 13, vol. xiii. *Apollonius Ther, is perhaps the same person as Apollonius Ophis or Apollonius Pergamenus. He is quoted by Erotianus, and must have lived in or before the 1st century AD. Another physician of this name, who is mentioned by Apuleius,Apuleis, Met., ix. init. as having been bitten by a mad dog, must (if he ever really existed) have lived in the 2nd century AD.

Positioned in the centre ground of Mexican politics, it drew ideologically from both social and economic liberalism. The party was formed as the conservative wing of the former Liberal Party which in the early twentieth century had splintered into more radical factions, represented by the PLM. The Party was originally founded in 1909 as the National Anti-Reelectionist Party (Spanish: Partido Nacional Antirreeleccionista) and was rebranded in 1911 as the PCP. The guiding principle of the party was constitutionalism, seeking to reestablish the supremacy of the Federal Constitution of 1857 and the rule of law after thirty years of dictatorship of General Porfirio D√≠az. The PCP was also a liberal progressive party which sought to pragmatically introduce some moderate social reforms in order to quench the thirst for justice of a country that was already at the threshold of a social revolution. The ideas of the Party were established in The Presidential Succession in 1910, a best-selling book published in 1909 by Francisco I. Madero, the scion of one of the wealthiest families in Mexico. Francisco I. Madero, the founder and ideologue of the Progressive Constitutionalists, became the first democratically-elected President of Mexico, governing between 1911 and his assassination in 1913. After the triumph of Francisco I. Madero to the Presidency of the Republic and Jos√© Mar√≠a Pino Su√°rez to the Vice Presidency of the Republic in the 1911 presidential elections, the PCP exercised executive power in Mexico between 1911 and 1913. In this same period, their candidates were elected in several local and municipal elections. Between 1912 and 1913, the PCP also had a majority in the Congress of the Union. In February 1913, during the events of the Ten Tragic Days, a military coup erupted that overthrew the Madero government, effectively interrupting the observation of the Federal Constitution of 1857. When the rule of law was restored with the Federal Constitution of 1917, the PCP did not regroup. Notwithstanding the foregoing, several former party members would play a leading role in the formation of a post-revolutionary order after the Mexican Revolution. Like the Liberal Party before it, the PCP was also the victim of a splinter. One faction believed that under Madero's leadership the PCP had become far too conservative, failing to appeal to the social demands of the Revolution. They decided to found a new party: the Liberal Constitutionalist Party () (PLC). Under the leadership of Venustiano Carranza, the PLC leaned closer towards the Centre- left ground of politics, effectively positioning themselves as social democrats. In 1929, the PLC merged to form part of the National Revolutionary Party () (PNR), the governing party which held uninterrupted power in the country between 1929 to 2000. Another faction, led by Jos√© Vasconcelos, felt that the PNR had become too authoritarian and had betrayed the conservative liberalism and constitutionalist principles espoused by Madero and the PCP. During the 1929 presidential elections, widely believed to be fraudulent, Jos√© Vasconcelos briefly revived the National Anti-Reelectionist Party, deciding to stand as a presidential candidate against Pascual Ortiz Rubio, the government candidate. Ten years after the arrest and subsequent exile of Vasconcelos, Manuel G√≥mez Mor√≠n, one of his closest collaborators, founded the centre-right National Action Party () (PAN), which would become the main opposition party. After the triumph of Vicente Fox during the 2000 presidential election, he became the first opposition president since the Revolution, culminating Mexico¬¥s democratic transition, as originally envisioned by Madero.

History When GIS first became widely available in the 1980s and 1990s, the only source of geographic data for China was paper maps. Several universities elected to undertake the huge task of digitizing this information so that other researchers could use it. The two earliest projects were conducted by The Australian Consortium for the Asian Spatial Information and Analysis Network (ACASIAN) at Griffith University and the China Data Center at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. ACASIAN specialized solely in spatial coverages while the China Data Center included GIS coverages as a supplemented to their primary mission of providing Chinese statistical and census data. There is a great deal of high quality GIS data being produced in China by both government organizations and private companies. Today, China's National Spatial Data Infrastructure Project, uses the WGS84 standard. In 1991, China's first color Map Editing and Publication System, MapCAD. In 1995, China's first National Advanced GIS Software, Computer based GIS, MapGIS.

China has now more than 500 institutions of higher learning training GIS- related professionals, of which more than 200 universities and colleges have established a GIS lab.ÊàëÂõΩ200Â§öÊâÄÈ´òÊ†°Âª∫Á´ãÂú∞ÁêÜ‰ø°ÊÅØÁ≥ªÁªüÂÆûÈ™åÂÆ§ Industry The GIS industry in China is worth 400 billion yuan per annum as of November 2007. More than 300,000 people were involved in either building or using these systems, according to Zondy Cyber Group president Wu Xincai, who is also the president of the China Association for Geographic Information System. Almost 20,000 enterprises are estimated to have engaged in the industry. The biggest vendor of GIS in China is Zondy Cyber Group, followed by SuperMap. Around 2000 of these have GIS as a core discipline or function. The industry's rapid expansion is attributed to the country's economic development, which has led to an increase in capital input, from both government and businesses. Between 2001 and 2005 the Ministry of Information Industry allocated more than 20 million yuan to fund the development and application of GIS. GIS has been put to use in many spheres, including land survey, mineral exploitation, water conservancy and environmental protection. It also has applications in power generation, mapping, telecommunication, and the management of public administration and public services.

Sewage from areas of Dubai not connected to the municipal piped network at the time was collected daily from thousands of holding tanks across the city and driven by tankers to the city's only sewage treatment plant at Al-Awir. Because of the long queues and delays, several tanker drivers resorted to illegally dumping the raw sewage into storm drains or behind dunes in the desert resulting in much controversy. The result of sewage dumped into storm drains was that it flowed directly into the Persian Gulf, near to the city's prime swimming beaches. Doctors warned that tourists using the beaches ran the risk of contracting serious illnesses like typhoid and hepatitis. Dubai's municipality says that it is committed to trying to catch the culprits and has imposed fines of up to $25,000 as well as threatening to confiscate tankers if dumping persists. The municipality maintains that test results show samples of the water are \\"within the standard\\". In 2013 it was reported that the Jebel Ali plant receives 70% of sewage through the city's sewage network, while the remaining 30% comes from sewage trucks.

It is named after American entertainer Barbra Streisand, whose attempt to suppress the California Coastal Records Project's photograph of her residence in Malibu, California, taken to document California coastal erosion, inadvertently drew further attention to it in 2003. Attempts to suppress information are often made through cease-and-desist letters, but instead of being suppressed, the information receives extensive publicity, as well as media extensions such as videos and spoof songs, which can be mirrored on the Internet or distributed on file-sharing networks. The Streisand effect is an example of psychological reactance, wherein once people are aware that some information is being kept from them, they are significantly more motivated to access and spread that information. Origin of the term Mike Masnick of Techdirt coined the term in 2005 in relation to a holiday resort issuing a takedown notice to urinal.net (a site dedicated to photographs of urinals) over use of the resort's name. The term alluded to Barbra Streisand, who in 2003 had sued photographer Kenneth Adelman and Pictopia.com for violation of privacy. The US$50 million lawsuit endeavored to remove an aerial photograph of Streisand's mansion from the publicly available collection of 12,000 California coastline photographs. Adelman photographed the beachfront property to document coastal erosion as part of the California Coastal Records Project, which was intended to influence government policymakers.Link includes lawsuit filings. Streisand was ordered to pay $177,107.54 in court and legal fees. The site has an image of the $155,567.04 check Streisand paid for Adelman's legal fees. Before Streisand filed her lawsuit, \\"Image 3850\\" had been downloaded from Adelman's website only six times; two of those downloads were by Streisand's attorneys.Tentative ruling, page 6, stating, \\"Image 3850 was download six times, twice to the Internet address of counsel for plaintiff\\". In addition, two prints of the picture were ordered‚Äîone by Streisand's counsel and one by Streisand's neighbor. As a result of the case, public knowledge of the picture increased greatly; more than 420,000 people visited the site over the following month. The lawsuit was dismissed and Streisand was ordered to pay Adelman's legal fees, which amounted to $155,567.Streisand v. Adelman, et al., in California Superior Court; Case SC077257 Examples =In politics= military radio station of Pierre-sur-Haute in 2013, and call it \\"classified\\", the article became the most viewed page on French Wikipedia. In November 2007, Tunisia blocked access to YouTube and Dailymotion after material was posted depicting Tunisian political prisoners. Activists and their supporters then started to link the location of then-President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's palace on Google Earth to videos about civil liberties in general. The Economist said this \\"turned a low-key human-rights story into a fashionable global campaign\\". The French intelligence agency DCRI's deletion of the French-language Wikipedia article about the military radio station of Pierre-sur-HauteCommuniqu√© from the Wikimedia Foundation, April 6, 2013 resulted in the article temporarily becoming the most-viewed page on the French Wikipedia. A 2013 libel suit by Theodore Katsanevas against a Greek Wikipedia editor resulted in members of the project bringing the story to the attention of journalists. The government of South Africa stated their intention to ban the 2017 book The President's Keepers, detailing corruption within the government of Jacob Zuma. This caused sales of the book to spike dramatically, causing the book to sell out within 24 hours before the ban would supposedly be put into effect. This made the book a national best seller and led to multiple reprints. In February 2018, Anne Applebaum wrote in The Washington Post about the Polish Holocaust law, which would have criminalized blaming Poles for the Holocaust. She argued that the Streisand effect would draw more attention to aspects of history that the Polish government preferred to suppress. A 2018 study of millions of individual responses of Chinese social media users found that sudden censorship of information by the Chinese government and its affiliates often led to mass backlashes, including newfound popularity of VPNs and the subsequent reviewing of entire topic lists on which censored subjects appear. Other researchers found that the backlash tended to result in permanent changes to political attitudes and behaviors. A 2019 study of political imprisonment by the government of Saudi Arabia found that while the incarceration tended to deter individual dissidents from further dissent, it strongly emboldened their social media followers, led to a sharp increase in calls for political reform, and resulted in an increase in online dissent and physical in-person protests overall, including criticism of the ruling family and calls for regime change. Such repression draws public attention to the imprisoned dissidents and their causes, and did not deter other prominent figures in Saudi Arabia from continuing to dissent online. In March 2019, California Representative Devin Nunes filed a defamation lawsuit against Twitter and three users for US$250 million in damages. One user named in the lawsuit, the parody account @DevinCow (Name: Devin Nunes‚Äô cow), had 1,200 followers before the lawsuit. The number of followers of @DevinCow soon jumped to 600,000 followers. In August 2020, it was reported that the Chinese government had blanked out parts of its Baidu mapping platform, and that this could be used to find a network of buildings bearing hallmarks of prisons and internment camps. In October of 2020, the New York Post published emails purporting to be from a laptop owned by Presidential Candidate Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden, detailing an alleged corruption scheme. In response, Twitter blocked the story from their platform and locked the accounts of those who shared a link to the article, including the New York Post's own Twitter account, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany, among others. Researchers at MIT cited the increase of 5.5 thousand shares every 15 minutes to about 10 thousand shares shortly after Twitter censored the story as evidence of the Streisand Effect nearly doubling the attention the story received. =By businesses= In April 2007, a group of companies that used Advanced Access Content System (AACS) encryption issued cease-and-desist letters demanding that the system's 128-bit (16-byte) numerical key (represented in hexadecimal as 09 F9 11 02 9D 74 E3 5B D8 41 56 C5 63 56 88 C0) to be removed from several high-profile websites, including Digg. With the numerical key and along with some software, it was possible to decrypt the video content on new DVDs. This led to the key's proliferation across other sites and chat rooms in various formats, with one commentator describing it as having become \\"the most famous number on the Internet\\". Within a month, the key had been reprinted on over 280,000 pages, had been printed on T-shirts and tattoos, and had appeared on YouTube in a song played over 45,000 times. In September 2009, multi-national oil company Trafigura obtained a super- injunction to prevent The Guardian newspaper from reporting on an internal Trafigura investigation into the 2006 Ivory Coast toxic waste dump scandal. A super-injunction prevents reporting on even the existence of the injunction. Using parliamentary privilege, Labour MP Paul Farrelly referred to the super- injunction in a parliamentary question, and on October 12, 2009, The Guardian reported that it had been gagged from reporting on the parliamentary question, in violation of the 1689 Bill of Rights. Blogger Richard Wilson correctly identified the blocked question as referring to the Trafigura waste dump scandal, after which The Spectator suggested the same. Not long after, Trafigura began trending on Twitter, helped along by Stephen Fry's retweeting the story to his followers. Twitter users soon tracked down all details of the case, and by October 16, the super-injunction had been lifted and the report published. In November 2012, Casey Movers, a Boston moving company, threatened to sue a woman in Hingham District Court for libel in response to a negative Yelp review. The woman's husband wrote a blog post about the situation, which was then picked up by Techdirt and Consumerist. By the end of the week, the company was reviewed by the Better Business Bureau, which later revoked its accreditation. In December 2013, YouTube user ghostlyrich uploaded video proof that his Samsung Galaxy S4 battery had spontaneously caught fire. Samsung had demanded proof before honoring its warranty. Once Samsung learned of the YouTube video, it added additional conditions to its warranty, demanding ghostlyrich delete his YouTube video, promise not to upload similar material, officially absolve the company of all liability, waive his right to bring a lawsuit, and never make the terms of the agreement public. Samsung also demanded that a witness cosign the settlement proposal. When ghostlyrich shared Samsung's settlement proposal online, his original video drew 1.2 million views in one week. In August 2014, it was reported that Union Street Guest House in Hudson, New York, had a policy that \\"there will be a $500 fine that will be deducted from your deposit for every negative review of USGH [Union Street Guest House] placed on any Internet site by anyone in your party and/or attending your wedding or event.\\" The policy had been used in an attempt to suppress an unfavorable November 2013 Yelp review. Thousands of negative reviews of the policy were posted to Yelp and other review sites. In September 2018, The Verge, an American technology news and media network operated by Vox Media, published an article titled \\"How to Build a Custom PC for Editing, Gaming or Coding\\" and uploaded a video to YouTube titled \\"How we Built a $2000 Custom Gaming PC\\", which was widely criticized for its numerous factual errors and instructions that would have been harmful or dangerous to both the computer and user if followed. In February 2019, Vox Media started issuing DMCA takedown notices to YouTube channels which posted content using clips from the video, most notably to technology channels Bitwit and ReviewTechUSA, bringing further attention to the video and the related content they attempted to suppress. After an outcry following the decision, YouTube reinstated these two videos, along with retracting the copyright \\"strikes\\" applied. On 20 February 2020, Apple filed a legal complaint against the sales of the German-language book App Store Confidential, written by a former German App Store manager, Tom Sadowski. Apple cited confidential business information as the reason for requesting the sales ban. However, the publicity brought on by the media caused the book to reach number two on the Amazon bestseller list in Germany. The book was soon on its second print run. =By other organizations= In January 2008, The Church of Scientology's attempts to get Internet websites to delete a video of Tom Cruise speaking about Scientology resulted in the creation of Project Chanology. On December 5, 2008, the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) added the English Wikipedia article about the 1976 Scorpions album Virgin Killer to a child pornography blacklist, considering the album's cover art \\"a potentially illegal indecent image of a child under the age of 18\\". The article quickly became one of the most popular pages on the site, and the publicity surrounding the IWF action resulted in the image being spread across other sites. The IWF was later reported on the BBC News website to have said \\"IWF's overriding objective is to minimise the availability of indecent images of children on the Internet, however, on this occasion our efforts have had the opposite effect\\". This effect was also noted by the IWF in its statement about the removal of the URL from the blacklist. In June 2012, Argyll and Bute Council banned a nine-year-old primary school pupil from updating her blog, NeverSeconds, with photos of lunchtime meals served in the school's canteen. The blog, which was already popular, started receiving a large number of views due to the international media furor that followed the ban. Within days, the council reversed its decision under immense public pressure and scrutiny. After the reversal of the ban, the blog became more popular than it was before. =By individuals= In May 2011, Premier League footballer Ryan Giggs sued Twitter after a user revealed that Giggs was the subject of an anonymous privacy injunction (informally referred to as a \\"super-injunction\\") that prevented the publication of details regarding an alleged affair with model and former Big Brother contestant Imogen Thomas. A blogger for the Forbes website observed that the British media, which were banned from breaking the terms of the injunction, had mocked the footballer for not understanding the effect. Dan Sabbagh from The Guardian subsequently posted a graph detailing‚Äîwithout naming the player‚Äîthe number of references to the player's name against time, showing a large spike following the news that the player was seeking legal action. Similar situations involving super- injunctions in England and Wales have occurred, one involving Jeremy Clarkson. Since January 2016 a celebrity (later revealed outside England and Wales to be David Furnish) used the injunction granted in PJS v News Group Newspapers to prevent media in England and Wales reporting events that have been featured in Scottish media and on the Internet. A satirical play, Two Brothers and the Lions, was written by French playwright H√©di Tillette de Clermont-Tonnerre, about two wealthy British people who live in a castle on the Channel Island of Brecqhou, \\"who become cold, selfish monsters in the heart of our democratic societies\\". In reality the billionaire Barclay brothers, owners of the Daily Telegraph newspaper amongst other holdings, live in a castle on the island; David Barclay sued the playwright in France for defamation and invasion of privacy, although the Barclays were not named in the play. The playwright's lawyer described the play as \\"a satirical fable on capitalism\\". Tillette de Clermont-Tonnerre acknowledged that the play was partly inspired by the lives of the brothers, but defended his right to freedom of expression and said the play had been commissioned to explore the issue of the continued existence of mediaeval Norman law in the Channel Islands, while ruminating on the nature and future of capitalism. In July 2019 Barclay lost the case, though was considering an appeal. The play had been obscure and only played in small theatres, though critically acclaimed; after the lawsuit performances were scheduled in cities across France. The Guardian newspaper asserts that Bret Stephens, an American journalist, in 2019 achieved \\"as close to the perfect Streisand effect as one could imagine\\" by writing an email of complaint to David Karpf, a political scientist whose tweet describing Stephens as a \\"bedbug\\" had had insignificant interest; Stephens also sent the email to the provost of George Washington University where Karpf works as a professor of media and public affairs. Stephens was widely mocked on Twitter, deleted his Twitter account, and the story was picked up by the world's media. The Streisand effect has been observed in relation to the right to be forgotten, as a litigant attempting to remove information from search engines risks the litigation itself being reported as valid, current news.

Giurgea coined the term nootropic in 1972. Nootropic characteristics He stated that nootropic drugs should have the following characteristics: # They should enhance learning and memory. # They should enhance the resistance of learned behaviors/memories to conditions which tend to disrupt them (e.g. electroconvulsive shock, hypoxia). # They should protect the brain against various physical or chemical injuries (e.g. barbiturates, scopalamine). # They should increase the efficacy of the tonic cortical/subcortical control mechanisms. # They should lack the usual pharmacology of other psychotropic drugs (e.g. sedation, motor stimulation) and possess very few side effects and extremely low toxicity.

Before its acquisition by Wells Fargo and Company in 2008, Wachovia was the fourth-largest bank holding company in the United States, based on total assets. Wachovia provided a broad range of banking, asset management, wealth management, and corporate and investment banking products and services. At its height, it was one of the largest providers of financial services in the United States, operating financial centers in 21 states and Washington, D.C., with locations from Connecticut to Florida and west to California. Wachovia provided global services through more than 40 offices around the world. The acquisition of Wachovia by Wells Fargo was completed on December 31, 2008, after a government-forced sale to avoid Wachovia's failure. The Wachovia brand was absorbed into the Wells Fargo brand in a process that lasted three years. On October 15, 2011, the last Wachovia branches in North Carolina were converted to Wells Fargo. Business lines One Wells Fargo Center, formerly One Wachovia Center. The former corporate headquarters of Wachovia in Charlotte, North Carolina. Wachovia was the product of a 2001 merger between the original Wachovia Corporation, based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina; and Charlotte-based First Union Corporation. The company was organized into four divisions: General Bank (retail, small business, and commercial customers), Wealth Management (high-net-worth, personal trust, and insurance business), Capital Management (asset management, retirement, and retail brokerage services), and Corporate and Investment Bank (capital markets, investment banking, and financial advisory). It served retail brokerage clients under the name Wachovia Securities nationwide as well as in six Latin American countries, and investment banking clients in selected industries nationwide. In 2009, Wachovia Securities was the first Wachovia business to be converted to the Wells Fargo brand, when the business became Wells Fargo Advisors. Calibre was an independent consultant that was hired by Wachovia for the Family Wealth Group to research managers. The group no longer uses Calibre. The company's corporate and institutional capital markets and investment banking groups operated under the Wachovia Securities brand, while its asset management group operated under the Evergreen Investments brand until 2010, when the Evergreen fund family merged with Wells Fargo Advantage Funds, and institutional and high-net-worth products merged with Wells Capital Management and its affiliates. Wachovia's private equity arm operated as Wachovia Capital Partners. Additionally, the asset-based lending group operated as Wachovia Capital Finance. =Origin of corporate name= Wachovia ( ) has its origins in the Latin form of the Austrian name Wachau. When Moravian settlers arrived in Bethabara, North Carolina, in 1753, they gave this name to the land they acquired, because it resembled the Wachau valley along the Danube River. The area formerly known as Wachovia now makes up most of Forsyth County, and the largest city is now Winston-Salem. =First Union= First Union logo. First Union was founded as Union National Bank on June 2, 1908, a small banking desk in the lobby of a Charlotte hotel by H.M. Victor. The bank merged with First National Bank and Trust Company of Asheville, North Carolina, in 1958 to become First Union National Bank of North Carolina. First Union Corporation was incorporated in 1967. By the 1990s, it had grown into a Southern regional powerhouse in a strategy mirroring its longtime rival on Tryon Street in Charlotte, NCNB (later NationsBank and now Bank of America). In 1995, however, it acquired First Fidelity Bancorporation of Newark, New Jersey; at one stroke becoming a major player in the Northeast. Its Northeastern footprint grew even larger in 1998, when it acquired CoreStates Financial Corporation of Philadelphia. One of CoreStates' predecessors, the Bank of North America, had been the first bank proposed, chartered and incorporated in America on December 31, 1781. A former Bank of North America branch in Philadelphia remains in operation today as a Wells Fargo branch =Wachovia= The 1986‚Äì2002 Legacy Wachovia Logo The first Wachovia Loan And Trust Company Building, located in Winston-Salem. Wachovia Corporation began on June 16, 1879 in Winston-Salem, North Carolina as the Wachovia National Bank. The bank was co-founded by James Alexander Gray and William Lemly. In 1911, the bank merged with Wachovia Loan and Trust Company, \\"the largest trust company between Baltimore and New Orleans\\", which had been founded on June 15, 1893. Wachovia grew to become one of the largest banks in the Southeast partly on the strength of its accounts from the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, which was also headquartered in Winston-Salem. On December 12, 1986, Wachovia purchased First Atlanta. Founded as Atlanta National Bank on September 14, 1865, and later renamed to First National Bank of Atlanta, this institution was the oldest national bank in Atlanta. This purchase made Wachovia one of the few companies with dual headquarters: one in Winston-Salem and one in Atlanta. In 1991, Wachovia entered the South Carolina market by acquiring South Carolina National Corporation, founded as the Bank of Charleston in 1834. In 1998, Wachovia acquired two Virginia-based banks, Jefferson National Bank and Central Fidelity Bank. In 1997, Wachovia acquired both 1st United Bancorp and American Bankshares Inc, giving its first entry into Florida. In 2000, Wachovia made its final purchase, which was Republic Security Bank. =Merger of First Union and Wachovia= On April 16, 2001, First Union announced it would acquire Wachovia, through the exchange of approximately $13.4 billion in First Union stock. First Union offered two of its shares for each Wachovia share outstanding. The announcement was made by Wachovia chairman L.M. \\"Bud\\" Baker Jr. and First Union chairman Ken Thompson. Baker would become chairman of the merged bank, while Thompson would become president and CEO.Paul Nowell, \\"U.S. bank giant looms\\". Associated Press via theMontreal Gazette, April 17, 2001: D7. First Union was the nominal survivor, and the merged bank was based in Charlotte and adopted First Union's corporate structure and retained First Union's pre-2001 stock price history. However, as an important part of the merger, the merged bank took Wachovia's name and stock ticker symbol. This merger was viewed with great surprise by the financial press and security analysts. While Wachovia had been viewed as an acquisition candidate after running into problems with earnings and credit quality in 2000, the suitor shocked analysts as many speculated that Wachovia would be sold to Atlanta-based SunTrust. The deal was met with skepticism and criticism. Analysts, remembering the problems with the CoreStates acquisition, were concerned about First Union's ability to merge with another large company. Winston-Salem's citizens and politicians suffered a blow to their civic pride because the merged company would be based in Charlotte. The city of Winston-Salem was concerned both by job losses and the loss of stature from losing a major corporate headquarters. First Union was concerned by the potential deposit attrition and customer loss in the city.\\"Wachovia and First Union announce Winston-Salem as base for the new Wachovia's Wealth Management Business\\" Wachovia press release, August 30, 2001 First Union responded to these concerns by placing the wealth management and Carolinas-region headquarters in Winston-Salem. On May 14, 2001, SunTrust announced a rival takeover bid for Wachovia, the first hostile takeover attempt in the banking sector in many years. In its effort to make the deal appeal to investors, SunTrust argued that it would provide a smoother transition than First Union and offered a higher cash price for Wachovia stock than First Union. Wachovia's board of directors rejected SunTrust's offer and supported the merger with First Union. SunTrust continued its hostile takeover attempt, leading to a bitter battle over the summer between SunTrust and First Union. Both banks increased their offers for Wachovia, took out newspaper ads, mailed letters to shareholders, and initiated court battles to challenge each other's takeover bids. On August 3, 2001, Wachovia shareholders approved the First Union deal, rejecting SunTrust's attempts to elect a new board of directors for Wachovia and ending SunTrust's hostile takeover attempt. Another problem concerned each bank's credit card division. In April 2001, Wachovia agreed to sell its $8 billion credit card portfolio to Bank One. The cards, which would have still been branded as Wachovia, would have been issued through Bank One's First USA division. First Union had sold its credit card portfolio to MBNA in August 2000. After entering into negotiations, the new Wachovia agreed to buy back its portfolio from Bank One in September 2001 and resell it to MBNA. Wachovia paid Bank One a $350 million termination fee. On September 4, 2001, First Union and Wachovia officially merged. In order to prevent a repeat of the CoreStates problems, the new Wachovia took its time phasing-in the conversion of legacy Wachovia computer systems to First Union systems. The company first began converting systems in the southeast United States (where both banks had branches), before moving to First Union's branches in the Northeast, which only had to change their signs to reflect the new company name and logo. This process ended on August 18, 2003, almost 2 years after the merger took place. In comparison to the CoreStates purchase, the merger of First Union and Wachovia was billed as a success by analysts. The company's deliberate pace of conversion seems to have prevented any large-scale customer attrition. In fact, Wachovia was ranked number one in customer satisfaction among major banks by the University of Michigan's annual American Customer Satisfaction Index for every year after the merger. When Wachovia and First Union merged, Charlotte's One, Two, and Three First Union buildings became One, Two, and Three Wachovia Center (respectively), and the 55-story First Union Financial Center in downtown Miami became the Wachovia Financial Center. The merger also affected the names of the indoor professional sports arenas in Philadelphia and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Formerly known as the First Union Center and the First Union Spectrum (both Philadelphia) and First Union Arena (Wilkes-Barre), they were renamed the Wachovia Center (now known as Wells Fargo Center), Wachovia Spectrum, and Wachovia Arena at Casey Plaza (now known as Mohegan Sun Arena at Casey Plaza), respectively. =Merger and acquisition history= The following is an illustration of the company's major mergers and acquisitions and historical predecessors (up to the Wachovia and First Union merger of 2001). The list is not comprehensive. =Acquisitions= Between 2001 and 2006, Wachovia bought several other financial services companies in an attempt to become a national bank and comprehensive financial services company. Prudential Securities Wachovia Securities and the Prudential Securities Division of Prudential Financial, Inc. combined to form Wachovia Securities LLC on July 1, 2003. Wachovia owned a controlling 62% stake, while Prudential Financial retained the remaining 38%. At the time, the new firm had client assets of $532.1 billion, making it the nation's third largest full service retail brokerage firm based on assets. Metropolitan West Securities On October 22, 2003, Wachovia announced it would acquire Metropolitan West Securities, an affiliate company of Metropolitan West Financial. This acquisition added a portfolio of over $50 billion of securities on loan to the Wachovia Global Securities Lending division. SouthTrust On November 1, 2004, Wachovia completed the acquisition of Birmingham, Alabama-based SouthTrust Corporation, a transaction valued at $14.3 billion. The merger created the largest bank in the southeast United States, the fourth largest bank in terms of holdings, and the second largest in terms of number of branches. Integration was completed by the end of 2005. Failed MBNA purchase In June 2005, Wachovia negotiated to purchase monoline credit card company MBNA. However, the deal fell through when Wachovia balked at MBNA's purchase price. Within a week of the deal's collapse, MBNA entered into an agreement to be purchased by Wachovia's chief rival, Bank of America. Wachovia received $100 million out of this deal, the result of an agreement Wachovia predecessor First Union made in 2000 when it sold its credit card portfolio to MBNA. This agreement required MBNA to pay this sum if it were ever sold to a competitor. In late 2005 Wachovia announced that it would end its relationship with MBNA and start up its own credit card division so that the bank could issue its own Visa cards. Westcorp Westcorp logo Westcorp, Western Financial Bank's parent company, WFS Financial Inc. and Wachovia announced a proposed acquisition by Wachovia in September 2005. Westcorp and WFS Financial Inc. shareholders approved the acquisition on Jan. 6, 2006 and on March 1, 2006, the merger was complete. This acquisition made Wachovia the ninth largest auto finance lender in the competitive U.S. auto finance market and provided Wachovia with a small retail and commercial banking presence in Southern California. On February 12, 2007, the former 19 Western Financial Bank branches opened under the Wachovia name. These branches became the launching point for a much larger Wachovia presence in California with the acquisition and integration of World Savings Bank in 2007. Golden West Financial/World Savings Bank Wachovia agreed to purchase Golden West Financial for a little under $25.5 billion on May 7, 2006. This acquisition gave Wachovia an additional 285-branch network spanning 10 states. Wachovia greatly raised its profile in California, where Golden West held $32 billion in deposits and operated 123 branches. Golden West, which operated branches under the name World Savings Bank, was the second largest savings and loan in the United States. The business was a small savings and loan in the San Francisco Bay area when it was purchased in 1963 for $4 million by Herbert and Marion Sandler. Golden West specialized in option ARMs loans, marketed under the name \\"Pick-A-Pay.\\" These loans gave the borrower a choice of payment plans, including the option to defer paying a part of the interest owed, which was then added onto the balance of the loan. In 2006, Golden West Financial was named the \\"Most Admired Company\\" in the mortgage services business by Fortune magazine. By the time Wachovia announced its acquisition, Golden West had over $125 billion in assets and 11,600 employees. By October 2, 2006 Wachovia had closed the acquisition of Golden West Financial Corporation. The Sandlers agreed to remain on the board at Wachovia. The Sandlers sold their firm at the top of the market, saying that they were growing older and wanted to devote themselves to philanthropy. A year earlier, in 2005, World Savings lending had started to slow, after more than quadrupling since 1998. Some current and former Wachovia officials say that the merger was agreed to in days and that it was impossible to conduct a thorough vetting of World Savings' loans. They noted that the creditworthiness of World Savings borrowers edged down from 2004 to 2006, while Pick-A-Pay borrowers had credit scores well below the industry average for traditional loans. World Savings lending volume dipped again in 2006 shortly after the sale to Wachovia was initiated. In 2007, after the merger, World Savings, now known as Wachovia Mortgage began to attract more borrowers by taking a step that some regulators were starting to frown upon, and which the former World Savings management had been resisting for years: it allowed borrowers to make monthly payments based on an annual interest rate of just 1 percent. While Wachovia Mortgage continued to scrutinize borrowers' ability to manage increased payments, the move to rock-bottom rates lured customers whose financial reliability was harder to verify. More than 70% of the Pick-A-Pay loans were made in California, Florida and Arizona, where home prices have declined severely. New York Times reporter Floyd Norris has called World Savings a \\"ticking timebomb\\" that created \\"zombie homeowners\\". While Wachovia Chairman and CEO G. Kennedy \\"Ken\\" Thompson had described Golden West as a \\"crown jewel\\", investors did not react positively to the deal at the time. Analysts have since said that Wachovia purchased Golden West at the peak of the US housing boom. Wachovia Mortgage's mortgage-related problems led to Wachovia suffering writedowns and losses that far exceeded the price paid in the acquisition, ending up in the fire-sale of Wachovia to Wells Fargo. A. G. Edwards right On May 31, 2007, Wachovia announced plans to purchase A. G. Edwards for $6.8 billion to create the United States' second largest retail brokerage firm. The acquisition closed on October 1, 2007. In early March 2008 Wachovia began to phase out the AG Edwards brand in favor of a unified Wachovia Securities.  Historical data (2000‚Äì2008)  Image:Wachovia_al.jpgAsset & Liability Image:Wachovia_al_ratio.jpgAsset/Liability Image:Wachovia_income.jpgNet Income Wachovia, excluding subsidiaries, was the fourth largest bank at the end of 2008. 2007‚Äì2009 financial crisis Exposed to risky loans, such as adjustable rate mortgages acquired during the acquisition of Golden West Financial in 2006, Wachovia began to experience heavy losses in its loan portfolios during the subprime mortgage crisis. In the first quarter of 2007, Wachovia reported $2.3 billion in earnings, including acquisitions and divestitures. However, in the second quarter of 2008, Wachovia reported a much larger than anticipated $8.9 billion loss. On June 2, 2008, Wachovia chief executive officer Ken Thompson was forced to retire. He'd been head of Wachovia since 2000, while it was still known as First Union. The board replaced him on an interim basis with Chairman Lanty Smith. Smith had already replaced Thompson as chairman a month earlier. On July 9, 2008, Wachovia hired Treasury Undersecretary Bob Steel as chief executive in hopes that his experience would lead the company out of its difficulties. =Government intervention= After Steel took over, he insisted that Wachovia would stay independent. However, its stock price plunged 27 percent on September 26 due to the seizure of Washington Mutual the previous night. On the same day, several businesses and institutional depositors withdrew money from their accounts in order to drop their balances below the $100,000 insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) ‚Äì an event known in banking circles as a \\"silent run.\\" Ultimately, Wachovia lost a total of $5 billion in deposits that day‚Äîabout one percent of the bank's total deposits.Rothacker, Rick. $5 billion withdrawn in one day in silent run. The Charlotte Observer, 2008-10-11 The large outflow of deposits attracted the attention of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates national banks. Federal regulators pressured Wachovia to put itself up for sale over the weekend. Had Wachovia failed, it would have been a severe drain on the FDIC's insurance fund due to its size (it operated one of the largest branch networks on the East Coast).St. Onge, Peter. Stunningly swift fall for Wachovia. The Charlotte Observer, 2008-09-30.Rothacker, Rick; and Kerry Hall. Wachovia faced a 'silent' bank run. The Charlotte Observer, 2008-10-02. As business halted for the weekend, Wachovia was already in FDIC-brokered talks with Citigroup and Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo initially emerged as the frontrunner to acquire the ailing Wachovia's banking operations, but backed out due to concerns over Wachovia's commercial loans. With no deal in place as September 28 dawned, regulators were concerned that Wachovia wouldn't have enough short-term funding to open for business the next day. In order to obtain enough liquidity to do business, banks usually depend on short-term loans to each other. However, the markets had been so battered by a credit crisis related to the housing bubble that banks were skittish about making such loans. Under the circumstances, regulators feared that if customers pulled out more money, Wachovia wouldn't have enough liquidity to meet its obligations. This would have resulted in a failure dwarfing that of WaMu. When FDIC Chairwoman Sheila Bair got word of Wachovia's situation, she initially decided to handle the situation like she'd handled WaMu a day earlier. Under this scenario, the Comptroller of the Currency would have seized Wachovia's banking assets (Wachovia Bank, N.A. and Wachovia Bank of Delaware, N.A.) and placed them under the receivership of the FDIC. The FDIC would have then sold the banking assets to the highest bidder. Bair called Steel on September 28 and told him that the FDIC would be auctioning off Wachovia's banking assets. Bair felt this would best protect the small banks. However, several Federal regulators, led by New York Fed President Tim Geithner, felt such a course would be politically unjustifiable so soon after WaMu's seizure. After a round of mediation between Geithner and Bair, the FDIC declared that Wachovia was \\"systemically important\\" to the health of the economy, and thus could not be allowed to fail. It was the first time the FDIC had made such a determination since the passage of a 1991 law allowing the FDIC to handle large bank failures on short notice. Later that night, in an FDIC-brokered deal, Citigroup agreed to buy Wachovia's retail banking operations in an \\"open bank\\" transfer of ownership. The transaction would have been facilitated by the FDIC, with the concurrence of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve and the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the President. The FDIC's open bank assistance procedures normally require the FDIC to find the cheapest way to rescue a failing bank. However, when a bank is deemed \\"systemically important,\\" the FDIC is allowed to bypass this requirement. Steel had little choice but to agree, and the decision was announced on the morning of September 29, roughly 45 minutes before the markets opened. From this point on, Citigroup became the source of liquidity allowing Wachovia to continue to operate until the acquisition was complete. In its announcement, the FDIC stressed that Wachovia did not fail and was not placed into receivership. In addition, the FDIC said that the agency would absorb Citigroup's losses above $42 billion; Wachovia's loan portfolio was valued at $312 billion. In exchange for assuming this risk, the FDIC would receive $12 billion in preferred stock and warrants from Citigroup. The transaction would have been an all-stock transfer, with Wachovia Corporation stockholders to have received stock from Citigroup, valuing Wachovia stock at about one dollar per share for a total transaction value of about $2.16 billion. Citigroup would have also assumed Wachovia's senior and subordinated debt. Citigroup intended to sell ten billion dollars of new stock on the open market to recapitalize its purchased banking operations. The proposed closing date for the Wachovia purchase was by the end of the year, 2008. Wachovia expected to continue as a publicly traded company, retaining its retail brokerage arm, Wachovia Securities and Evergreen mutual funds. At the time, Wachovia Securities had 14,600 financial advisers and managed more than $1 trillion, third in the U.S. after Merrill Lynch and Citigroup's Smith Barney. The announcement drew some criticism from Wachovia stockholders who felt the dollar-per-share price was too cheap. Some of them planned to try to defeat the deal when it came up for shareholder approval. However, institutional investors such as mutual funds and pension funds controlled 73 percent of Wachovia's stock; individual stockholders would have had to garner a significant amount of support from institutional shareholders to derail the sale. Also, several experts in corporate dealmaking told The Charlotte Observer that such a strategy is very risky since federal regulators helped broker the deal. One financial expert told the Observer that if Wachovia's shareholders voted the deal down, the OCC could have simply seized Wachovia and placed it into the receivership of the FDIC, which would then sell it to Citigroup. Had this happened, Wachovia's shareholders risked being completely wiped out.Rexrode, Christina; and Jen Aronoff. Shareholders talk of fighting Citi deal. The Charlotte Observer, 2008-10-02. Acquisition by Wells Fargo A Wells Fargo branch in Durham, North Carolina; previously a Wachovia branch until 2011. Though Citigroup was providing the liquidity that allowed Wachovia to continue to operate, Wells Fargo and Wachovia announced on October 3, 2008, that they had agreed to merge in an all-stock transaction requiring no government involvement. Wells Fargo announced it had agreed to acquire all of Wachovia for $15.1 billion in stock. Wachovia preferred the Wells Fargo deal because it would be worth more than the Citigroup deal and keep all of its businesses intact. Also, there is far less overlap between the banks, as Wells Fargo is dominant in the West and Midwest compared to the redundant footprint of Wachovia and Citibank along the East Coast. Both companies' boards unanimously approved the merger on the night of October 2. Citigroup explored its legal options and demanded that Wachovia and Wells Fargo cease discussions, claiming that Wells Fargo engaged in \\"tortious interference\\" with an exclusivity agreement between Citigroup and Wachovia. That agreement states in part that until October 6, 2008 \\"Wachovia shall not, and shall not permit any of its subsidiaries or any of its or their respective officers, directors, [...] to [...] take any action to facilitate or encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal.\\". Citigroup convinced Judge Charles E. Ramos of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County to grant a preliminary injunction temporarily blocking the Wells Fargo deal. This ruling was later overturned by Judge James M. McGuire of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Appellate Division, First Department, partly because he believed Ramos did not have the right to rule on the case in Connecticut. On October 9, 2008, Citigroup abandoned its attempt to purchase Wachovia's banking assets, allowing the Wachovia-Wells Fargo merger to go through. However, Citigroup pursued $60 billion in claims, $20 billion in compensatory and $40 billion in punitive damages, against Wachovia and Wells Fargo for alleged violations of the exclusivity agreement. Wells Fargo settled this dispute with Citigroup Inc. for $100 Million on November 19, 2010. Citigroup may have been pressured by regulators to back out of the deal; Bair endorsed Wells Fargo's bid because it removed the FDIC from the picture. Geithner was furious, claiming that the FDIC's reversal would undermine the government's ability to quickly rescue failing banks. However, Geithner's colleagues at the Fed were not willing to take responsibility for selling Wachovia. The Federal Reserve unanimously approved the merger with Wells Fargo on October 12, 2008. The combined company retained the Wells Fargo name, and was based in San Francisco. However, Charlotte remained as the headquarters for the combined company's East Coast banking operations, and Wachovia Securities remained in Charlotte. Three members of the Wachovia board joined the Wells Fargo board. The merger created the largest branch network in the United States. In filings unsealed two days before the merger approval in a New York federal court, Citigroup argued that its own deal was better for U.S taxpayers and Wachovia shareholders. It said that it had exposed itself to \\"substantial economic risk\\" by stating its intent to rescue Wachovia after less than 72 hours of due diligence. Citigroup had obtained an exclusive agreement in order to protect itself.Filings outline demise of Citi-Wachovia deal Wachovia suffered a $23.9 billion loss in the third quarter. In September 2008, the Internal Revenue Service issued a notice providing tax breaks to companies that acquire troubled banks. According to analysts, these tax breaks were worth billions of dollars to Wells Fargo. Vice Chairman Bill Thomas of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission indicated that these tax breaks may have been a factor in Wells Fargo's decision to purchase Wachovia. Wells Fargo's purchase of Wachovia closed on December 31, 2008. By the time Wells Fargo completed the acquisition of Wachovia, the byline \\"A Wells Fargo company\\" was added to the logo. Controversies =Identity theft negligence= A May 2007 New York Times article described Wachovia's negligence in screening and taking action against companies linked with identity theft. With stolen identities, the companies used unsigned checks to remove funds from personal Wachovia bank accounts. In total, Wachovia accepted $142 million in unsigned checks from \\"companies that made unauthorized withdrawals from thousands of accounts\\", collecting millions of dollars in fees from them. According to Pat Meehan, a U.S. attorney for Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Wachovia received \\"thousands of warnings that it was processing fraudulent checks, but ignored them\\". On April 25, 2008, Wachovia agreed to pay up to $144 million to end the investigation without admitting wrongdoing. The investigation found that Wachovia had failed to conduct suitable due diligence, and that it would have discovered the thefts if it had followed normal procedures. The penalty is one of the largest ever demanded by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. = Latin drug cartel money laundering= In April 2008, the Wall Street Journal reported that federal prosecutors had initiated a probe into Wachovia and other U.S. banks for aiding drug money laundering by Mexican and Colombian money-transfer companies, also known as casas de cambio. These companies help Mexican immigrants in the United States send remittances back to family in Mexico, but it is widely known that they also present a significant money-laundering risk. However, not only is it a \\"lucrative industry\\" that is able to charge high fees, but Wachovia also viewed it as a way to gain a foothold in the Hispanic banking market. In March 2010, Wachovia admitted \\"serious and systemic\\" violations of the Bank Secrecy Act that allowed Mexican and Colombian drug cartels to launder $378.4 billion between 2004 and 2007, the \\"largest violation of the Bank Secrecy Act\\". It negotiated a deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department to resolve criminal charges for willfully failing to set up an effective anti-money-laundering program. It agreed to forfeit $110 million and pay a $50 million fine to the U.S. Treasury. Reports in Bloomberg Businessweek in June 2010 and The Observer in April 2011 shed light on the extent to which Wachovia went to turn a blind eye, including by ignoring the warnings and suspicious activity reports (SARs) of its London-based director of anti-money-laundering.

He made 612 appearances and scored 58 goals for Hearts, and helped them win every major honour in Scottish football. Cumming also represented Scotland and the Scottish League. Club career Cumming signed for Heart of Midlothian on provisional forms by the then manager, Dave McLean. At the time Cumming was employed as a pit worker and playing junior league football for Carluke Rovers. Cumming signed fully for Hearts in January 1950. He was quickly dubbed the \\"Iron Man\\" for his fearless and resolute tackling. His versatility seen him play at either wing- half or left-back. He even appeared as a goalkeeper for one reserve match. Dave Mackay had previously been on schoolboy terms at Hearts. Mackay joined the club's pro ranks in 1951. Cumming and Mackay became the duo who made that team tick for the remainder of the 1950s. \\"He never had a bad game. It was either a fairly good game or an excellent game,\\" said Mackay of Cumming. Cumming is the most decorated player in Hearts' history, having played throughout the club's most successful era. In nine seasons from 1954 to 1963 Hearts won seven trophies. He won two league championship medals, one Scottish Cup medal and four Scottish League Cup medals. His commitment to the team is typified by his quote now displayed above the entrance to the players tunnel at Tynecastle: \\"Blood doesn't show on a maroon jersey\\". This was said after Cumming had blood streaming from a head injury in a clash with Willie Fernie in the 1956 Scottish Cup Final; he returned to the playing field in the and was named man of the match 3‚Äì1 win against Celtic.

Cumming retired from playing in 1967. He was a trainer at Hearts for a decade after ending his playing days and later returned to work in the steel industry. Cumming remained a regular at Hearts games until illness confined him to a nursing home. International career Cumming played nine times for Scotland, with his senior caps coming in two distinct spells. The first cap was a defeat at home to the 'Magical Magyars' era Hungary team in December 1954. This was a few weeks after Cumming won his first major trophy, and represented the first of four caps between December 1954 and May 1955.

Evacuated from Paris to the resort town of Vichy in the unoccupied \\"Free Zone\\" () in the southern part of Metropolitan France, (including French Algeria) it remained responsible for the civil administration of France as well as its colonies.Julian Jackson, France: The Dark Years, 1940‚Äì1944 (2001). France was invaded by Nazi Germany beginning on 10 May 1940. The Nazis rapidly conquered France by bypassing the highly fortified Maginot Line and invading through Belgium. By July, the military situation of the French was dire, and it was apparent that the French had lost. The French government began to discuss the possibility of an armistice. Paul Reynaud resigned as prime-minister of the French Third Republic rather than sign an armistice, and Marshal Philippe P√©tain, a hero of World War I, became prime minister. Shortly thereafter, P√©tain signed the Armistice of 22 June. On 10 July, the Third Republic was effectively dissolved as P√©tain was granted essentially dictatorial powers by the National Assembly. At Vichy, P√©tain established an authoritarian government that reversed many liberal policies and began tight supervision of the economy. Conservative Catholics became prominent and Paris lost its avant- garde status in European art and culture. The media were tightly controlled and promoted anti-Semitism, and, after June 1941, anti-Bolshevism.Debbie Lackerstein, National Regeneration in Vichy France: Ideas and Policies, 1930‚Äì1944 (2013) The occupation presented certain advantages, such as keeping the French Navy and French colonial empire under French control, and avoiding full occupation of the country by Germany, thus maintaining a degree of French independence and neutrality. Despite heavy pressure, the French government at Vichy never joined the Axis alliance and even remained formally at war with Germany. Conversely, Vichy France became a collaborationist regime, and was little more than a Nazi client state. Germany kept two million French soldiers prisoner, carrying out forced labour (). They were hostages to ensure that Vichy would reduce its military forces and pay a heavy tribute in gold, food, and supplies to Germany. French police were ordered to round up Jews and other \\"undesirables\\" such as communists and political refugees; at least 72,500 were killed. Though the French public initially supported the regime, opinion gradually turned against the French government and the occupying German forces over time, when it became clear that Germany was losing the war, and living conditions in France became increasingly difficult. A resistance movement, working largely in concert with de Gaulle's movement outside the country, increased in strength over the course of the occupation. Following the Allied invasion of Normandy in June 1944 and the liberation of France later that year, the Free French Provisional government of the French Republic (GPRF) was installed as the new national government, led by de Gaulle. The last of the Vichy exiles were captured in the Sigmaringen enclave in April 1945. P√©tain was put on trial for treason by the new Provisional government, and sentenced to death; this was commuted to life imprisonment by de Gaulle. Only four senior Vichy officials were tried for crimes against humanity, although many more had participated in the deportation of Jews for internment in Nazi concentration camps, abuses of prisoners, and severe acts against members of the Resistance. Overview In 1940, Marshal P√©tain was known as a First World War hero, the victor of the battle of Verdun. As the last premier of the Third Republic, being a reactionary by inclination, he blamed the Third Republic's democracy for France's sudden defeat by Germany. He set up a paternalistic, authoritarian regime that actively collaborated with Germany, Vichy's official neutrality notwithstanding. The Vichy government cooperated with the Nazis' racial policies. =Terminology= France under German occupation (Germans occupied the southern zone starting in November 1942‚ÄîOperation Case Anton). The yellow zone was under Italian administration. Chief of State of Vichy France (Chef de l'√âtat Fran√ßais) After the National Assembly under the Third Republic voted to give full powers to Philippe P√©tain on 10 July 1940, the name R√©publique Fran√ßaise (French Republic) disappeared from all official documents. From that point on, the regime was referred to officially as the √âtat Fran√ßais (French State). Because of its unique situation in the history of France, its contested legitimacy, and the generic nature of its official name, the \\"French State\\" is most often represented in English by the synonyms \\"Vichy France\\", \\"Vichy regime\\", \\"government of Vichy\\", or in context, simply \\"Vichy\\". The territory under the control of the Vichy government was the unoccupied, southern portion of France south of the Line of Demarcation, as established by the Armistice of 22 June 1940, and the overseas French territories, such as French North Africa, which was \\"an integral part of Vichy\\", and where all antisemitic Vichy's laws were also implemented. This was called the Unbesetztes Gebiet (Unoccupied zone) by the Germans, and known as the Zone libre (Free Zone) in France, or less formally as the \\"southern zone\\" (zone du sud) especially after Operation Anton, the invasion of the Zone libre by German forces in November 1942. Other contemporary colloquial terms for the Zone libre were based on abbreviation and wordplay, such as the \\"zone nono\\", for the non-occupied Zone. =Jurisdiction= In theory, the civil jurisdiction of the Vichy government extended over most of metropolitan France, French Algeria, the French protectorate in Morocco, the French protectorate of Tunisia, and the rest of the French colonial empire that accepted the authority of Vichy; only the disputed border territory of Alsace- Lorraine was placed under direct German administration. Alsace-Lorraine was officially still part of France, as the Reich never annexed the region. The Reich government at the time was not interested in attempting to enforce piecemeal annexations in the West (although it later did annex Luxembourg) ‚Äì it operated under the assumption that Germany's new western border would be determined in peace negotiations that would be attended by all of the Western Allies, thus producing a frontier that would be recognised by all of the major powers. Since Adolf Hitler's overall territorial ambitions were not limited to recovering Alsace-Lorraine, and since Britain was never brought to terms, these peace negotiations never took place. The Nazis had some intention of annexing a large swath of northeastern France and replacing that region's inhabitants with German settlers, and initially forbade French refugees from returning to this region. These restrictions, which were never thoroughly enforced, were basically abandoned following the invasion of the Soviet Union, which had the effect of turning the Nazis' territorial ambitions almost exclusively to the East. German troops guarding the boundary line of the northeastern Zone interdite were withdrawn on the night of 17‚Äì18 December 1941 although the line remained in place on paper for the remainder of the occupation. Nevertheless, effectively Alsace-Lorraine was annexed: German law applied to the region, its inhabitants were conscripted into the Wehrmacht and pointedly the customs posts separating France from Germany were placed back where they had been between 1871‚Äì1918. Similarly, a sliver of French territory in the Alps was under direct Italian administration from June 1940 to September 1943. Throughout the rest of the country, civil servants were under the formal authority of French ministers in Vichy. Ren√© Bousquet, the head of French police nominated by Vichy, exercised his power in Paris through his second-in-command, Jean Leguay, who coordinated raids with the Nazis. German laws took precedence over French ones in the occupied territories, and the Germans often rode roughshod over the sensibilities of Vichy administrators. On 11 November 1942, following the landing of the Allies in North Africa (Operation Torch), the Axis launched Operation Anton, occupying southern France and disbanding the strictly limited \\"Armistice Army\\" that Vichy had been allowed by the armistice. =Legitimacy= Vichy's claim to be the legitimate French government was denied by Free France and by all subsequent French governments after the war. They maintain that Vichy was an illegal government run by traitors, having come to power through an unconstitutional coup d'√©tat. P√©tain was constitutionally appointed the Premier by President Lebrun on 16 June 1940, and he was legally within his rights to sign the armistice with Germany; yet, his decision to ask the National Assembly to dissolve itself while granting him dictatorial powers has been more controversial. Historians have particularly debated the circumstances of the vote by the National Assembly of the Third Republic, granting full powers to P√©tain on 10 July 1940. The main arguments advanced against Vichy's right to incarnate the continuity of the French state were based on the pressure exerted by Pierre Laval, former Premier in the Third Republic, on the deputies in Vichy, and on the absence of 27 deputies and senators who had fled on the ship Massilia, and thus could not take part in the vote. However, during the war the Vichy government was internationally recognized,Peter Jackson & Simon Kitson ‚ÄòThe paradoxes of foreign policy in Vichy France‚Äô in Jonathan Adelman(ed), Hitler and his Allies, London, Routledge, 2007 notably by the United States and several other major Allied powers./ Australia's diplomatic relationships with Vichy: French embassy in AustraliaCanada's diplomatic relationships with Vichy: Foreign Affairs Canada . Diplomatic relations with Great Britain had been severed since 8 July 1940, after the Attack on Mers-el- K√©bir. Ideology The Vichy regime sought an anti-modern counter-revolution. The traditionalist right in France, with strength in the aristocracy and among Catholics, had never accepted the republican traditions of the French Revolution. It demanded a return to traditional lines of culture and religion and embraced authoritarianism, while dismissing democracy. The Communist element, strongest in labour unions, turned against Vichy in June 1941, when Germany invaded the Soviet Union. Vichy was intensely anti-Communist and generally pro-German; American historian Stanley G. Payne found that it was \\"distinctly rightist and authoritarian but never fascist\\". Political scientist Robert Paxton analysed the entire range of Vichy supporters, from reactionaries to moderate liberal modernizers, and concluded that genuine fascist elements had but minor roles in most sectors. French historian Olivier Wieviorka rejects the idea that Vichy France was fascist, noting that \\"P√©tain refused to create a single party state, avoided getting France involved in a new war, hated modernization and supported the Church.\\" Propaganda poster for the Vichy Regime's R√©volution nationale program, 1942 The Vichy government tried to assert its legitimacy by symbolically connecting itself with the Gallo-Roman period of France's history, and celebrated the Gaulish chieftain Vercingetorix as the \\"founder\\" of the nation. It was asserted that just as the defeat of the Gauls in the 52 BC Battle of Alesia had been the moment in French history when a sense of common nationhood was born, the defeat of 1940 would again unify the nation. The Vichy government's \\"Francisque\\" insignia featured two symbols from the Gallic period: the baton and the double-headed hatchet (labrys) arranged so as to resemble the fasces, symbol of the Italian Fascists. To advance his message, Marshal P√©tain frequently spoke on French radio. In his radio speeches, P√©tain always used the personal pronoun je, portrayed himself as a Christ-like figure sacrificing himself for France while also assuming a God-like tone of a semi-omniscient narrator who knew truths about the world that the rest of the French did not.Flood, Christopher \\"P√©tain and de Gaulle\\" pages 88‚Äì110 from France At War In the Twentieth Century edited by Valerie Holman and Debra Kelly, Oxford: Berghahan Books, 2000 pages 92‚Äì93 To justify the Vichy ideology of the R√©volution nationale (\\"national revolution\\"), P√©tain needed a radical break with the Republic, and during his radio speeches the entire French Third Republic era was always painted in the blackest of colours, a time of la d√©cadence (\\"decadence\\") when the French people were alleged to have suffered moral degeneration and decline. Summarising P√©tain's speeches, the British historian Christopher Flood wrote that P√©tain blamed la d√©cadence on \\"political and economic liberalism, with its divisive, individualistic and hedonistic values‚Äîlocked in sterile rivalry with its antithetical outgrowths, Socialism and Communism\\". P√©tain argued that rescuing the French people from la d√©cadence required a period of authoritarian government which would restore national unity and the traditionalist morality which P√©tain claimed the French had forgotten. Despite his highly negative view of the Third Republic, P√©tain argued that la France profonde (\\"deep France\\", denoting profoundly French aspects of French culture) still existed, and that the French people needed to return to what P√©tain insisted was their true identity. Alongside this claim for a moral revolution was P√©tain's call for France to turn inwards, to withdraw from the world, which P√©tain always portrayed as a hostile and threatening place full of endless dangers for the French. Joan of Arc replaced Marianne as the national symbol of France under Vichy as her status as one of France's best-loved heroines gave her widespread appeal while at the same time the image of Joan as devoutly Catholic and patriotic fit well with Vichy's traditionalist message. Vichy literature portrayed Joan as an archetypal virgin and Marianne as an archetypal whore. Under the Vichy regime, the school textbook Miracle de Jeanne by Ren√© Jeanneret was required reading, and the anniversary of Joan's death became an occasion for school speeches commemorating her martyrdom. Joan's encounter with angelic voices, according to Catholic tradition, were presented as literal history. The textbook Miracle de Jeanne declared \\"the Voices did speak!\\" in contrast with Republican school texts, which had strongly implied Joan was mentally ill. Vichy instructors sometimes struggled to square Joan's military heroism with the classical virtues of womanhood, with one school textbook insisting that girls ought not follow Joan's example literally, saying: \\"Some of the most notable heroes in our history have been women. But nevertheless, girls should preferably exercise the virtues of patience, persistence and resignation. They are destined to tend to the running of the household ... It is in love that our future mothers will find the strength to practise those virtues which best befit their sex and their condition.\\"\\" Exemplifying Vichy propaganda's synthesis of Joan the warrior and Joan the dutiful woman, Anne-Marie Hussenot, speaking at the school at Uriage, stated: \\"a woman should remember that, in the case of Joan of Arc, or other illustrious women throughout the exceptional mission that was confided to them, they first of all performed humbly and simply their woman's role\\". The key component of Vichy's ideology was Anglophobia.Cornick, Martyn \\"Fighting Myth with Reality: The Fall of France, Anglophobia, and the BBC\\" pages 65‚Äì87 from France At War In the Twentieth Century edited by Valerie Holman and Debra Kelly, Oxford: Berghahan Books, 2000 pages 69‚Äì74. In part, Vichy's virulent Anglophobia was due to its leaders' personal dislike of the British, as Marshal P√©tain, Pierre Laval and Admiral Fran√ßois Darlan were all Anglophobes. As early as February 1936, P√©tain had told the Italian Ambassador to France that \\"England has always been France's most implacable enemy\\"; he went on to say that France had \\"two hereditary enemies\\", namely Germany and Britain, with the latter being easily the more dangerous of the two; and he wanted a Franco- German-Italian alliance that would partition the British Empire, an event that P√©tain claimed would solve all of the economic problems caused by the Great Depression. Beyond that, in order to justify both the armistice with Germany and the R√©volution nationale, Vichy needed to portray the French declaration of war on Germany as a hideous mistake, and the French society under the Third Republic as degenerate and rotten. The R√©volution nationale together with P√©tain's policy of la France seule (\\"France alone\\") were meant to \\"regenerate\\" France from la d√©cadence that was said to have destroyed French society and brought about the defeat of 1940. Such a harsh critique of French society could only generate so much support, and as such Vichy blamed French problems on various \\"enemies\\" of France, the chief of which was Britain, the \\"eternal enemy\\" that had supposedly conspired via Masonic lodges first to weaken France and then to pressure France into declaring war on Germany in 1939. No other nation was attacked as frequently and violently as Britain was in Vichy propaganda. In P√©tain's radio speeches, Britain was always portrayed as the \\"Other\\", a nation that was the complete antithesis of everything good in France, the blood-soaked \\"Perfidious Albion\\" and the relentless \\"eternal enemy\\" of France whose ruthlessness knew no bounds. Joan of Arc who had fought against England was made into the symbol of France in part for that reason. The chief themes of Vichy Anglophobia were British \\"selfishness\\" in using and abandoning France after instigating wars, British \\"treachery\\" and British plans to take over French colonies. The three examples that were used to illustrate these themes were the Dunkirk evacuation in May 1940, the Royal Navy attack at Mers-el-K√©bir on the French Mediterranean fleet that killed over 1,300 French sailors in July 1940, and the failed Anglo-Free French attempt to seize Dakar in September 1940. Typical of Vichy anti-British propaganda was the widely distributed pamphlet published in August 1940 and written by self-proclaimed \\"professional Anglophobe\\" Henri B√©raud titled Faut- il r√©duire l'Angleterre en esclavage? (\\"Should England Be Reduced to Slavery?\\"); the question in the title was merely rhetorical. Additionally, Vichy mixed Anglophobia with racism and antisemitism to portray the British as a racially degenerate \\"mixed race\\" working for Jewish capitalists, in contrast to the \\"racially pure\\" peoples on the continent of Europe who were building a \\"New Order\\". In an interview conducted by B√©raud with Admiral Darlan published in Gringoire newspaper in 1941, Darlan was quoted as saying that if the \\"New Order\\" failed in Europe it would mean \\"here in France, the return to power of the Jews and Freemasons subservient to Anglo-Saxon policy\\". Fall of France and establishment of the Vichy government French prisoners of war are marched off under German guard, 1940 France declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939, following the German invasion of Poland on 1 September. After the eight-month Phoney War, the Germans launched their offensive in the west on 10 May 1940. Within days, it became clear that French military forces were overwhelmed and that military collapse was imminent.Robert A. Doughty, The Breaking Point: Sedan and the Fall of France, 1940 (1990) Government and military leaders, deeply shocked by the d√©b√¢cle, debated how to proceed. Many officials, including Prime Minister Paul Reynaud, wanted to move the government to French territories in North Africa, and continue the war with the French Navy and colonial resources. Others, particularly the Vice-Premier Philippe P√©tain and the Commander-in-Chief, General Maxime Weygand, insisted that the responsibility of the government was to remain in France and share the misfortune of its people. The latter view called for an immediate cessation of hostilities. While this debate continued, the government was forced to relocate several times, to avoid capture by advancing German forces, finally reaching Bordeaux. Communications were poor and thousands of civilian refugees clogged the roads. In these chaotic conditions, advocates of an armistice gained the upper hand. The Cabinet agreed on a proposal to seek armistice terms from Germany, with the understanding that, should Germany set forth dishonourable or excessively harsh terms, France would retain the option to continue to fight. General Charles Huntziger, who headed the French armistice delegation, was told to break off negotiations if the Germans demanded the occupation of all metropolitan France, the French fleet, or any of the French overseas territories. The Germans did not. Philippe P√©tain meeting Hitler in October 1940 Prime Minister Paul Reynaud favoured continuing the war; however, he was soon outvoted by those who advocated an armistice. Facing an untenable situation, Reynaud resigned and, on his recommendation, President Albert Lebrun appointed the 84-year-old P√©tain as his replacement on 16 June 1940. The Armistice with France (Second Compi√®gne) agreement was signed on 22 June 1940. A separate French agreement was reached with Italy, which had entered the war against France on 10 June, well after the outcome of the battle had been decided. Adolf Hitler had a number of reasons for agreeing to an armistice. He wanted to ensure that France did not continue to fight from North Africa, and he wanted to ensure that the French Navy was taken out of the war. In addition, leaving a French government in place would relieve Germany of the considerable burden of administering French territory, particularly as Hitler turned his attention toward Britain ‚Äì which did not surrender and fought on against Germany. Finally, as Germany lacked a navy sufficient to occupy France's overseas territories, Hitler's only practical recourse to deny the British the use of those territories was to maintain France's status as a de jure independent and neutral nation while also sending a message to Britain that they were alone, with France appearing to switch sides and the United States remaining neutral. However, Nazi espionage against France after its defeat intensified greatly, particularly in southern France.http://Spying for Germany in Vichy France. =Conditions of armistice and 10 July 1940 vote of full powers= The armistice divided France into occupied and unoccupied zones: northern and western France, including the entire Atlantic coast, was occupied by Germany, and the remaining two-fifths of the country was under the control of the French government with the capital at Vichy under P√©tain. Ostensibly, the French government administered the entire territory. Prisoners Germany took two million French soldiers as prisoners of war and sent them to camps in Germany. About one-third had been released on various terms by 1944. Of the remainder, the officers and NCOs (corporals and sergeants) were kept in camps but were exempt from forced labour. The privates were first sent to \\"Stalag\\" camps for processing and were then put out to work. About half of them worked in German agriculture, where food rations were adequate and controls were lenient. The others worked in factories or mines, where conditions were much harsher.Richard Vinen, The Unfree French: Life under the Occupation (2006) pp 183‚Äì214 Army of the Armistice French colonial prisoner in German captivity, 1940French Colonial Soldiers in German Prisoner-of-War Camps (1940‚Äì1945), Raffael Scheck, 2010, French History, p421 The Germans occupied northern France directly. The French had to pay costs for the 300,000-strong German occupation army, amounting to 20 million Reichsmarks per day, paid at the artificial rate of twenty Francs to the Reichsmark. This was 50 times the actual costs of the occupation garrison. The French government also had responsibility for preventing French citizens from escaping into exile. Article IV of the Armistice allowed for a small French army‚Äîthe Army of the Armistice (Arm√©e de l'Armistice)‚Äîstationed in the unoccupied zone, and for the military provision of the French colonial empire overseas. The function of these forces was to keep internal order and to defend French territories from Allied assault. The French forces were to remain under the overall direction of the German armed forces. The exact strength of the Vichy French Metropolitan Army was set at 3,768 officers, 15,072 non-commissioned officers, and 75,360 men. All members had to be volunteers. In addition to the army, the size of the Gendarmerie was fixed at 60,000 men plus an anti-aircraft force of 10,000 men. Despite the influx of trained soldiers from the colonial forces (reduced in size in accordance with the Armistice) there was a shortage of volunteers. As a result, 30,000 men of the class of 1939 were retained to fill the quota. At the beginning of 1942 these conscripts were released, but there were still not enough men. This shortage remained until the dissolution, despite Vichy appeals to the Germans for a regular form of conscription. The Vichy French Metropolitan Army was deprived of tanks and other armoured vehicles, and was desperately short of motorised transport, a particular problem for cavalry units. Surviving recruiting posters stress the opportunities for athletic activities, including horsemanship, reflecting both the general emphasis placed by the Vichy government on rural virtues and outdoor activities, and the realities of service in a small and technologically backward military force. Traditional features characteristic of the pre-1940 French Army, such as kepis and heavy capotes (buttoned-back greatcoats) were replaced by berets and simplified uniforms. The Vichy authorities did not deploy the Army of the Armistice against resistance groups active in the south of France, reserving this role to the Vichy Milice (militia), a paramilitary force created on 30 January 1943 by the Vichy government to combat the Resistance; so that members of the regular army could defect to the Maquis after the German occupation of southern France and the disbandment of the Army of the Armistice in November 1942. By contrast, the Milice continued to collaborate and its members were subject to reprisals after the Liberation. Vichy French colonial forces were reduced in accordance with the terms of the Armistice; still, in the Mediterranean area alone, Vichy had nearly 150,000 men under arms. There were about 55,000 in French Morocco, 50,000 in Algeria, and almost 40,000 in the Army of the Levant (Arm√©e du Levant), in Lebanon and Syria. Colonial forces were allowed to keep some armoured vehicles, though these were mostly \\"vintage\\" World War I tanks (Renault FT). German custody The Armistice required France to turn over any German citizens within the country upon German demand. The French regarded this as a \\"dishonorable\\" term since it would require France to hand over persons who had entered France seeking refuge from Germany. Attempts to negotiate the point with Germany proved unsuccessful, and the French decided not to press the issue to the point of refusing the Armistice. Vichy government Pierre Laval with the head of German police units in France, SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer Carl Oberg Pierre Laval and Philippe P√©tain in the Frank Capra documentary film Divide and Conquer (1943) On 10 July 1940, the Parliament and the government gathered in the quiet spa town of Vichy, their provisional capital in central France. (Lyon, France's second-largest city, would have been a more logical choice but mayor √âdouard Herriot was too associated with the Third Republic. Marseilles had a reputation as an organized crime hub. Toulouse was too remote and had a left- wing reputation. Vichy was centrally located and had many hotels for ministers to use.) Pierre Laval and Rapha√´l Alibert began their campaign to convince the assembled Senators and Deputies to vote full powers to P√©tain. They used every means available, promising ministerial posts to some while threatening and intimidating others. They were aided by the absence of popular, charismatic figures who might have opposed them, such as Georges Mandel and √âdouard Daladier, then aboard the ship Massilia on their way to North Africa and exile. On 10 July the National Assembly, comprising both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, voted by 569 votes to 80, with 20 voluntary abstentions, to grant full and extraordinary powers to Marshal P√©tain. By the same vote, they also granted him the power to write a new constitution. By Act No. 2 on the following day, P√©tain defined his own powers, and abrogated any Third Republic laws that were in conflict with them. (These acts would later be annulled in August 1944.) 1942 Vichy France safe-conduct passport used for Algeria Most legislators believed that democracy would continue, albeit with a new constitution. Although Laval said on 6 July that \\"parliamentary democracy has lost the war; it must disappear, ceding its place to an authoritarian, hierarchical, national and social regime\\", the majority trusted in P√©tain. L√©on Blum, who voted no, wrote three months later that Laval's \\"obvious objective was to cut all the roots that bound France to its republican and revolutionary past. His 'national revolution' was to be a counter-revolution eliminating all the progress and human rights won in the last one hundred and fifty years\\". The minority of mostly Radicals and Socialists who opposed Laval became known as the Vichy 80. Deputies and senators who voted to grant full powers to P√©tain were condemned on an individual basis after the liberation. The majority of French historians and all post-war French governments contend that this vote by the National Assembly was illegal. Three main arguments are put forward: * Abrogation of legal procedure * The impossibility for parliament to delegate its constitutional powers without controlling its use a posteriori * The 1884 constitutional amendment making it unconstitutional to put into question the \\"republican form\\" of the government Julian T. Jackson wrote that \\"There seems little doubt, therefore, that at the beginning Vichy was both legal and legitimate.\\" He stated that if legitimacy comes from popular support, P√©tain's massive popularity in France until 1942 made his government legitimate; if legitimacy comes from diplomatic recognition, over 40 countries including the United States, Canada, and China recognised the Vichy government. According to Jackson, de Gaulle's Free French acknowledged the weakness of its case against Vichy's legality by citing multiple dates (16 June, 23 June and 10 July) for the start of Vichy's illegitimate rule, implying that at least for some period of time, Vichy was not yet illegitimate. Countries recognised the Vichy government despite de Gaulle's attempts in London to dissuade them; only the German occupation of all of France in November 1942 ended diplomatic recognition. Partisans of Vichy point out that the grant of governmental powers was voted by the two chambers of the Third Republic (the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies), in conformity with the law. The argument concerning the abrogation of legal procedure is based on the absence and non-voluntary abstention of 176 representatives of the people ‚Äì the 27 on board the Massilia, and an additional 92 deputies and 57 senators, some of whom were in Vichy, but not present for the vote. In total, the parliament was composed of 846 members, 544 Deputies and 302 Senators. One Senator and 26 Deputies were on the Massilia. One Senator did not vote; 8 Senators and 12 Deputies voluntarily abstained; 57 Senators and 92 Deputies involuntarily abstained. Thus, out of a total of 544 Deputies, only 414 voted; and out of a total of 302 Senators, only 235 voted. Of these, 357 Deputies voted in favour of P√©tain and 57 against, while 212 Senators voted for P√©tain, and 23 against. Thus, P√©tain was approved by 65% of all Deputies and 70% of all Senators. Although P√©tain could claim legality for himself ‚Äì particularly in comparison with the essentially self-appointed leadership of Charles de Gaulle ‚Äì the dubious circumstances of the vote explain why a majority of French historians do not consider Vichy a complete continuity of the French state.Jean-Pierre Az√©ma, De Munich √† la Lib√©ration, Le Seuil, 1979, p.82 The text voted by the Congress stated: > The National Assembly gives full powers to the government of the Republic, > under the authority and the signature of Marshal P√©tain, to the effect of > promulgating by one or several acts a new constitution of the French state. > This constitution must guarantee the rights of labor, of family and of the > homeland.

Elle sera ratifi√©e par > la nation et appliqu√©e par les Assembl√©es qu'elle aura cr√©√©es. 1943 1 Franc coin. Front: \\"French State\\". Back: \\"Work Family Homeland\\". The Constitutional Acts of 11 and 12 July 1940 granted to P√©tain all powers (legislative, judicial, administrative, executive ‚Äì and diplomatic) and the title of \\"head of the French state\\" (chef de l'√âtat fran√ßais), as well as the right to nominate his successor. On 12 July P√©tain designated Laval as Vice- President and his designated successor, and appointed Fernand de Brinon as representative to the German High Command in Paris. P√©tain remained the head of the Vichy regime until 20 August 1944. The French national motto, Libert√©, Egalit√©, Fraternit√© (Freedom, Equality, Brotherhood), was replaced by Travail, Famille, Patrie (Work, Family, Homeland); it was noted at the time that TFP also stood for the criminal punishment of \\"travaux forc√©s √† perpetuit√©\\" (\\"forced labor in perpetuity\\").John F. Sweets, Choices in Vichy France: The French Under Nazi Occupation (New York, 1986), p. 33 Reynaud was arrested in September 1940 by the Vichy government and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1941 before the opening of the Riom Trial. P√©tain was reactionary by nature, his status as a hero of the Third Republic during World War I notwithstanding. Almost as soon as he was granted full powers, P√©tain began blaming the Third Republic's democracy and endemic corruption for France's humiliating defeat by Germany. Accordingly, his government soon began taking on authoritarian characteristics. Democratic liberties and guarantees were immediately suspended. The crime of \\"felony of opinion\\" (d√©lit d'opinion) was re- established, effectively repealing freedom of thought and expression; critics were frequently arrested. Elective bodies were replaced by nominated ones. The \\"municipalities\\" and the departmental commissions were thus placed under the authority of the administration and of the prefects (nominated by and dependent on the executive power). In January 1941 the National Council (Conseil National), composed of notables from the countryside and the provinces, was instituted under the same conditions. Despite the clear authoritarian cast of P√©tain's government, he did not formally institute a one-party state, he maintained the Tricolor and other symbols of republican France, and unlike many far rightists, he was not an anti-Dreyfusard. P√©tain excluded fascists from office in his government, and by and large his cabinet comprised \\"February 6 men\\" (i.e. members of the \\"National Union government\\" formed after the 6 February 1934 crisis following the Stavisky Affair) or mainstream politicians whose career prospects had been blocked by the triumph of the Front populaire in 1936.Ousby, Ian Occupation The Ordeal of France, 1940‚Äì1944, New York: CooperSquare Press, 2000 page 83. Foreign relations Vichy France was recognised by most Axis and neutral powers, including the US and the USSR. During the war, Vichy France conducted military actions against armed incursions from Axis and Allied belligerents, an example of armed neutrality. The most important such action was the scuttling of the French fleet in Toulon on 27 November 1942, preventing its capture by the Axis. The United States granted Vichy full diplomatic recognition, sending Admiral William D. Leahy to France as American ambassador. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Secretary of State Cordell Hull hoped to use American influence to encourage those elements in the Vichy government opposed to military collaboration with Germany. The Americans also hoped to encourage Vichy to resist German war demands, such as for air bases in French-mandated Syria or to move war supplies through French territories in North Africa. The essential American position was that France should take no action not explicitly required by the Armistice terms that could adversely affect Allied efforts in the war. The US position towards Vichy France and de Gaulle was especially hesitant and inconsistent. President Roosevelt disliked Charles de Gaulle, whom he regarded as an \\"apprentice dictator\\".When the US wanted to take over France , Annie Lacroix-Riz, in Le Monde diplomatique, May 2003 (English, French, etc.) Robert Murphy, Roosevelt's representative in North Africa, started preparing for a landing in North Africa in December 1940 (a year before the US entered the war). The US first tried to support General Maxime Weygand, general delegate of Vichy for Africa until December 1941. This first choice having failed, they turned to Henri Giraud shortly before the landing in North Africa on 8 November 1942. Finally, after Fran√ßois Darlan's turn towards the Free Forces ‚Äî Darlan had been president of the Council of Vichy from February 1941 to April 1942 ‚Äî they played him against de Gaulle. US General Mark W. Clark of the combined Allied command made Admiral Darlan sign on 22 November 1942 a treaty putting \\"North Africa at the disposition of the Americans\\" and making France \\"a vassal country\\". Washington then imagined, between 1941 and 1942, a protectorate status for France, which would be submitted after the Liberation to an Allied Military Government of Occupied Territories (AMGOT) like Germany. After the assassination of Darlan on 24 December 1942, Washington turned again towards Henri Giraud, to whom had rallied Maurice Couve de Murville, who had financial responsibilities in Vichy, and Lemaigre-Dubreuil, a former member of La Cagoule and entrepreneur, as well as Alfred Pose, general director of the Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie (National Bank for Trade and Industry). The Soviet Union maintained full diplomatic relations with the Vichy government until 30 June 1941. These were broken after Vichy expressed support for Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Due to British requests and the sensitivities of its French Canadian population, Canada maintained full diplomatic relations with the Vichy regime until the beginning of November 1942 and Case Anton ‚Äì the complete occupation of Vichy France by the Nazis. Memorial to the 1,297 French seamen who died during the British bombardment of their ships at Mers El Kebir Britain feared that the French naval fleet could end up in German hands and be used against its own naval forces, which were so vital to maintaining North Atlantic shipping and communications. Under the armistice, France had been allowed to retain the French Navy, the Marine Nationale, under strict conditions. Vichy pledged that the fleet would never fall into the hands of Germany, but refused to send the fleet beyond Germany's reach by sending it to Britain or to faraway territories of the French empire such as the West Indies. This did not satisfy Winston Churchill, who ordered French ships in British ports to be seized by the Royal Navy. Shortly after the Armistice (22 June 1940), Britain conducted the destruction of the French Fleet at Mers-el-Kebir, killing 1,297 French military personnel, and Vichy severed diplomatic relations with Britain. The French squadron at Alexandria, under Admiral Ren√©-Emile Godfroy, was effectively interned until 1943 after an agreement was reached with Admiral Andrew Browne Cunningham, commander of the British Mediterranean Fleet.Burrin, Philippe (1997). La France √† l'heure allemande 1940‚Äì1944. Paris: Seuil. After the Mers el Kebir incident, the United Kingdom recognised Free France as the legitimate government of France. Switzerland and other neutral states maintained diplomatic relations with the Vichy regime until the liberation of France in 1944 when Philippe P√©tain resigned and was deported to Germany for the creation of a forced government-in-exile.Lawrence Journal-World ‚Äì Aug 22, 1944 . Retrieved 17 January 2016. =French Indochina, Japan and Franco-Thai War= Japanese troops entering Saigon in 1941 In June 1940, the Fall of France made the French hold on Indochina tenuous. The isolated colonial administration was cut off from outside help and outside supplies. After negotiations with Japan, the French allowed the Japanese to set up military bases in Indochina.Toland, The Rising Sun This seemingly subservient behaviour convinced Major-General Plaek Pibulsonggram, the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Thailand, that Vichy France would not seriously resist a campaign by the Thai military to recover parts of Cambodia and Laos that had been taken from Thailand by France in the early 20th century. In October 1940, the military forces of Thailand attacked across the border with Indochina and launched the Franco-Thai War. Although the French won an important naval victory over the Thais, Japan forced the French to accept Japanese mediation of a peace treaty that returned the disputed territory to Thai control. The French were left in place to administer the rump colony of Indochina until 9 March 1945, when the Japanese staged a coup d'√©tat in French Indochina and took control, establishing their own colony, the Empire of Vietnam, as a double puppet state. =Colonial struggle with Free France= To counter the Vichy government, General Charles de Gaulle created the Free French Forces (FFL) after his Appeal of 18 June 1940 wireless speech. Initially, Winston Churchill was ambivalent about de Gaulle, and Churchill severed diplomatic ties with Vichy only when it became clear that the Vichy government would not join the Allies. India and Oceania Until 1962, France possessed four small, non-contiguous but politically united colonies across India, the largest being Pondicherry in Southeast India. Immediately after the fall of France, the Governor General of French India, Louis Alexis √âtienne Bonvin, declared that the French colonies in India would continue to fight with the British allies. Free French forces from that area (and others) participated in the Western Desert campaign, although news of the death of French-Indian soldiers caused some disturbances in Pondicherry. The French possessions in Oceania joined the Free French side in 1940, or in one case in 1942. They then served as bases for the Allied effort in the Pacific and contributed troops to the Free French Forces. Following the Appeal of 18 June, debate arose among the population of French Polynesia. A referendum was organised on 2 September 1940 in Tahiti and Moorea, with outlying islands reporting agreement in the following days. The vote was 5564 to 18 in favour of joining the Free French side. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, American forces identified French Polynesia as an ideal refuelling point between Hawaii and Australia and, with de Gaulle's agreement, organised \\"Operation Bobcat\\" sending nine ships with 5000 American soldiers to build a naval refuelling base and airstrip and set up coastal defence guns on Bora Bora.Triest, Willard G. \\"Gearing up for Operation Bobcat\\" in Mason, John T., editor, The Pacific War Remembered. U.S. Naval Institute Press, 2003, p. 41‚Äì51 , 9781591144786. This first experience was valuable in later Seabee (phonetic pronunciation of the naval acronym, CB, or Construction Battalion) efforts in the Pacific, and the Bora Bora base supplied the Allied ships and planes that fought the battle of the Coral Sea. Troops from French Polynesia and New Caledonia formed a Bataillon du Pacifique in 1940; became part of the 1st Free French Division in 1942, distinguishing themselves during the Battle of Bir Hakeim and subsequently combining with another unit to form the Bataillon d'infanterie de marine et du Pacifique; fought in the Italian Campaign, distinguishing themselves at the Garigliano during the Battle of Monte Cassino and on to Tuscany; and participated in the Provence landings and onwards to the liberation of France. In the New Hebrides, Henri Sautot promptly declared allegiance to the Free French on 20 July, the first colonial head to do so.Henri Sautot Order of Liberation The outcome was decided by a combination of patriotism and economic opportunism in the expectation that independence would result. Sautot subsequently sailed to New Caledonia, where he took control on 19 September. Due to its location on the edge of the Coral Sea and on the flank of Australia, New Caledonia became strategically critical in the effort to combat the Japanese advance in the Pacific in 1941‚Äì1942 and to protect the sea lanes between North America and Australia. Noum√©a served as a headquarters of the United States Navy and Army in the South Pacific,World War II Pacific Island Guide, p. 71 , Gordon L. Rottman, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002 and as a repair base for Allied vessels. New Caledonia contributed personnel both to the Bataillon du Pacifique and to the Free French Naval Forces that saw action in the Pacific and Indian Ocean. In Wallis and Futuna the local administrator and bishop sided with Vichy, but faced opposition from some of the population and clergy; their attempts at naming a local king in 1941 (to buffer the territory from their opponents) backfired as the newly elected king refused to declare allegiance to P√©tain. The situation stagnated for a long while, due to the remoteness of the islands and because no overseas ship visited the islands for 17 months after January 1941. An aviso sent from Noum√©a took over Wallis on behalf of the Free French on 27 May 1942, and Futuna on 29 May 1942. This allowed American forces to build an airbase and seaplane base on Wallis (Navy 207) that served the Allied Pacific operations. Americas A Vichy France plan to have Western Union build powerful transmitters on Saint Pierre and Miquelon in 1941 to enable private trans Atlantic communications was blocked following pressure by Roosevelt, then on 24 December 1941 Free French forces on three corvettes, supported by a submarine landed and seized control of Saint Pierre and Miquelon on orders from Charles de Gaulle without reference to any of the Allied commanders. French Guiana on the northern coast of South America, removed its Vichy supporting government on 22 March 1943, shortly after eight allied ships were sunk by a German submarine off the coast of Guiana, and the arrival of American troops by air on 20 March. Martinique became home to the bulk of the Gold reserve of the Bank of France, with 286 tons of gold transported there on the French cruiser √âmile Bertin in June 1940. The Island was blockaded by the British navy until an agreement was reached to immobilise French ships in port. The British used the gold as collateral for Lend-Lease facilities from the USA, on the basis it could be \\"acquired\\" at any time if needed. In July 1943 Free French sympathisers on the Island took control of the gold and the fleet once Admiral Georges Robert departed after a threat from America to launch a full scale invasion. Guadeloupe in the French West Indies also changed allegiance in 1943 after Admiral Georges Robert ordered police to fire on protestors, before he fled back to Europe. Equatorial and West Africa In Central Africa, three of the four colonies in French Equatorial Africa went over to the Free French almost immediately: French Chad on 26 August 1940, French Congo on 29 August 1940, and Ubangi-Shari on 30 August 1940. They were joined by the French mandate of Cameroun on 27 August 1940. One colony in French Equatorial Africa, Gabon, had to be occupied by military force between 27 October and 12 November 1940.http://www.cheminsdememoire.gouv.fr/page/affichecitoyennete.php?idLang=en&idCitoyen;=25 On 23 September 1940, the Royal Navy and Free French forces under Charles de Gaulle launched Operation Menace, an attempt to seize the strategic, Vichy- held port of Dakar in French West Africa (modern Senegal). After attempts to encourage them to join the Allies were rebuffed by the defenders, a sharp fight erupted between Vichy and Allied forces. was heavily damaged by torpedoes, and Free French troops landing at a beach south of the port were driven off by heavy fire. Even worse from a strategic point of view, bombers of the Vichy French Air Force based in North Africa began bombing the British base at Gibraltar in response to the attack on Dakar. Shaken by the resolute Vichy defence, and not wanting to further escalate the conflict, British and Free French forces withdrew on 25 September, bringing the battle to an end. On 8 November 1940, Free French forces under the command of de Gaulle and Pierre Koenig, along with the assistance of the Royal Navy, invaded Vichy-held Gabon. Gabon, which was the only territory of French Equatorial Africa that was unwilling to join the Free French Forces, fell into allied hands on 12 November 1940, after the capital Libreville was bombed and captured. The final Vichy troops in Gabon surrendered without any military confrontation with the Allies at Port-Gentil. The capture of Gabon by the Allies was crucial to ensure that the entire French Equatorial Africa was out of Axis reach. French Somaliland Map of French Somaliland, 1922 The governor of French Somaliland (now Djibouti), Brigadier-General Paul Legentilhomme, had a garrison of seven battalions of Senegalese and Somali infantry, three batteries of field guns, four batteries of anti-aircraft guns, a company of light tanks, four companies of militia and irregulars, two platoons of the camel corps and an assortment of aircraft. After visiting from 1940, Wavell decided that Legentilhomme would command the military forces in both Somalilands should war with Italy come. In June, an Italian force was assembled to capture the port city of Djibouti, the main military base. After the fall of France in June, the neutralisation of Vichy French colonies allowed the Italians to concentrate on the more lightly defended British Somaliland. On 23 July, Legentilhomme was ousted by the pro-Vichy naval officer Pierre Nouailhetas and left on 5 August for Aden, to join the Free French. In March 1941, the British enforcement of a strict contraband regime to prevent supplies being passed on to the Italians, lost its point after the conquest of the AOI. The British changed policy, with encouragement from the Free French, to \\"rally French Somaliland to the Allied cause without bloodshed\\". The Free French were to arrange a voluntary ralliement by propaganda (Operation Marie) and the British were to blockade the colony. Wavell considered that if British pressure was applied, a rally would appear to have been coerced. Wavell preferred to let the propaganda continue and provided a small amount of supplies under strict control. When the policy had no effect, Wavell suggested negotiations with the Vichy governor Louis Nouailhetas, to use the port and railway. The suggestion was accepted by the British government but because of the concessions granted to the Vichy regime in Syria, proposals were made to invade the colony instead. In June, Nouailhetas was given an ultimatum, the blockade was tightened and the Italian garrison at Assab was defeated by an operation from Aden. For six months, Nouailhetas remained willing to grant concessions over the port and railway but would not tolerate Free French interference. In October, the blockade was reviewed, but the beginning of the war with Japan in December led to all but two blockade ships being withdrawn. On 2 January 1942, the Vichy government offered the use of the port and railway, subject to the lifting of the blockade but the British refused and ended the blockade unilaterally in March. Syria and Madagascar The next flashpoint between Britain and Vichy France came when a revolt in Iraq was put down by British forces in June 1941. German Air Force (Luftwaffe) and Italian Air Force (Regia Aeronautica) aircraft, staging through the French possession of Syria, intervened in the fighting in small numbers. That highlighted Syria as a threat to British interests in the Middle East. Consequently, on 8 June, British and Commonwealth forces invaded Syria and Lebanon. This was known as the Syria- Lebanon campaign or Operation Exporter. The Syrian capital, Damascus, was captured on 17 June and the five-week campaign ended with the fall of Beirut and the Convention of Acre (Armistice of Saint Jean d'Acre) on 14 July 1941. The additional participation of Free French forces in the Syrian operation was controversial within Allied circles. It raised the prospect of Frenchmen shooting at Frenchmen, raising fears of a civil war. Additionally, it was believed that the Free French were widely reviled within Vichy military circles, and that Vichy forces in Syria were less likely to resist the British if they were not accompanied by elements of the Free French. Nevertheless, de Gaulle convinced Churchill to allow his forces to participate, although de Gaulle was forced to agree to a joint British and Free French proclamation promising that Syria and Lebanon would become fully independent at the end of the war. From 5 May to 6 November 1942, British and Commonwealth forces conducted Operation Ironclad, known as the Battle of Madagascar: the seizure of the large, Vichy French-controlled island of Madagascar, which the British feared Japanese forces might use as a base to disrupt trade and communications in the Indian Ocean. The initial landing at Di√©go-Suarez was relatively quick, though it took British forces a further six months to gain control of the entire island. French North Africa Operation Torch was the American and British invasion of French North Africa, Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, started on 8 November 1942, with landings in Morocco and Algeria. The long- term goal was to clear German and Italian forces from North Africa, enhance naval control of the Mediterranean, and prepare for an invasion of Italy in 1943. The Vichy forces initially resisted, killing 479 Allied forces and wounding 720. Vichy Admiral Darlan initiated co-operation with the Allies. The Allies recognised Darlan's self-nomination as High Commissioner of France (head of civil government) for North and West Africa. He ordered Vichy forces there to cease resisting and co-operate with the Allies, and they did so. By the time the Tunisia Campaign was fought, the French forces in North Africa had gone over to the Allied side, joining the Free French Forces.Arthur L. Funk, The Politics of Torch (1974) Henri Giraud and de Gaulle during the Casablanca Conference in January 1943 In North Africa, after the 8 November 1942 putsch by the French resistance, most Vichy figures were arrested, including General Alphonse Juin, chief commander in North Africa, and Admiral Fran√ßois Darlan. Darlan was released, and U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower finally accepted his self-nomination as High Commissioner of North Africa and French West Africa (Afrique occidentale fran√ßaise, AOF), a move that enraged de Gaulle, who refused to recognise Darlan's status. After Darlan signed an armistice with the Allies and took power in North Africa, Germany violated the 1940 armistice with France and invaded Vichy France on 10 November 1942 (operation code-named Case Anton), triggering the scuttling of the French fleet in Toulon. Henri Giraud arrived in Algiers on 10 November 1942, and agreed to subordinate himself to Admiral Darlan as the French Africa army commander. Even though Darlan was now in the Allied camp, he maintained the repressive Vichy system in North Africa, including concentration camps in southern Algeria and racist laws. Detainees were also forced to work on the Trans-Saharan Railway. Jewish goods were \\"aryanized\\" (i.e. stolen), and a special Jewish Affairs service was created, directed by Pierre Gazagne. Numerous Jewish children were prohibited from going to school, something which not even Vichy had implemented in metropolitan France. Admiral Darlan was assassinated on 24 December 1942 in Algiers by the young monarchist Bonnier de La Chapelle. Although de La Chapelle had been a member of the resistance group led by Henri d'Astier de La Vigerie, it is believed he was acting as an individual. After Admiral Darlan's assassination, Henri Giraud became his de facto successor in French Africa with Allied support. This occurred through a series of consultations between Giraud and de Gaulle. De Gaulle wanted to pursue a political position in France and agreed to have Giraud as commander- in-chief, as the more qualified military person of the two. Later, the Americans sent Jean Monnet to counsel Giraud and to press him to repeal the Vichy laws. After difficult negotiations, Giraud agreed to suppress the racist laws, and to liberate Vichy prisoners from the South Algerian concentration camps. The Cremieux decree, which granted French citizenship to Jews in Algeria and which had been repealed by Vichy, was immediately restored by General de Gaulle. Giraud took part in the Casablanca conference, with Roosevelt, Churchill, and de Gaulle, in January 1943. The Allies discussed their general strategy for the war, and recognised joint leadership of North Africa by Giraud and de Gaulle. Henri Giraud and Charles de Gaulle then became co-presidents of the Comit√© fran√ßais de la Lib√©ration Nationale, which unified the Free French Forces and territories controlled by them and had been founded at the end of 1943. Democratic rule for the European population was restored in French Algeria, and the Communists and Jews liberated from the concentration camps. At the end of April 1945 Pierre Gazagne, secretary of the general government headed by Yves Chataigneau, took advantage of his absence to exile anti-imperialist leader Messali Hadj and arrest the leaders of his party, the Algerian People's Party (PPA). On the day of the Liberation of France, the GPRF would harshly repress a rebellion in Algeria during the S√©tif massacre of 8 May 1945, which has been qualified by some historians as the \\"real beginning of the Algerian War\\". Collaboration with Nazi Germany 23 January 1943: German-Vichy French meeting in Marseilles. SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer Bernhard Griese, Marcel Lemoine (regional pr√©fet), (Commander of Marseilles Sicherheitspolizei); laughing: Ren√© Bousquet (General Secretary of the French National Police created in 1941), creator of the GMRs; behind: Louis Darquier de Pellepoix (Commissioner for Jewish Affairs). Historians distinguish between state collaboration followed by the Vichy regime, and \\"collaborationists\\", who were private French citizens eager to collaborate with Germany and who pushed towards a radicalisation of the regime. P√©tainistes, on the other hand, were direct supporters of Marshal P√©tain rather than of Germany (although they accepted P√©tain's state collaboration). State collaboration was sealed by the Montoire (Loir-et-Cher) interview in Hitler's train on 24 October 1940, during which P√©tain and Hitler shook hands and agreed on co-operation between the two states. Organized by Pierre Laval, a strong proponent of collaboration, the interview and the handshake were photographed and exploited by Nazi propaganda to gain the support of the civilian population. On 30 October 1940, P√©tain made state collaboration official, declaring on the radio: \\"I enter today on the path of collaboration.\\" On 22 June 1942, Laval declared that he was \\"hoping for the victory of Germany\\". The sincere desire to collaborate did not stop the Vichy government from organising the arrest and even sometimes the execution of German spies entering the Vichy zone.Simon Kitson, The Hunt for Nazi Spies, Fighting Espionage in Vichy France. University of Chicago Press, 2008; the French edition appeared in 2005. The composition and policies of the Vichy cabinet were mixed. Many Vichy officials, such as P√©tain, were reactionaries who felt that France's unfortunate fate was a result of its republican character and the actions of its left-wing governments of the 1930s, in particular of the Popular Front (1936‚Äì1938) led by L√©on Blum. Charles Maurras, a monarchist writer and founder of the Action Fran√ßaise movement, judged that P√©tain's accession to power was, in that respect, a \\"divine surprise\\", and many people of his persuasion believed it preferable to have an authoritarian government similar to that of Francisco Franco's Spain, even if under Germany's yoke, than to have a republican government. Others, like Joseph Darnand, were strong anti-Semites and overt Nazi sympathizers. A number of these joined the units of the L√©gion des Volontaires Fran√ßais contre le Bolch√©visme (Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism) fighting on the Eastern Front, later becoming the SS Charlemagne Division.J.Lee Ready (1995), World War Two. Nation by Nation, London, Cassell, page 86. On the other hand, technocrats such as Jean Bichelonne and engineers from the Groupe X-Crise used their position to push various state, administrative, and economic reforms. These reforms have been cited as evidence of a continuity of the French administration before and after the war. Many of these civil servants and the reforms they advocated were retained after the war. Just as the necessities of a war economy during the First World War had pushed forward state measures to reorganise the economy of France against the prevailing classical liberal theories ‚Äì structures retained after the 1919 Treaty of Versailles ‚Äì reforms adopted during World War II were kept and extended. Along with the 15 March 1944 Charter of the Conseil National de la R√©sistance (CNR), which gathered all Resistance movements under one unified political body, these reforms were a primary instrument in the establishment of post-war dirigisme, a kind of semi-planned economy which led to France becoming a modern social democracy. An example of such continuities is the creation of the French Foundation for the Study of Human Problems by Alexis Carrel, a renowned physician who also supported eugenics. This institution was renamed as the National Institute of Demographic Studies (INED) after the war and exists to this day. Another example is the creation of the national statistics institute, renamed INSEE after the Liberation. The reorganisation and unification of the French police by Ren√© Bousquet, who created the groupes mobiles de r√©serve (GMR, Reserve Mobile Groups), is another example of Vichy policy reform and restructuring maintained by subsequent governments. A national paramilitary police force, the GMR was occasionally used in actions against the French Resistance, but its main purpose was to enforce Vichy authority through intimidation and repression of the civilian population. After Liberation, some of its units were merged with the Free French Army to form the Compagnies R√©publicaines de S√©curit√© (CRS, Republican Security Companies), France's main anti-riot force. =Racial policies and collaboration= French Police registering new inmates at the Pithiviers camp French Milice guarding detainees Germany interfered little in internal French affairs for the first two years after the armistice, as long as public order was maintained. As soon as it was established, P√©tain's government voluntarily took measures against \\"undesirables\\": Jews, m√©t√®ques (immigrants from Mediterranean countries), Freemasons, Communists, Gypsies (also known as Romani), homosexuals, and left-wing activists. Inspired by Charles Maurras's conception of the \\"Anti-France\\" (which he defined as the \\"four confederate states of Protestants, Jews, Freemasons, and foreigners\\"), Vichy persecuted these supposed enemies. In July 1940, Vichy set up a special commission charged with reviewing naturalisations granted since the 1927 reform of the nationality law. Between June 1940 and August 1944, 15,000 persons, mostly Jews, were denaturalised.Fran√ßois Masure, \\"√âtat et identit√© nationale. Un rapport ambigu √† propos des naturalis√©s\\", in Journal des anthropologues, hors- s√©rie 2007, pp. 39‚Äì49 (see p. 48) This bureaucratic decision was instrumental in their subsequent internment in the green ticket roundup. The Internment camps in France inaugurated by the Third Republic were immediately put to new use, ultimately becoming transit camps for the implementation of the Holocaust and the extermination of all undesirables, including the Romani people (who refer to the extermination of the Romani as Porrajmos). A Vichy law of 4 October 1940 authorised internments of foreign Jews on the sole basis of a prefectoral order,Dominique R√©my, Les Lois de Vichy, Romillat, 2004, p.91, and the first raids took place in May 1941. Vichy imposed no restrictions on black people in the Unoccupied Zone; the regime even had a mulatto cabinet minister, the Martinique-born lawyer Henry L√©mery.Vichy France and the Jews . Michael Robert Marrus, Robert O. Paxton (1995). Stanford University Press. pp. 367‚Äì368. The Third Republic had first opened concentration camps during World War I for the internment of enemy aliens and later used them for other purposes. Camp Gurs, for example, had been set up in southwestern France after the fall of Catalonia, in the first months of 1939, during the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939), to receive the Republican refugees, including Brigadists from all nations, fleeing the Francoists. After √âdouard Daladier's government (April 1938 ‚Äì March 1940) took the decision to outlaw the French Communist Party (PCF) following the signing of the German‚ÄìSoviet non-aggression pact (the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact) in August 1939, these camps were also used to intern French communists. Drancy internment camp was founded in 1939 for this use; it later became the central transit camp through which all deportees passed on their way to concentration and extermination camps in the Third Reich and Eastern Europe. When the Phoney War started with France's declaration of war against Germany on 3 September 1939, these camps were used to intern enemy aliens. These included German Jews and anti-fascists, but any German citizen (or other Axis national) could also be interned in Camp Gurs and others. As the Wehrmacht advanced into Northern France, common prisoners evacuated from prisons were also interned in these camps. Camp Gurs received its first contingent of political prisoners in June 1940. It included left- wing activists (communists, anarchists, trade-unionists, anti-militarists) and pacifists, as well as French fascists who supported Italy and Germany. Finally, after P√©tain's proclamation of the \\"French State\\" and the beginning of the implementation of the \\"R√©volution nationale\\" (National Revolution), the French administration opened up many concentration camps, to the point that, as historian Maurice Rajsfus writes, \\"The quick opening of new camps created employment, and the Gendarmerie never ceased to hire during this period.\\"Maurice Rajsfus, Drancy, un camp de concentration tr√®s ordinaire, Cherche Midi √©diteur (2005). Besides the political prisoners already detained there, Gurs was then used to intern foreign Jews, stateless persons, Romani, homosexuals, and prostitutes. Vichy opened its first internment camp in the northern zone on 5 October 1940, in Aincourt, in the Seine-et-Oise department, which it quickly filled with PCF members.Aincourt, camp d'internement et centre de tri The Royal Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans, in the Doubs, was used to intern Romani. The Camp des Milles, near Aix-en-Provence, was the largest internment camp in the Southeast of France; twenty-five hundred Jews were deported from there following the August 1942 raids. Exiled Republican, antifascist Spaniards who had sought refuge in France after the Nationalist victory in the Spanish Civil War were then deported, and 5,000 of them died in Mauthausen concentration camp.Film documentary on the website of the Cit√© nationale de l'histoire de l'immigration In contrast, French colonial soldiers were interned by the Germans in French territory instead of being deported. Besides the concentration camps opened by Vichy, the Germans also opened some Ilags (Internierungslager) for the detention of enemy aliens on French territory; in Alsace, which was under the direct administration of the Reich, they opened the Natzweiler camp, the only concentration camp created by the Nazis on French territory. Natzweiler included a gas chamber, which was used to exterminate at least 86 detainees (mostly Jewish) with the aim of obtaining a collection of undamaged skeletons for the use of Nazi professor August Hirt. The Vichy government took a number of racially motivated measures. In August 1940, laws against antisemitism in the media (the Marchandeau Act) were repealed, while decree n¬∞1775 of 5 September 1943 denaturalised a number of French citizens, in particular Jews from Eastern Europe. Foreigners were rounded-up in \\"Foreign Workers' Groups\\" (groupements de travailleurs √©trangers) and as with the colonial troops, used by the Germans as manpower. The Statute on Jews excluded them from the civil administration. Vichy also enacted racial laws in its territories in North Africa. \\"The history of the Holocaust in France's three North African colonies (Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia) is intrinsically tied to France's fate during this period.\\" With regard to economic contribution to the German economy, it is estimated that France provided 42% of the total foreign aid.Christoph Buchheim, 'Die besetzten Lander im Dienste der Deutschen Kriegswirtschaft', VfZ, 32, (1984), p. 119 Eugenics policies In 1941, Nobel Prize winner Alexis Carrel, an early proponent of eugenics and euthanasia, and a member of Jacques Doriot's French Popular Party (PPF), advocated for the creation of the Fondation Fran√ßaise pour l'√âtude des Probl√®mes Humains (French Foundation for the Study of Human Problems), using connections to the P√©tain cabinet. Charged with the \\"study, in all of its aspects, of measures aimed at safeguarding, improving and developing the French population in all of its activities\\", the Foundation was created by decree of the collaborationist Vichy regime in 1941, and Carrel was appointed as \\"regent\\".See Reggiani, Alexis Carrel, the Unknown: Eugenics and Population Research under Vichy , French Historical Studies, 2002; 25: 331‚Äì356 The Foundation also had for some time as general secretary Fran√ßois Perroux. The Foundation was behind the 16 December 1942 Act mandating the \\"prenuptial certificate\\", which required all couples seeking marriage to submit to a biological examination, to ensure the \\"good health\\" of the spouses, in particular with regard to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and \\"life hygiene\\". Carrel's institute also conceived the \\"scholar booklet\\" (\\"livret scolaire\\"), which could be used to record students' grades in French secondary schools and thus classify and select them according to scholastic performance. Besides these eugenic activities aimed at classifying the population and improving its health, the Foundation also supported an 11 October 1946 law instituting occupational medicine, enacted by the Provisional Government of the French Republic (GPRF) after the Liberation. The Foundation initiated studies on demographics (Robert Gessain, Paul Vincent, Jean Bourgeois), nutrition (Jean Sutter), and housing (Jean Merlet), as well as the first polls (Jean Stoetzel). The foundation, which after the war became the INED demographics institute, employed 300 researchers from the summer of 1942 to the end of the autumn of 1944.Gwen Terrenoire, \\"Eugenics in France (1913‚Äì1941) : a review of research findings \\", Joint Programmatic Commission UNESCO-ONG Science and Ethics, 2003 \\"The foundation was chartered as a public institution under the joint supervision of the ministries of finance and public health. It was given financial autonomy and a budget of forty million francs, roughly one franc per inhabitant: a true luxury considering the burdens imposed by the German Occupation on the nation's resources. By way of comparison, the whole Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) was given a budget of fifty million francs.\\" Alexis Carrel had previously published in 1935 the best-selling book L'Homme, cet inconnu (\\"Man, This Unknown\\"). Since the early 1930s, Carrel had advocated the use of gas chambers to rid humanity of its \\"inferior stock\\", endorsing the scientific racism discourse. One of the founders of these pseudoscientifical theories had been Arthur de Gobineau in his 1853‚Äì1855 essay titled \\"An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races\\". In the 1936 preface to the German edition of his book, Alexis Carrel had added a praise to the eugenics policies of the Third Reich, writing the following: > The German government has taken energetic measures against the propagation > of the defective, the mentally diseased, and the criminal. The ideal > solution would be the suppression of each of these individuals as soon as he > has proven himself to be dangerous.Quoted in Andr√©s Horacio Reggiani. Alexis > Carrel, the Unknown: Eugenics and Population Research under Vichy (French > historical studies, 25:2 Spring 2002), p. 339. Also quoted in French by > Didier Daeninckx in Carrel also wrote this in his book: > The conditioning of petty criminals with the whip, or some more scientific > procedure, followed by a short stay in hospital, would probably suffice to > ensure order. Those who have murdered, robbed while armed with automatic > pistol or machine gun, kidnapped children, despoiled the poor of their > savings, misled the public in important matters, should be humanely and > economically disposed of in small euthanasic institutions supplied with > proper gasses. A similar treatment could be advantageously applied to the > insane, guilty of criminal acts.Quoted in Szasz, Thomas. The Theology of > Medicine New York: Syracuse University Press, 1977. Alexis Carrel had also taken an active part to a symposium in Pontigny organised by Jean Coutrot, the \\"Entretiens de Pontigny\\". Scholars such as Lucien Bonnaf√©, Patrick Tort, and Max Lafont have accused Carrel of responsibility for the execution of thousands of mentally ill or impaired patients under Vichy. Statute on Jews Poster above the entrance of an anti-semitic exhibition called \\"The Jew and France\\" A Nazi ordinance dated 21 September 1940 forced Jews of the \\"occupied zone\\" to declare themselves as such at a police station or sub-prefectures (sous-pr√©fectures). Under the responsibility of Andr√© Tulard, head of the Service on Foreign Persons and Jewish Questions at the Prefecture of Police of Paris, a filing system registering Jewish people was created. Tulard had previously created such a filing system under the Third Republic, registering members of the Communist Party (PCF). In the department of the Seine, encompassing Paris and its immediate suburbs, nearly 150,000 persons, unaware of the upcoming danger and assisted by the police, presented themselves at police stations in accordance with the military order. The registered information was then centralised by the French police, who constructed, under the direction of inspector Tulard, a central filing system. According to the Dannecker report, \\"this filing system is subdivided into files alphabetically classed, Jewish with French nationality and foreign Jewish having files of different colours, and the files were also classed, according to profession, nationality and street [of residency]\\".French: ¬´ ce fichier se subdivise en fichier simplement alphab√©tique, les Juifs de nationalit√© fran√ßaise et √©trang√®re ayant respectivement des fiches de couleur diff√©rentes, et des fichiers professionnels par nationalit√© et par rue. ¬ª These files were then handed over to Theodor Dannecker, head of the Gestapo in France, under the orders of Adolf Eichmann, head of the RSHA IV-D. They were used by the Gestapo on various raids, among them the August 1941 raid in the 11th arrondissement of Paris, which resulted in 3,200 foreign and 1,000 French Jews being interned in various camps, including Drancy. On 3 October 1940, the Vichy government voluntarily promulgated the first Statute on Jews, which created a special underclass of French Jewish citizens, and enforced, for the first time in France, racial segregation.The Guardian: Disclosed: the zealous way Marshal P√©tain enforced Nazi anti-Semitic laws , 3 October 2010, last accessed 3 October 2010 The October 1940 Statute excluded Jews from the administration, the armed forces, entertainment, arts, media, and certain professions, such as teaching, law, and medicine. A Commissariat-General for Jewish Affairs (CGQJ, Commissariat G√©n√©ral aux Questions Juives) was created on 29 March 1941. It was directed by Xavier Vallat until May 1942 and then by Darquier de Pellepoix until February 1944. Mirroring the Reich Association of Jews, the Union G√©n√©rale des Isra√©lites de France was founded. The police oversaw the confiscation of telephones and radios from Jewish homes and enforced a curfew on Jews starting in February 1942. They also enforced requirements that Jews not appear in public places and ride only on the last car of the Parisian metro. Along with many French police officials, Andr√© Tulard was present on the day of the inauguration of Drancy internment camp in 1941, which was used largely by French police as the central transit camp for detainees captured in France. All Jews and others \\"undesirables\\" passed through Drancy before heading to Auschwitz and other camps. =July 1942 Vel' d'Hiv Roundup= Two Jewish women in occupied Paris wearing yellow badges before the mass arrests In July 1942, under German orders, the French police organised the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup (Rafle du Vel' d'Hiv) under orders by Ren√© Bousquet and his second in Paris, Jean Leguay, with co-operation from authorities of the SNCF, the state railway company. The police arrested 13,152 Jews, including 4,051 children‚Äîwhich the Gestapo had not asked for‚Äîand 5,082 women, on 16 and 17 July and imprisoned them in the Winter Velodrome in unhygienic conditions. They were led to Drancy internment camp (run by Nazi Alois Brunner and French constabulary police) and crammed into box cars and shipped by rail to Auschwitz. Most of the victims died en route due to lack of food or water. The remaining survivors were sent to the gas chambers. This action alone represented more than a quarter of the 42,000 French Jews sent to concentration camps in 1942, of whom only 811 would return after the end of the war. Although the Nazi VT (Verf√ºgungstruppe) had directed the action, French police authorities vigorously participated. \\"There was no effective police resistance until the end of Spring of 1944\\", wrote historians Jean-Luc Einaudi and Maurice Rajsfus. =August 1942 and January 1943 raids= The French police, headed by Bousquet, arrested 7,000 Jews in the southern zone in August 1942. 2,500 of them transited through the Camp des Milles near Aix-en- Provence before joining Drancy. Then, on 22, 23, and 24 January 1943, assisted by Bousquet's police force, the Germans organised a raid in Marseilles. During the Battle of Marseilles, the French police checked the identity documents of 40,000 people, and the operation succeeded in sending 2,000 Marseillese people in the death trains, leading to the extermination camps. The operation also encompassed the expulsion of an entire neighbourhood (30,000 persons) in the Old Port before its destruction. For this occasion, SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer Karl Oberg, in charge of the German Police in France, made the trip from Paris and transmitted to Bousquet orders directly received from Heinrich Himmler. It is another notable case of the French police's willful collaboration with the Nazis.Maurice Rajsfus, La Police de Vichy. Les Forces de l'ordre fran√ßaises au service de la Gestapo, 1940/1944, Le Cherche-midi √©diteur, 1995. Chapter XIV, La Bataille de Marseille, pp. 209‚Äì217. =Jewish death toll= In 1940, approximately 350,000 Jews lived in metropolitan France, less than half of them with French citizenship (the others being foreign, mostly exiles from Germany during the 1930s). About 200,000 of them, and the large majority of foreign Jews, resided in Paris and its outskirts. Among the 150,000 French Jews, about 30,000, generally native from Central Europe, had been naturalised French during the 1930s. Of the total, approximately 25,000 French Jews and 50,000 foreign Jews were deported.Az√©ma, Jean-Pierre and B√©darida, Fran√ßois (dir.), La France des ann√©es noires, 2 vol., Paris, Seuil, 1993 [r√©√©d. Seuil, 2000 (Points Histoire)] According to historian Robert Paxton, 76,000 Jews were deported and died in concentration and extermination camps. Including the Jews who died in concentration camps in France, this would have made for a total figure of 90,000 Jewish deaths (a quarter of the total Jewish population before the war, by his estimate).Le r√¥le du gouvernement de Vichy dans la d√©portation des juifs, notes taken during a conference of Robert Paxton at Lyon on 4 November 2000 Paxton's numbers imply that 14,000 Jews died in French concentration camps, but the systematic census of Jewish deportees from France (citizens or not) drawn under Serge Klarsfeld concluded that 3,000 had died in French concentration camps and 1,000 more had been shot. Of the approximately 76,000 deported, 2,566 survived. The total thus reported is slightly below 77,500 dead (somewhat less than a quarter of the Jewish population in France in 1940).Summary from data compiled by the Association des Fils et Filles des d√©port√©s juifs de France, 1985. Proportionally, either number makes for a lower death toll than in some other countries (in the Netherlands, 75% of the Jewish population was murdered). This fact has been used as arguments by supporters of Vichy; according to Paxton, the figure would have been greatly lower if the \\"French state\\" had not willfully collaborated with Germany, which lacked staff for police activities. During the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup of July 1942, Laval ordered the deportation of children, against explicit German orders. Paxton pointed out that if the total number of victims had not been higher, it was due to the shortage in wagons, the resistance of the civilian population, and deportation in other countries (notably in Italy). =Government responsibility= Commemorative plaque to the victims held in the Vel' d'Hiv after the 16‚Äì17 July 1942 roundup of Jews in Paris For decades, the French government argued that the French Republic had been dismantled when Philippe P√©tain instituted a new French State during the war and that the Republic had been re-established when the war was over. It was not for the Republic, therefore, to apologise for events that happened while it had not existed and that had been carried out by a State it did not recognise. For example, former President Fran√ßois Mitterrand had maintained that the Vichy Government, not France's Republic, was responsible. This position was more recently reiterated by Marine Le Pen, leader of the National Front Party, during the 2017 election campaign. The first official admission that the French State had been complicit in the deportation of 76,000 Jews during WW II was made in 1995 by then President Jacques Chirac, at the site of the V√©lodrome d'Hiver, where 13,000 Jews had been rounded up for deportation to death camps in July 1942. \\"France, on that day [16 July 1942], committed the irreparable. Breaking its word, it handed those who were under its protection over to their executioners,\\" he said. Those responsible for the roundup were \\"450 policemen and gendarmes, French, under the authority of their leaders [who] obeyed the demands of the Nazis..... the criminal folly of the occupiers was seconded by the French, by the French state\\".Allocution de M. Jacques CHIRAC Pr√©sident de la R√©publique prononc√©e lors des c√©r√©monies comm√©morant la grande rafle des 16 et 17 juillet 1942 (Paris) , Pr√©sident de la r√©publique On 16 July 2017, also at a ceremony at the Vel' d'Hiv site, President Emmanuel Macron denounced the country's role in the Holocaust in France and the historical revisionism that denied France's responsibility for the 1942 roundup and subsequent deportation of 13,000 Jews. \\"It was indeed France that organised this\\", Macron insisted, French police collaborating with the Nazis. \\"Not a single German\\" was directly involved,\\" he added. Macron was even more specific than Chirac had been in stating that the Government during the War was certainly that of France. \\"It is convenient to see the Vichy regime as born of nothingness, returned to nothingness. Yes, it's convenient, but it is false. We cannot build pride upon a lie.\\" Macron made a subtle reference to Chirac's remark when he added, \\"I say it again here. It was indeed France that organized the roundup, the deportation, and thus, for almost all, death.\\" Military Portions of the French military fell into Vichy control: General Charles Nogu√®s served as commander-in-chief of Vichy French Forces. Vichy French Navy were under the command of Admiral Fran√ßois Darlan with naval garrison in Toulon. Vichy French Air Force was led by General Jean Romatet with involvement in actions in North Africa. Collaborationnistes L√©gion des Volontaires fighting with the Axis on the Eastern front Stanley Hoffmann in 1974, and after him, other historians such as Robert Paxton and Jean-Pierre Az√©ma have used the term collaborationnistes to refer to fascists and Nazi sympathisers who, for ideological reasons, wished a reinforced collaboration with Hitler's Germany. Examples of these are Parti Populaire Fran√ßais (PPF) leader Jacques Doriot, writer Robert Brasillach or Marcel D√©at. A principal motivation and ideological foundation among collaborationnistes was anticommunism. Collaborationnisme (collaborationism) should be distinguished from collaboration. Collaboration refers to those of the French who for whatever reason collaborated with the Germans whereas collaborationism refers to those, primarily from the fascist right, who embraced the goal of a German victory as their own. Organizations such as La Cagoule opposed the Third Republic, particularly when the left-wing Popular Front was in power. Collaborationists may have influenced the Vichy government's policies, but ultra-collaborationists never comprised the majority of the government before 1944. To enforce the r√©gime's will, some paramilitary organisations were created. A notable example was the \\"L√©gion Fran√ßaise des Combattants\\" (LFC) (French Legion of Fighters), including at first only former combatants, but quickly adding \\"Amis de la L√©gion\\" and cadets of the L√©gion, who had never seen battle, but who supported P√©tain's r√©gime. The name was then quickly changed to \\"L√©gion Fran√ßaise des Combattants et des volontaires de la R√©volution Nationale\\" (French Legion of Fighters and Volunteers of the National Revolution). Joseph Darnand created a \\"Service d'Ordre L√©gionnaire\\" (SOL), which consisted mostly of French supporters of the Nazis, of which P√©tain fully approved. Social and economic history Vichy French zinc and aluminium coins made during the war. These coins circulated in both the German‚Äìoccupied zone and Vichy's unoccupied zone. Vichy authorities were strongly opposed to \\"modern\\" social trends and tried through \\"national regeneration\\" to restore behaviour more in line with traditional Catholicism. Philip Manow argues that, \\"Vichy represents the authoritarian, antidemocratic solution that the French political right, in coalition with the national Church hierarchy, had sought repeatedly during the interwar period and almost put in place in 1934.\\"Philip Manow, \\"Workers, farmers and Catholicism: A history of political class coalitions and the south-European welfare state regime\\". Journal of European Social Policy 25.1 (2015): 32‚Äì49. Calling for \\"National Regeneration\\", Vichy reversed many liberal policies and began tight supervision of the economy with central planning a key feature. Labor unions came under tight government control. There were no elections. The independence of women was reversed, with an emphasis put on motherhood. Government agencies had to fire married women employees. Conservative Catholics became prominent. Paris lost its avant-garde status in European art and culture. The media were tightly controlled and stressed virulent anti-Semitism, and, after June 1941, anti-Bolshevism. Hans Petter Graver says Vichy \\"is notorious for its enactment of anti-Semitic laws and decrees, and these were all loyally enforced by the judiciary\\".Hans Petter Graver, \\"The Opposition\\". in Judges Against Justice (Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2015) pp. 91‚Äì112. =Economy= Vichy rhetoric exalted the skilled labourer and small businessman. In practice, the needs of artisans for raw materials were neglected in favour of large businesses. The General Committee for the Organization of Commerce (CGOC) was a national program to modernise and professionalise small business. In 1940 the government took direct control of all production, which was synchronised with the demands of the Germans. It replaced free trade unions with compulsory state unions that dictated labour policy without regard to the voice or needs of the workers. The centralised, bureaucratic control of the French economy was not a success, as German demands grew heavier and more unrealistic, passive resistance and inefficiencies multiplied, and Allied bombers hit the rail yards; Vichy made the first comprehensive long-range plans for the French economy. The government had never before attempted a comprehensive overview. De Gaulle's Provisional Government in 1944‚Äì45 quietly used the Vichy plans as a base for its own reconstruction program. The Monnet Plan of 1946 was closely based on Vichy plans. Thus both teams of wartime and early postwar planners repudiated prewar laissez-faire practices and embraced the cause of drastic economic overhaul and a planned economy. Forced labour Nazi Germany kept French POWs as forced labourers throughout the war. They added compulsory (and volunteer) workers from occupied nations, especially in metal factories. The shortage of volunteers led the Vichy government to pass a law in September 1942 that effectively deported workers to Germany, where they constituted fifteen percent of the labour force by August 1944. The largest number worked in the giant Krupp steel works in Essen. Low pay, long hours, frequent bombings, and crowded air raid shelters added to the unpleasantness of poor housing, inadequate heating, limited food, and poor medical care, all compounded by harsh Nazi discipline. They finally returned home in the summer of 1945. The forced labour draft encouraged the French Resistance and undermined the Vichy government. Food shortages Civilians suffered shortages of all varieties of consumer goods. The rationing system was stringent and badly mismanaged, leading to malnourishment, black markets, and hostility to state management of the food supply. The Germans seized about twenty percent of the French food production, causing severe disruption to the French household economy. French farm production fell by half because of lack of fuel, fertiliser and workers; even so the Germans seized half the meat, twenty percent of the produce, and two percent of the champagne. Supply problems quickly affected French stores, which lacked most items. The government answered by rationing, but German officials set the policies and hunger prevailed, especially affecting youth in urban areas. The queues lengthened in front of shops. Some people‚Äîincluding German soldiers‚Äîbenefited from the black market, where food was sold without tickets at very high prices. Farmers especially diverted meat to the black market, which meant that much less for the open market. Counterfeit food tickets were also in circulation. Direct buying from farmers in the countryside and barter against cigarettes became common. These activities were strictly forbidden, and thus carried the risk of confiscation and fines. Food shortages were most acute in the large cities. In the more remote country villages, clandestine slaughtering, vegetable gardens and the availability of milk products permitted better survival. The official ration provided starvation level diets of one thousand thirteen or fewer calories a day, supplemented by home gardens and, especially, black market purchases. =Women= The two million French soldiers held as POWs and forced labourers in Germany throughout the war were not at risk of death in combat but the anxieties of separation for their 800,000 wives were high. The government provided a modest allowance, but one in ten became prostitutes to support their families. Meanwhile, the Vichy regime promoted a highly traditional model of female roles. The R√©volution Nationale official ideology fostered the patriarchal family, headed by a man with a subservient wife who was devoted to her many children. It gave women a key symbolic role to carry out the national regeneration. It used propaganda, women's organisations, and legislation to promote maternity, patriotic duty, and female submission to marriage, home, and children's education. The falling birthrate appeared to be a grave problem to Vichy. It introduced family allowances and opposed birth control and abortion. Conditions were very difficult for housewives, as food was short as well as most necessities. Mother's Day became a major date in the Vichy calendar, with festivities in the towns and schools featuring the award of medals to mothers of numerous children. Divorce laws were made much more stringent, and restrictions were placed on the employment of married women. Family allowances that had begun in the 1930s were continued, and became a vital lifeline for many families; it was a monthly cash bonus for having more children. In 1942 the birth rate started to rise, and by 1945 it was higher than it had been for a century. On the other side women of the Resistance, many of whom were associated with combat groups linked to the French Communist Party (PCF), broke the gender barrier by fighting side by side with men. After the war, their services were ignored, but France did give women the vote in 1944. German invasion, November 1942 Progressive end of the Vichy regime Hitler ordered Case Anton to occupy Corsica and then the rest of the unoccupied southern zone in immediate reaction to the landing of the Allies in North Africa (Operation Torch) on 8 November 1942. Following the conclusion of the operation on 12 November, Vichy's remaining military forces were disbanded. Vichy continued to exercise its remaining jurisdiction over almost all of metropolitan France, with the residual power devolved into the hands of Laval, until the gradual collapse of the regime following the Allied invasion in June 1944. On 7 September 1944, following the Allied invasion of France, the remainders of the Vichy government cabinet fled to Germany and established a puppet government in exile in the so-called Sigmaringen enclave. That rump government finally fell when the city was taken by the Allied French army in April 1945. Part of the residual legitimacy of the Vichy regime resulted from the continued ambivalence of U.S. and other leaders. President Roosevelt continued to cultivate Vichy, and promoted General Henri Giraud as a preferable alternative to de Gaulle, despite the poor performance of Vichy forces in North Africa‚ÄîAdmiral Fran√ßois Darlan had landed in Algiers the day before Operation Torch. Algiers was headquarters of the Vichy French XIX Army Corps, which controlled Vichy military units in North Africa. Darlan was neutralised within 15 hours by a 400-strong French resistance force. Roosevelt and Churchill accepted Darlan, rather than de Gaulle, as the French leader in North Africa. De Gaulle had not even been informed of the landing in North Africa.Extraits de l'entretien d'Annie Rey-Goldzeiguer [1, avec Christian Makarian et Dominique Simonnet, publi√© dans l'Express du 14 mars 2002], on the LDH website The United States also resented the Free French taking control of St Pierre and Miquelon on 24 December 1941, because, Secretary of State Cordell Hull believed, it interfered with a U.S.-Vichy agreement to maintain the status quo with respect to French territorial possessions in the western hemisphere. Following the invasion of France via Normandy and Provence (Operation Overlord and Operation Dragoon) and the departure of the Vichy leaders, the U.S., Britain and the Soviet Union finally recognised the Provisional Government of the French Republic (GPRF) headed by de Gaulle as the legitimate government of France on 23 October 1944. Before that, the first return of democracy to Metropolitan France since 1940 had occurred with the declaration of the Free Republic of Vercors on 3 July 1944, at the behest of the Free French government‚Äîbut that act of resistance was quashed by an overwhelming German attack by the end of July. Decline of the regime =Independence of the SOL= Against Communism / French Militia / Secretary-General Joseph Darnand\\". In 1943 the Service d'ordre l√©gionnaire (SOL) collaborationist militia, headed by Joseph Darnand, became independent and was transformed into the \\"Milice fran√ßaise\\" (French Militia). Officially directed by Pierre Laval himself, the SOL was led by Darnand, who held an SS rank and pledged an oath of loyalty to Adolf Hitler. Under Darnand and his sub-commanders, such as Paul Touvier and Jacques de Bernonville, the Milice was responsible for helping the German forces and police in the repression of the French Resistance and Maquis. =Sigmaringen commission= The Sigmaringen operation was based in the city's ancient castle. Liberation of France, 1944 Following the Liberation of Paris on 25 August 1944, P√©tain and his ministers were taken to Sigmaringen by the German forces. After both P√©tain and Laval refused to cooperate, Fernand de Brinon was selected by the Germans to establish a pseudo-government in exile at Sigmaringen. P√©tain refused to participate further and the Sigmaringen operation had little or no authority. The offices used the official title \\"French Government Commission for the Defense of National Interests\\" () and informally was known as the \\"French Delegation\\" (). The enclave had its own radio station (Radio-patrie, Ici la France) and official press (, Le Petit Parisien), and hosted the embassies of Axis powers Germany and Japan, as well as an Italian consulate. The population of the enclave was about 6,000, including known collaborationist journalists, the writers Louis- Ferdinand C√©line and Lucien Rebatet, the actor Robert Le Vigan, and their families, as well as 500 soldiers, 700 French SS, prisoners of war and French civilian forced labourers. The Commission lasted for seven months, surviving Allied bombing runs, poor nutrition and housing, and a bitterly cold winter where temperatures plunged to , while residents nervously watched the advancing Allied troops drawing closer and discussed rumors. On 21 April 1945 General de Lattre ordered his forces to take Sigmaringen. The end came within days. By the 26th, P√©tain was in the hands of French authorities in Switzerland, and Laval had fled to Spain. Brinon, Luchaire, and Darnand were captured, tried, and executed by 1947. Other members escaped to Italy or Spain. The Vichy regime was no more. Aftermath =Provisional government= The Free French, concerned that the Allies might decide to put France under administration of the Allied Military Government for Occupied Territories, strove to establish quickly the Provisional Government of the French Republic. The first action of that government was to re-establish republican legality throughout metropolitan France. The provisional government considered the Vichy government to have been unconstitutional and all its actions therefore without legitimate authority. All \\"constitutional acts, legislative or regulatory\\" taken by the Vichy government, as well as decrees taken to implement them, were declared null and void by the Order of 9 August 1944. Inasmuch as blanket rescission of all acts taken by Vichy (i.e., including measures that might have been taken by a legitimate republican government) was deemed impractical, though, the Order provided that acts not expressly noted as nullified in the Order were to continue to receive \\"provisional application\\". Many acts were explicitly repealed, including all acts that Vichy had called \\"constitutional acts\\", all acts that discriminated against Jews, all acts related to so-called \\"secret societies\\" (e.g., Freemasons), and all acts that established special tribunals. Collaborationist paramilitary and political organisations, such as the Milice and the Service d'ordre l√©gionnaire, were also dissolved. The provisional government also took steps to replace local governments, including governments that had been suppressed by the Vichy regime, through new elections or by extending the terms of those who had been elected not later than 1939. =Purges= After the liberation, France was swept for a short period with a wave of executions of Collaborationists. Collaborationists were brought to the V√©lodrome d'hiver, Fresnes prison or the Drancy internment camp. Women who were suspected of having romantic liaisons with Germans, or more often of being prostitutes who had entertained German customers, were publicly humiliated by having their heads shaved. Those who had engaged in the black market were also stigmatised as \\"war profiteers\\" (profiteurs de guerre), and popularly called \\"BOF\\" (Beurre Oeuf Fromage, or Butter Eggs Cheese, because of the products sold at outrageous prices during the Occupation). The Provisional Government of the French Republic (GPRF, 1944‚Äì46) quickly reestablished order, and brought Collaborationists before the courts. Many convicted Collaborationists were then given amnesty under the Fourth Republic (1946‚Äì54). Four different periods are distinguished by historians: * the first phase of popular convictions (√©puration sauvage ‚Äì wild purge): extrajudicial executions and shaving of women's heads. Estimations by police prefects made in 1948 and 1952 counted as many as 6,000 executions before the Liberation, and 4,000 afterward. * the second phase (√©puration l√©gale or legal purge), which began with Charles de Gaulle's 26 and 27 June 1944 purge ordonnances (de Gaulle's first ordonnance instituting purge Commissions was enacted on 18 August 1943): judgments of Collaborationists by the Commissions d'√©puration, who condemned approximately 120,000 persons (e.g. Charles Maurras, leader of the royalist Action Fran√ßaise, was thus condemned to a life sentence on 25 January 1945), including 1,500 death sentences (Joseph Darnand, head of the Milice, and Pierre Laval, head of the French state, were executed after trial on 4 October 1945, Robert Brasillach, executed on 6 February 1945, etc.)‚Äîmany of those who survived this phase were later given amnesty. * the third phase, more lenient towards Collaborationists (the trial of Philippe P√©tain or of writer Louis- Ferdinand C√©line). * finally came the period for amnesty and graces (e.g.,. Jean-Pierre Esteva, Xavier Vallat, creator of the General Commission for Jewish Affairs, Ren√© Bousquet, head of French police, etc.) Other historians have distinguished the purges against intellectuals (Brasillach, C√©line, etc.), industrialists, fighters (LVF, etc.) and civil servants (Papon, etc.). Paris 1944: Women accused of collaboration with Nazis are paraded through the streets; they often had their hair cut off as a form of humiliation. Philippe P√©tain was charged with treason in July 1945. He was convicted and sentenced to death by firing squad, but Charles de Gaulle commuted the sentence to life imprisonment. In the police, some collaborators soon resumed official responsibilities. This continuity of the administration was pointed out, in particular concerning the events of the Paris massacre of 1961, executed under the orders of head of the Parisian police Maurice Papon when Charles de Gaulle was head of state. Papon was tried and convicted for crimes against humanity in 1998. The French members of the Waffen-SS Charlemagne Division who survived the war were regarded as traitors. Some of the more prominent officers were executed, while the rank-and-file were given prison terms; some of them were given the option of doing time in Indochina (1946‚Äì54) with the Foreign Legion instead of prison. Among artists, singer Tino Rossi was detained in Fresnes prison, where, according to Combat newspaper, prison guards asked him for autographs. Pierre Benoit and Arletty were also detained. Executions without trials and other forms of \\"popular justice\\" were harshly criticised immediately after the war, with circles close to P√©tainists advancing the figures of 100,000, and denouncing the \\"Red Terror\\", \\"anarchy\\", or \\"blind vengeance\\". The writer and Jewish internee Robert Aron estimated the popular executions to a number of 40,000 in 1960. This surprised de Gaulle, who estimated the number to be around 10,000, which is also the figure accepted today by mainstream historians. Approximately 9,000 of these 10,000 refer to summary executions in the whole of the country, which occurred during battle. Some imply that France did too little to deal with collaborators at this stage, by selectively pointing out that in absolute value (numbers), there were fewer legal executions in France than in its smaller neighbour Belgium, and fewer internments than in Norway or the Netherlands, but the situation in Belgium was not comparable as it mixed collaboration with elements of a war of secession: The 1940 invasion prompted the Flemish population to generally side with the Germans in the hope of gaining national recognition, and relative to national population a much higher proportion of Belgians than French thus ended up collaborating with the Nazis or volunteering to fight alongside them; The Walloon population in turn led massive anti-Flemish retribution after the war, some of which, such as the execution of Irma Swertvaeger Laplasse, remained controversial. The proportion of collaborators was also higher in Norway, and collaboration occurred on a larger scale in the Netherlands (as in Flanders) based partly on linguistic and cultural commonality with Germany. The internments in Norway and Netherlands, meanwhile, were highly temporary and were rather indiscriminate; there was a brief internment peak in these countries as internment was used partly for the purpose of separating Collaborationists from non-Collaborationists. Norway ended up executing only 37 Collaborationists. =1980s trials= Some accused war criminals were judged, some for a second time, from the 1980s onwards: Paul Touvier, Klaus Barbie, Maurice Papon, Ren√© Bousquet (the head of the French police during the war) and his deputy Jean Leguay. Bousquet and Leguay were both convicted for their responsibilities in the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup of July 1942. Among others, Nazi hunters Serge and Beate Klarsfeld spent part of their post-war effort trying to bring them before the courts. A fair number of collaborationists then joined the OAS terrorist movement during the Algerian War (1954‚Äì62). Jacques de Bernonville escaped to Quebec, then Brazil. Jacques Ploncard d'Assac became counsellor to the dictator Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar in Portugal. In 1993, former Vichy official Ren√© Bousquet was assassinated while he awaited prosecution in Paris following a 1991 inculpation for crimes against humanity; he had been prosecuted but partially acquitted and immediately amnestied in 1949.Ren√© Bousquet devant la Haute Cour de Justice In 1994 former Vichy official Paul Touvier (1915‚Äì1996) was convicted of crimes against humanity. Maurice Papon was likewise convicted in 1998, released three years later due to ill health, and died in 2007. Historiographical debates and \\"Vichy Syndrome\\" Until Jacques Chirac's presidency, the official point of view of the French government was that the Vichy regime was an illegal government distinct from the French Republic, established by traitors under foreign influence. Indeed, Vichy France eschewed the formal name of France (\\"French Republic\\") and styled itself the \\"French State\\", replacing the Republican motto of Libert√©, Egalit√©, Fraternit√© (liberty, equality, fraternity) inherited from the 1789 French Revolution, with the motto Travail, Famille, Patrie (work, family, homeland). While the criminal behaviour of Vichy France was consistently acknowledged, this point of view denied any responsibility of the state of France, alleging that acts committed between 1940 and 1944 were unconstitutional acts devoid of legitimacy.One of the first legal acts of the provisional government was to pass an ordinance reestablishing the rule of law: Ordonnance du 9 ao√ªt 1944 relative au r√©tablissement de la l√©galit√© r√©publicaine sur le territoire continental, article 1: \\"The form of government of France is and stays the Republic. In law, the Republic never ceased to exist.\\" article 2: \\"Thus, all constitutional acts, statutes and regulations, and decisions taken for the execution thereof, taken after 16 June 1940 up to the reestablishment of the provisional government of the French Republic, are null and devoid of effects.\\" The main proponent of this view was Charles de Gaulle himself, who insisted, as did other historians afterwards, on the unclear conditions of the June 1940 vote granting full powers to P√©tain, which was refused by the minority of Vichy 80. In particular, coercive measures used by Pierre Laval have been denounced by those historians who hold that the vote did not, therefore, have Constitutional legality (See subsection: Conditions of armistice and 10 July 1940 vote of full powers). In later years, de Gaulle's position was reiterated by president Mitterrand. \\"I will not apologize in the name of France. The Republic had nothing to do with this. I do not believe France is responsible,\\" he said in September 1994. The first President to accept responsibility for the arrest and deportation of Jews from France was Jacques Chirac, in a 16 July 1995 speech. He recognised the responsibility of \\"the French State\\" for seconding the \\"criminal folly of the occupying country\\", in particular the French police, headed by Ren√© Bousquet (charged in 1990 with crimes against humanity), which assisted the Nazis in the enactment of the so-called \\"Final Solution\\". The July 1942 Vel' d'Hiv Roundup is a tragic example of how the French police did the Nazi work, going even further than what military orders demanded (by sending children to Drancy internment camp, last stop before the extermination camps).En 1995, la reconnaissance des ¬´ fautes commises par l'√âtat ¬ª in Le Monde, 26 January 2005 President Macron's statement on 16 July 2017 was even more specific, stating clearly that the Vichy regime was certainly the French State during WW II, and played a role in the Holocaust. (Earlier that year, speeches made by Marine Le Pen had made the headlines by claiming that the Vichy Government was \\"not France.\\") Macron made the following remark when discussing the Vel' d'Hiver roundup of Jews: \\"It is convenient to see the Vichy regime as born of nothingness, returned to nothingness. Yes, it's convenient, but it is false.\\" As historian Henry Rousso has put it in The Vichy Syndrome (1987), Vichy and the state collaboration of France remains a \\"past that doesn't pass away\\". Historiographical debates are still, today, passionate, opposing conflictual views on the nature and legitimacy of Vichy's collaborationism with Germany in the implementation of the Holocaust. Three main periods have been distinguished in the historiography of Vichy: first the Gaullist period, which aimed at national reconciliation and unity under the figure of Charles de Gaulle, who conceived himself above political parties and divisions; then the 1960s, with Marcel Oph√ºls's film The Sorrow and the Pity (1971); finally the 1990s, with the trial of Maurice Papon, civil servant in Bordeaux in charge of the \\"Jewish Questions\\" during the war, who was convicted after a very long trial (1981‚Äì1998) for crimes against humanity. The trial of Papon did not only concern an individual itinerary, but the French administration's collective responsibility in the deportation of the Jews. Furthermore, his career after the war, which led him to be successively prefect of the Paris police during the Algerian War (1954‚Äì1962) and then treasurer of the Gaullist Union des D√©mocrates pour la R√©publique party from 1968 to 1971, and finally Budget Minister under president Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing and prime minister Raymond Barre from 1978 to 1981, was symptomatic of the quick rehabilitation of former collaborationists after the war. Critics contend that this itinerary, shared by others (although few had such public roles), demonstrates France's collective amnesia, while others point out that the perception of the war and of the state collaboration has evolved during these years. Papon's career was considered more scandalous as he had been responsible, during his function as prefect of police of Paris, for the 1961 Paris massacre of Algerians during the war, and was forced to resign from this position after the \\"disappearance\\", in Paris in 1965, of the Moroccan anti-colonialist leader Mehdi Ben Barka. Papon was convicted in 1998 as having been complicit with the Nazis in crimes against humanity. While it is certain that the Vichy government and a large number of its high administration collaborated in the implementation of the Holocaust, the exact level of such co-operation is still debated. Compared with the Jewish communities established in other countries invaded by Germany, French Jews suffered proportionately lighter losses (see Jewish death toll section above); although, starting in 1942, repression and deportations struck French Jews as well as foreign Jews. Former Vichy officials later claimed that they did as much as they could to minimise the impact of the Nazi policies, although mainstream French historians contend that the Vichy regime went beyond the Nazi expectations. The regional newspaper Nice Matin revealed on 28 February 2007, that in more than 1,000 condominium properties on the C√¥te d'Azur, rules dating to Vichy were still \\"in force\\", or at least existed on paper. One of these rules, for example, stated that: > The contractors shall make the following statements: they are of French > nationality, are not Jewish, nor married to Jewish in the sense of the laws > and ordinances in force [under Vichy, ed. note] The president of the Conseil Repr√©sentatif des Institutions juives de France- C√¥te d'Azur, a Jewish association group, issued a strong condemnation labelling it \\"the utmost horror\\" when one of the inhabitants of such a condominium qualified this as an \\"anachronism\\" with \\"no consequences\\".Nice Matin, 28 February 2007 (subscription only) ‚Äì The news is taken up by L'Humanit√© on 1 March 2007, Des immeubles ni√ßois √† l'heure de Vichy Jewish inhabitants were able and willing to live in the buildings, and to explain this the Nice Matin reporter surmised that some tenants may have not read the condominium contracts in detail, while others deemed the rules obsolete.Le Figaro, 15 October 2007, A vendre appartement pour Fran√ßais non juif A reason for the latter is that any racially discriminatory condominium or other local rule that may have existed \\"on paper\\", Vichy-era or otherwise, was invalidated by the constitutions of the French Fourth Republic (1946) and French Fifth Republic (1958) and was inapplicable under French antidiscrimination law. Thus, even if the tenants or coowners had signed or otherwise agreed to these rules after 1946, any such agreement would be null and void (caduque) under French law, as were the rules. Rewriting or eliminating the obsolete rules would have had to be done at the occupants' expense, including notary fees of 900 to 7000 EUR per building. =\\"Sword and shield\\" argument= Today, the few remaining Vichy supporters continue to maintain the official argument advanced by P√©tain and Laval: the state collaboration was supposed to protect the French civilian population from the hardships of the Occupation. At his trial P√©tain proclaimed that while Charles de Gaulle had represented the \\"sword\\" of France, P√©tain had been the \\"shield\\" which protected France. =Purification= Munholland reports a widespread consensus among historians regarding the authoritarian character of the Vichy regime and its: =Foreign Jews= Although this claim is rejected by the rest of the French population and by the state itself, another myth remains more widespread than this one. This other myth refers to the alleged \\"protection\\" by Vichy of French Jews by \\"accepting\\" to collaborate in the deportation ‚Äì and, ultimately, in the extermination ‚Äì of foreign Jews. This argument has been rejected by several historians who are specialists of the subject, among them US historian Robert Paxton, who is widely recognised, and historian of the French police Maurice Rajsfus. Both were called on as experts during the Papon trial in the 1990s. Robert Paxton thus declared, before the court, on 31 October 1997, that \\"Vichy took initiatives... The armistice allowed it a breathing space.\\" L'Humanit√©, 1 November 1997, Robert Paxton donne une accablante le√ßon d'histoire (Robert Paxton gives a damning lesson of history) and Robert Paxton: History Lesson. Retrieved 29 August 2016. Henceforth, on its own Vichy decided, within the homeland, to implement the \\"National Revolution\\" (\\"R√©volution nationale\\"). After naming the alleged causes of the defeat (\\"democracy, parliamentarism, cosmopolitanism, the left wing, foreigners, Jews, ...\\"), Vichy put in place, by 3 October 1940, the first anti-Jewish legislation. From then on, Jewish people were considered \\"second-zone citizens \\". Internationally, France \\"believed the war to be finished\\". Thus, by July 1940, Vichy was eagerly negotiating with the German authorities in an attempt to gain a place for France in the Third Reich's \\"New Order\\". But \\"Hitler never forgot the 1918 defeat. He always said no.\\" Vichy's ambition was doomed from the start. \\"Antisemitism was a constant theme\\", recalled Robert Paxton. It even, at first, opposed German plans. \\"At this time the Nazis had not yet decided to exterminate the Jews, but to expel them. Their idea was not to make of France an antisemitic country. On the contrary, they wanted to send there the Jews that they expelled\\" from the Reich. The historic change came in 1941‚Äì1942, with the pending German defeat on the Eastern Front. The war then became \\"total\\", and in August 1941, Hitler decided on the \\"global extermination of all European Jews\\". This new policy was officially formulated during the January 1942 Wannsee Conference, and implemented in all European occupied countries by spring 1942. France, praising itself for having remained an independent state (as opposed to other occupied countries) \\"decided to cooperate. This is the second Vichy.\\" The first train of deportees left Drancy on 27 March 1942, for Poland ‚Äì the first in a long series. \\"The Nazis needed the French administration... They always complained about the lack of staff.\\" recalled Paxton, something which Maurice Rajsfus has also underlined. Although the American historian recognised during the trial that the \\"civil behavior of certain individuals\\" had permitted many Jews to escape deportation, he stated that: > The French state, itself, participated in the policy of extermination of the > Jews... How can one claim the reverse when such technical and administrative > resources were made available to them? Pointing to the French police's registering of Jews, as well as Laval's decision, taken completely autonomously in August 1942, to deport children along with their parents, Paxton added: > Contrary to preconceived ideas, Vichy did not sacrifice foreign Jews in the > hope of protecting French Jews. At the hierarchy summit, it knew, from the > start, that the deportation of French Jews was unavoidable. Paxton then referred to the case of Italy, where deportation of Jewish people had started only after the German occupation. Italy surrendered to the Allies in mid-1943 but was subsequently invaded by Germany. Fighting continued there through 1944. In particular, in Nice, \\"Italians had protected the Jews. And the French authorities complained about it to the Germans.\\" More recent work by the historian Susan Zuccotti finds that, in general, the Vichy government facilitated the deportation of foreign Jews rather than French ones, until at least 1943: > Vichy officials [had] hoped to deport foreign Jews throughout France in > order to ease pressure on native Jews. Pierre Laval himself expressed the > official Vichy position... In the early months of 1943, the terror [Adam] > Munz and [Alfred] Feldman described in German-occupied France was still > experienced by foreign Jews like themselves. It is difficult to know exactly > how many French Jews were arrested, usually for specific or alleged > offences, but on 21 January 1943, Helmut Knochen informed Eichmann in Berlin > that there were 2,159 French citizens among the 3,811 prisoners at Drancy. > Many had been at Drancy for several months. They had not been deported > because, until January 1943, there had usually been enough foreigners and > their children to fill the forty-three trains that had carried about 41,591 > people to the east... By January 1943, foreign Jews were increasingly aware > of the danger and difficult to find. Nazi pressure for the arrest of French > Jews and the deportation of those already at Drancy increased accordingly. > Thus, when Knochen reported that there were 2,159 French citizens among the > 3,811 prisoners at Drancy on 21 January 1943, he also asked Eichmann for > permission to deport them. There had been no convoy from Drancy in December > and January, and [SS Lieutenant Heinz] R√∂thke was pressuring Knochen to > resume them. R√∂thke also wanted to empty Drancy in order to refill it. > Despite Vichy officials' past disapproval and Eichmann's own prior > discouragement of such a step, permission for the deportation of the French > Jews at Drancy, except for those in mixed marriages, was granted from Berlin > on 25 January.Susan Zuccotti, The Holocaust, the French, and the Jews. > University of Nebraska Press, 1999, pp. 168‚Äì169. Deportations from France did not start until summer 1942, several months after mass deportation from other countries started. Whatever the Vichy government's intent initially or subsequently, the numerical outcome was that less than 15% of French Jews, vs. nearly twice that proportion of non-citizen Jews residing in France, died. More Jews lived in France at the end of the Vichy regime than had approximately ten years earlier.Fran√ßois Delpech, Historiens et G√©ographes, no 273, mai‚Äìjuin 1979, Notable figures * Philippe P√©tain, Head of State. * Pierre Laval, Prime Minister (1940, 1942‚Äì1944). * Pierre- √âtienne Flandin, Prime Minister (1940‚Äì1941). * Fran√ßois Darlan, Prime Minister (1941‚Äì1942). * Pierre Pucheu, Minister of the Interior. * Maxime Weygand, Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces and Minister of Defense. * Charles Huntziger, general and Minister of Defense. * Ren√© Bousquet, head of the French police. * Jean Leguay, delegate of Bousquet in the \\"free zone\\", charged with crimes against humanity for his role in the July 1942 Vel' d'Hiv Roundup. * Louis Darquier de Pellepoix, Commissioner for Jewish Affairs. * Philippe Henriot, State Secretary of Information and Propaganda. * Maurice Papon, head of the Jewish Questions Service in the prefecture of Bordeaux.

Lithographic limestone is hard limestone that is sufficiently fine-grained, homogeneous and defect free to be used for lithography.

The term sublithographic is sometimes used for homogeneous fine-grained limestone with a somewhat coarser texture.Ronald K.

Origin Meleke in the Gerofit Formation (Turonian) near Makhtesh Ramon, southern Israel; a type of lithographic limestone. The generally accepted theory for the origin of lithographic and sublithographic limestones is that they were formed in shallow stagnant hypersaline and anoxic lagoons. The combination of mild hypersalinity and low oxygen content is believed to have inhibited the formation of microbial mats and prevented the invasion of bottom dwelling organisms. Microbial mats and bottom dwelling organisms would have left fossils, and bottom dwelling organisms would have churned the accumulating sediment, producing a less homogeneous rock. Stagnancy was required to avoid churning or sculpting of the sediment by currents or wave action.Brian J. Witzke and Bill J.

Distribution =Europe= The original source for lithographic limestone was the Solnhofen Limestone named after the quarries of Solnhofen where it was first found. This is a late Jurassic deposit, part of a deposit of plattenkalk (a very fine-grained limestone that splits into thin plates, usually Micrite) that extends through the Swabian Alb and Franconian Alb in Southern Germany.Annemarie Scholz, G√ºnter Schweigert and Gerd Dietel, Bivalves from the Nusplingen Lithographic Limestone (Upper Jurassic, Southern Germany), Biodiversity 1, Dec. 30, 2008; pages 111-131. Only a small fraction of plattenkalk is suitable for lithography. For many years, the Solnhofen deposits were the only source of lithographic limestone. French lithographic limestone from quarries near Montdardier, about 6 km south of le Vigan, Gard was exhibited at the Great Exhibition of 1851, where it earned an honorable mention.

Shortly before 1867, a second lithographic limestone quarry was opened in France near Cerin and Crey, Is√®re ().Reports of the United States Commissioners of the Paris Universal Exposition, 1867, General Survey of the Exhibition; Government Printing Office, Washington, 1868; page 54. The lithographic limestones of Cerin are from the Kimmeridgian stage of the Upper Jurassic, and as with the Solnhofen deposits, they preserve numerous interesting fossils.C. Gaillard, P. Bernier, J.

Wenz, Ichnofabric from the Upper Jurassic lithographic limestone of Cerin, southeast France, Paleontology , Vol. 37, Part 2, 1994; pages 285-304. Lithographic limestone from the Lower Cretaceous has been quarried near Santa Maria de Mei√† on the south flank of the Serra del Montsec in Spain. In 1902, L. M. Vidal, a mining engineer, recognized the importance of the fossils found there.Luis M. Chiappe and Antonio LaCasa-Ruiz, Noguerornis gonzalezi (Aves: Ornithothoraces) from the Early Cretaceous of Spain, Chapter 10 of Mesozoic Birds -- Above the Heads of Dinosaurs, University of California Press, 2002; pages 230-239. =The Americas= The American Lithographic Stone Company was organized in Louisville, Kentucky in late 1868. It initially focused its operation on quarries in Overton County, Tennessee,Lithographic Stone, Mineral Resources of the United States, 1886 United States Geological Survey, 1887; page 690. but shortly before 1900, it opened a quarry at Brandenburg, Kentucky. This quarry was the only commercial source of lithographic stone in the United States at the turn of the 20th century. Unlike the Solnhofen stone, Kentucky lithographic limestone was slightly dolomitic, and it was judged to be competitive with Solnhofen stone for some purposes, but not for the highest quality work.S.

Butts, Mississippian Formations of Western Kentucky Kentucky Geological Survey, 1917; page 40. This stone source was sub-Carboniferous (Mississippian).Robert Peter and A. M. Peter, General Remarks on the Limestones of Kentucky, Chemical Analyses, A, Vol II Geological Survey of Kentucky, 1885; page 133. In 1917, the Brandenburg quarry was judged the most important source of Lithographic stone in the United States.Frank C. Schrader, Ralph W. Stone and Samuel Sanford, Useful Minerals of the United States, Bulletin 624, United States Geological Survey, 1917; page 142. Prior to 1916, the output of the Brandenburg quarry was small, but in 1916, as World War I cut off access to Solnhofen stone, the quarry produced 20 tons of finished lithographic stone.Lithographic Stone, a New American Product, Commerce Reports, Vol I, No. 39, Feb. 15, 1917; page 637. The Remains of the Brandenburg Lithograph Quarry are located along the Buttermilk Falls Historic Walking Trail ().Buttermilk Falls Trail page of Geocaching.com In 1903, Clement L. Webster discovered a bed of lithographic limestone about 2 miles southwest of Orchard, Iowa. His company, the Interstate Investment & Development Company platted a town named Lithograph City nearby and opened a quarry ().Interstate Investment & Development Co. v. Webster, Supreme Court of Iowa, The Northwestern Reporter, Vol. 177, West, St. Paul, 1920.The Lithoggraph City Enterprise (reprints) Geological Society of Iowa, Oct. 16, 1995. The Lithograph City Formation of the Cedar Valley Group straddles the border between the Middle and Late Devonian and was named for its exposure in this quarry. Outcrops of this formation extend from near Cedar Falls, Iowa north into Minnesota.Bill J. Bunker, Brian J. Witzke and Jed Day, Upper Cedar Valley Stratigraphy North Central Iowa Lithograph City Formation, Guidebook 44, Geological Society of Iowa, Apr. 27, 1986. The suitability of Lithograph City limestone for lithography was tested by A. B. Hoen who reported that stone from two layers in the Lithograph City quarry was excellent for lithography and finer grained than the finest Solnhofen stone.A. B. Hoen, Discussion of the Requisite Qualities of Lithographic Limestone, with Report on Tests of the Lithographic Stone of Mitchell County, Iowa, Iowa Geological Survey Annual Report, 1902, Des Moines, 1903; pages 339-352. Lithograph City was an important source of lithographic stone in the United States during World War I, but the quarries closed as metal printing plates replaced stone. In 1918, the Devonian Products Company took over the operation, focusing on the production of crushed rock and renaming the town Devonia.Wayne I/ Anderson, Iowa's Geological Past, University of Iowa Press, 1998; page 160. By 1938, the town had disappeared.Bill J. Bunker, Lithograph City web page of the Iowa Geological Survey .

R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium, featured in The Lord of the Rings. A dwarf warrior, he is the son of Gl√≥in, a character from Tolkien's earlier novel, The Hobbit. Gimli is chosen to represent the race of Dwarves in the Fellowship of the Ring. As such, he is one of the primary characters of the novel. In the course of the adventure, Gimli aids the Ring-bearer Frodo Baggins, participates in the War of the Ring, and becomes close friends with Legolas, overcoming an ancient enmity of Dwarves and Elves. Fictional biography Gimli was born in the Ered Luin (Blue Mountains) in the Third Age. His father was Gl√≥in, one of the former companions of the hobbit, Bilbo Baggins. Gimli had wanted to accompany his father and the others in the company of Thorin Oakenshield on their quest to reclaim Erebor (the Lonely Mountain), but at age 62 he was deemed too young.Unfinished Tales, p. 336. He was a remote descendant of Durin the Deathless, chief of the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves and ancestor to the Dwarven people to which Gimli belonged, the Longbeards. Gimli was of the royal line, but not close to the succession; he was the third cousin once removed of D√°in II Ironfoot, king of Durin's Folk, and the first cousin once removed of Balin, also one of Bilbo's former companions, and later briefly Lord of Moria. Gimli is first seen at the Council of Elrond with Gl√≥in, they had travelled there to warn that the Dark Lord Sauron was searching for Bilbo, and to seek the advice of Elrond. There they learned that Bilbo's kinsman Frodo was now the bearer of the One Ring, the greatest of the Ring of Power, forged by Sauron. The Council decided to have it destroyed by casting it into the volcanic Mount Doom in Sauron's domain of Mordor. Frodo volunteered for the task, and Elrond chose Gimli and seven others of varying races to aid him in his task. Thus, the Fellowship of the Ring was formed.The Fellowship of the Ring, book 2, ch. 2 \\"The Council of Elrond\\" Within the Fellowship there was initially friction between Gimli and the elf Legolas: their races bore an old grudge against each other over the Necklace of the Dwarves and the destruction of Doriath, and more recently Thranduil, Legolas' father, had once imprisoned Gimli's father Gl√≥in (as described in The Hobbit). When the company was forced to enter the ancient underground Dwarf-realm, the Mines of Moria, Gimli was at first enthusiastic and hoped to find Balin's colony of his people there.The Fellowship of the Ring, book 2, ch. 3 \\"The Ring Goes South\\" However, Moria was still inhabited by Orcs, Cave Trolls, and a Balrog: Balin and his folk had all been killed. The Fellowship found his tomb and a chronicle of events in the Chamber of Mazarbul; Orcs discovered their presence, and they had to fight their way out.The Fellowship of the Ring, book 2, ch. 4 \\"A Journey in the Dark\\" The Fellowship's leader, the Wizard Gandalf, died fighting the Balrog, but the rest of the Fellowship escaped the Mines.The Fellowship of the Ring, book 2, ch. 5 \\"The Bridge of Khazad-d√ªm Aragorn, a Ranger, then led them to the forest of Lothl√≥rien, populated by Elves hostile to Dwarves. Gimli was told he had to be blindfolded if he was to enter the forest, and his refusal nearly led to a violent situation, defused only when Aragorn arranged for the entire Fellowship to be blindfolded.The Fellowship of the Ring, book 2, ch. 6 \\"Lothl√≥rien\\" Gimli's opinion of Elves changed when he met Galadriel, co-ruler of Lothl√≥rien: her beauty, kindness, and understanding impressed Gimli so much that, when given the opportunity to ask for whatever he wished, he responded that being able to see her and hear her gentle words was gift enough. When pressed further, he admitted that he desired a single strand of her golden hair, to be an heirloom of his house, but that he could not ask for such a gift. Galadriel was so moved by his bold yet courteous request that she gave him not one, but three of her hairs. She also subsequently gave Gimli the name \\"Lockbearer\\" as a result. By the end of the sojourn in Lothl√≥rien, Gimli had formed his unlikely friendship with Legolas.The Fellowship of the Ring, book 2, ch. 8 \\"Farewell to L√≥rien\\" At Amon Hen, the company was sundered, for Boromir, son of the Steward of Gondor, tried to take the Ring and use it for Gondor and his own gain in their ongoing war against Sauron. Frodo fled at this and went ahead, accompanied only by his gardener Samwise Gamgee.The Two Towers, book 3, ch. 1 \\"The Departure of Boromir\\" The Fellowship was scattered while looking for Frodo, and the two other hobbits of the party, Merry Brandybuck and Pippin Took, were captured by Orcs. Boromir was mortally wounded defending them, and it fell to Gimli, Aragorn and Legolas to set him on a funeral boat. They decided to go after Merry and Pippin, for Frodo's mission was out of their hands. After running a great distance in a few days to the land of Rohan, they met √âomer, nephew of Rohan's King Th√©oden, with a troop of cavalry. They had killed all the Orcs the Three Hunters were pursuing. When √âomer spoke ill of the name Galadriel, having been told false rumours about her, Gimli responded harshly: Aragorn calmed the quarrel.The Two Towers, book 3, ch. 2 \\"The Riders of Rohan\\" After being informed about the situation in Rohan, Gimli and the others continued their search for the hobbits, and they came across a resurrected Gandalf, now Gandalf the White, in Fangorn Forest. He assured them that the hobbits were now safe.The Two Towers, book 3, ch. 5 \\"The White Rider\\" Gandalf led them to Rohan's capital, Edoras, where he roused King Th√©oden out of inaction and exposed his counsellor, Gr√≠ma Wormtongue, as a spy for Sauron's ally Saruman.The Two Towers, book 3, ch. 6 \\"The King of the Golden Hall\\" Gimli proved his valour in combat in the ensuing Battle of Helm's Deep against Saruman's forces. He and Legolas engaged in an Orc-slaying contest (Gimli won by one; he killed 42 to Legolas's 41); he received a minor head injury and his axe was notched on the iron collar of the forty-first Orc. During the battle, Gimli saved √âomer's life by killing two orcs and driving off two others.The Two Towers, book 3, ch. 7 \\"Helm's Deep\\" Later, Gimli's vivid description of the Glittering Caves of Aglarond moved Legolas to promise to visit the caves when the War was over. Their friendship was a model for overcoming prejudice; they even rode together on the same horse.The Two Towers, book 3, ch. 8 \\"The Road to Isengard\\" After their victory, Gimli and the others went to Saruman's stronghold of Isengard, where Gandalf cast Saruman out of the Order of Wizards and broke his staff. During this conversation, Gimli saw through Saruman's lies with the words \\"This wizard's words stand on their heads\\".The Two Towers, book 3, ch. 10 \\"The Voice of Saruman\\" Gimli then accompanied Aragorn, Legolas, a company of Rangers of the North, and Elrond's sons Elladan and Elrohir on the Paths of the Dead. At the stone of Erech, Aragorn summoned the Dead Men of Dunharrow, spirits bound by oath to fight for the king of Gondor, which Aragorn rightfully was.The Return of the King, book 5, ch. 2 \\"The Passing of the Grey Company\\" Gimli witnessed the Dead rout invaders at Pelargir in south Gondor by the power of fear alone. After Aragorn declared the spirits' oath fulfilled, the men of south Gondor gathered to his banner, and they sailed in the enemy's abandoned ships to relieve the siege of Gondor's capital Minas Tirith. Their arrival led to victory in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.The Return of the King, book 5, ch. 6 \\"The Battle of the Pelennor Fields\\" Gimli alone represented the Dwarves in the final battle against Sauron, the Battle of the Morannon in front of the Black Gate of Mordor. There he recognized Pippin Took's feet underneath a troll and saved the young hobbit's life.The Return of the King, book 5, ch. 10 \\"The Black Gate Opens\\" Before the host of Gondor could be overwhelmed, the Ring was destroyed, and Sauron was defeated.The Return of the King, book 6, ch. 4 \\"The Field of Cormallen\\" After the War, Gimli led a large number of Durin's folk south to establish a new Dwarf-realm at Aglarond, and he became the first Lord of the Glittering Caves. The Dwarves of the Glittering Caves built \\"great works\\" in Rohan and Gondor, and replaced the ruined gate of Minas Tirith with a new one made of mithril and steel.The Lord of the Rings, Appendix A, part III. According to the Red Book of Westmarch, after Aragorn's death in the Fourth Age, Gimli (then 262 years old, past mid- life for a Dwarf) sailed with Legolas into the West, becoming the first dwarf in the Undying Lands. Concept and creation The name Gimli first appeared in Tolkien's works in The Tale of Tin√∫viel, the earliest version of the story of Beren and L√∫thien Tin√∫viel, found in the second volume of The Book of Lost Tales. Here, the name belongs to an aged elf, a prisoner along with Beren in the kitchens of Tevildo, Prince of Cats (forerunner of Sauron). During the writing of The Lord of the Rings, as told in The Return of the Shadow, Gimli's character was first named Frar, then Burin, and he was the son of Balin. The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey writes that Tolkien at times uses Gimli to generate the reaction he wants from the reader. Shippey is critical of this use of characters as \\"'internal reflectors' of embarrassment or suspicion\\". Family tree Adaptations Gimli in Ralph Bakshi's animated version of The Lord of the Rings Gimli was voiced by David Buck in Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated version of The Lord of the Rings. Here he is drawn as being almost as tall as the rest of the non-hobbit members of the Fellowship. Gimli does not appear in the 1980 animated version of The Return of the King. He is portrayed by Tomi Salmela in the 1993 Finnish miniseries Hobitit. John Rhys-Davies as Gimli in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring In Peter Jackson's film trilogy, Gimli is played by John Rhys-Davies, using a Scottish accent. Gimli's more prosaic and blunt style, in contrast with the more refined Aragorn and Legolas, provides defusing comic relief, with much of the humour based on heightism, along with his competitive, if friendly, feud with Legolas, where Gimli consistently finds himself out-achieved. On stage, Gimli was portrayed by Elizabeth Harris in the Cincinnati stage productions of The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Two Towers (2002), and The Return of the King (2003) for Clear Stage Cincinnati. In Canada, Gimli was portrayed by Ross Williams in the 3-hour Toronto stage production of The Lord of the Rings, which opened in 2006. In The Lord of the Rings: The Musical, he was played by S√©van Stephan throughout its London run.

Parish church and Gildhouse St Winwaloe's, Poundstock The parish church of St Winwaloe is at in Poundstock hamlet and its battlemented tower houses a ring of six bells, rehung in 2000. The medieval church consists of a nave, chancel, north transept, north aisle and west tower. The aisle is of 15th- century date and the church was tactfully restored by J. D. Sedding. Features of interest include the Gothic font (probably 13th century), the Jacobean pulpit, and three wall paintings on the north wall. These are much faded but interesting for their iconography: they are the Tree of Deadly Sins, the Warning to Sabbath-breakers and the Weighing of Souls.Pevsner, N.

Originally, the cinema site was a garden centre and caf√©, but was purchased by the Collard family in 1986 to convert it into a cinema, as the nearest cinema to Bude was over 30 miles away in Wadebridge. It was built and designed by the film producer, Mervyn CollardMervyn Collard on the IMDb database (who produced actor David Jason's first film, White Cargo. Mervyn died in 2004). Work started on the build at the end of 1987, and Westar 7000s projectors were installed, along with the carpets and seats and other fittings. The projectors were moved from the former Strand Cinema in Bideford, Devon. The architect was Martin Back. The building frontage is in mock Greek style with a classical pediment, and two columns. The opening night film was a charity screening of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Some changes have been made since opening, including the projectors now replaced with Cinemeccanica Victoria 9s, and the ticket office and foyer have been modified.Mervyn Collard's article on the Mad Cornish Projectionist's website.

This work led to her establishing the first population dynamics and genetics laboratory and developing spatial Lotka-Volterra models, ecological networks and artificial intelligence to apply earth observations in biological oceanography, fisheries and fleet deployment in Fisheries and Oceans Canada at the Bedford Institute of Oceanography, with NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the USA) and the intelligence systems laboratory at Xerox PARC. From 1987-1990, Professor McGlade continued her research in systematics, ichthyology, population dynamics and coastal issues in Cambridge as the Adrian Fellow at Darwin College, at the International Federation of Institutes of Advanced Study in the Netherlands, and Cranfield Institute in the UK. In 1988 Professor McGlade was appointed as a Director at KFA (now FZ) J√ºlich in Germany and led research on theoretical ecology. In 1992 she became Professor in Biological Sciences at the University of Warwick and from 2000 was NERC Professorial Fellow at University College London. She and her research teams developed knowledge about spatial dynamical systems (differential equations, coupled-map lattices, cellular automata and individual based models) to study the behaviour of a wide range of ecosystems. The ideas and theories developed led to significant insights into the role of evolutionarily stable attractors, invasion exponents and phenotype dynamics in a wide range of ecosystems, including the African savannah, marine communities, annual and perennial plants and forests and red grouse. From 1998-2000, she was Director of NERC's Center for Coastal and Marine Science. She also served as a Board Member of the Environment Agency England and Wales and as a member of the Advisory Council for the Campaign for Science and Engineering. In 2013 she was appointed as Chief Scientist of UNEP where she has researched the science policy interface, integrated global environmental assessment, near-real time environmental monirtoing systems and the use of geospatial and big data in statistics for sustainable development.

Accessed: May 3.1, 2013. At the EEA, she introduced SEIS, the Shared Environmental Information System for national reporting and indicator development and brought together key aspects of national and international research outputs, including those from the Copernicus earth observation programme. Under her leadership, the Agency reinforced its capability to produce integrated environmental assessments, analyse the state of Europe‚Äôs environment as a whole, and provide reliable projections. Professor McGlade worked to strengthen the link between science and policy. She pointed at the magnitude of climate change and urged policymakers to start developing and applying adaptation measures. McGlade was a firm advocate of informing and involving the public in all aspects of the environment. To this end, she strove to strengthen the information and feedback channels between researchers, public and policymakers, making environmental information understandable and accessible through technological media.  United Nations Environment Programme  In 2013, McGlade joined UNEP at its headquarters in Nairobi and in 2014 became chief scientist and director of the Division of Early Warning and Assessment. After joining she continued the development of UNEP Live, an open cross-lingual platform for global exchange of environmental information, and led UNEP's assessment and statistical activities including the environmental dimension of the Sustainable Development Goals, Global Environmental Outlook, Emission Gap Report and Frontiers: Emerging issues of global importance.

He became famous both for his efforts to shield Jewish victims of Nazi persecution during World War II, and later for his efforts to document instruments of propaganda utilized during national conflict.Henri Max Corwin (Cohen) in his twenties. Biography Henri Max Cohen was born in 1903, the youngest of four children, in the eastern Netherlands village of Oldenzaal, where his family had lived since at least 1770. After completing secondary schooling Cohen entered the study of Law at Leiden University, but soon had to return to Oldenzaal to run the family business when his father suffered health problems. As a youth Cohen had two abiding pastimes, stamp collecting and the theater. He wrote plays, directed plays and acted in plays. When the persecution of Jewish people in Germany became apparent in the years before the outbreak of World War II, he began escorting people from that nation to safe havens in the Netherlands. He was often assisted in these trips by his fiance√© Geraldine. Soon after the start of the war, his nation was invaded and occupied by German troops. At that time, he became active in providing hiding places for people who would otherwise be arrested and deported under the German antisemitism policies. For this effort, he was arrested on 16 October 1943 by two Dutch members of the Sicherheitsdienst, on the charge of providing \\"safe houses\\". He was sentenced to imprisonment at Assen, but while being transported there, he managed to jump from the train and escape. He remained in hiding until the end of the war, after which he returned to Oldenzaal and resumed managing his family's affairs. During the Cold War fears of the 1950s, he noted a renewed antisemitism in Europe. He saw many of the Dutch Jews moving to safe areas (usually America), and considered moving his family away also. In the end, he decided to remain in the Netherlands, but changed his name (and thus the family's name) from Cohen to Corwin, hoping that this would buy them a margin of safety if anti-Jewish persecution did resume. Corwin died in January 1962 at the age of 58. A street in Oldenzaal was named in his honor.http://www.corwincollection.com Official website of Henri Max Corwin Humanitarian efforts In the 1930s when the situation for the Jews in Germany became unbearable, he acted as a courier for the Jewish Refugee Committee in Amsterdam, taking refugees or their belongings across the Dutch border. For this he was granted membership in the U.N.A.P.E.F. (Union Nationale des Passeurs & Filieristes Benevoles). A letter from Albert Einstein confirms these activities (a copy is shown on the site). When in 1940 the Germans occupied the Netherlands and began arresting Jewish citizens, Cohen organized (in cooperation with the Resistance) hiding places for family and friends. This illegal activity led to his arrest by the SD (the Sicherheits Dienst) in 1943. On the way to prison he managed to escape and went into hiding himself until the end of the war. In the early fifties, when Russian politics threatened European peace, many Dutch Jews fled the country. Mr. Cohen thought best to protect his family by changing his name in Corwin, a name several of his family living in the States already had adopted. Genealogy efforts In his later years Corwin became an enthusiastic historian and genealogist. He tracked down family trees of Jewish families and gave lectures on the ups and downs of the Jewish population in the Twente region. The results of this research can be found in the Central Institute for Genealogy in The Hague, in the Rosentaliana Library and the Jewish Historical Museum in Amsterdam, in periodicals, newspapers and the Yearbook Twente 1962. In 1960 he received the Order ofhttp://www.corwincollection.com/press-9.html Oranje Nassau. Corwin died of heart failure at the age of 58 in January 1962. In Oldenzaal a street is named after him. Detailed information with regard to the collection of H.M. Corwin and his interesting life, including his war diary, photo albums, press articles and more can be found on the personal site, created by his daughters in 2008. A book about his life will appear in 2009.  Collection of documents  Corwin assembled a unique collection of documents regarding the Second World War and the Holocaust. Most of the collected items can be categorized under the title of \\"propaganda\\". This war collection contains 24 albums on various aspects of the period from approximately 1900 until 1945, including the rise of nationalism, the 1936 Olympic Games, Nazi occupation of various countries, anti-Semitic measures and the massacre of the Jews. The collection was exhibited in 1959/1964 in the Netherlands and in Israel at the Yad Vashem and at the Kibbutz Lohamei Hagethaot.Philatelic exhibition on the European catastrophe: from the collection of Mr. H. Corwin, Israel, Jerusalem, Yad Vashem, 1960. = The Color of Propaganda = propaganda_1 propaganda_4 propaganda_2 propaganda_5 propaganda_3 propaganda_6 These red pages are in no way related to one specific country or ideology, although on first glance it is very easy to recognize in them the signs of national-socialist Germany or communist Russia. In reality, propaganda has many colours and shades: red, brown, orange, green, blue, and not to mention black and even white. Its main aim is to manipulate the minds of the masses. It uses rhetoric, memorable images (books, children...), concepts that are difficult to argue against (fidelity, honesty, kindness, brotherhood...), the notion of a common destiny and of the ultimate goal, and most importantly a charismatic leader who is capable of enticing, stupefying and getting the people to follow him. The six pages of comparative analysis presented here are only a small, yet nevertheless the most demonstrative example of the documents that constitute this unique collection. They are the concise guide to the methods of propaganda ‚Äì the recipe for the poisonous potion commonly known as Propaganda. You will find here all the necessary ingredients: the need for order and stability, democracy and demonstration of the ‚Äúwill of the people‚Äù, power and greatness, history (the older the better, and it must always be legendary), most definitely a book (though of course, there is only one book- The Book!), and let us not forget the heroes, the martyrs and the spiteful enemies. Unfortunately, the majority of the documents and facts presented in this collection are not so easy to identify. In this lies their main strength as propaganda items and also their greatest danger, the danger of which the creator of this collection ‚Äì Henri- Max Corwin ‚Äì wanted to warn future generations. When studying the documents within this collection, it is crucial to always remember the terrible lessons of history, the price one must pay for gullibility and for the reluctance to analyse and think.

Influenced by the works of Wassily Kandinsky, he developed an abstract style. In Copenhagen, Mortensen was joint founder of the \\"Linien\\" school of abstract painters.http://www.kunstonline.dk/diverse/biografier/?id=4781 In 1937, he undertook a study trip to Paris, where he met pioneers of surrealism, such as Roger Vitrac, Gala √âluard, Michel Leiris, Antonin Artaud, Raymond Queneau and Andr√© Masson. During the Second World War, Mortensen's works reflected the violence of Europe. He moved to Paris in 1947, remaining there until 1964. Together with Robert Jacobsen, Mortensen became connected to the Galerie Denise Ren√© in Paris, which became famous for concrete art. His later works are concrete works of art characterised by large, clear, bright colour surfaces. Mortensen was awarded the Edvard Munch Prize in 1946, and the Kandinsky prize in 1950, and the Thorvaldsen Medal in 1968.

The Biscovey Stone is the shaft of an ancient Celtic cross. It was inscribed but the text is no longer readable. There are several theories about the stone, one says it dates from around 600 AD to show the Saxon advance into the county, another puts the date at around 900 AD.

TOC Flag design The Pembrokeshire Flag is based on the flag of St David. (The saint's birthplace, the city of St David's, is in Pembrokeshire.) The blue is also considered to be reminiscent of the sea, and the yellow of summer sunshine. The central rose represents the red Tudor Rose, a symbol used by King Henry VII, who founded the Tudor dynasty; a man of both Welsh and English descent who was born in Pembroke Castle. The green pentagon around the rose symbolises the green fields and cliff-tops of Pembrokeshire.Pembrokeshire Flag site The colours for the flag are: { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"width:100%; background:#f9f9f9; border:1px solid #aaa; border-collapse:collapse; white- space:nowrap; text-align:left;\\" - style=\\"text-align: center; background: #eee\\" !style=\\"background:white;color:black;width:20%\\"Colour space !style=\\"background:#005EB8;color:white;width:16%\\" Blue !style=\\"background:#FFD100;color:black;width:16%\\" Yellow !style=\\"background:#00B140;color:white;width:16%\\" Green !style=\\"background:#DA291C;color:white;width:16%\\" Red !style=\\"background:#FFFFFF;color:black;width:16%\\" White - style=\\"text-align: center\\" Pantone 300c 109c 354c 485c  -style=\\"text-align: center\\" CMYK  99.50.0.0  0.9.100.0  81.0.92.0  0.95.100.0  0.0.0.0 -style=\\"text- align: center\\" RGB  0-94-184  255-209-0  0-177-64  218-41-28  255-255-255 -style=\\"text-align: center\\" HTML  #005EB8  #FFD100  #00B140  #DA291C  #FFFFFF } References Flag Flags of places in Wales Flags with crosses Flags introduced in 1988 ","title":"Flag of Pembrokeshire"},{"id":"20599653","text":"Professor Anthony John Moses Anthony John Moses (born 12 October 1942, in Newport) is a Welsh scientist, researcher and professor, former director of Wolfson Centre for Magnetics.

Initiation of igneous processes associated with volcanic passive margins occurs before and/or during the rifting process depending on the cause of rifting. There are two accepted models for VPM formation: hotspots/mantle plumes and slab pull. Both result in large, quick lava flows over a relatively short period of geologic time (i.e. a couple of million years). VPM's progress further as cooling and subsidence begins as the margins give way to formation of normal oceanic crust from the widening rifts. Characteristics Despite the differences in origin and formation, most VPMs share the same characteristics: *4 to 7 km thick basaltic and (frequently) silicic subaerial flows; dike swarms and sills running parallel to continent-facing normal faults. *10 to 15 km thick bodies in the lower crust (HVLC) show high seismic P-Wave velocities, between 7.1 and 7.8 km/s which lie under the transitional crust (crust between continental crust and oceanic crust). *Seaward Dipping Reflector (SDR) series: Inner SDRs overlie transitional continental crust. They are composed of varying mixtures of subaerial volcanic flows, volcaniclastic and non-volcanic sediments which range from 50‚Äì150 km wide and are 5‚Äì10 km thick. Outer SDRs overlie transitional oceanic crust and are composed of submarine basaltic flows which range from 3 to 9 km thick. Development rightthumbNot to scale Extensional stress leads to asthenospheric upwelling and Listric Faulting. rightthumbNot to scale Asthenospheric upwelling, listric faulting, and crustal thinning continue. Mantle convection (A) further weakens lithosphere and leads to the formation of dikes and sills (B). Dikes and sills feed magma chambers in the lower and upper crust (C). Lava erupts as basaltic sheet flows (D). rightthumbNot to scale Thinning crust is strained to the point of breaking, forming a mid-ocean ridge (A). Mantle material upwells to fill the gap at the mid-ocean ridge (B) and cools to form oceanic crust (C). Volcanic sheet flows atop transitional oceanic crust form outer seaward dipping reflectors (D). Convecting mantle material along base of transitional crust cools to form HVLC (E). rightthumb Extension thins the crust. Magma reaches the surface through radiating sills and dikes, forming basalt flows, as well as deep and shallow magma chambers below the surface. The crust gradually sink due to thermal subsidence, and originally horizontal basalt flows are rotated tosees become seaward dipping reflectors. =Rift initiation= Active rifting The active rift model sees rupture driven by hotspot or mantle plume activity. Upwellings of hot mantle, known as mantle plumes, originate deep in Earth and rise to heat and thin the lithosphere. Heated lithosphere thins, weakens, rises, and finally rifts, Enhanced melting following continental breakup is very important in VPMs, creating thicker than normal oceanic crust of 20 to 40 km thick. Other melts caused by convection related upwelling form reservoirs of magma from which dike swarms and sills eventually radiate to the surface, creating the characteristic seaward dipping lava flows. This model is controversial. Passive rifting The passive rift model infers that slab pull stretches the lithosphere and thins it. To compensate for lithospheric thinning, asthenosphere upwells, melts due to adiabatic decompression, and derivative melts rise to the surface to erupt. Melts push up through faults towards the surface, forming dikes and sills. =Development of transitional crust= Continued extension leads to accelerated igneous activity, including repeated eruptions. Repeated eruptions form a thick sequence of lava beds that can reach a combined thickness of up to 20 km. These beds are identified on seismic refraction sections as seaward dipping reflectors. It is important to note that the early phase of volcanic activity is not limited to the production of basalts. Rhyolite and other felsic rocks can also be found in these zones. Continued extension with volcanic activity forms transitional crust, welding ruptured continent to nascent ocean floor. Volcanic beds cover the transition from thinned continental crust to oceanic crust. Also occurring during this phase is the formation of high velocity seismic zones under the thinned continental crust and the transition crust. These zones are identified by typical seismic velocities between 7.2-7.7 km/s and are usually interpreted as layers of mafic to ultramafic rocks that have underplated the transitional crust. Asthenospheric upwelling leads to the formation of a mid-ocean ridge and new oceanic crust progressively separates the once-conjoined rift halves. Continued volcanic eruptions spread lava flows across transitional crust and onto oceanic crust. Due to the high rate of magmatic activity the new oceanic crust forms much thicker than typical oceanic crust. An example of this is Iceland where oceanic crust has been identified as being up to 40 km thick. Some have theorized that the copious amounts of volcanic material also lead to the formation of oceanic plateaus at this time. =Post-rift= The final and longest phase is the continued thermal subsidence of the transitional crust and the accumulation of sediments. Continued seafloor spreading leads to the formation of oceanic crust of normal thickness. Over time this production of normal oceanic crust and sea floor spreading leads to the formation of an ocean. This phase is of the most interest to the oil industry and sedimentary geologists. Distribution and examples The distribution of known volcanic margins is shown on the graphic to the right. Many of the margins have not been thoroughly investigated and more passive margins are identified as volcanic from time to time. Volcanic passive margins: *South Atlantic *Western Australia *Southwest India *West Greenland *East Greenland *Northern Labrador Sea *South of Arabia *Norwegian Margin *US Atlantic Margin Map showing the distribution of Earth's passive margins with known volcanic and non-volcanic margins distinguished. The margins are marked with color masks where the darkest blues and reds are non-volcanic and volcanic passive margins, respectively. =VPM example: The US Atlantic Margin= The US Atlantic passive margin extends from Florida to southern Nova Scotia. This VPM was a result of the breakup of the supercontinent, Pangea, in which North America separated from northwestern Africa and Iberia to form the North Atlantic Ocean. This margin has a typical history of tectonic events that are representative of volcanic passive margins with rifting and passive margin formation occurring 225-165 million years ago. Like other VPMs the US East Coast Margin developed in two stages; 1) rifting, initiated during the Middle to Late Triassic and continued into Jurassic time and 2) seafloor spreading, which began in Jurassic time and continues today. The US East Coast includes several components which are characteristic of VPM's including; seaward- dipping reflectors, flood basalts, dikes, and sills.

Morrow Creek joins Pacific Creek just over halfway through its journey.  History  South Pass was first discovered by European-American traders in 1812; the first wagon trains crossed in 1832. Pacific Creek was the first water that the trains encountered after leaving the Sweetwater River at Burnt Ranch on the eastern side of the pass. Many wagon trains took the opportunity to camp and refresh at Pacific Springs, which is the first significant feeder into Pacific Creek.
