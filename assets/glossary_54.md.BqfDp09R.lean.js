Once allied to the type species of the genus Priscileo, later placed as Wakaleo pitikantensis, \\"Priscileo\\" roskellyae was subsequently transferred to its own genus Lekaneleo.  Taxonomy  The species was described by Anna Gillespie in 1997, describing material excavated at the Riversleigh World Heritage Area that included a largely complete cranium and maxillary retaining some teeth and details of the alveoli. Examination of the new species included a revision of the previously monotypic genus, Priscileo, known only by fragmented remains of teeth and a partial maxilla. The discovery of a new species of Riversleigh fauna allowed the genus to be revised (Gillespie, et al, 2017) to include the type to be recognised in the new combination as Wakaleo pitikantensis. Subsequently Gillespie, Archer & Hand (2020) moved \\"Priscileo\\" roskellyae to a distinct genus Lekaneleo, arguing that it exhibits features supporting its generic distinction within Thylacoleonidae. The specific epithet honours Ros Kelly, who provided support to research at Riversleigh when acting as a minister of the federal government.  Description  As one of two described species of Priscileo, it is estimated to have been around two thirds the size of Priscileo pitikantensis; the body mass of L. roskellyae is calculated as . The upper dental formula of this marsupial was I1‚Äì3 C1 P1‚Äì13 M 1‚Äì4. The premolar P3 is similar in form to the larger tooth in species of Wakaleo, the mid-sized thylacoleonids that also existed at Riversleigh and seemed to occupied different ecological niches in the same time period. The comparative bite force of the species, along with the larger Thylacoleo carnifex, is estimated to have been the greatest of any known mammal and strongly supports the conception of predators that killed animals larger than itself. The conception of the larger species 'P. pitikantensis, based on extrapolations from the limb morphology, is proposed to have been an arboreal ambush predator.

In Literary Hub, Madden describes it as \\"a coming-of-age memoir growing up in Boca Raton, Florida, in a very privileged Jewish community as a biracial, queer girl with a lot of family secrets: two addict parents and a famous family, as well.\\" In The New York Times, Tessa Fontaine said of Long Live the Tribe of Fatherless Girls, \\"This is a fearless debut that carries as much tenderness as pain. The author never shrinks from putting herself back into the world after every hurt, and we are lucky for it...it‚Äôs all compulsively readable, not just because of those big themes, but because of the embodied, needle-fine moments that make the stories sing.\\" Electric Literature said, \\"What makes Long Live the Tribe of Fatherless Girls so exceptional is the compassion Madden brings to the page.\\" In NPR, Ilana Masad said, \\"In baring the bad and ugly alongside the good, Madden has succeeded in creating a mirror of larger concerns, even as her own story is achingly specific and personal.\\" Kirkus Reviews said, \\"Though the author‚Äôs aching emotional rawness sometimes makes for difficult reading, this is a deeply courageous work that chronicles one artist‚Äôs jagged‚Äîand surprisingly beautiful‚Äîpath to wholeness. Affecting, fearless, and unsparingly honest.\\" When asked what she wants others to take away from the book, Madden has said, \\"I hope people feel the power of being an outsider.\\"  No Tokens Journal  Madden is the founding Editor-in-Chief of No Tokens Journal, which describes itself as \\"a journal celebrating work that is felt in the spine.\\" They are run entirely by women and non-binary individuals. Madden has said that No Tokens was founded because \\"there was and is a need for more balance in publishing. There is a need for people to start paying attention, and I‚Äôm glad so many are. I admired what VIDA was doing; I admired many journals and publishers who said, 'We‚Äôre here. Look.' It is unacceptable to ignore the numbers, and I wanted to be a part of that response.\\" On editing, she's said \\"Being an editor sharpens the eye and ear, yada yada, of course, but really, if we‚Äôre talking artistic development, founding and editing a journal has taught me everything about generosity and community building.

From 1953 to 1955, he was a postdoc in California, first at the Carnegie Institution for Science, Department of Plant Biology, Stanford, and then at Caltech in Pasadena. Returning to Zurich in 1955, Landolt joined the academic staff of ETHZ, where he worked until his retirement. In 1957 he completed his habilitation thesis Physiologische und √∂kologische Untersuchungen an Lemnaceen (Physiological and ecological studies on duckweeds). From 1957 to 1964 he worked as a Privatdozent in systematic botany, especially systematics of flowering plants. In 1964, Landolt was appointed associate professor of systematic botany, in particular Phanerogamae systematics. He worked from 1966 to 1967 as a professor extraordinarius and from 1967 to 1992 as a professor ordinarius of geobotany; he gave his farewell lecture in February 1993. He also served as director of the Geobotanical Institute from 1966 to 1993, R√ºbel Foundation (now part of the Institute of Integrative Biology in the Department of Environmental Sciences of ETHZ). Even after his retirement in 1992, Landolt remained active in research.  Research and conservation  Landolt became known in Switzerland mainly for his research and publications on the Swiss and Alpine flora, and later also for his extensive mapping for the city of Zurich and the Sihlwald to the south. His geobotanical mapping helped botanists at Zurich's horticultural offices achieve a better understanding of local flora. However, he has also made many exploratory trips to tropical and subtropical countries to collect Lemnoideae. The result is a unique collection of living duckweed and herbarium specimens from which many researchers have obtained the objects for their work. The original collection is still in Zurich. A copy of the collection is maintained in the United States at Rutgers University; a small part of the collection is also available at the Friedrich Schiller University Jena. In addition to his research activities, Landolt has been involved in numerous botany and nature conservation associations and commissions, such as Pro Natura (formerly the Swiss League for the Protection of Nature), the Zurich and Swiss Botanical Societies, the Naturforschende Gesellschaft in Z√ºrich, the Swiss Greina Foundation for the Conservation of Alpine Rivers, the Sihlwald Nature Conservation Foundation, and the Sitatunga Foundation for Nature Conservation.  Honors  In honor of Elias Landolt, a genus of duckweed was named Landoltia by Donald H. Les & Daniel J. Crawford. A small-leaved linden (Tilia cordata), which now grows in the Zurich city park known as the J.-R.-von- Salis-Anlage (located in the ), was planted by Pro Natura in memory of its longtime honorary president. Selected publications In addition to publications intended for the narrower scientific community, Landolt knew how to write those that appealed to an interested lay public.

He was a deputy minister for defence during the second republic, and the member of parliament for the Subin Constituency during the second republic and third republic. Early life and education Thomas was born on 4 October 1936 in Kumasi, Ashanti Region, Gold Coast (now Ghana). He had his early education at St. Cyprian's School in Kumasi and Adisadel College in Cape Coast. He continued at King's College, London, University of London for his bachelor's degree and Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge University for his post graduate degree. Career and politics Thomas was called to the bar at Gray's Inn, London. At the inception of the second republic Thomas contested for the Subin seat on the ticket of the Progress Party and won. Two years later, he was appointed deputy minister for defence. He served in that capacity from 1971 to 1972 when the Busia government was overthrown. During the era of the SMC he was a member of the People's Movement for Freedom and Justice (PMFJ); a movement that opposed the Unigov (union government) concept of governance that was introduced by General Ignatius Kutu Acheampong and his government. After a referendum that suggested that majority of the ghanaian populace were in favour of the unigov concept of governance, he together with other members of the People's Movement for Freedom and Justice (PMFJ) had their assets frozen. In 1979 during the third republic he was once again elected to represent the Subin Constituency in parliament on the ticket of the Popular Front Party; the new name the Progress Party adopted for the 1979 general elections. He served as the member of parliament for Subin until 1981 when the Limann government was overthrown bt the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council.

Background Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War consisted of a series of multi-national military expeditions in 1918. The stated goals were to help the Czechoslovak Legion, to secure supplies of munitions and armaments in Russian ports, and to re-establish the Eastern Front but after the Bolshevik government withdrew from World War I, the Allied Powers openly backed the anti-communist White forces in Russia. Allied efforts were hampered by divided objectives, war- weariness from the overall global conflict, and a lack of domestic support. These factors, together with the evacuation of the Czechoslovak Legion, compelled the Allied Powers to withdraw from North Russia and Siberia in 1920, though Japanese forces occupied parts of Siberia until 1922 and the northern half of Sakhalin until 1925. Incident An American unit of the 27th Infantry Regiment was based at Evgenevka, Station on the Trans-Siberian Railway. An American sentry, known as Private \\"Little\\" Smith, was guarding a portion of the station when a Japanese unit was disembarking from the train. One of the Japanese soldiers tried to pass into the American section but was blocked by Smith. The Japanese soldier, angered by Smith's refusal, smacked the American across the head with his canteen strap. In response, Smith raised his gun to fire but his rifle jammed and so he stabbed the Japanese soldier in the neck with his bayonet. After their soldier was wounded the Japanese unit seized Smith and threatened to execute him. Alerted by American soldiers the commander of the American 27th Infantry Regiment, Major Fitzhugh Lee Allderdice, mobilized all 250 men under his command and marched to the station to free Smith. When they arrived at the station a Japanese Captain tried to stab an American but the blow was blocked by his heavy sheepskin jacket. Major T Airi the commander of the Japanese then arrived and started negotiating with Allderdice. When the Japanese Captain became enraged he lunged at the Americans again but Major Airi blocked the blow with his body receiving a wound on his shoulder. The Americans drew their guns and Allderdice spoke through the translator stating that \\"If you want war with the United States you'll get it if you raise your hand against this command.\\" Smith was eventually freed after it was agreed that the Americans would salute the Japanese officers in the station. October 1 incident On October 1, 1919, it was reported that another incident almost led to a confrontation between Japanese and American forces. Two American officers, Captain L. P. Johns of the 27th and Corporal Benjamin Sperling of the 31st, were arrested by Anti- Bolshevik forces under the command of General Rozanoff, in Iman, Russia. They were seized by the Russians for not having passports. Captain Johns was able to escape to alert his superiors. An American force quickly arrived and attempted to free him but the Russians refused and the local Japanese forces backed the Russians and said that if fighting broke out between the Americans and the Russians the Japanese would back the Russians. Eventually it was discovered that Sperling had been moved to General Kalmykov's HQs and that he would be freed. When Sperling returned to the American base it was revealed that during his captivity he had been flogged. On October 9, 1919, the white- Russians offered an official apology for Sperling's flogging.

Although it is called ridge push, the term is somewhat misleading; it is actually a body force that acts throughout an ocean plate, not just at the ridge, as a result of gravitational pull. The name comes from earlier models of plate tectonics in which ridge push was primarily ascribed to upwelling magma at mid-ocean ridges pushing or wedging the plates apart.  Mechanics  Diagram of a mid-ocean ridge showing ridge push near the mid-ocean ridge and the lack of ridge push after 90 Ma Ridge push is the result of gravitational forces acting on the young, raised oceanic lithosphere around mid-ocean ridges, causing it to slide down the similarly raised but weaker asthenosphere and push on lithospheric material farther from the ridges. Mid-ocean ridges are long underwater mountain chains that occur at divergent plate boundaries in the ocean, where new oceanic crust is formed by upwelling mantle material as a result of tectonic plate spreading and relatively shallow (above ~60 km) decompression melting. The upwelling mantle and fresh crust are hotter and less dense than the surrounding crust and mantle, but cool and contract with age until reaching equilibrium with older crust at around 90 Ma. This produces an isostatic response that causes the young regions nearest the plate boundary to rise above older regions and gradually sink with age, producing the mid-ocean ridge morphology. The greater heat at the ridge also weakens rock closer to the surface, raising the boundary between the brittle lithosphere and the weaker, ductile asthenosphere to create a similar elevated and sloped feature underneath the ridge. These raised features produce ridge push; gravity pulling down on the lithosphere at the mid-ocean ridge is mostly opposed by the normal force from the underlying rock, but the remainder acts to push the lithosphere down the sloping asthenosphere and away from the ridge. Because the asthenosphere is weak, ridge push and other driving forces are enough to deform it and allow the lithosphere to slide over it, opposed by drag at the Lithosphere-Asthenosphere boundary and resistance to subduction at convergent plate boundaries. Ridge push is mostly active in lithosphere younger than 90 Ma, after which it has cooled enough to reach thermal equilibrium with older material and the slope of the Lithosphere-Asthenosphere boundary becomes effectively zero.  History  =Early ideas (1912-1962)= Despite its current status as one of the driving forces of plate tectonics, ridge push was not included in any of Alfred Wegener's 1912-1930 proposals of continental drift, which were produced before the discovery of mid-ocean ridges and lacked any concrete mechanisms by which the process might have occurred. Even after the development of acoustic depth sounding and the discovery of global mid-ocean ridges in the 1930s, the idea of a spreading force acting at the ridges was not mentioned in scientific literature until Harry Hess's proposal of seafloor spreading in 1960, which included a pushing force at mid-ocean ridges as a result of upwelling magma wedging the lithosphere apart. =Gravitational models= In 1964 and 1965, Egon Orowan proposed the first gravitational mechanism for spreading at mid- ocean ridges, postulating that spreading can be derived from the principles of isostasy. In Orowan's proposal, pressure within and immediately under the elevated ridge is greater than the pressure in the oceanic crust to either side due to the greater weight of overlying rock, forcing material away from the ridge, while the lower density of the ridge material relative to the surrounding crust would gradually compensate for the greater volume of rock down to the depth of isostatic compensation. Similar models were proposed by Lliboutry in 1969, Parsons and Richer in 1980, and others. In 1969, Hales proposed a model in which the raised lithosphere of the mid-ocean ridges slid down the elevated ridge, and in 1970 Jacoby proposed that the less dense material and isostasy of Orowan and others' proposals produced uplift which resulted in sliding similar to Hales' proposal. The term \\"ridge push force\\" was coined by Forsyth and Uyeda in 1975.  Significance  Early models of plate tectonics, such as Harry Hess's seafloor spreading model, assumed that the motions of plates and the activity of mid-ocean ridges and subduction zones were primarily the result of convection currents in the mantle dragging on the crust and supplying fresh, hot magma at mid-ocean ridges. Further developments of the theory suggested that some form of ridge push helped supplement convection in order to keep the plates moving, but in the 1990s, calculations indicated that slab pull, the force that a subducted section of plate exerts on the attached crust on the surface, was an order of magnitude stronger than ridge push. As of 1996, slab pull was generally considered the dominant mechanism driving plate tectonics. Modern research, however, indicates that the effects of slab pull are mostly negated by resisting forces in the mantle, limiting it to only 2-3 times the effective strength of ridge push forces in most plates, and that mantle convection is probably much too slow for drag between the lithosphere and the asthenosphere to account for the observed motion of the plates. This restores ridge push as one of the dominant factors in plate motion. = Opposing forces = Ridge push is primarily opposed by plate drag, which is the drag force of the rigid lithosphere moving over the weaker, ductile asthenosphere. Models estimate that ridge push is probably just sufficient to overcome plate drag and maintain the motion of the plate in most areas. Slab pull is similarly opposed by resistance to the subduction of the lithosphere into the mantle at convergent plate boundaries. = Notable qualifications = Research by Rezene Mahatsente indicates that the driving stresses caused by ridge push would be dissipated by faulting and earthquakes in plate material containing large quantities of unbound water, but they conclude that ridge push is still a significant driving force in existing plates because of the rarity of intraplate earthquakes in the ocean. In plates with particularly small or young subducting slabs, ridge push may be the predominant driving force in the plate's motion. According to Stefanick and Jurdy, the ridge push force acting on the South American plate is approximately 5 times the slab pull forces acting at its subducting margins because of the small size of the subducting slabs at the Scotia and Caribbean margins. The Nazca plate also experiences relatively small slab pull, approximately equal to its ridge push, because the plate material is young (no more than 50 million years old) and therefore less dense, with less tendency to sink into the mantle. This also causes the subducting Nazca slab to experience flat slab subduction, one of the few places in the world where this currently occurs.

The station lost its broadcast license over several violations, the most notable of which was the use of its subsidiary communications authority (SCA) subcarrier facility to telecast the results of horse races on an additional audio channel. History Carol Music, Inc., a company that provided wired background music to businesses and restaurants, applied for a construction permit for a new FM station in Chicago on July 2, 1956. The Federal Communications Commission granted the permit on August 30. The transmitter was located on a tower atop 333 North Michigan, which was installed in March 1957. WCLM signed on May 25, 1957, broadcasting originally at 18 kW. The station later obtained authorization to increase its effective radiated power to 60 kW. It would not be long, however, before WCLM's broadcasts, which, like the wired service, were primarily oriented at retail establishments, came in for scrutiny. In 1959, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the intelligence unit of the Chicago Police Department, and the anti-racketeering section of the Office of the Attorney General of the United States opened an inquiry into Carol Music. However, it was an action taken on December 15, 1961, that sparked the interest of the Federal Communications Commission. On that day, a Chicago company known as Newsplex, Inc., began using the SCA channel on WCLM to broadcast the results of horse races to businesses. The lease of the SCA to Newsplex, a company that‚Äîlike Carol Music‚Äîwas managed by William Drenthe, was never reported to the FCC. Further, a routine check revealed that WCLM had broadcast the results of a Florida horse race only 20 minutes after its conclusion, when Florida law at the time required race results to be delayed 30 minutes before being sent by newswires. On July 26, 1962, the FCC ordered WCLM to show cause why its license should not be revoked. In addition to the SCA issues, the FCC claimed that WCLM, with its programming of music and commercials for chain grocery stores, failed to provide the balanced service of entertainment, music, and news that it had promised at its license renewal. It also found that the station had failed to maintain operating logs. Newsplex ceased operating on September 15, 1962. In April 1963, the FCC issued Drenthe, who by that time was no longer the general manager of WCLM, a subpoena to appear at the station's license revocation hearing. Upon receiving and opening the subpoena, Drenthe suffered a heart attack. After the hearing, the two examiners recommended in September that the FCC revoke WCLM's license. They found that the horse race results broadcast on the SCA channel and received by bookies on equipped radios rented from Newsplex were timely enough so as to aid illegal gambling, even though station officials had stated at a 1962 press conference that these results were broadcast on a 30-minute delay. The station also claimed that the FCC used data gathered in its hearings to aid the FBI investigation. On July 24, 1964, the FCC issued its final decision ordering WCLM off the air by unanimous vote. The commission said that Carol Music had failed to program the station in accordance with the proposals made by the company when applying for its license and had used the SCA for a purpose other than that originally stated, noting that the other violations found in the hearing made it unnecessary for the FCC to consider the horse race results service as a factor in revoking the license. It denied a petition for reconsideration that November, but Carol Music appealed in federal court, keeping the station on the air into 1965. The court granted the FCC's motion to dismiss the appeal in November, in effect upholding the revocation. A final attempt to stay a revocation order was denied, and in August 1966, WCLM finally left the air, with the FCC authorizing August 27 as the latest date the station could cease operations. The 101.9 frequency did not stay vacant long in the Chicago area, which at the time was the battleground for a complex series of competing applications, interference concerns, and short-spacing complaints. In December 1964, the FCC proposed relocating the frequency from Chicago to Skokie to solve interference problems. Station WRSV had gone on the air in 1961 at 98.3, causing considerable interference to second-adjacent station WFMT at 98.7 and generating interference complaints from listeners of WRSV and WFMT. It was also substantially short-spaced, per the mileage separations at the time, to WFMT and WHFC at 97.9. In September 1966, with WCLM off the air, WRSV moved to 101.9, though it could not use the exact facilities of WCLM, as these were grandfathered into the later introduction of FM station classes.

It lies at the intersection of politics, social science, statistics, and education.  History  There is a long history of advocacy for the role of evidence to promote social. Marquis de Condorcet‚Äôs notion of savoir liberateur ‚Äì knowledge that empowers people to liberate themselves from social oppression - provides an example; William Playfair‚Äòs Political and Commercial Atlas (1786) is an early publication designed to make complex evidence accessible to a wide audience; John Snow and Florence Nightingale both used powerful graphical displays to address problems associated with disease; the Otto Neurath's work on Isotype (picture language) set out to establish a universal graphical language for communicating about social issues. Humans have always lived in uncertain times, and have made decisions in the light of imperfect data. Recently, there has been a dramatic increase in the volume and nature of data available, in the tools available for display and analysis, and in the ways information is communicated. In parallel, there has been a growing distain for robust evidence ‚Äì illustrated by notions of a ‚Äòpost truth‚Äô era; and descriptions of journalists as enemies of the people.  Applications  Here are described some facets of statistical literacy that underpin the ability to engage with statistics about social issues ‚Äì i.e. Civic Statistics. Data that can be used to inform social policy are complex. Data are often multivariate; aggregated data and indicator systems are common; variables interact; data may be time critical. There is a core set of ideas associated with literacy and numeracy that are essential to functioning in society, such as reading skills, understanding arguments, reading graphs and handling percentages. Beyond this citizens need to do more than understand data ‚Äì they need to see the implications for society and policy.Engaging Civic Statistics: A Call for Action This requires knowledge about the processes of knowledge generation, and ways to represent and model situations, along with ideas commonly taught in statistics courses such as sample bias and inference. It also requires contextual knowledge the state of society (e.g. the percentage of tax revenue spent on healthcare). Civic statistics aims to empower citizens and policy makers by addressing the central issues associated with evidence-informed decision making.Conceptual Framework for Civic Statistics These include: developing a sophisticated approach to questions of data provenance and data quality; understanding the uses and abuses of a wide range of methods for presenting and analysing social data from a variety of sources; ways to represent and model situations; understanding risk; and appropriate advocacy.

It was written by series showrunner Jesse Armstrong and directed by Mark Mylod, and aired on August 11, 2019. The episode picks up two days after the end of the first season, and sees a traumatized Kendall trying to make amends with his father while backtracking on his attempted takeover of the company. Logan begins to consider naming his successor. Plot Shortly after Shiv and Tom's wedding, Kendall is in a rehab clinic in Iceland, but is called away within 48 hours of his stay to give a public statement regarding his decision to back down from his hostile takeover of Waystar RoyCo. Still traumatized and disoriented after the events in England, Kendall struggles to offer a coherent response, but Karolina instructs him to simply say, \\"I saw their plan, and my dad's plan was better.\\" The Roy siblings, who are unaware of Kendall's accident and still feel betrayed by his takeover attempt, watch his interview with confusion at his strange appearance. Shiv and Tom watch from a yacht where they are spending their honeymoon, which they decide to cut short so they can attend to family matters (including Tom's new role in the company). Roman and Gerri, meanwhile, watch the statement from a Japanese hospital, where they are visiting those injured in the explosion that occurred during the botched satellite launch that Roman oversaw. Roman evades most questions during a press conference regarding the incident. Kendall returns to New York and sits down with Logan and Karl in Waystar's offices to assess the extent of Stewy and Sandy's threat. Kendall privately confides to Logan some of the personal information he revealed to Stewy and Sandy that attested to his father's erratic behavior. Logan later has dinner with his financial adviser Jamie Laird, who suggests that he sell the company to avoid a costly legal battle. That night, Greg comes to Kendall's temporary new apartment to deliver him cocaine. The next morning, Kendall arrives early to lunch at the family's summer home in the Hamptons, where an unidentified foul odor fills the house. Colin, the head of Logan's security detail, takes Kendall aside to inform him that he is not a suspect in the police investigation into Andrew Dodds' death. The other children arrive, and the source of the stench is discovered to be a dead raccoon stuffed in the chimney. Logan has the prepared meal discarded and orders pizza, and asks his children for their opinion on whether he should sell the company. However, none of them find themselves able to speak freely in front of the entire family. Logan excuses himself to his office and has the Roy children meet him one by one behind closed doors, starting with Roman. Shiv is called in next, where Logan tells her he sees her fit to run the company. Shiv is taken aback by the offer but expresses interest. However, she doesn't disclose this to Tom, and simply informs him that he has been named the Chair of Global Broadcast News at ATN. At dusk, Logan confronts the contractor who was in charge of recent repairs to the summer home, who placed the dead raccoons in the chimney out of resentment for being underpaid. Logan has the contractor either take an even smaller sum of money or receive no payment at all. That night, Logan takes Kendall to meet with Stewy and Sandy in Manhattan, but sends Kendall in alone. Stewy is both enraged and bewildered by Kendall's betrayal, and Sandy refuses to come to a compromise, which makes the strenuous legal battle their only option. Kendall assures them that they will lose. Production \\"The Summer Palace\\" was written by Succession showrunner Jesse Armstrong and directed by Mark Mylod in his fifth episode for the series. For season 2, actors J. Smith-Cameron (Gerri), Arian Moayed (Stewy), and Dagmara Domi≈Ñczyk (Karolina) were promoted to series regulars and received credit in the opening titles. The episode introduces Danny Huston in a recurring role as Jamie Laird, Logan's financial adviser. The episode's opening scenes at Kendall's rehab clinic were shot on location in Iceland. Henry Ford II's 1960 estate in the Hamptons stood in for the Roys' summer home. Production designer Stephen Carter remarked that the location was chosen to reflect Logan's sensibilities: \\"Given the age of the character, he would have been forming his impressions of what trendy style would be in the sixties.\\" The production retrofitted new artwork and furniture in five of the home's rooms to create the set. Reception =Ratings= Upon airing, the episode was watched by 0.612 million viewers, with an 18-49 rating of 0.18. =Critical reception= \\"The Summer Palace\\" received critical acclaim, with many reviewers praising the introduction of Shiv as a potential successor to Logan. On Rotten Tomatoes, the episode has a rating of 94% based on 17 reviews, with the critics' consensus stating, \\"Fast-paced, savage, and surprisingly tragic, the one percent continues to commit unspeakable atrocities to one another in the entertaining \\"The Summer Palace.\\"\\" Randall Colburn of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, praising the developments to Kendall's character arc despite previously believing his story to be concluded in the first season. Colburn called Sarah Snook a \\"reservoir of restrained exuberance\\" in her performance during the negotiation between Logan and Shiv. Scott Tobias of Vulture gave the episode a full five stars, comparing Kendall's sudden subservience to The Manchurian Candidate and praising writer Armstrong for mining the \\"tragicomedy\\" of the situation. Emily VanDerWerff of Vox called the Shiv storyline a \\"delicious\\" setup for the rest of the season, and praised Kieran Culkin's ability to find \\"unusual physicality to all of his scenes.\\" VanDerWerff also found parallels between Roman's idea of downscaling the family business to the real-world budget cuts at the Fox Corporation. =Accolades= Sarah Snook submitted this episode to support her nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series at the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards.https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/2020-emmy- nominations/ References External links * \\"The Summer Palace\\" at HBO * Category:2019 American television episodes Category:Succession (TV series) ","title":"The Summer Palace (Succession)"},{"id":"61440778","text":"Suzanne Fei is an American bioinformatics analyst.

It was written by Jon Brown and directed by Andrij Parekh, and aired on August 18, 2019. In the episode, Kendall is tasked with reviewing the performance of Vaulter, a media startup whose acquisition he personally engineered. Tom begins work at Waystar's news outlet ATN and becomes privy to Shiv's expanding future at the company. The episode became notable among critics for its satire of online news publications and its various parallels to ongoing issues in the journalism industry. Plot The Roys watch Stewy's interview regarding the takeover bid on rival news network PGM, and decide to retaliate immediately. Logan tasks Kendall and Roman with scrutinizing Vaulter, which is becoming a financial sink for Waystar. Senator Eavis promotes Shiv to chief of staff of his presidential campaign. Shiv meets Logan to discuss his offer to run the company, but Logan suggests that it would take three years for Shiv to fully integrate into her role as CEO. The next day, Kendall and Roman visit Vaulter's offices and inform Lawrence that they will be performing a routine check of Vaulter's performance for Logan. Lawrence attempts to stall Kendall's efforts by burying him in paperwork, while Roman takes several Vaulter employees out for drinks in an attempt to extract more valuable information from them. Tom, who has been promoted to Chair of Global Broadcast News at ATN, meets the network's owner Cyd Peach, who immediately dominates over him and dismisses him as another corporate bureaucrat. Determined to make his own impact, Tom tasks Greg with rooting out inefficiencies at the network, despite Greg's discomfort with ATN's politics. That night, Connor and Willa host a party celebrating their return to New York, which doubles as a canvassing event for Connor's presidential bid. Greg suggests to Tom that they digitize ATN's operations; Tom takes it as an opportunity to fire employees. Kendall and Roman report their review of Vaulter's performance to Logan the next morning. Kendall wants Waystar to keep the company, but Roman reports having learned from intoxicated employees that Vaulter's readership is failing and that its staff wants to unionize. Logan sides with Roman and tasks Kendall with shutting down Vaulter and merging its intellectual property into Waystar's assets. Kendall hesitantly obliges, and unsuccessfully attempts to talk Vaulter's employees out of unionizing in a final attempt to salvage the site's viability. Shiv and Tom have dinner with Roman and Tabitha, and Tom is roundly mocked. Afterwards, Shiv informs Tom that Logan has offered her the company. Tom expresses support but worries that the offer jeopardizes his own planned inheritance of the company; Shiv claims that Tom is still set to take over. Kendall covertly installs Wi-Fi blockers in Vaulter's offices that night and arrives the next morning to inform the company's entire staff of their termination. Lawrence is nonplussed and demands to know why Kendall is suddenly turning against him; Kendall flatly answers that he is doing so on his father's orders. That night, he copes by throwing a drug-fueled party in a temporary apartment he gifts to Greg. The next morning, Logan brings in Kendall to work alongside him full-time to help navigate the proxy battle against Stewy and Sandy. Meanwhile, Shiv antagonizes Eavis and decides to quit his campaign. That evening, Kendall shoplifts from a convenience store. Production \\"Vaulter\\" was written by Jon Brown and directed by Andrij Parekh. It was Parekh's second time directing for the series after serving as a cinematographer for several episodes in the first season and directing the episode \\"Which Side Are You On?. The episode introduces Jeannie Berlin in a recurring role as Cyd Peach, the hard-nosed owner of Waystar's news outlet ATN. The fictional company Vaulter has several parallels to real-world online media startups, and numerous critics pointed out how it functioned as a parody of popular news websites and gossip blogs. Vice was often cited as the most prominent basis for Vaulter by critics, and Vice News itself published an article by Drew Schwartz identifying various similarities between the culture of Vaulter depicted in the episode and Vice's own idiosyncrasies. These included a large neon sign bearing the company logo, framed photos of marijuana farms, and \\"unhinged headlines\\" like \\"Meet the World‚Äôs Richest People Trafficker (He‚Äôs a Surprisingly Nice Guy).\\" In the same piece, Schwartz also compared Vaulter to Gawker, for its similarly strained relationship with its parent company; and BuzzFeed, also for the comically exaggerated headlines. Austen Goslin of Polygon compared Vaulter's attempted \\"pivot to video\\" to the real-life fad of video-based content that companies like Facebook, Vice, and Mashable once saw as a major profit generator. Goslin particularly emphasized the similarity between Vaulter and Mic, which made a failed gambit on the profitability of video journalism in 2017 and ultimately sold for far less than its once-soaring valuation. Mic also performed mass layoffs of its staff during its downfall, similar to Kendall's firing of Vaulter's employees at the end of the episode; additionally, its founder partially attributed the company's failure to Facebook's algorithms, which the character Lawrence Yee blames for Vaulter's low readership in the episode. The name \\"Vaulter\\" was also compared to New York Magazine's entertainment-based subsidiary Vulture. Reception =Ratings= Upon airing, the episode was watched by 0.603 million viewers, with an 18-49 rating of 0.16. =Critical reception= \\"Vaulter\\" received critical acclaim, with reviewers praising the performances, writing, and the depiction of Vaulter, which was frequently described as a satire of prominent online news websites and culture blogs. On Rotten Tomatoes, the episode has a rating of 94% based on 18 reviews, with the critics' consensus stating, \\"Along with the disastrous downfall of a new media company, Jeremy Strong's performance as the downtrodden Kendall Roy takes \\"Vaulter\\" to the next level.\\" Randall Colburn of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A-, praising Kendall's character development and remarking on the \\"painful\\" parallels between the Vaulter storyline and the historically tense relationship between real-life news companies and unions, including The A.V. Club and its parent company G/O Media. Colburn remarked that \\"as painful as it is to watch, [the episode] nevertheless reflects the ruthlessness of our monopolized economic climate, and continues the series‚Äô exploration of how the pettiness and interpersonal drama of the 1% drips down to the working class and, in this instance, journalism.\\" Winston Cook-Wilson of Spin called \\"Vaulter\\" one of the series' best episodes to date, remarking that the episode mixed \\"a nuanced take on one of America‚Äôs most doomed industries with its typical air of high melodrama\\" and finding the scene in which Kendall discourages Vaulter's employees from unionizing to be \\"harrowing.\\" Cook-Wilson found numerous similarities between the shutdown of Vaulter and the downfall of real-world news companies after acquisition, which also included the controversial leadership of G/O Media under Jim Spanfeller. Scott Tobias of Vulture gave the episode a full five stars, saying that the series gets its depiction of a modern online news company \\"excruciatingly right.\\" Tobias praised the episode's emotionally resonant depiction of Kendall's deteriorating resolve, and described Jeannie Berlin's guest appearance as an \\"absolute treat.\\" Noel Murray of The New York Times praised Matthew Macfadyen's performance in the episode, saying that the episode featured some of the actor's best scenes in the series. Murray also praised Nicholas Braun for his delivery of Greg's many comic moments in the episode.

It was written by Tony Roche and directed by Andrij Parekh, and aired on August 25, 2019. In the episode, the Roys go on a hunting trip in Hungary, but conflict erupts over Logan's controversial plan to acquire a rival news corporation. The episode became notable for \\"Boar on the Floor,\\" a fictional game that is depicted during the climax. Plot Greg meets with author Michelle Pantsil, who is writing a biography on Logan, but abruptly leaves when he realizes he is being recorded. Logan, whose health remains under question, announces to his board that Waystar will be taking over rival media giant Pierce Global Media (PGM), and shuts down the members who disagree with the idea. Logan also decides to bring Frank back to the company, seeing as he is personal friends with PGM owner Nan Pierce. Roman and Tabitha watch Connor's presidential campaign announcement, which he is running on an anti-tax platform. Roman asks Tabitha to reach out to PGM board member Naomi Pierce, her friend and past sexual fling, to broach the idea of an acquisition. Shiv, who knows of Logan's acquisition plans thanks to Gerri and disapproves of it, asks Gerri to have Tom talk Logan out of it at the family's upcoming hunting retreat in Hungary. On the plane, Logan is furious to learn that someone within the company spoke to Pantsil; Greg becomes nervous about being found out. They reunite with Frank after landing in Hungary and discuss the logistics of acquiring PGM. Back in New York, Shiv tries to convince Connor not to run for president, seeing as an anti-tax campaign is unfeasible. She accompanies Willa for drinks and seduces one of the actors in Willa's planned stage play. Connor, against the advice of his family, releases his campaign video to the public. While hunting, Greg confides to Tom that he spoke to Pantsil and begs Tom to keep his secret. Kendall and Roman discuss having been contacted by Pantsil themselves; Roman discreetly takes a private call. One pig is shot during the hunting session and brought back to the lodge as the main course for dinner. Logan is further infuriated when he learns that the Pierces already know about his acquisition plans, demanding to know who in the company tipped them off. As everyone begins to eat, Logan cuts off the dinner and begins individually interrogating various members of the group to find out who talked to the Pierce family. Logan has Karl, Tom and Greg sit in the corner of the room and subjects them to a viciously humiliating game he calls \\"Boar on the Floor,\\" having the three of them play-act like pigs and fight over a piece of sausage, with the loser being declared the mole. Amidst the chaos, Kendall wrestles Roman's phone away from him and learns that it was in fact Roman who talked to the Pierces. Roman claims he was trying to help his father, but Logan berates him and demands to know who in the room backs him on the acquisition. Kendall observes that everyone present is opposed, but Logan insists that he will nonetheless see his plan through. During breakfast the next morning, Logan finds out that Mo, a recently-deceased member of the board, talked to Pantsil and considers the issue resolved, to Greg's relief. Gerri approaches a despondent Roman and convinces him to take Waystar's six-week management training course to better understand the company and earn the respect of his father. On the plane back to New York, Frank informs Logan that PGM's CEO is interested in a meeting. That night, Logan calls Shiv telling her it is time to bring her into the company. Production \\"Hunting\\" was written by Tony Roche, who had previously worked with Succession showrunner Jesse Armstrong as a writer on the series The Thick of It, Veep, and Fresh Meat, and the film In the Loop. It was directed by Andrij Parekh, in his third episode for the series - Parekh, typically a cinematographer, served as the series' director of photography during the early episodes of the first season. Oheka Castle in Huntington, New York stood in for the Roys' hunting lodge in Hungary. Armstrong said the decision to set the episode in Hungary was inspired by Josef Stalin's dinner parties, where he would frequently play cruel jokes on his close associates. =\\"Boar on the Floor\\"= The episode's most widely- noted sequence depicts \\"Boar on the Floor,\\" a sadistic game Logan plays to root out the source of a leak in his company. Roche said that the scene was an effort to \\"explore how poisonous an influence Logan is on his friends and family, as well as on the world.\\" Armstrong named several real-life influences for the \\"extraordinary and extreme\\" nature of the way internal corporate conflicts were handled in the episode, including Sumner Redstone, Ghislaine Maxwell and Rupert Murdoch, while Parekh drew inspiration from the Stanford prison experiment, \\"where people are made either guards or prisoners, and [about] how people settle in a habit, and they allow themselves to do things that they would otherwise never do.\\" Parekh noted that certain parts of the scene, such as the actors crawling on their hands and knees, were not originally in the script, and that he had to take care to minimize the amount of discomfort among the actors in filming the \\"awful\\" and \\"gruesome\\" scene.

Kornhaber compared the episode's climax to the dinner party scene in the 2017 film The Square in the way fear and humiliation \\"[morph] professionals into pigs\\" and how \\"the hooting and jeering from onlookers is a clear demonstration of how easily civilization can collapse into something more animalistic.\\" Randall Colburn of The A.V.

It was written by Georgia Pritchett and directed by Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini, and aired on September 1, 2019. The episode charts several character threads: Logan and Kendall work to secure the acquisition of a rival media giant; Shiv is brought in to observe the daily operations of the company; Roman enters Waystar's management training program; Tom faces an internal controversy while overseeing the company's news channel, ATN; Connor and Willa attend the funeral of a board member with a problematic past; Kendall struggles with his mental health. The episode introduces Holly Hunter in a recurring role as Rhea Jarrell, the CEO of Waystar's rival news conglomerate Pierce Global Media (PGM). Plot Kendall takes a trip to Waystar's rooftop, under surveillance from the security cameras. He makes a call to PGM's CEO, Rhea Jarrell, establishing contact ahead of their upcoming meeting. Shiv rides with Tom to her first day at Waystar. They are met with protests over ATN anchor Mark Ravenhead, who is under fire for his alleged support of Nazism. Logan discusses the issue at a board meeting, noting that it presents a problem for his acquisition of PGM, which leans left. He tasks Tom with scrutinizing Ravenhead to see if any of the accusations have merit. Meanwhile, Connor and Willa attend the funeral of board member Mo, where Connor hopes to meet potential donors for his presidential campaign. Connor informs Willa that Mo's real name is in fact Lester; the nickname \\"Mo\\" is a play on the word \\"molester,\\" which Lester was known to be. Michelle Pantsil is present at the funeral and presses Connor on his knowledge of Lester's past, but Willa helps Connor rewrite his eulogy into a series of generic statements to sabotage Pantsil's efforts at using any information against him. Shiv and Gerri discuss Kendall's erratic behavior as of late, which includes shoplifting. Shiv remains perplexed as to why Kendall is suddenly so loyal to his father. Kendall, meanwhile, meets Rhea in the company parking lot and brings her upstairs to meet Logan privately. Rhea informs them that the Pierce family has no interest in selling their company. Meanwhile, Tom sits down with Ravenhead and receives strong indications that he is indeed a Nazi sympathizer; however, their meeting is cut short when a gunshot is heard in the building and everyone is ushered into safe rooms. Logan, Shiv and Rhea are taken to a larger, more secure safe room than Tom and Greg, who are simply locked inside a random office space, much to Tom's chagrin. Kendall is brought in shortly afterwards, having visited the rooftop again. Logan and Kendall manage to sway Rhea into accepting a handsome offer of money to buy PGM. Greg, meanwhile, admits to Tom that he no longer wants to work at ATN. Tom is enraged and begins attacking Greg with water bottles, but the chaos dies down once the building's premises are deemed safe to reenter. Greg reveals to Tom that he kept copies of the cruises documents and blackmails him into giving him a promotion; Tom, impressed with Greg's audacity, begrudgingly agrees. Roman, meanwhile, starts the company's six-week management training program, having been advised to do so by Gerri in order to earn his father's respect. However, he is bored by the training events and behaves disrespectfully while working as a character at one of the company parks. He soon befriends an eccentric co- trainee named Brian, and the two of them successfully come up with a pitch for a new ride at Waystar's parks. However, Roman is taken aside and informed of the possible shooting at the company building, and uses the situation as an excuse to skip the class rather than present his idea. As Rhea leaves, Logan agrees to fire Ravenhead from ATN as a \\"peace offering\\" to the Pierces. He is informed that the shooting was in fact a suicide triggered by bullying within ATN's workplace environment. That night, Roman returns from his first day of management training and flippantly reports his progress to Gerri; he suddenly finds himself sexually aroused when she scolds him, and Gerri plays along with his fetish. Meanwhile, Kendall, still guilty over the death of Andrew Dodds, tearfully confides to Shiv he doesn't feel he is worth anything beyond his loyalty to his father. The next morning, Kendall revisits the rooftop, only to find glass suicide barriers installed along the perimeter. Production \\"Safe Room\\" was written by Georgia Pritchett and directed by husband-and-wife team Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini. Actor Jeremy Strong said he used Crime and Punishment and The Manchurian Candidate as inspirations for his performance as Kendall in season 2, describing the character as an \\"almost somnambulistic, just dead-eyed soldier who's been weaponized, who's been made to cross further and further his own moral and ethical lines.\\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fien-print/succession-safe-room- jeremy-strong-interview-1235677 Scott Tobias of Vulture inferred that the active-shooter scare in the episode was inspired by the real-life bomb threat in the CNN offices in December 2018.https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/succession-season-2-episode-4-recap-safe- room.html Reception =Ratings= Upon airing, the episode was watched by 0.577 million viewers, with an 18-49 rating of 0.11.http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-sunday- cable-originals-network-finals-9-1-2019.html =Critical reception= \\"Safe Room\\" received critical acclaim, with reviewers praising its ability to balance humor and timely political themes, and many calling it one of the series' best episodes.

It was written by Will Tracy and directed by Mark Mylod, and aired on September 8, 2019. \\"Tern Haven\\" shows the Roy family meeting with another billionaire family, the Pierces, in a step toward a potential acquisition of the Pierce family media conglomerate PGM by Waystar RoyCo. The episode introduces several new characters, including Nan Pierce, and marks the first on-screen appearance of Naomi Pierce, previously only mentioned. Plot Logan officially announces his plans to acquire rival media giant Pierce Global Media (PGM), but informs the family that they first have to spend the weekend at the estate of the Pierce family to allay concerns about the Roys' \\"moral character.\\" PGM's readership and sales have foundered over the last two years, presenting a clearer opportunity for the Roys. Nonetheless, Logan, who is staunchly determined to win the acquisition, gives his family meticulous instructions on how to present themselves to the Pierces. Kendall is told to arrive later than the rest of the family under the pretense of \\"volunteering.\\" The Pierces receive the Roys at Tern Haven, their family estate in Long Island. The Roys have already established certain inroads with the Pierces: Frank is personal friends with the family matriarch Nan Pierce, while Roman's girlfriend Tabitha once had a sexual relationship with Nan's cousin Naomi, who has made a special trip for the meeting with the Roys. The two families mingle, though there is friction between Connor and Maxim Pierce, a consultant at the Brookings Institution who doesn't take Connor's presidential ambitions seriously, as well as between Shiv and Mark Pierce, an academic to whom she makes a condescending joke. Kendall soon arrives and learns that he and Naomi share a history of drug problems. Logan takes his family aside and scolds them for not meeting his expectations of how they must \\"perform\\", but Marcia is frustrated with Logan for his paranoid, controlling behavior. That night, the two families have dinner together, which becomes increasingly tense as the Pierces probe into the lives of the Roys. Marcia makes comments suggesting that she is resentful of how Logan treats her, and Tom feels pressured when the liberal Pierces repeatedly insult him over his position at ATN. Tensions reach a breaking point when Nan asks Logan who he plans to name as his successor: Logan refuses to answer the question, prompting Shiv to angrily proclaim that she has already been chosen, stunning the room. Nan ends the dinner and ushers everyone outdoors to go stargazing. While everyone else gathers outside, Shiv takes solace in her bedroom and panics to Tom, regretting her outburst. Meanwhile, Kendall and Naomi, who have become increasingly flirtatious over the night, sneak off to do cocaine together, and later get drunk and have sex inside the Roys' helicopter. Naomi admits to Kendall that she despises the Roys for running tabloids on her while she struggled with her addiction, and that she is only here to ensure that an acquisition deal fails. In the middle of the night, Roman and Tabitha attempt to have sex for the first time, but Roman struggles to perform, and Tabitha is put off by his unusual fetishes. He visits Gerri's room and once again becomes sexually aroused by her erotic humiliation. The following morning, Nan, Rhea and Naomi meet privately with Logan, Shiv, Gerri and Kendall, and agree to sell PGM's ownership to the Roys on the condition that Shiv is named Logan's successor. Logan refuses their terms and calls off the deal, but suggests to Nan that her family needs the money in order for their company to survive. As soon as the Roys land back in Manhattan, Logan receives a phone call saying the Pierces have reconsidered, and that the deal is a success. The Roys celebrate at Logan's apartment, but Logan himself chooses to reflect in his room alone. Production The episode was filmed over the course of two days at a mansion on Long Island, referred to in the episode as \\"Tern Haven\\". Stephen Carter, the production designer for the show, originally considered \\"Tern Haven\\" as a shooting location for the Roy summer home, but it ultimately fit better for the \\"....New England, Hyannis Port-style vibe\\" the production team sought for the Pierce family. The home originally belonged to Junius Spencer Morgan, who named it \\"Salutation\\". The estate is one of several in the area used as filming locations for the second season. During the episode's dinner scene, which culminates in arguments and tense conversation between members of both families, the camera crew gradually became closer to the actors in order to make the audience feel \\"intimately connected\\" to the scene. =Pierce family= \\"Tern Haven\\" marks the on-screen introduction of the Pierce family, owners of another, left- leaning media company, PGM. The Pierce family has no single real-world analog, but Will Tracy, the writer of \\"Tern Haven\\" indicated the family was inspired by the Bancrofts, Sulzbergers and Grahams, which he referred to as \\"...reputable, blue-blood, northeastern, legacy-media families\\". Their narrative also resembles those of the American Taylor and Chandler media families. The production team did not create the Pierce family members as \\"doppelg√§nger analogs\\". Instead, the other family was designed to \\"...feed a mounting sense of friction,\\" though critics noted parallels between individual Roy-Pierce pairs. Writing for The New Yorker, Rachel Syme described the Pierce family aesthetic as \\"shabby chic,\\" indicating dynastic wealth, as opposed to the sleeker, arriviste fashion choices of the Roys. Reception =Ratings= Upon airing, the episode was watched by 0.507 million viewers, with an 18-49 rating of 0.11. =Critical reception= \\"Tern Haven\\" received critical acclaim, with particular praise directed at Tracy's script, the performances, and the dynamic between the Roys and Pierces. On Rotten Tomatoes, the episode has a rating of 94% based on 17 reviews, with the critics' consensus stating, \\"Cultural and political differences collide when the elder Roy struggles to convince the Pierce family to hand over their crown jewels in the highly fascinating, intensely devastating 'Tern Haven.'\\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/succession/s02/e05 Randall Colburn of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, noting how the episode developed the relationship between Logan and Shiv, and praising the \\"gorgeous\\" scene in which Kendall and Naomi bond over their similar histories with their respective families. Vox considered \\"Tern Haven\\" to be the best episode of Succession to date, pointing out the Shakespearian influence over the Roy- Pierce dynamic and also singling out the scenes between Kendall and Naomi for praise. The reviewers also enjoyed the introduction of the Pierces, describing them as a \\"hilarious jumble of upper-class nonsense.\\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/9/8/20853285/succession- season-2-episode-5-tern-haven-recap-shiv-logan-pierce Vulture's Scott Tobias rated the episode 5 out of 5 stars, praising the dialogue and remarking on the added depth given to Shiv and Tom's relationship. Joanna Robinson, writing for Vanity Fair, noted the episode's focus on \\"female ambition\\" and the goals of the women in the cast, heightened by the introduction of the \\"matriarchal Pierce family\\". Den of Geek's Andrew Husband rated the episode 4.5 out of 5 stars, considering the episode the second half of a \\"brilliant two-parter\\" that began with the previous week's \\"Safe Room\\". Husband remarked on how the episode's plot highlighted each of the Roys' unique idiosyncrasies. =Accolades= At the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards, Cherry Jones won the award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series for her performance in the episode and Kieran Culkin submitted this episode to support his nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series.https://www.goldderby.com/feature/complete-list-2020-emmys-episode- submissions-revealed-updating-1203624872/ References External links * \\"Tern Haven\\" at HBO * Category:2019 American television episodes Category:Succession (TV series) ","title":"Tern Haven"},{"id":"61440812","text":"Osoet Pegua or Soet Pegu (1615‚Äì1658), was a Thai businesswoman. She acted as the business agent between the Ayutthaya Kingdom and the Netherlands in the mid-17th century, during which she had a very influential position and enjoyed a de facto monopoly to the trade between the two nations. Osoet Pegua was a member of the Mon people. She was a successful businesswoman with valuable contacts in the Thai royal court. During this period, South East Asia had a small merchant class, and trade was often left to women, as it was regarded as a part of domestic household duties. Most of the international trade in the region took place between foreign tradesmen and the local rulers, and the foreign tradesmen often conducted temporary marriages with local businesswomen, who acted as the agents between the foreign tradesmen and the ruler. Osoet Pegua was one of the most famous of these women, and became well known in Thailand as an example of a female business agent, and as an independent woman. She conducted temporary marriages with several of the officials of the Dutch East India Company, and acted as the agent between King Prasat Thong and the Netherlands, effectively controlling the trade between the two nations. Between 1638 and 1642, she was briefly married to Jeremias van Vliet, the leading official of the Dutch East India Company's station in Thailand. In 1642, Jeremias van Vliet left her to become governor of Dutch Malacca. This resulted in a conflict between him and Pegua which disturbed trade relations between Ayutthaya and the Netherlands.

The ex-Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, directed the Government of Pakistan (PML-N) to initiate a national program to provide laptops to students who perform well academically. Selected students were given a laptop (manufactured by Haier) and a 3G EVO device. Students were also allowed access to HEC's National Digital Library using the 3G/4G EVO device. This scheme was a part of the Prime Minister's Youth Programs. It was abolished by the Tehreek-e-Insaaf government in Pakistan.  Free online courses with HEC and Coursera  The Higher Education Commission Pakistan (HEC) partnered with Coursera in 2018 to offer students 8,000 free online courses.

The dress's simplicity was praised in Vogue: \\"the sum of that simple perfection which distinguishes her whole Molyneux trousseau, and which only a fine personal taste could have achieved.\\" Princess Marina wore a tulle veil with a diamond fringe tiara belonging to her mother, Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia. She wore two small bunches of orange blossom over each ear. Princess Marina also wore a 34-stone diamond rivi√®re necklace, which was a gift from King George V.

It is part of the complex which also includes a bell-tower, an episcopal palace, and a circuit wall. The complex is inscribed on the list of Georgia's Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance. The complex stands in what is now the village of Zemo Nikozi‚Äîan \\"upper\\" part of the historical settlement of Nikozi‚Äîon the right bank of the Greater Liakhvi River, in the immediate proximity of the South Ossetia conflict zone, some 2 km south of the disputed entity's capital of Tskhinvali. The episcopal palace was badly damaged in fighting during the August 2008 Russo-Georgian War and subsequently underwent an emergency stabilization program. The Zemo Nikozi church is the seat of a bishop of the Georgian Orthodox Eparchy of Nikozi and Tskhinvali, responsible for the territory of South Ossetia. Some 100 m south stands the church of the Archangel, a small 10th-century domed structure.  History  The first recorded mention of Nikozi occurs in a chronicle of Juansher, who attributes the founding of the church there and the appointment of a bishop to the 5th-century king Vakhtang Gorgasali: \\"he built the church of Nik'ozi at the hearth of a fire(-temple), and installed a bishop where was buried the body of St. Ra≈æden, who had been martyred by the Persians in the war with Vaxt'ang.\\" This account is reiterated by the historian Prince Vakhushti, writing c. 1745, who adds that a bishop still resided at Nikozi in his day, being \\"a pastor to the Caucasians, the Dvals, and what is now known as Ossetia, as well as Glola-Ghebi\\". St. Ra≈æden's martyrium is also mentioned by the anonymous 13th-century Georgian chronicle Histories and Eulogies of the Sovereigns, which relates that one of the sons of \\"the kings of Ossetians\\", a disillusioned claimant to the hand of Queen Tamar (), died in Nikozi and was buried in its church of St. Ra≈æden. The Nikozi cathedral and its complex was constructed over a several-century span. The extant church building dates mostly to the 14th‚Äì16th century, a bell-tower is a 16th‚Äì17th-century structure and an episcopal palace was built in the 9th‚Äì11th century. Several other buildings such as a bishop's residence, cells, a refectory, and various accessory structures were constructed in the 19th and 20th centuries. During the August 2008 Russo-Georgian War, Zemo Nikozi was a scene of heavy fighting between the Georgian and Russian forces and Russian air attacks on 10 August 2008, which damaged the Nikozi complex, especially the recently repaired episcopal palace. Its renovated roof, floor, and balconies were burned down, and the original south floor stones cracked due to fire. Monastic cells, a bishop's dwelling, and the refectory were completely destroyed. After the war, following an action initiated by the Council of Europe, a project was implemented for emergency stabilization works to the Nikozi complex, including preliminary onsite works, a new roof, consolidation and stabilization of the structure, and archaeological works, setting grounds for further rehabilitation works.  Architecture  Dome of the church. A bell-tower at Nikozi. As systematic archaeological studies have not been conducted at Nikozi and the church has been remodeled several times in the course of history, neither the fire-temple nor the 5th-century shrine of St. Ra≈æden mentioned in the chronicles has been identified. The extant cathedral is constructed in a cross-in-square plan, measuring 16.7 √ó 11.5 m. A three- line inscription in the medieval Georgian asomtavruli script on the south fa√ßade identifies Bishop Michael as the builder of the church and is paleographically dated to the 10th century. The church was substantially rebuilt in the 14th to 16th century and further renovated in the 17th and 19th centuries. Both the outer and inner walls of the church are faced with hewn stone slabs. The interior has then been plastered. The entrances are on the west, south, and north, the latter now closed up. The semi-circular apse of the sanctuary is flanked by a rectangular pastophorium on each side. The eastern and western arms of the \\"cross\\" are somewhat elongated. Each of the four arms is pierced by a single window. The dome rests upon the corners of the eastern walls and protruding pylons of the western wall. Eight windows punctuate the drum of the dome. The building is capped with coping stones. Stone ram heads are placed on the ridges of all four pediments. The church carries several badly damaged wall inscriptions; one of them, on a stone slab above a window on the east wall, is reconstructed to bear the name of the certain bishop Zachary and is dated to the early Christian period. The remains of an ambulatory are visible on the ground level. In the northwest corner of the complex stands a 16th‚Äì17th-century two-storey bell-tower, measuring 5.45 √ó 5.35 m., with its fa√ßades faced with grey hewn stone slabs. The ground floor acts as a vaulted porch with three bearing arches; the top storey a pyramidal structure containing bells. Fa√ßades contain several now barely legible asomtavruli inscriptions. The base between openings is a round pillar adorned with a capital. Each of the four fa√ßades of the bell-tower terminates in a gable, the peak of which is topped with a sculpted head of a ram. The bell- tower is flanked on either side by a stone wall, which is a later addition. An episcopal palace stands in ruins outside the wall, to the southeast. Dated to the 9th‚Äì11th century, it is a two-storey building set in a rectangular plan, with the dimensions of 11.2 √ó 21 m., and built of rubble, ashlars, and brick. The ground floor contains large arched porch and a fireplace; the top one was lit with four arched openings, leading to a wooden balcony.

It was built as part of the N25 New Ross Bypass, and was officially opened on 29 January 2020 by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and opened to traffic on 30 January 2020, becoming Ireland's longest bridge. Name The bridge is controversially officially named after Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, the mother of former US President John F. Kennedy whose ancestors came from nearby Dunganstown. It is also popularly referred to as the Pink Rock Bridge or as the New Ross Bypass Bridge, and as the Barrow Crossing in technical materials related to its construction. Overview Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Bridge (night view) The main spans of the bridge are the longest concrete-only extradosed box-girder bridge spans in the world. The spans are equal in length to the main span of the N25 Suir Bridge in Waterford; and four metres shorter the main span of the Foyle Bridge in Northern Ireland, which is 21 metres shorter in total length. The two central main spans are supported by a central plane of stay cables passing through saddles located on three towers at the three central supports. The distinctive feature of the Bridge is the different height of the towers. The side towers have a height of 16.2m and have 8 passing cables and the central pier has a height of 27.0m and 18 passing cables. Construction method The side spans over dry land on both sides of the river Barrow were built using a scaffold and a wing form traveller. The main spans were built using the balanced cantilever method. At its maximum length from the central pier, the west span cantilevered 140m over the river.

The Whigs emerged in the 1830s in opposition to President Andrew Jackson, pulling together former members of the National Republican Party, the Anti-Masonic Party, and disaffected Democrats. The Whigs had some links to the defunct Federalist Party, but the Whig Party was not a direct successor to that party and many Whig leaders, including Clay, had previously aligned with the Democratic-Republican Party rather than the Federalist Party. In the 1836 presidential election, four different Whig candidates received electoral votes, but the party failed to defeat Jackson's chosen successor, Martin Van Buren. Whig nominee William Henry Harrison unseated Van Buren in the 1840 presidential election, but died just one month into his term. Harrison's successor, John Tyler, was expelled from the party in 1841 after clashing with Clay and other Whig Party leaders over economic policies such as the re- establishment of a national bank. Clay won his party's nomination in the 1844 presidential election but was defeated by Democrat James K. Polk, who subsequently presided over the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Whig nominee Zachary Taylor won the 1848 presidential election, but Taylor died in 1850 and was succeeded by Millard Fillmore. Fillmore, Clay, Daniel Webster, and Democrat Stephen A. Douglas led the passage of the Compromise of 1850, which helped to defuse sectional tensions in the aftermath of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Nonetheless, sectional divisions contributed to a decisive Whig defeat in the 1852 presidential election. The Whigs collapsed following the passage of the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act in 1854, with most Northern Whigs eventually joining the anti-slavery Republican Party and most Southern Whigs joining the nativist American Party and later the Constitutional Union Party.  Background  =End of the First Party System= John Quincy Adams, the 6th president, became a Whig congressman later in his career During the 1790s, the first major U.S. parties arose in the form of the Federalist Party, led by Alexander Hamilton, and the Democratic-Republican Party, led by Thomas Jefferson. Federalist strength declined after the 1800 presidential election and especially after the War of 1812, leaving the Democratic-Republicans as the sole major party. After 1815, the Democratic-Republicans became increasingly polarized. A nationalist wing, led by Henry Clay, favored policies such as the Second Bank of the United States, the implementation of a protective tariff. A second group, the Old Republicans, opposed these policies, instead favoring a strict interpretation of the United States Constitution and a weak federal government.Holt (1999), pp. 2‚Äì3 In the 1824 presidential election, the Democratic-Republican congressional nominating caucus nominated Secretary of the Treasury William H. Crawford for president, but Clay, Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, Secretary of War John C. Calhoun, and General Andrew Jackson all ignored the results of the caucus and sought the presidency.Holt (1999), pp. 5‚Äì6 Crawford favored state sovereignty and a strict constructionist view of the Constitution, while Calhoun (who ultimately dropped out of the race), Clay, and Adams all favored high tariffs and the national bank. While the other candidates based their candidacies on their long tenure as congressmen, ambassadors, or members of the Cabinet, Jackson's appeal rested on his military service, especially in the Battle of New Orleans. Jackson won a plurality of the popular and electoral vote in the 1824 election, but, with Clay's support, Adams was elected as president in a contingent election held in the House of Representatives.Holt (1999), pp. 6‚Äì7 =National Republicans= Henry Clay, a founder of the Whig Party who served as the 1844 Whig presidential nominee In the years following the 1824 election, the Democratic-Republican Party split into two groups. Supporters of President Adams and Clay joined with many former Federalists such as Daniel Webster to form a group informally known as the \\"Adams party\\". Meanwhile, supporters of Jackson, Calhoun, and Crawford joined together to oppose the Adams administration's nationalist agenda, becoming informally known as \\"Jackonians\\".Holt (1999), pp. 7‚Äì8 Outside of New England, many of the Adams administration's allies defined themselves more in their opposition to Jackson than in their support of Adams.. Due in part to the superior organization and unity of his fledgling party, Jackson defeated President Adams in the 1828 presidential election, taking 56 percent of the popular vote.Holt (1999), pp. 8‚Äì9 With the defeat of Adams, Clay emerged as the leader of the National Republican Party, a political party opposed to Jackson; followers of Jackson, meanwhile, organized into the Democratic Party.Holt (1999), pp. 10‚Äì11 Despite Jackson's decisive victory in the 1828 election, National Republicans initially believed that Jackson's party would collapse once Jackson took office. Vice President Calhoun split from the administration in 1831, but differences over the tariff prevented Calhoun's followers from joining the National Republicans. Other actions of the administration, including a policy of Indian removal, the Maysville Road veto, and acceptance of tariffs and some federally-funded infrastructure projects, solidified Jackson's popularity.Holt (1999), pp. 10‚Äì11 Meanwhile, the Anti-Masonic Party formed following the disappearance and possible murder of William Morgan in 1826. Clay rejected overtures from the Anti-Masonic Party, and his attempt to convince Calhoun to serve as his running mate failed, leaving the opposition to Jackson split among different leaders when the National Republicans nominated Clay for president. Hoping to make the national bank a key issue of the 1832 election, the National Republicans convinced national bank president Nicholas Biddle to request an extension of the national bank's charter, but their strategy backfired when Jackson successfully portrayed his veto of the recharter as a victory for the people against an elitist institution.Holt (1999), pp. 15‚Äì16 Jackson won another decisive victory in the 1832 presidential election, taking 55 percent of the national popular vote and 88 percent of the popular vote in the slave states south of Kentucky and Maryland.Holt (1999), pp. 17‚Äì18 Clay's defeat discredited the National Republican Party, encouraging those opposed to Jackson to seek to create a more effective opposition party.Holt (1999), pp. 18‚Äì19 Creation, 1833‚Äì1836 Daniel Webster, a leading Whig from New England Shortly after Jackson's re-election, South Carolina passed a measure to \\"nullify\\" the Tariff of 1832, beginning the Nullification Crisis. Jackson strongly denied the right of South Carolina to nullify federal law, but the crisis was resolved after Congress passed the Tariff of 1833.Holt (1999), p. 20 The Nullification Crisis briefly scrambled the partisan divisions that had emerged after 1824, as many within the Jacksonian coalition opposed President Jackson's threats of force against South Carolina, while some opposition leaders like Daniel Webster supported them. In South Carolina and other states, those opposed to Jackson began to form small \\"Whig\\" parties.Holt (1999), p. 20 The Whig label implicitly compared \\"King Andrew\\" to King George III, the King of Great Britain at the time of the American Revolution. Jackson's decision to remove government deposits from the national bank ended any possibility of a Webster-Jackson alliance and helped to solidify partisan lines. The removal of the deposits drew opposition from both pro-bank National Republicans and states' rights Southerners like Willie Person Mangum of North Carolina, the latter of whom accused Jackson of flouting the Constitution.Holt (1999), p. 24 In late 1833, Clay began to hold a series of dinners with opposition leaders in order to settle on a candidate to oppose Martin Van Buren, the likely Democratic nominee in the 1836 presidential election. While Jackson's opponents could not agree on a single presidential candidate, they coordinated in the Senate to oppose Jackson's initiatives.Holt (1999), p. 26 Historian Michael Holt writes that the \\"birth of the Whig Party\\" can be dated to Clay and his allies taking control of the Senate in December 1833.Holt (1999), pp. 26‚Äì27 The National Republicans, including Clay and Webster, formed the core of the Whig Party, but many Anti-Masons like William H. Seward of New York and Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania also joined. Several prominent Democrats defected to the Whigs, including Mangum, former Attorney General John Berrien, and John Tyler of Virginia. The Whig Party's first major action was to censure Jackson for the removal of the national bank deposits, thereby establishing opposition to Jackson's executive power as the organizing principle of the new party.Holt (1999), pp. 27‚Äì28 In doing so, the Whigs were able to shed the elitist image that had persistently hindered the National Republicans.Holt (1999), p. 30 Throughout 1834 and 1835, the Whigs successfully incorporated National Republican and Anti-Masonic state-level organizations and established new state party organizations in Southern states like North Carolina and Georgia.Holt (1999), pp. 34‚Äì35  Rise, 1836‚Äì1841  =Van Buren and the election of 1836= William Henry Harrison, a two-time presidential candidate who became the first Whig president in 1841 but died just one month into office Early successes in various states made many Whigs optimistic about victory in 1836, but an improving economy bolstered Van Buren's standing ahead of the election.Holt (1999), pp. 36‚Äì37 The Whigs also faced the difficulty of uniting former National Republicans, Anti-Masons, and states' rights Southerners around one candidate, and the party suffered an early blow when Calhoun announced that he would refuse to support any candidate opposed to the doctrine of nullification.Holt (1999), pp. 38‚Äì39 As party leaders were unable to organize a presidential nominating convention, legislative caucuses in the states instead nominated candidates, resulting in the nomination of multiple Whig candidates for president. The presence of multiple Whig presidential candidates in the 1836 election was a reflection of a divided party rather than the result of a concerted strategy by party leaders, though some Whigs did express hope that nominating multiple candidates would force a contingent election in the House of Representatives by denying Van Buren a majority of the electoral vote.Holt (1999), pp. 39‚Äì40 Northern Whigs cast aside both Clay and Webster in favor of General William Henry Harrison, a former senator who had led U.S. forces in the 1811 Battle of Tippecanoe. Though he had not previously been affiliated with the National Republicans, Harrison indicated that he shared the party's concerns over Jackson's executive power and favored federal investments in infrastructure. Though he was eclipsed by Harrison, Webster remained in the race, but only as the Whig candidate in his home state of Massachusetts.Holt (1999), pp. 40‚Äì42 Southern Whigs coalesced around Senator Hugh Lawson White, a long-time Jackson ally who opposed Van Buren's candidacy. Capitalizing on opposition to Van Buren and the growing prominence of the abolitionist movement, White and his followers helped establish and grow Whig party organizations throughout the South.Holt (1999), pp. 42‚Äì43 Ultimately, Van Buren won a majority of the electoral and popular vote in the 1836 election, though the Whigs improved on Clay's 1832 performance in the South and West. Harrison won Kentucky and several Northern states, White carried Tennessee and Georgia, Webster won his home state, and Willie Mangum won South Carolina's eleven electoral votes.Holt (1999), pp. 45‚Äì46 Shortly after Van Buren took office, an economic crisis known as the Panic of 1837 struck the nation.Holt (1999), p. 61 Land prices plummeted, industries laid off employees, and banks failed. According to historian Daniel Walker Howe, the economic crisis of the late 1830s and early 1840s was the most severe recession in U.S. history until the Great Depression. Van Buren's economic response centered on establishing the Independent Treasury system, essentially a series of vaults that would hold government deposits. As the debate over the Independent Treasury continued, William Cabell Rives and some other Democrats who favored a more activist government defected to the Whig Party, while Calhoun and his followers joined the Democratic Party.Holt (1999), pp. 67‚Äì68 The Whigs experienced a series of electoral successes in 1837 and 1838, sparking hopes that the party could win the upcoming 1840 presidential election.Holt (1999), pp. 64‚Äì65 Whig leaders agreed to hold the party's first national convention in December 1839 in order to select the Whig presidential nominee.Holt (1999), pp. 92‚Äì93 =Election of 1840= William Henry Harrison defeated Martin Van Buren in the 1840 presidential election, thereby becoming the first Whig president By early 1838, Clay had emerged as the front-runner due to his support in the South and his spirited opposition to Van Buren's Independent Treasury.Holt (1999), pp. 93‚Äì94 However, a recovering economy convinced other Whigs to support Harrison, who was generally seen as the Whig candidate best able to win over Democrats and new voters.Holt (1999), pp. 97‚Äì98 Another candidate emerged in the form of General Winfield Scott, who earned acclaim for avoiding tensions with Britain during the Rebellions of 1837‚Äì1838 in Canada.Holt (1999), p. 101 Clay led on the first ballot of the 1839 Whig National Convention, but, with the crucial support of Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania and Thurlow Weed of New York, Harrison won the Whig nomination on the fifth ballot.Holt (1999), pp. 102‚Äì103 For vice president, the Whigs nominated John Tyler, a former states' rights Democrat chosen to be on the ticket primarily because other Southern supporters of Clay refused to serve as Harrison's running mate.Holt (1999), p. 104 Log cabins and hard cider became the dominant symbols of the Whig campaign as the party sought to portray Harrison as a man of the people.Holt (1999), pp. 105‚Äì107 The Whigs also assailed Van Buren's handling of the economy and argued that traditional Whig policies such as the restoration of a national bank and the implementation of protective tariff rates would help to restore the economy.Holt (1999), pp. 107‚Äì108 Harrison himself avoided taking strong stances on issues like the national bank, but he pledged to serve only a single term, promised to defer to Congress on most matters of policy, and attacked Van Buren's alleged executive tyranny.Holt (1999), p. 110 With the economy still in a downturn, Harrison decisively defeated Van Buren, taking a wide majority of the electoral vote and just under 53 percent of the popular vote. Voter turnout jumped from 57.8 percent in 1836 to 80.2 percent in 1840, with Whigs capturing a decisive majority of these new voters. In concurrent elections, the Whigs took control of Congress.Holt (1999), pp. 112‚Äì113  Harrison and Tyler, 1841‚Äì1845  =Tyler administration= With the election of the first Whig presidential administration in the party's history, Clay and his allies prepared to pass ambitious domestic policies such as the restoration of the national bank, the distribution of federal land sales revenue to the states, a national bankruptcy law, and increased tariff rates.Holt (1999), p. 126 Harrison took office in 1841 and appointed Webster as Secretary of State; Clay chose to remain in the Senate, but Clay allies John J. Crittenden, Thomas Ewing, and John Bell all joined Harrison's Cabinet.Holt (1999), pp. 124‚Äì125 Harrison died just one month into his term, thereby elevating Vice President Tyler to the presidency.Holt (1999), pp. 127‚Äì128 Tyler supported some parts of the Whig legislative program, including the repeal of Van Buren's Independent Treasury systemMay, pp. 67‚Äì68 and the passage of the Preemption Act of 1841, which was the first law in U.S. history that allowed for voluntary bankruptcy.Howe, pp. 592‚Äì593. Despite those points of agreement, Tyler had never accepted much of the Whig economic program and he soon clashed with Clay and other congressional Whigs.Holt (1999), pp. 127‚Äì128 Following the repeal of the Independent Treasury, the Whigs turned their attention to the creation of a new national bank.Peterson, pp. 61, 67. Tyler vetoed Clay's national bank bill in August 1841, holding that the bill was unconstitutional.May, pp. 68‚Äì71 Congress passed a second bill based on an earlier proposal made by Treasury Secretary Ewing that was tailored to address Tyler's constitutional concerns, but Tyler vetoed that bill as well.Howe, pp. 591‚Äì592. In response, every Cabinet member but Webster resigned, and the Whig congressional caucus expelled Tyler from the party on September 13, 1841.Holt (1999), p. 137 Tyler quickly assembled a new Cabinet consisting of states' rights and anti-Clay Whigs, purged allies of Clay from federal positions, and began a campaign to win over various Whig leaders, including journalists Thurlow Weed and Horace Greeley.Holt (1999), pp. 137‚Äì139 Due to the ongoing economic troubles of the Panic of 1837, as well as the relatively low tariff rates set by the Tariff of 1833, the government faced a growing budget deficit.Howe, p. 593. Whigs in Congress, led by the House Ways and Means Chairman Millard Fillmore, passed in each house a bill restoring tariffs to the levels set by the Tariff of 1832. Tyler signed the Tariff of 1842 on August 30, 1842, but vetoed a separate bill to restore the policy of distributing federal land sales revenue to the states.Peterson, pp. 103‚Äì08. Shortly afterwards, the Whigs began impeachment proceedings against Tyler, but they ultimately declined to impeach him because they believed that his likely acquittal would devastate the party.Peterson, pp. 169‚Äì170. The Whigs lost numerous races in the 1842 mid-term elections, as the country continued to suffer from the effects of the Panic of 1837. The Whigs had promised \\"relief and reform,\\" and voters punished the party for the lack of change.May, pp. 78‚Äì79 According to historian Michael C. Holt, the failure of the Whigs to enact their policies after their sweeping victories in the 1840 elections permanently damaged the party's credibility and discouraged Whig voters from turning out for elections in the 1840s and 1850s.Holt (1999), pp. 154‚Äì155 Discontent with the Whig Party also helped fuel the rise of the Liberty Party, an abolitionist third party consisting largely of former Whigs.Holt (1999), p. 156 =Election of 1844= Whig nominee Henry Clay was defeated by Democrat James K. Polk in the 1844 presidential election Beginning in mid-1842, Tyler increasingly began to court Democrats, appointing them to his Cabinet and other positions.Holt (1999), p. 150 At the same time, many Whig state organizations repudiated the Tyler administration and endorsed Clay as the party's candidate in the 1844 presidential election.Holt (1999), p. 149 After Webster resigned from the Cabinet in May 1843 following the conclusion of the Webster‚ÄìAshburton Treaty, Tyler made the annexation of Texas his key priority. The annexation of Texas was widely viewed as a pro-slavery initiative as it would add another slave state to the union, and most leaders of both parties opposed opening the question of annexation in 1843 due to the fear of stoking the debate over slavery. Tyler was nonetheless determined to pursue annexation because he believed that the British conspired to abolish slavery in Texas and because he saw the issue as a means to reelection, either through the Democratic Party or through a new party.Holt (1999), pp. 169‚Äì170 In April 1844, Secretary of State John C. Calhoun reached a treaty with Texas providing for the annexation of that country.Holt (1999), pp. 170‚Äì171 Clay and Van Buren, the two front-runners for major party presidential nominations in the 1844 election, both announced their opposition to annexation, and the Senate blocked the annexation treaty.Holt (1999), pp. 171‚Äì172 To the surprise of Clay and other Whigs, the 1844 Democratic National Convention rejected Van Buren in favor of James K. Polk and established a platform calling for the acquisition of both Texas and Oregon Country.Holt (1999), pp. 172‚Äì173 A protege of Andrew Jackson, Polk had hoped to win the vice presidential nomination prior to the convention, but Democratic delegates instead made Polk the first \\"dark horse\\" presidential nominee in U.S. history.Howe, pp. 683‚Äì684. Having won the presidential nomination at the 1844 Whig National Convention unopposed, Clay and other Whigs were initially confident that they would defeat the divided Democrats and their relatively obscure candidate.Holt (1999), p. 173 However, Democratic leaders were able to convince all three of Van Buren, Calhoun, and Tyler to support Polk, bolstering the Democratic campaign.Holt (1999), pp. 174‚Äì175 Ultimately, Polk won the election, taking 49.5 of the popular vote and a majority of the electoral vote; the swing of just over one percent of the vote in New York would have given Clay the victory.Holt (1999), pp. 194‚Äì195 Southern voters responded to Polk's calls for annexation, while in the North, Democrats benefited from the growing anomisoty towards the Whig Party among Catholic and foreign-born voters.Holt (1999), pp. 200‚Äì203 Though Clay refrained from making nativist appeals during the campaign,Holt (1999), pp. 191‚Äì192 his running mate, Theodore Frelinghuysen, was publicly associated with nativist and anti-Catholic groups.Holt (1999), p. 188  Polk and the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, 1845‚Äì1849  =Polk administration= Zachary Taylor served in the Mexican-American War and later won the 1848 presidential election as the Whig nominee The United States settled the Texas-Mexico border and acquired portions of seven current states in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Portions of present-day Arizona and New Mexico were later acquired in the 1853 Gadsden Purchase. In the final weeks of Tyler's presidency, a small group of Southern Whigs joined with congressional Democrats to pass a joint resolution providing for the annexation of Texas. Texas subsequently became a state in 1845.Holt (1999), pp. 220‚Äì221 Following the annexation of Texas, Polk began preparations for a potential war with Mexico, which still regarded Texas as a part of its republic and contended that Texas's true southern border was the Nueces River rather than the Rio Grande River.Merry (2009), pp. 188‚Äì189 In April, a skirmish known as the Thornton Affair broke out on the northern side of the Rio Grande River, ending in the death or capture of dozens of American soldiers.Merry (2009), pp. 240-242 In a subsequent message to Congress asking for a declaration of war, Polk explained his decision to send Taylor to the Rio Grande, and argued that Mexico had invaded American territory by crossing the Rio Grande River.Merry (2009), pp. 244‚Äì245 Many Whigs argued that Polk had provoked war with Mexico by sending Taylor to the Rio Grande, but most Whigs feared that opposing the war would be politically unpopular, so only a minority of Whigs voted against the declaration of war.Holt (1999), p. 233 As the war continued, most Whigs continually praised the soldiers fighting the war and approved military appropriations bills, but at the same time attacked Polk's handling of the war as both incompetent and tyrannical.Holt (1999), pp. 248‚Äì249 Taylor won a series of battles against Mexican forces in Northern Mexico, but victories in that theater failed to convince the Mexican government to agree to the territorial concessions sought by Polk.Merry (2009), pp. 259‚Äì260, 311-313, 352‚Äì355 While the war in Mexico continued, Polk submitted a treaty providing for the partition of Oregon Country with Britain; the Senate ratified the Oregon Treaty in a 41‚Äì14 vote, with opposition coming from those who sought the full territory.Bergeron, p. 133 Polk also pushed through the restoration of the Independent Treasury System and a bill that reduced tariffs; opposition to the passage of these Democratic policies helped to reunify and reinvigorate the Whigs.Holt (1999), pp. 233‚Äì234 The Whigs won numerous congressional, gubernatorial, and state legislative seats in the 1846 elections, boosting the party's hopes of winning the presidency in 1848.Holt (1999), pp. 238, 243 In August 1846, Polk asked Congress to appropriate $2 million in hopes of using that money as a down payment for the purchase of California in a treaty with Mexico.Merry (2009), pp. 283-285 Polk's request ignited opposition to the war, as Polk had never before made public his desire to annex parts of Mexico, aside from lands claimed by Texas. Representative David Wilmot (D-Pennsylvania) offered an amendment known as the Wilmot Proviso, which would ban slavery in any newly acquired lands.Merry (2009), pp. 286-289 The Wilmot Proviso passed the House with the support of Northern Whigs and Northern Democrats, breaking the normal pattern of partisan division in congressional votes, but it was defeated in the Senate.McPherson, pp. 53-54 Nonetheless, clear divisions remained between the two parties on territorial acquisitions. Most Democrats joined Polk in seeking to acquire vast tracts of land from Mexico, but most Whigs opposed territorial growth, either because they wanted to prevent the spread of slavery or because they feared the debate over the status of slavery in the new territories would be divisive.Holt (1999), pp. 252‚Äì253 An army under General Winfield Scott captured Mexico City in September 1847, marking the end of major military operations in the war.Holt (1999), p. 255 In February 1848, Mexican and U.S. negotiators reached the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which provided for the cession of Alta California and New Mexico.Merry (2009), pp. 424‚Äì426 Despite Whig objections to the acquisition of Mexican territory, the treaty was ratified with the support of majorities of both Democrat and Whig senators. The Whigs voted for the treaty largely because ratification brought the war to an immediate end.Holt (1999), pp. 310‚Äì311 Differences over slavery prevented Congress from passing any legislation to organize territorial governments in the Mexican Cession, as Northerners sought to exclude it and Southerners sought to allow it in the newly-acquired territories.Bergeron, pp. 210‚Äì211 =Election of 1848= A political cartoon satirizing the candidacy of either Zachary Taylor or Winfield Scott in the 1848 presidential election With the economy improving during Polk's presidency, Whig leaders like John J. Crittenden of Kentucky began to look to General Taylor as a presidential candidates in the hopes that the party could run on Taylor's personal popularity rather than economic issues.Holt (1999), pp. 246‚Äì247, 269 Taylor and his allies carefully cultivated his reputation as a plain-spoken man who put the good of the country above partisan squabbling.Holt (1999), pp. 270‚Äì273 His candidacy faced significant resistance in the Whig Party due to his lack of public commitment to Whig policies and his association with the Mexican-American War.Holt (1999), pp. 258‚Äì260 In late 1847, Clay emerged as Taylor's main opponent for the Whig nomination, appealing especially to Northern Whigs with his opposition to the war and the acquisition of new territory.Holt (1999), pp. 277‚Äì280 The ratification of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo badly damaged Clay's candidacy in North, as Clay was unwilling to endorse the Wilmot Proviso but could no longer campaign on a platform opposed to territorial acquisition.Holt (1999), pp. 313‚Äì315 Many anti-Clay Northerners backed the candidacy of Winfield Scott, who had distinguished himself in the Mexican- American War and who, unlike Taylor, had a long association with the Whig Party.Holt (1999), pp. 317‚Äì318 Taylor won 85 of the 111 slave state delegates on the first presidential ballot of the 1848 Whig National Convention, while free state delegates spread their votes among Clay, Taylor, Scott, and Webster.Holt (1999), p. 323 Taylor clinched the nomination on the fourth ballot after several delegates from both sections switched their support from Clay to Taylor.Holt (1999), pp. 325‚Äì326 For vice president, the Whigs nominated Millard Fillmore of New York, a pro-Clay Northerner. Honoring his pledge to serve only one term, Polk declined to seek re-election in 1848,Merry (2009), pp. 376-377 and the Democrats nominated Senator Lewis Cass of Michigan. Cass drew support from some Northern and Southern Democrats with his doctrine of popular sovereignty, under which each territory would decide the legal status of slavery.McPherson, p. 58 Anti-slavery Northern Whigs disaffected with Taylor joined together with Democratic supporters of Martin Van Buren and some members of the Liberty Party to found the new Free Soil Party; the party nominated a ticket of Van Buren and Whig Charles Francis Adams Sr. and campaigned against the spread of slavery into the territories.Holt (1999), pp. 333‚Äì334, 339 The Whig campaign in the North received a boost when Taylor released a public letter in which he stated that he favored Whig principles and would defer to Congress after taking office, thereby reassuring some wavering Whigs.Holt (1999), p. 361 During the campaign, Northern Whig leaders touted traditional Whig policies like support for infrastructure spending and increased tariff rates,Holt (1999), p. 365 but Southern Whigs largely eschewed economic policy, instead emphasizing that Taylor's status as a slaveholder meant that he could be trusted on the issue of slavery more so than Cass.Holt (1999), pp. 356‚Äì357 Ultimately, Taylor won the election with a majority of the electoral vote and a plurality of the popular vote. Taylor improved on Clay's performance in the South and benefited from the defection of many Democrats to Van Buren in the North.Holt (1999), pp. 368‚Äì370  Taylor and Fillmore, 1849‚Äì1853  = Taylor administration = Upon taking office, Taylor and his allies attempted to transform the Whig Party into a new organization centered on Taylor and centrist positions on issues like slavery and the tariff.Holt (1999), pp. 414‚Äì415 In making Cabinet selections, Taylor selected individuals who were moderate on the issue of slavery and who had supported Taylor over Clay and other Whig leaders prior to the 1848 Whig convention.Holt (1999), pp. 412‚Äì413 With Crittenden unwilling to leave his position as governor of Kentucky, Taylor appointed Crittenden's ally, John M. Clayton of Delaware, to the key position of Secretary of State.Holt (1999), pp. 407‚Äì410 Reflecting the administration's desire to find a middle ground between traditional Whig and Democratic policies, Secretary of the Treasury William M. Meredith issued a report calling for an increase in tariff rates, but not to the levels seen under the Tariff of 1842. In part due do the federal deficits in the aftermath of the Mexican-American War, Meredith's report largely abandoned the traditional Whig policy of favoring federally-funded internal improvements.Holt (1999), pp. 445‚Äì448 Meredith's policies were not adopted, and, partly due to the strong economic growth of the late 1840s and late 1850s, traditional Whig economic stances would increasingly lose their salience after 1848.Holt (1999), pp. 685‚Äì686 When Taylor assumed office, the organization of state and territorial governments and the status of slavery in the Mexican Cession remained the major issue facing Congress.Holt (1999), pp. 389‚Äì390 To sidestep the issue of the Wilmot Proviso, the Taylor administration proposed that the lands of the Mexican Cession be admitted as states without first organizing territorial governments; thus, slavery in the area would be left to the discretion of state governments rather than the federal government.Holt (1999), pp. 437‚Äì438 Taylor's plan was complicated by several factors, including Democratic control of Congress, ongoing sectional tensions over the status of slavery, and Texas's claim to all land in the Mexican Cession east of the Rio Grande River.Holt (1999), pp. 474‚Äì475 In January 1850, Senator Clay introduced a separate proposal which included the admission of California as a free state, the cession by Texas of some of its northern and western territorial claims in return for debt relief, the establishment of New Mexico and Utah territories, a ban on the importation of slaves into the District of Columbia for sale, and a more stringent fugitive slave law. Clay's proposal won the backing of many Southern and Northern leaders, but Taylor opposed Clay's plan, since he favored granting California statehood immediately and denied the legitimacy of Texas's claims over New Mexico. = Fillmore and the Compromise of 1850 = Millard Fillmore, the last Whig president U.S. states and territories after the Compromise of 1850, which settled several issues in the aftermath of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War Taylor died in July 1850 and was succeeded by Vice President Fillmore. In contrast to John Tyler, Fillmore's legitimacy and authority as president was widely accepted by members of Congress and the public. Partly to indicate his independence from Taylor, Fillmore accepted the resignation of Taylor's entire Cabinet and set about building a new one.Holt (1999), pp. 524‚Äì525 The new president hoped to use the process of selecting the cabinet to re-unify the Whig Party, and he sought to balance the cabinet among North and South, pro-compromise and anti-compromise, and pro-Taylor and anti-Taylor.Holt (1999), pp. 525‚Äì526 Among those who joined Fillmore's Cabinet were Crittenden, Thomas Corwin of Ohio, and Webster, whose support for the Compromise had outraged his Massachusetts constituents. Webster emerged as both the most controversial and most important figure in Fillmore's Cabinet.Holt (1999), pp. 525‚Äì527 Meanwhile, with the apparent collapse of his proposed compromise, Clay took a temporary leave from the Senate, and Democratic Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois took the lead in advocating for a compromise based largely on Clay's proposals. In an August 1850 message, Fillmore urged Congress to settle the Texas‚ÄìNew Mexico boundary dispute as quickly as possible. With Fillmore's support, a Senate bill providing for a final settlement of Texas's borders won passage days after Fillmore delivered his message. Under the terms of the bill, the U.S. would assume Texas's debts, while Texas's northern border was set at the 36¬∞ 30' parallel north (the Missouri Compromise line) and much of its western border followed the 103rd meridian. The bill attracted the support of a bipartisan coalition of Whigs and Democrats from both sections, though most opposition to the bill came from the South. The Senate quickly moved onto the other major issues, passing bills that provided for the admission of California, the organization of New Mexico Territory, and the establishment of a new fugitive slave law. Passage of what became known as the Compromise of 1850 soon followed in the House of Representatives. Though the future of slavery in New Mexico, Utah, and other territories remained unclear, Fillmore himself described the Compromise of 1850 as a \\"final settlement\\" of sectional issues. Following the passage of the Compromise of 1850, Fillmore's enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 became the central issue of his administration. The Fugitive Slave Act created the first national system of law enforcement by appointing federal commissioner in every county to hear fugitive slave cases and enforce the fugitive slave law. Many in the North felt that the Fugitive Slave Act effectively brought slavery into their home states, and while the abolitionist movement remained weak, many Northerners increasingly came to detest slavery. The Whig Party became badly split between pro-Compromise Whigs like Fillmore and Webster and anti-Compromise Whigs like William Seward, who demanded the repeal of the Fugitive Slave Act.Holt (1999), pp. 552‚Äì553 In the Deep South, most Whigs joined with pro-Compromise Democrats to form a unionist party during the 1850 elections, decisively defeating their opponents and ending any threat of Southern secession in 1850.Holt (1999), pp. 607‚Äì608 Though Webster hoped to supplant the Whig Party with a new Union Party, the unionist movement did not spread outside the Deep South and had largely collapsed by 1852.Holt (1999), pp. 620‚Äì621, 677‚Äì678 = Election of 1852 = Winfield Scott, the unsuccessful Whig candidate in the 1852 presidential election Though Fillmore's enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act made him unpopular among many in the North, he retained considerable support from the South, where he was seen as the only candidate capable of uniting the party. Meanwhile, Secretary Webster had long coveted the presidency and, though in poor health, planned a final attempt to gain the White House. Fillmore was sympathetic to the ambitions of his longtime friend, but was reluctant to rule out accepting the party's 1852 nomination, as he feared doing so would allow Seward to gain control of the party. A third candidate emerged in the form of General Winfield Scott, who, like previously successful Whig presidential nominees William Henry Harrison and Zachary Taylor, had earned fame for his martial accomplishments. Scott had supported the Compromise of 1850, but his association with Senator William Seward of New York made him unacceptable to Southern Whigs. Thus, approaching the June 1852 Whig National Convention in Baltimore, the major candidates were Fillmore, Webster, and Scott. On the convention's first presidential ballot, Fillmore received 133 of the necessary 147 votes, while Scott won 131 and Webster won 29. Fillmore and Webster supporters sought to broker a deal to unite behind either candidate, but they were unsuccessful and balloting continued. On the 48th ballot, Webster delegates began to defect to Scott, and the general gained the nomination on the 53rd ballot. For vice president, the Whigs nominated Secretary of the Navy William Alexander Graham of North Carolina.Holt (1999), pp. 723‚Äì724 Democrat Franklin Pierce defeated Whig Winfield Scott in the 1852 election The 1852 Democratic National Convention nominated a dark horse candidate in the form of former New Hampshire senator Franklin Pierce, who had been out of national politics for nearly a decade before 1852. The nomination of Pierce, a Northerner sympathetic to the Southern view on slavery, united Democrats from both the North and South. As the Whig and Democratic national conventions had approved similar platforms, the 1852 election focused largely on the personalities of Scott and Pierce.Holt (1999), pp. 726‚Äì727 Though most Free Soil leaders favored Scott over Pierce, the party once again ran a presidential ticket in 1852, nominating Senator John P. Hale of New Hampshire for president. At the same time, some pro-Compromise Whigs and nativist groups ran Webster on an independent ticket. Both candidacies cut into Scott's base of support and signaled Whig discontent in the North.Holt (1999), pp. 740‚Äì742 The 1852 elections proved to be disastrous for the Whig Party, as Scott was defeated by a wide margin and the Whigs lost several congressional and state elections.Holt (1999), pp. 754‚Äì755 Scott won just four states and 44 percent of the popular vote, while Pierce won just under 51 percent of the popular vote and a large majority of the electoral vote. Scott amassed more votes than Taylor had in most Northern states, but Democrats benefited from a surge of new voters in the North and the collapse of Whig strength in much of the South.Holt (1999), pp. 756‚Äì760  Collapse, 1853‚Äì1856  =Pierce administration= Despite their decisive loss in the 1852 elections, most Whig leaders believed the party could recover during the Pierce presidency in much the same way that it had recovered under President Polk.Holt (1999), pp. 763‚Äì764 However, the strong economy still prevented the Whig economic program from regaining salience, and the party failed to develop an effective platform on which to campaign.Holt (1999), pp. 776‚Äì777 The debate over the 1854 Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act, which effectively repealed the Missouri Compromise by allowing slavery in territories north of the 36¬∞30‚Ä≤ parallel, shook up traditional partisan alignments.Holt (1999), pp. 804‚Äì805, 809‚Äì810 The party divided along sectional lines, as Southern Whigs supported the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act and Northern Whigs strongly opposed it.Holt (1999), pp. 817‚Äì818 Across the Northern states, the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act gave rise to anti-Nebraska coalitions consisting of Free Soilers, Whigs, and Democrats opposed to the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act. In Michigan and Wisconsin, these two coalitions labeled themselves as the Republican Party, but similar groups in other states initially took on different names.Holt (1999), pp. 841‚Äì842 Like their Free Soil predecessors, Republican leaders generally did not call for the abolition of slavery, but instead sought to prevent the extension of slavery into the territories.McPherson (1988), p. 129. Another political coalition appeared in the form of the nativist and anti-Catholic Know Nothing movement, which eventually organized itself into the American Party. Both the Republican Party and the Know Nothings portrayed themselves as the natural Whig heirs in the battle against Democratic executive tyranny, but the Republicans focused on the \\"Slave Power\\" and the Know Nothings focused on the supposed danger of mass immigration and a Catholic conspiracy. While the Republican Party almost exclusively appealed to Northerners, the Know Nothings gathered many adherents in both the North and South; some individuals joined both groups even while they remained part of the Whig Party or the Democratic Party.Holt (1999), pp. 843‚Äì846 Congressional Democrats suffered huge losses in the mid-term elections of 1854, as voters provided support to a wide array of new parties opposed to the Democratic Party.McPherson (1988), pp. 129‚Äì130. Though several successful congressional candidates had campaigned only as Whigs, most congressional candidates who were not affiliated with the Democratic Party had campaigned either independently of the Whig Party or in fusion with another party.Holt (1999), pp. 877‚Äì878 As cooperation between Northern and Southern Whigs appeared increasingly unlikely, leaders from both sections continued to abandon the party. While Seward and many other Northern leaders increasingly gravitated towards the Republican Party, Fillmore and his allies settled on a strategy of using the Know Nothings as a vehicle for Fillmore's pro-union candidacy in the 1856 election. A smaller group of Northern Whig leaders, including Edward Everett, rejected both new parties and continued to adhere to the Whig Party.Holt (1999), pp. 907‚Äì910 In the South, most Whigs abandoned their party for the Know Nothings, though some joined the Democratic Party instead.Holt (1999), pp. 925‚Äì926 =1856 election= Though he did not share the nativist views of the Know Nothings, in 1855 Fillmore became a member of the Know Nothing movement and encouraged his Whig followers to join as well.Holt (1999), pp. 911‚Äì913 Seeking to ensure the party would avoid the sectional tensions that had plagued the Whigs, the Know Nothings adopted a platform pledging not to repeal the Fugitive Slave Act or the Kansas-Nebraska Act.Holt (1999), pp. 929‚Äì931 In September 1855, Seward led his faction of Whigs into the Republican Party, effectively marking the end of the Whig Party as an independent and significant political force. Seward stated that the Whigs had been \\"a strong and vigorous party,\\" but also a party that was \\"moved by panics and fears to emulate the Democratic Party in its practiced subserviency\\" to the Slave Power.Holt (1999), pp. 947‚Äì949 Thus, the 1856 presidential election became a three-sided contest between Democrats, Know Nothings, and Republicans.Holt (1999), pp. 961‚Äì962 The Know Nothing National Convention nominated Fillmore for president, but disagreements over the party platform's stance on slavery caused many Northern Know Nothings to abandon the party.Holt (1999), pp. 963‚Äì965 Meanwhile, the 1856 Republican National Convention chose John C. Fr√©mont as the party's presidential candidate.Gara (1991), pp. 168‚Äì174. The defection of many Northern Know Nothings, combined with the caning of Charles Sumner and other events that stoked sectional tensions, bolstered Republicans throughout the North.Holt (1999), pp. 966‚Äì967 During his campaign, Fillmore minimized the issue of nativism, instead attempting to use his campaign as a platform for unionism and a revival of the Whig Party.Gara (1991), pp. 175‚Äì176. Seeking to rally support from Whigs who had yet to join another party, Fillmore and his allies organized the sparsely- attended 1856 Whig National Convention, which nominated Fillmore for president.Holt (1999), pp. 976‚Äì978 Ultimately, Democrat James Buchanan won the election with a majority of the electoral vote and 45 percent of the popular vote; Fr√©mont won most of the remaining electoral votes and took 33 percent of the popular vote, while Fillmore won 21.6 percent of the popular vote and just eight electoral votes. Fillmore largely retained Taylor and Scott voters in the South, but most former Whigs in the North voted for Fr√©mont rather than Fillmore.Holt (1999), pp. 978‚Äì980 Notes References =Works cited=      Category:Second Party System History United States Whig Party ","title":"History of the United States Whig Party"},{"id":"61441295","text":"Veronika Hubrtova is a Czech professional pool player.

She was kidnapped by the car's driver, 65-year-old mechanic Gheorghe DincƒÉ, who raped and beat her. While in captivity in DincƒÉ's house, Alexandra managed to call 112 three times, with a phone she found in the room. Alexandra's uncle, Alexandru CumpƒÉna»ôu, released a written copy of her calls on his Facebook account, to show \\"the rottenness of a murderous system and the courage of this incredible child\\". The first call happened at 11:05 a.m., 25 July. Alexandra identified herself to the operator, stated that she was kidnapped and is held in a house in Caracal. The operator asked if she was raped, and she told him she was. The operator told her they would need to know where exactly she is. During her second call, at 11:06 a.m., Alexandra clarified that she was kidnapped by car, she was blindfolded and locked in a room. She remembered passing a dam and guessed she might be in Bold, a district of Caracal. She did not remember the license plate but remembered that the car was grey. She stated she found the name of Lucian Gabriel Popescu on a business card in the house, but that she doesn't know whether or not that was the kidnapper's name. She also mentioned she is calling from the kidnapper's phone she also found in the room.

The third call took place at 11:12 a.m., Alexandra asked if a police car is on its way, and said she is afraid of the perpetrator coming back. Police took over the call again, and clarified that she is not sure the business card belongs to the perpetrator. During all three calls the operators and the police officers spoke to her in an ironic and condescending tone, while Alexandra was begging for their help and said several times that she was scared. The police succeeded to identify the house by 2 a.m. the next day (26 July); despite this the police forces, together with prosecutors Popescu Cristian Ovidiu, Vasilescu Liviu and ZƒÉvoianu CƒÉtƒÉlin Alexandru agreed upon the common decision to wait four hours before using the search warrant to enter the building, even though the law did not even require them to have one. The police arrested DincƒÉ, who confessed he murdered Alexandra, as well as 18-year-old Luiza Melencu, who disappeared in April.\\"Anger Over Romanian Teen‚Äôs Murder Prompts High-Level Resignation\\", Balkan Insight, 29 July 2019 An official statement from DIICOT, the agency investigating the case, announced that Alexandra‚Äôs DNA was identified in ‚Äúdental pieces‚Äù found in a barrel on DincƒÉ's property, however, this result was shown to be inconclusive. Some of the teeth found in the barrel exhibited dental work that Alexandra didn‚Äôt have , but the forensic specialists failed to make note of this, and examined the teeth as a whole using a destructive method that rendered individual analysis of each tooth impossible. Despite the uncertainties of the DNA result, on its basis, DIICOT issued a death certificate for Alexandra, which her family refused to recognize.  Allegations of corruption and human trafficking  The families of Alexandra MƒÉce»ôanu and Luiza Melencu do not believe the girls were murdered by Gheorghe DincƒÉ. Many suspect that DincƒÉ is lying to cover a human trafficking network, a widespread phenomenon in Romania, and that the prosecutors who worked on Alexandra's disappearance intentionally delayed the raid on DincƒÉ's property. Prosecutor Vasilescu Liviu, while working on the case of Luiza Melencu's disappearance, obtained footage of DincƒÉ's car shot by a surveillance camera, linking DincƒÉ to Luiza's disappearance well before Alexandra's kidnapping. Despite this, prosecutor Vasilescu never questioned DincƒÉ or searched his car or property. Furthermore, in the case of Alexandra's disappearance, prosecutor Vasilescu didn't share the footage of DincƒÉ's car with the other prosecutors until the morning of 27 July, and even then, he only showed them a still picture from the footage, where the license plate of DincƒÉ's car happened to not be visible. On 27 July, after the raid on DincƒÉ's property finally took place, prosecutor Popescu Cristian Ovidiu apparently argued that not only Alexandra had been murdered at 2 a.m. that morning, but also that the cause of her death was strangulation, despite the fact that there was no body found for him to even speculate about, and this was days before DincƒÉ's confession. Both Alexandra and Luiza's families received phone calls from men offering reassurances about the girls shortly after each disappearance. Alexandra's mother received a series of phone calls before and after her daughter's supposed murder, at least one of them believed to have been made by Gheorghe DincƒÉ, telling her that Alexandra is well, and that she had gotten married and ran away to work abroad. Before that, in April, Luiza's family received two similar phone calls, one believed to be from DincƒÉ, and another from an unknown man, suggesting DincƒÉ may have had accomplices. Gheorghe DincƒÉ's claim that he incinerated Alexandra has been called into question. For one, it is unclear why DincƒÉ would not have attempted to immediately dispose of the body if he knew Alexandra had called the police using his phone, instead choosing to slowly incinerate her body whole for approx. 8 hours. Also, incineration of a whole human or animal body is expected to produce a noticeably unpleasant smell and some amount of smoke, but DincƒÉ's neighbors gave wildly conflicting testimonies regarding whether they smelled anything unusual, and none of them saw any smoke coming from DincƒÉ's property, to confirm if a burning really took place. DIICOT has been criticized for investigating both Alexandra and Luiza's cases as murders, instead of kidnappings, and for refusing many of the requests made by the lawyers of the victims‚Äô families that were seemingly relevant to the case, such as performing a judicial experiment to ascertain if DincƒÉ could‚Äôve incinerated the bodies of the victims as described, or to question important witnesses and suspected accomplices to DincƒÉ‚Äôs sex trafficking and other criminal activities. Alexandra‚Äôs uncle, businessman and former talk-show host Alexandru CumpƒÉna»ôu, revealed that a week after his niece‚Äôs kidnapping, he obtained information about her whereabouts which required immediate action from the authorities and which he sent to several officials asking for help, most notably to president Klaus Iohannis, who infamously replied: ‚ÄúI will analyze.‚Äù Until currently, none of the officials in question have commented publicly about CumpƒÉna»ôu‚Äôs plea, and it‚Äôs unknown how, or if, they‚Äôve acted on the information.  Public reaction  The case met widespread outrage in Romania and the news of the murder and the events following it spread across Europe. On 27 July more than 2,500 people protested in Bucharest.\\"Bucharest Crowd Protests Over Slow Police Response In Kidnapping-Murder Of Teenage Girl\\", Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 27 July 2019 Newly appointed Interior Minister Nicolae Moga dismissed National Police Chief Ioan Buda, Olt County Prefect Petre Neac»ôu and Olt County Police Chief Cristian Voiculescu before resigning himself, only a week after taking office.\\"Romania‚Äôs newly appointed interior minister resigns after shocking murder of teenage girl\\", Romania Insider, 30 July 2019 Minister of Education Ecaterina Andronescu has been dismissed by the Prime Minister after remarking that \\"young girls should know better than to get in cars with strangers\\". The case also highlights the fact that insufficient public transport is a serious problem in the Romanian countryside, where hitchhiking plays an important role in transportation. Lucian Gabriel Popescu, the man first misidentified as the perpetrator, stated in a press release that he only met DincƒÉ once, while working in the local cadastre office; he does not know him. He asked the press not to contact him, as he and his family were strongly affected by the case.\\"PrecizƒÉrile bƒÉrbatului a cƒÉrui carte de vizitƒÉ a fost gƒÉsitƒÉ de Alexandra\\" (in Romanian), Digi 24, 31 July 2019 See also *List of kidnappings References Category:2010s missing person cases Category:2010s murders in Romania Category:2019 in Romania Category:2019 murders in Europe Category:July 2019 crimes Category:July 2019 events in Europe Category:Kidnapping in Romania Category:Missing person cases in Europe Category:Political scandals Category:Rape in the 2010s Category:Violence against women in Romania ","title":"Kidnapping of Alexandra MƒÉce»ôanu"},{"id":"61441352","text":"Huntley George Gordon Duff (5 July 1822 ‚Äì 26 May 1856) was a Scottish first- class cricketer.

Hans Memling, about 1470 (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.) Cura sanitatis Tiberii (\\"Tiberius restored to health\\") is a short legendary text which, like other supplements to the Gospel of Nicodemus, is grouped among the New Testament Apocrypha. According to the narrative, the Roman emperor Tiberius, gravely ill, sent Volusianus to Judea to search for Jesus, who was reported to be able to cure all sicknesses. Volusianus learned in Judea that the provincial governor Pontius Pilate had recently allowed the Jews to put Jesus to death. Despairing of success, Volusianus then heard that Veronica possessed a miraculous veil imprinted with the face of Jesus. This veil restored Tiberius to health. Accepting the truth of Christianity, Tiberius punished Pilate by banishing him to Ameria. Tiberius's third successor, Nero, learning more about Jesus from the apostle Peter, recalled Pilate to answer new questions. Having pieced together the full story, Nero confirmed Pilate's sentence of exile. Pilate then committed suicide.Z.

History Townley first appeared in the Pacific in March 1685 with 180 men aboard two captured Spanish ships, where he met up with a portion of William Knight's crew. Early the next year they joined forces with French corsairs under Francois Grogniet and Jean L‚ÄôEscuyer, who had recently joined with another English contingent under Charles Swan in Cygnet and Edward Davis in Batchelor's Delight. Together they raided Leon and Realejo before separating. Near Acapulco Swan and Townley attempted to capture a treasure galleon from Manila but found it too well protected and were forced to withdraw. After this unprofitable foray with Swan, Townley's force sailed back south alone and raided Granada alongside Grogniet's flotilla before the group again broke up. Having had little success under Grogniet, some of the French sailors elected to join Townley. That July they sacked Panama, taking fantastic treasure but losing much of it to a Spanish counterattack. Townley sent the heads of some hostages to Spanish leaders to force them into supplying the buccaneers with food, and threatened more hostage deaths if the Spanish failed to release some buccaneer prisoners. In August the Spanish launched a surprise assault on Townley's forces at sea but were badly defeated. Townley executed more prisoners and the Spanish paid a large ransom, but Townley, wounded in the previous engagement, soon died. After his body was cast overboard the buccaneers elected George D‚ÄôHout to be their new commander. See also *John Read (pirate) - elected Captain of Cygnet after a mutiny against Swan.

Early life McMorrow was born on September 19, 1926 to Philip and Theresa (Murphy) McMorrow. His father served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1939 to 1947. McMorrow grew up in Dorchester. He graduated from the Boston Latin School in 1943. From 1944 to 1946 he served in the United States Navy in the Pacific and China. He resumed his education after the War and graduated from Harvard College in 1948. He earned a Master of Arts degree from the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1950 and later received a Master of Education degree from Boston College. Outside of politics, McMorrow taught English at Boston Latin and Newman Preparatory School and was director of research and statistics for the Massachusetts Department of Education. In the latter role, McMorrow was responsible for the disbursement of $35 million in funds to schools throughout Massachusetts. Political career From 1953 to 1957, McMorrow represented Dorchester in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. In 1955, McMorrow ran for a seat on the Boston School Committee. He campaigned on a platform supporting the single-salary system for teachers and building new schools. He spent the final week of the campaign in the hospital with a viral infection. He finished third in an eight candidate race where the top five were elected. In 1957, McMorrow was unanimously elected chairman of the board. In the 1957 election, McMorrow topped the ticket in a contest that saw five supporters of the single-salary schedule elected to the board. McMorrow was a candidate in the 1959 Boston mayoral election. He finished fifth in the five candidate primary election with 9% of the vote. Following his defeat, McMorrow backed second-place finisher John F. Collins over Senate President John E. Powers in the general election. Powers had the backing of the majority of Boston's politicians, including 40 of the city's 44 state representatives and U.S. Senator John F. Kennedy. The other two unsuccessful candidates, Gabriel F. Piemonte and James W. Hennigan Jr., declined to endorse either candidate. During the campaign, McMorrow worked as a strategist and assistant for Collins and following his upset victory, was his chief aide during the transition period. He studied a number of reforms aimed at streamlining city government, specifically in the areas of urban renewal, public relations, assessing, recreation, and administration. Collins took trips to Philadelphia and Newark to further study these reforms. On December 18, 1959, Collins announced that McMorrow would serve as his deputy mayor (a position officially titled director of administrative services). In this role, McMorrow would \\"see that the policies enunciated by the administration are carried out\\", according to Collins. During his tenure as deputy mayor, McMorrow was known as \\"Mac the Knife\\" for his work in cutting the city budget. In 1961, McMorrow was appointed to the newly created position of director of administrative management for the Boston Redevelopment Authority. He held this position until his retirement. McMorrow died on November 23, 2008 at the Hebrew Rehabilitation Center in Boston.

Biography  He was born in 1964 in Valladolid. A young journalist writing for the El Norte de Castilla, the \\"Bachiller\\" (as Miguel √Ångel Rodr√≠guez was sometimes known for his lack of higher studies) met Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar (then bidding for the presidency of the Junta of Castile and Le√≥n) in the campaign bus before the 1987 Castilian-Leonese regional election. Following the election, Aznar, who was invested regional president, appointed Rodr√≠guez as Spokesperson of the Junta of Castile and Le√≥n; Rodr√≠guez served for the 1987‚Äì1989 spell during which Aznar presided the regional government. During his mandate as Spokesperson of the regional government in Castile and Le√≥n, he reportedly elaborated a blacklist of journalists, compiling political, personal and professional assessments on 12 journalists. He has been mentioned as a core member of the so-called \\"Clan of Valladolid\\", a circle of people around Aznar, that eventually got to lead the People's Party (PP) from G√©nova Street, holding top posts during the years of Aznar in La Moncloa as Prime Minister. He followed Aznar after the later was designated as successor of Manuel Fraga at the helm of the newly created PP, as was hired as the Aznar's director of communications in 1990. He ran 12th in the PP's list in Madrid for the 1996 Congressional election. Elected, he served as member of the Lower House for less than two months. Following the investiture of Aznar as Prime Minister, he renounced to his seat and was appointed to the dual post of Secretary of State for Communication and Spokesperson of the Government in the Aznar government. He left the Government in July 1998 citing \\"personal reasons\\", and was replaced as Spokesperson of the Government by Josep Piqu√©. He then started a career in the private sector in the fields of advertising and media. In April 2011 the Provincial Audience of Madrid sentenced Rodr√≠guez to pay a ‚Ç¨30,000 fine after Rodr√≠guez called Dr. Luis Montes a \\"nazi\\" and accused him of \\"killing people without their permission\\"; the sentence was ratified in November 2011. In 2019, PP's Isabel D√≠az Ayuso hired MAR as consultant vis-√†- vis the campaign for the 2019 Madrilenian regional election. In January 2020, months after the investiture of D√≠az Ayuso as regional president, she appointed Miguel √Ångel Rodr√≠guez as Chief of Staff, reportedly to the despair of her vice-president Ignacio Aguado, whom Miguel √Ångel Rodr√≠guez had previously dubbed as \\"the disloyal one\\".

His contemporaries were John of Rila and Prohor of Pƒçinja. Biography Gavrilo of Lesnovo was born in Osiƒçko Polje (Osiƒçi) in the 10th century. As the only child of rich parents, he received all the attention and was provided with the best education. When he grew up, he married a girl of the royal family who died soon after. He was a Balkan Slav, a friend of Prohor Pƒçinjski and Jovan Rilski (John of Rila). He struggled in the 10th century near Kratovo on Mount Lesnovska, where he built a temple to the Holy Archangel Michael and was its abbot, with numerous fraternities that soon came to him. He became known as a miracle worker both during his life and after his death. The current church located at the present-day monastery was built by Despot Jovan Oliver, a nobleman under the Emperor Du≈°an the Mighty. Saint Gavrilo died in the Lord toward the end of the tenth century. There are three biographies of the Venerable Gabriel. The first Life was written in 1330 by the monk Stanislav in the Lesnovo monastery. It is probably an abbreviated transcript of an earlier life. The other two biographies date from the 15th and 16th centuries and provide more details about Gabriel. They state that the Patriarch of Trnovo and the Bulgarian Tsar Jovan Shishman (1371-1391) transferred the relics of the Venerable Gavril Lesnovski to the Church of the Twelve Apostles, near the Church of John of Rila, where they are still located today. Saint Gabriel passed away at the end of the 10th century. The Serbian Orthodox Church celebrates it on January 15 according to the church calendar, and on 28 January according to the Gregorian calendar. His character is preserved on the frescoes in the monasteries of Lesnovo, the Patriarchate of Peƒá, Graƒçanica, Orahovica and Jurca near Bitola. It remains still unsolved whether Gavrilo founded a monastery or was it founded on the spot close to his hermitage. Very little is known of this original monastery since Gavrilo's relics were taken away and the first and only mention of the old monastery comes only from 1330 in a chronicle by monk Stanislav of Lesnovo, who mentions Gavrilo's funeral.

A 1960 film adaptation changed the African American character Mardou Fox, Kerouac's love interest, to a young French girl (played by Leslie Caron) to better fit both contemporary social and Hollywood palates. While it was derided and vehemently criticized by Allen Ginsberg, among others, for its two-dimensional characters, it illustrates the way the film industry attempted to exploit the emerging popularity of this culture as it grew in San Francisco and Greenwich Village, New York. A Greenwich Village beatnik bar setting had been used in Richard Quine's film Bell, Book and Candle (1958), but Ranald MacDougall's adaptation of Kerouac's novel, scripted by Robert Thom, was less successful. The Subterraneans was one of the final MGM films produced by Arthur Freed, and features a score by Andr√© Previn and brief appearances by jazz singer Carmen McRae singing \\"Coffee Time,\\" and saxophonists Gerry Mulligan, as a street priest, and Art Pepper. Comedian Arte Johnson plays the Gore Vidal character, here named Arial Lavalerra. Box office According to MGM records the film earned only $340,000 in the US and Canada and $425,000 elsewhere resulting in a loss of $1,311,000. Musical score and soundtrack The film score was composed, arranged and conducted by Andr√© Previn, with the motion picture also featuring Previn's jazz trio, and the soundtrack album was released on the MGM label in 1960.Callahan, M., Edwards, D., Eyries, P. & Preuss, P. MGM Album Discography, Part 6: E-3801 to E-4000 (1960-1962) accessed February 26, 2016 Allmusic's Jason Ankeny noted, \\"Andr√© Previn had the good sense to recruit cool jazz giants including Gerry Mulligan, Russ Freeman, and Dave Bailey to perform his Subterraneans score: jazz not only fueled Kerouac's work, but his prose sought to evoke the rhythms and energy of bebop. Indeed, this music comes far closer to accurately capturing Kerouac's writing than any of the film's dialogue. Previn also deserves credit for articulating the sadness of the original novel, deftly combining horns and strings to create a score that is dark and emotive\\". =Track listing= All compositions by Andr√© Previn except as indicated # \\"Why Are We Afraid\\" (Previn, Dory Langdon) - 1:57 # \\"Guido's Blackhawk\\" - 3:05 # \\"Two by Two\\" - 4:00 # \\"Bread and Wine\\" - 4:12 # \\"Coffee Time\\" (Harry Warren, Arthur Freed) - 2:43 # \\"A Rose and the End\\" - 3:24 # \\"Should I\\" (Nacio Herb Brown, Freed) - 2:28 # \\"Look Ma, No Clothes\\" - 1:32 # \\"Things are Looking Down\\" - 5:39 # \\"Analyst\\" - 4:19 # \\"Like Blue\\" - 1:58 # \\"Raising Caen\\" - 3:02 =Personnel= *Andr√© Previn - piano, arranger, conductor *Gerry Mulligan - baritone saxophone (tracks 1, 3, 4, 6 and 8-10) *Carmen McRae - vocals (track 5) *Art Farmer (tracks 4 & 9), Jack Sheldon (1, 3, 6, 8 & 10 and 12) - trumpet *Bob Enevoldsen - valve trombone (tracks 1, 3, 4, 6 and 9) *Art Pepper - alto saxophone (tracks 1, 3, 4, 6 & 8-10 and 12) *Bill Perkins - tenor saxophone (tracks 1, 3, 4, 6 and 9) *Russ Freeman - piano (tracks 4, 9 and 12) *Buddy Clark (tracks 4 & 9), Red Mitchell (tracks 1-3, 5-8, and 10-12) - bass *Dave Bailey (tracks 4 & 9), Shelly Manne (tracks 1-3, 5-8, and 10-12) - drums *Unidentified string section, clarinet and oboe (tracks 1, 3, 6, 8 and 10) See also * List of American films of 1960 References *1958.

Formed in 1853 to provide horsecar service between Boston and Roxbury, it quickly expanded to become the largest railway company in the region, with operations over more than ninety miles of track and an annual ridership of over forty-two million passengers per year.; . It ended operations in 1887 as a result of the consolidation plan which united nearly all Boston streetcar lines into the West End Street Railway.  Formation  The Metropolitan Railroad was an early pioneer in the effort to bring street railway service to Boston, replacing the older horse-drawn omnibus lines which had come to be viewed as expensive and unreliable. The company received its charter on May 21, 1853 by the Massachusetts General Court, by which it was enabled to build a rail line connecting downtown Boston with the then- independent town of Roxbury.; . John P. Ober, a former Boston alderman, served as first president of the new organization. Engraving of an open-air car of the Metropolitan in early 1857, at the corner of Boylston and Tremont streets Although the Metropolitan was one of the first railway companies to be established in the Boston area, defects in its charter and community opposition to its proposed lines significantly delayed the commencement of its operations. The company was unable to secure approval to lay tracks between Dover (now East Berkeley) and Boylston streets until late 1856, by which time a competing line, the Cambridge Railroad, had already begun providing railway service between Boston and Cambridge. Eventually, however, the company was able to complete a single track as far as Boylston Street, and on September 18, 1856 municipal authorities of Roxbury boarded a car and were taken for a ride along the line.; ; . The original route of the Metropolitan ran from Boylston Market, at the corner of Boylston and Washington streets, to Eliot Square in Roxbury via Washington Street.; . On October 3, the route was extended along Tremont Street as far north as Scollay Square (now Government Center), returning along Washington Street and Harrison Avenue, and on October 11 a double track was completed as far as the Tremont House near King's Chapel. The line, which offered service between the two municipalities at a speed of seven miles per hour, quickly proved to be a popular one, and in its first full year of operations almost four million passengers were carried on 116,560 trips.. According to , however, the passenger count for the first year was over eight million. By statute, fares for the line within the city of Boston were initially capped at five cents per trip.  Expansion  Over the next three decades, the Metropolitan Railroad received grants to lay its lines on dozens of additional locations in Boston and Roxbury, including in downtown and the West and South Ends;; at the same time, it undertook a strategy of acquiring or leasing the lines of several competing railways, enabling it to significantly expand its foothold in Boston and a number of surrounding towns in the process. Within a few years of its incorporation it had cemented its status as the largest street railway company in the city, ahead of the other principal railroads of the Union/Cambridge, South Boston, and Middlesex.; . For passenger numbers as of 1865, see . In 1858 the Metropolitan was authorized by the legislature to acquire the West Roxbury Railroad, which provided service between Roxbury and West Roxbury,; . The property and franchise of the company were conveyed to the Metropolitan on August 29, 1862. and in 1859 it received similar permission to purchase the franchise and property of the Brookline Railroad.; . In 1863 the company expanded into Dorchester with the absorption of the Dorchester Railway and Dorchester Expansion Railway, which collectively connected that town to Boston with lines along Dorchester Avenue and several other streets,; . For the routes of these companies, see and a year later Dorchester and Roxbury Railroad was also acquired.; . In 1864 the Metropolitan made a bid on the Suffolk Railroad, which operated in East Boston and held an East Boston-Downtown line running via ferryboats to Hanover Street in the North End and thence to Scollay Square. The company was successful in absorbing the rail lines of the Suffolk, but its attempts to secure the ferry lines were stymied by Boston city officials, and it was eventually directed to remove the tracks connecting to the ferry terminals in 1871.; ; . See also . In 1865 the Chlesea and East Boston Railroad, which connected East Boston and Chelsea via the Meridian Street Bridge, was absorbed by the Metropolitan,; ; ; and in 1868 the Brookline and Back Bay Street Railway, running from Brookline Village to Roxbury Crossing, was taken over.; . In 1878 the Boston and West Roxbury Railroad, which had already leased its line to the Metropolitan several years prior, was formally consolidated with the company. (under the name of Dedham and West Roxbury Railway); .  Middle years  Complaints that the Metropolitan was engaging in monopolistic behavior eventually led to calls for reform,; : . and in 1872 the Highland Street Railway was chartered with the avowed purpose of competing with the company for business around its original Boston and Roxbury lines. Over the next several years the two railway companies were major rivals, with Highland usage of Metropolitan tracks presenting a particular point of contention; at the same time, the Highland constructed a new line along Shawmut Avenue to compete with the Metropolitan and gradually expanded its presence in Roxbury, Dorchester, and the South End.; ; . In 1874 Calvin A. Richards was elected as president of the Metropolitan, having previously served for eight months as a member of the board of directors. Although a newcomer to the railway industry, his firm style of management quickly enabled the company to recover from what had previously been a poor period of performance, and the financial situation of the Metropolitan was significantly improved as a result. Over the next thirteen years he remained as president of the railway, making him its longest-serving executive by far.; . For the tenures of other presidents of the company, see .  Consolidation  Map of the lines of the Metropolitan (in green) and other horsecar companies operating in Boston in 1886 In the fall of 1886, two new street railway companies were formed, the West End Street Railway and the Suburban Street Railway. The original incorporators started as a land company, with the goal of connecting and expanding the Boston and Brookline portions of Beacon Street in order to enhance the value of the land that they held along that route. In order to further increase the marketability of the land, the two railways were formed to provide transportation to the area, and the West End Railway was granted the right to enter Boston through the avenue and the neighborhood of Back Bay.; ; . To the directors of the Metropolitan, the emergence of the West End was seen as a threat to their business, and in order to counter this new rival they decided to make an effort to expand their own operations. The company initially made an attempt to take over the South Boston Railroad, which at that time was already running more car miles on Metropolitan tracks than on its own, and when this failed it alternatively filed proposals to extend its own lines into the South Boston peninsula.; ; . Talks with the directors of the Cambridge Railroad were also initiated, and in February 1887 the two railways announced an agreement to unite into a new consolidated company, which would be among the largest in the country once completed.; ; . These actions by the Metropolitan quickly drew alarm from the managers of the West End, and in response the latter suddenly made a bid to acquire a controlling interest in all of the railway companies of Boston (excepting only the Lynn and Boston). Within a short time, majority positions in the Metropolitan and the other companies had been secured, and in June 1887 the state legislature passed a bill allowing the West End to consolidate with any other railway operating in Boston.; ; . Shortly after the passage of the West End Bill, the managers of the West End made an offer to the remaining shareholders of the Metropolitan for 1.25 shares of West End 8% preferred stock in exchange for each Metropolitan share held. The board of the Metropolitan, which by then had become an advocate for consolidation, recommended acceptance of the proposal, and President Richards decided to set a precedent by being the first individual to exchange his shares. In November 1887 consolidation was formally completed, with the West End absorbing the Metropolitan, together with the South Boston and Consolidated (successor to the Middlesex and Highland) railroads, on November 12, and absorption of the Cambridge following soon after on November 19.; ; ; ; ; .

MTD is a unifying diagnosis for a previously poorly categorized disease process. It allows for the diagnosis of dysphonia caused by many different etiologies and can be confirmed by history, physical exam, laryngoscopy and videostroboscopy, a technique that allows for the direct visualization of the larynx, vocal cords, and vocal cord motion. MTD has been known by other names including muscle misuse dysphonia, hyperfunctional dysphonia, and hyperkinetic dysphonia among others. MTD can be broken in two groups: primary and secondary. Primary MTD occurs _without_ an underlying organic cause while secondary MTD occur due to an underlying organic source. MTD is more commonly diagnosed in women, the middle aged, and individuals who have high levels of stress. It also more often seen in those who use their voice often such as singers and teachers.  Etiology  = Pathophysiology = The pathophysiology of MTD is multifactorial. Voice production requires the coordination of multiple muscles and other structures in the larynx. Multiple factors cause the muscles of the larynx to become tense. This changes the position of the larynx and affects the cartilaginous structures within the larynx leading to abnormal phonation. There is increased muscle activity in MTD due to personal temperament, increased vocal use, and underlying medical or physical causes.  Primary MTD  Primary MTD has no underlying medical or physical cause and no known psychogenic or neurologic cause. It is caused by increased tension of the laryngeal muscles secondary to personality traits such as anxiety or life factors such as increased stress. Individual with high vocal use like teachers, singers, and others professions with high vocal expectations can also develop MTD. Additionally incorrect use of the voice can cause increased tension and lead to MTD. Primary MTD makes up a significant proportion (as high as 40%) of patients seen for voice complaints.  Secondary MTD  Secondary MTD is caused by an underlying medical or physical reason. Vocal fold lesions such as a vocal fold nodule or other changes in the vocal fold mucosa can lead to increased tension in the larynx and cause dysphonia. Larynogopharyngeal reflux, a process that is similar to GERD, can bring stomach acid into the larynx. This can provoke the larynx to tense to prevent the aspiration of the acid. It also has been found that MTD can occur in postmenopausal women due to decreased hormone levels which lead to swelling of the laryngeal tissues and eventual atrophy. Older men can also develop MTD as their vocal cords thin as they age. Post infectious MTD is also possible. For example during an episode of laryngitis, the muscles of the larynx tense secondary to the inflammation and residual tension can remaining following the resolution of the illness.  Signs and Symptoms  The voice quality in MTD can be described as breathy and can also sound harsh. Patients may complain that their voice sounds abnormal as well as needing to strain to produce sound, and having increased dysphonia with increased vocalization.  Diagnosis  A multidisciplinary team including otolaryngologists and speech language pathologists is useful for the evaluation and diagnosis of MTD. It is important to consider other dysphonias in the differential diagnosis. = Physical Exam = Palpation is a key exam maneuver when evaluating MTD. Because of the increased muscle tension of the paralaryngeal and laryngeal muscles, the larynx will be elevated on palpation. To make the exam more objective, various scales have developed to help standardize the process. = Voice Quality = The voice in MTD has been described as hoarse and breathy. MTD can be distinguished for another similar dysphonia, adductor spasmodic dysphonia, by differences in voice characteristics. In MTD, all vocal tasks (vowels, singing, etc) are difficult for the patient while in adductor spasmodic dysphonia, some vocal tasks are difficult while others are unaffected. There are objective parameters that help characterize the degree of dysphonia such as the Dysphonia Severity Index. This index is made up of many measurements of the voice include voice frequency measurements (high and low), maximum phonation time (MPT), and jitter (frequency instability). = Vocal Fold Visualization = Videostroboscopy is the use of a camera to see the larynx and vocal cords. Stroboscopy allows the visualization of vocal cord movement, which vibrate too quickly for human eye to perceive. When assessing the vocal cords, the most common finding in MTD is a posterior glottic gap. Other findings include increased movement of the vocal folds towards one another, and changes in the angles of the vocal fold openings.  Other Diagnosis Modalities  Surface electromyography (sEMG) has been considered as a diagnosis tool for MTD. sEMG can measure the muscle units of the muscles of the larynx to deduce if there is increased activity which means they are more tense. The results of studies using sEMG in MTD is currently mixed. Some studies demonstrate increased EMG levels in MTD while others do not demonstrate a difference in EMG between individuals with MTD and individuals without MTD. Further research is needed before sEMG is regularly used in the diagnosis of MTD.  Treatment  = Medical Treatment = In secondary MTD, the underlying medical cause should be addressed. Residual infections should be treated. Laryngopharyngeal reflux is treated similarly to GERD with diet and lifestyle adjustments and consideration for a proton pump inhibitor. = Voice Therapy = Voice therapy is commonly used in the treatment of MTD. The goal of voice therapy is to encourage proper vocal used and decrease the tension of the laryngeal muscles. Examples of voice therapy include voice exercises to help increase glottic closure, vocal hygiene, manual laryngeal therapy, respiratory exercises, nasal exercises and frequency modulation amongst other techniques. = Surgery = Surgery may be used as a treatment when there is a vocal lesion such as nodule or polyp that is causing the MTD. There is little utility to surgery in primary MTD.

The motto of the council is: \\"To UPHOLD the Unity, Harmony and Understanding among Vajrayana Buddhist Organisations in Malaysia.\\" Background information In 1998, with the encouragement of the Malaysian Government, a Malaysian Buddhist Coordinating Committee (MBCC) was formed, consisting of several national Buddhist councils. At that time, there was no council representing the Vajrayana Buddhist organizations in Malaysia. Hence, a proposal to form a council representing Vajrayana Buddhist organizations was first mooted in 1998. At the same time, the number of Tibetan-based Buddhist organizations had increased and there was a need for a representation of the Vajrayana Buddhist Community in dealing with the Government and other Buddhist umbrella bodies. After several years of discussion, a pro-tem committee was formed in April 2000. After many rounds of discussions, the formation of the VBCM was finally proposed with more encompassing aims. The VBCM was included as a participating member of the MBCC from 2000. Eventually, the VBCM was also recognized and registered by the Malaysian Registrar of Societies (ROS) on 12 June 2002.

Early life  Charles Cowley was a native of England, born in Eastington, Gloucestershire on January 9, 1832. He was the son of Aaron Cowley and Hannah Price. He came to America with his family in 1842 and settled in Lowell, Massachusetts where his father worked in the textile industry. He was educated with a mix of public schools and private tutors. Cowley worked for the Lowell Daily Courier, a Whig newspaper, before he was twenty-one years old and was called the ‚Äúboy editor‚Äù due to his age. He left the paper in 1854 after an attack of typhoid fever and began to study law upon his recovery. While studying law under Josiah Abbott and Samuel Brown, he wrote his first history of Lowell, Massachusetts. The book was entitled A Hand Book of Business in Lowell, with a History of the City and was published in 1856. He was admitted to the Bar for the state of Massachusetts the same year.  Civil War  He began the Civil War as a captain with the Wamesit Rifles in 1861, a company organized May 17, 1861 in Lowell, Massachusetts. He left the Wamesit Rifles to join the Navy in 1864 as Paymaster of the USS Lehigh but resigned later that year to be Judge Advocate in the South Atlantic Squadron where he served on the USS Philadelphia as part of Admiral John A. Dahlgren‚Äôs staff until the end of the war.  Post Civil War  Cowley returned to Lowell and resumed his writing and legal careers. His 1856 history of his adopted hometown was revised and published in 1868 as A History of Lowell. His other books include: Famous Divorces of all Ages (1878), Our Divorce Courts (1879), Reminiscences of James C. Ayer and the Town of Ayer (1879), Leaves from a Lawyers Life Afloat and Ashore (1879) about his experiences in the Navy. He worked as a reformer both inside and outside of government to bring about change including the passage of an act incorporating the first trade union in 1870 and ten hour factory law in Massachusetts in 1874. He was member of the common council and overseer of the poor in 1875-1876. Norwich University bestowed the honorary degree of LL. D. on him in 1885. Cowley was involved with several organizations including the Knights of Pythias, Grand Army of the Republic and New England Historic Genealogical Society. He died on February 6, 1908 in Lowell without ever marrying.  Memorial Day Controversy  Cowley's book Leaves from a Lawyers Life Afloat and Ashore includes a reference to a promise he made to his friend James Redpath to speak at a cemetery dedication ceremony organized by Redpath on May 1, 1865. Cowley claims that this ceremony, which he failed to attend, was the origin of the Memorial Day holiday. In their 2014 book, The Genesis of the Memorial Day Holiday in America, Bellware and Gardiner identify Charles Cowley's book as an early source of the idea that the first Memorial Day occurred in Charleston, South Carolina in 1865. Although the idea has been republished and debunked several times in the past, David Blight reintroduced this claim in his book Race and Reunion in 2001. Like many before them, Bellware and Gardiner dispute the notion that this Charleston event is the origin of Memorial Day. They point out that what took place was a cemetery dedication, a one-time event. It was not meant to be repeated annually. It also occurred on the already established May Day holiday, and was therefore just part of floral celebration of that holiday and not a new one. This assessment agrees with that of Snopes.com who gives the story a Half-True as the event occurred but was not the origin of Memorial Day. Bellware and Gardiner credit Mary Ann Williams and the Ladies Memorial Association of Columbus, Georgia as the true originators of the holiday as abundant contemporaneous evidence from across the nation exists to substantiate the claim.

He achieved world fame with his panoramic maps that combined modern cartography with classical painting. His work includes maps of Olympic Games sites, of mountainous regions published in the National Geographic Magazine, and four panorama posters of national parks published by the U.S. National Park Service. Early life Berann was born into a family of sculptors and painters in Innsbruck, in the Austrian Tyrol. Between 1930 and 1933, he studied painting at the Federal School of Art and Design in Innsbruck, but was unable to survive solely as a painter during the Great Depression. After graduating, he worked as a freelance artist and graphic designer. In 1934 he won a competition to produce a panoramic map of Grossglockner High Alpine Road, a newly opened mountain road, which led to commissions to paint landscapes for cartographic or tourism purposes. He married Ludmilla Herold in 1941. The couple had two daughters, Elisabeth and Angela. His military service in the German army, which sent him to Norway and northern Finland in 1942, also contributed to his artistic style. Painting career He painted over a hundred maps, including works produced for the Olympic Games in Cortina d'Ampezzo for the 1956 Winter Olympics, Rome for the 1960 Summer Olympics, Innsbruck in 1964 Winter Olympics and 1976 Winter Olympics, Sarajevo for the 1984 Winter Olympics, and Nagano for the 1998 Winter Olympics. He also produces ski trail maps for European winter sports resorts, particularly in Austria, Switzerland, Germany and France. In 1962 he painted Mount Everest for the National Geographic Society. He eventually painted about 20 maps for the National Geographic including Mont Blanc (September 1965), five maps of the Leeward Islands (October 1966), Sky World of the Himalayas (October 1966), a map of the Pacific Ocean floor (October 1969), The Delta Project in the Netherlands (April 1968), Nepal (November 1971), and A Traveller's Map of the Alps (April 1985). In 1977, he painted the topographic map of ocean floors by Marie Tharp and Bruce C. Heezen continuing work he started at National Geographic. Near the end of his career he painted four panoramas for the U.S. National Park Service of North Cascades National Park (1987), Yosemite National Park (1989), Yellowstone National Park (1991), and finally Denali National Park and Preserve (1994).

Style He combined traditional and modern techniques to develop a style of \\"mountainscape painting\\" and the \\"modern panoramic map\\" that made him famous. \\"There's just something absolutely magical about his panoramas,\\" according to Tom Patterson, a senior cartographer for the U.S. National Park Service. Berann used creative distortion in his work. For example his painting of Denali vertically exaggerated the heights by a factor of two, with additional exaggeration for the peak at the center of the painting. In his painting of Yellowstone National Park the size of the Old Faithful geyser and the park lodge were also exaggerated. Other distortions in his paintings include a visual opening up of the tightly packed canyons of North Cascades National Park. His use of clouds on the horizon sometimes creates a vanishing-point effect or balances other objects on the horizon. He also emphasized lakes and other bodies of water, showing reflections of the mountains or glints of sunlight to attract the viewer's eye. Colors in his paintings are extremely vivid when viewed up close, but when viewed from a normal distance mix into more natural hues. His work was often painstaking. For example on his 1966 panorama of the Himalayas for National Geographic he observed the mountains extensively including flying around Mount Everest in a chartered plane. Mountain climbers gathered over 100 photos for his use. Berann then spent 600 hours to paint the mountainscape.

Building one (usually in the diagonal-side-cut style) is a popular DIY project. (PDF with plans It is sometimes claimed that these chairs were designed by Benjamin Franklin. Franklin himself preferred to sit in a step chair he designed for his own library. This chair folded in a slightly different way from the common diagonal-side-cut step chair; the seat flips up, resting against the reclined back of the chair, and forming three steps; one formerly hidden under and parallel to the seat, and two attached vertically along the seat's front edge and midline. A variant form has a third position, in which the back of the chair becomes an ironing-board. This design was common in the 1700s, but was revived in the 1990s. It has been described as suitable for small apartments. Its design is sometimes attributed to Thomas Jefferson, and thus called a Jefferson chair.

The Coalition comprises over 300 hundred member schools across 20 countries and five continents worldwide.  History  In 1989, a small group of boys' schools headmasters, including Eric Anderson from Eton College, Richard Hawley from University School, J. Douglas Blakey from Upper Canada College, John Bednall from The Hutchins School, and a few other headmasters and admission officers from boys' schools in the United States, met to discuss contemporary issues facing their institutions. Although the headmasters present were present to focus on philosophical and pedagogical topics related to boys' education, some of the admissions officers raised concerns regarding the continued existence of boys' schools subsequent to a period of many boys' schools having become co-educational. Later, as a result of the first informal meeting, a formal conference was held in June 1993 just outside of Boston on the campus of the Belmont Hill School to continue the discussion. Attendees decided to form an organization, and in 1995, \\"Boys‚Äô Schools: An International Coalition,\\" was formed as a non-profit organization. Richard Hawley was appointed as the first President. During the initial ten years, the organization was managed by an Executive Secretary working part- time and a Board of Trustees. In 2001, an Executive Director was hired to work full-time and an autonomous office was established in La Jolla for the organization. In 2004, the organization's name was changed to its current form, the number of trustees on the board was increased from 12 to 27, trustee term limits were adopted, and new steps for the identification, nomination, and admission of future trustees were implemented to foster global participation in the IBSC. Beginning in 2009, regional Vice-Presidents representing continents were appointed.  Annual conferences  IBSC conferences have been held annually since 1995 and are hosted by different member schools around the globe each year. The first was at University School in the United States. Additionally, regional conferences may also be hosted. = Research = IBSC forums have shared research regarding the impact of single-sex schooling on subsequent student performance. Previous findings regarding teaching practices have demonstrated that boys respond differently to certain pedagogical differences that girls may not respond to. Another IBSC study of 18 boys' schools in six countries found that when boys were asked to comment on specific lessons that were best for them, they were unable to without also describing and appreciating the teacher as well. = IBSC Student Forum = Beginning in 2013, member schools brought student delegates to represent their institutions at annual conferences. Boys selected as delegates first engaged in service projects near their school locally to develop their capacities for ethical leadership through service and worked together virtually, before meeting in person for the conference and become exposed to global issues while engaging in collaborative projects.

He created paintings and prints, within the Arts and Crafts movement of still life and landscapes, as well as creating decorative work with his wife Salome Lavinia Johonnot (n√©e Hopper, 1883‚Äì1962). Together with Salome, they traveled to give educational lectures on the arts and created two private art schools, the Ralph Johonnot Studio in Richmond, California and Johonnot Summer School of Design and Hand Work in Pacific Grove, California. He was active in the arts throughout the state of California from approximately 1912‚Äì1940.  Biography  Johonnot was born 28 July 1880 in Syracuse, New York to Mary Helm and Charles Johonnot. He was the middle child with two siblings, an older brother Earnest and a younger brother Carl. Johonnot attended Pratt Institute, he was a pupil of Arthur Wesley Dow. In 1906‚Äì1907, Ralph and his brother Carl traveled to England and France to study painting. From 1909 until 1912, Johonnot taught classes in applied arts and decorative arts at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York and was eventually promoted to the head of the Design Department. By 1913, Johonnot and his wife moved to the San Francisco Bay Area and the same year he began lecturing at San Francisco Art Association (SFAA). Some of Johonnot's early students were artist Rudolph Schaeffer and William S. Rice.

It is located at the village of Dzirijumati, in the Supsa valley, 14 kilometers from the city of Ozurgeti. It currently belongs to the diocese of Shemokmedi.  History  Jumati monastery bell tower The monastery consists of a church dedicated to the Archangels Michael and Gabriel, a bell tower, a wall, and other monastic buildings. Its period of construction is unknown. Georgian scientist Dimitri Bakradse believes that the monastery was founded and built before the Shemokmedi monastery. The fresco painting dates from the XVI-XVIII centuries. In 1847, the church was renovated and in 1904, the bell tower was built. It has a square layout, six windows and was built in stone. It is partially destroyed. Jumati monastery was not only a religious center, but also an important cultural center of the Guria region. It was known for several relics preserved there, such as particularly valuable icons and historical documents. These relics and documents often had a secular meaning. By 1924, almost none of the relics were in Jumati. Particularly important was a golden icon of Saint George, from the 11th-12th century and which was lost in 1921 during a robbery. There are only two fragments preserved in the Hermitage Museum currently.

As a student of Jean-Victor Bertin, he became a popular landscape painter. He held his first exhibit at the Salon in 1819 and participated every few years until 1839; receiving a medal in 1827. He also practiced engraving and was one of the first members of the . He was decorated with the Legion of Honor in 1835, the year that his painting \\"Farm Donkeys\\" was acquired by the State. He died in 1851 as the result of an accident stemming from the Coup d'√©tat. While opening his window, he was struck in the wrist by a stray bullet and the wound became infected with tetanus. The contents of his studio and his art collection were sold at auction and dispersed in 1852.

The incident got its name from the bloodied, zombie-like appearance of the Russian combatants after they were bombarded with a mixture of poison gasses, chlorine and bromine, by the Germans. Battle The Germans launched a full frontal offensive on Osowiec Fortress at the beginning of July; the attack included 14 battalions of infantry, one battalion of sappers, 24‚Äì30 heavy siege guns, and 30 batteries of artillery equipped with poison gasses led by Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg. Russian defenses were manned by 500 soldiers of the 226th Infantry Regiment Zemlyansky, and 400 militia. The Germans waited until 4 a.m. on 6 August for favorable wind conditions, when the attack opened with regular artillery bombardment combined with chlorine gas. \\"The gas caused the grass to turn black and leaves to turn yellow, and the dead birds, frogs and other animals and insects were lying everywhere. Terrain looked like Hell.\\"Regarding the gas attack of the 6 August 1915, historians' accounts conflict in some details. Chlorine gas was used according to some authors (Kauffman & Kauffman, 2016 ; Buttar, 2017), whereas a mixture of chlorine and bromine was used according to other authors (Cherkasov et al., 2011 ; Khmelkov, 1939). The gas was contained in artillery shells according to one source (Kauffman & Kauffman, 2016), whereas the gas was contained in cylinders according to other sources (Buttar, 2017; Cherkasov et al., 2011; Khmelkov, 1939). The Russians either had no gas masks, or had poorly made ones, and most soldiers used their undershirts as masks, with many soaking them in water or urine. Sub-Lieutenant Vladimir Kotlinsky, the highest ranking Russian soldier to survive the initial attack, rallied the other surviving soldiers, and they elected to charge the advancing German lines. Over twelve battalions of the 11th Landwehr Division, making up more than 7000 men, advanced after the bombardment expecting little resistance. They were met at the first defense line by a counter-charge made up of the surviving soldiers of the 13th Company of the 226th Infantry Regiment. The Germans became panicked by the appearance of the Russians, who were coughing up blood and bits of their own lungs, as the hydrochloric acid formed by the mix of the chlorine gas and the moisture in their lungs had begun to dissolve their flesh. The Germans retreated, running so fast they got caught up in their own c-wire traps. The five remaining Russian guns subsequently opened fire on the fleeing Germans.Kauffman & Kauffman, 2016, pp. 112‚Äì113Kauffman & Kauffman, 2016, p. 225 Available at: European Researcher (Sochi, Russian Federation) Kotlinsky died later that evening. The Russians did not hold the area for much longer. The Germans threatened to encircle the fortress with the capture of Kaunas and Novogeorgievsk. The Russians demolished much of the fortress and withdrew on August 18th.

The original climate spiral was published on 9 May 2016 by British climate scientist Ed Hawkins to portray global average temperature anomaly (change) since 1850. The visualization graphic has since been expanded to represent other time-varying quantities such as atmospheric CO2 concentration, carbon budget, and arctic sea ice volume. Background Before climate spirals: A non-animated, non-spiral line chart (April 2016) depicts the same data as the first climate spiral graphic that was published the following month. (Horizontal axis shows months; changing line colours denote the passing years.) Brad Plumer wrote in Vox that the graph \\"makes clear how staggeringly, anomalously warm 2015 and 2016\\" had been, a phenomenon reflected in the spiral graphic where it \\"appears to burst outward toward the end of the animation\\". Hawkins credited a \\"Friday afternoon\\" email from Norwegian climatologist Jan Fuglestvedt for the idea of converting a conventional coloured line chart into a spiral, and thanked Fuglestvedt's wife, Taran F√¶hn, for having suggested it to Fuglestvedt. F√¶hn, a researcher for Statistics Norway and the Oslo Centre for Research on Environmentally Friendly Energy, had suggested that connecting December to the following January would show temperature evolution in a more dynamic way. Ensuing email discussions refined the design of the climate spiral, which Hawkins published on Monday 9 May 2016. Dissemination Expecting \\"only some vague interest\\", Hawkins later wrote that his tweet of the new graphic had been viewed 3.4 million times in its first year. The tweeted graphic is widely described as having gone viral. Within a day, Climate Central writer Andrea Thompson remarked in The Guardian that the \\"metaphoric spiral\\" of the planet spiraling toward catastrophic consequences \\"has become a literal one\\". Initially, Hawkins posited that the graphic resonated because it \\"doesn‚Äôt require any complex interpretation\\". In a 2019 paper, Hawkins et al. further surmised that the design and communication aspects of the graphic resonated with viewers for a variety of reasons, including: * its selection to graph temperature (a quantity that the public feels is relevant and understandable), * its production by scientists (who tend to be viewed as \\"trusted messengers\\"), * its being intuitive and eye- catching (not a \\"boring\\" scientific graph), * its similarity to a clock (which is normally regular and predictable but which provides a \\"visual surprise\\" at the end, portraying the \\"fortuitous\\" large temperature increases encountered very recently), * its animated nature (not a static graph), and * its short duration (holding viewers' attention). The paper further noted that sharing the graphic on social media allowed it to be \\"consumed within the social media bubble rather than requiring a journey to another website\\", allowing it to be \\"subsequently amplified by journalists, the media, and highly popular accounts\\". Content Climate spirals use changing distance from a center point to represent change of a dependent variable (archetypically, global average temperature). The independent variable, time, is broken down into months (represented by constantly changing rotational angle about the center point) and years (line colour that evolves as years pass). Hawkins explained that in his implementation, colours represent time: purple for early years, through blue, green to yellow for most recent years. He made the graphics in MATLAB and used the \\"viridis\\" colour scale, conscious of choosing a colour scale that makes the graphics legible to colour blind viewers. As the graphic includes red concentric circles denoting temperature changes of 1.5¬∞C and 2.0¬∞C, Hawkins explained that \\"the relationship between current global temperatures and the internationally discussed target limits is also clear without much complex interpretation needed\\". Ria Misra wrote in Gizmodo that the graphic \\"lets the noise of tiny variations fade into the background while still showcasing, very simply, the undeniable trend\\". Describing how global warming \\"appears to burst outward toward the end of the animation\\", Hawkins described how sulfate aerosols no longer counteracted the warming effect greenhouse gases after the 1970s, and noted how strong El Ni√±o events in 1998 and 2016 lead to higher temperature plateaus more recently. The first climate spiral portrayed data from HadCRUT4.4 from January 1850 ‚Äì March 2016, graphing relative to the 1850-1900 mean temperature, the same pre-industrial global average used in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report. Applications and influence Three days after the first climate spiral was published, it was the subject of an article on the U.S Department of State's ShareAmerica website, noting the \\"compelling\\" graphic \\"shows just how fast\\" \\"world temperatures are spiraling upward\\". A climate spiral was featured in the opening ceremony of the August 2016 Summer Olympics. The design was on the shortlist for the Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2016. In January 2017, \\"Spiraling Global Temperatures\\" was nominated for the Shorty Awards GIF of the Year. In January 2017, the spiral was tweeted by Bernie Sanders and the U.S. National Park Service, both conveying how almost all recorded warmest years have been recent years. =Extensions of the climate spiral concept= In May 2016 United States Geological Survey scientist Jay Alder extended Hawkins' historical spiral to the year 2100, creating a predictive spiral graphic showing a possible future trajectory of global warming given the then- current carbon emission trend. Hawkins extended his two-dimensional spiral design to a three-dimensional version in which the graphic appears as an expanding cone-shaped structure. Hawkins' original climate spiral application (global average temperature change) has been expanded to represent other time- varying quantities such as atmospheric CO2 concentration, carbon budget, and arctic sea ice volume. Critical response The day of the climate spiral's first publication (9 May 2016), Brad Plumer wrote in Vox that the \\"mesmerizing\\" GIF was \\"one of the clearest visualizations of global warming\\" he had ever seen. The following day (10 May), Jason Samenow wrote in The Washington Post that the spiral graph was \\"the most compelling global warming visualization ever made\\", and, likewise, former Climate Central senior science writer Andrew Freedman wrote in Mashable that it was \\"the most compelling climate change visualization we‚Äôve ever seen\\". Michael E. Mann, creator of the Hockey stick graph, said that the spiral graphic was \\"an interesting and worthwhile approach to representing the data graphically\\", and PRI's Timothy McGrath wrote that the spiral was \\"a simple, elegant illustration of a dark history and a potentially terrifying future\\". In BusinessGreen, environmental journalist James Murray praised the graphic's \\"elegant simplicity\\", asserting that \\"the mistakes, misinterpretations, and misinformation contained in so many climate sceptic arguments are steamrollered by the straightforward force of this spiral\\". On 11 May, Chris Mooney wrote in The Washington Post that, with his \\"startling animation\\" Hawkins had \\"hit a grand slam‚Äîand not through some clever turn of phrase or some new metaphor or framing, but rather, through viral data visualization\\". Sarah Rense, first writing in Esquire that \\"climate science is unpalatable\\" and \\"depressing data\\", characterized the new graphic as being \\"as mesmerizing as it is depressing\\", \\"a cool GIF with pretty colours (to which) people will pay attention\\". In late May 2016, Brian Kahn, communications coordinator at the International Research Institute for Climate and Society, wrote that the spiral was a \\"revolutionary new way to look at global temperatures\\" and posited that the graphic's popularity \\"can be attributed in part to its hypnotic nature and the visceral way it shows the present predicament of climate change\\". In July 2016, freelance journalist Chelsea Harvey wrote in The Washington Post that, \\"at a time when climate science communication efforts are often viewed as dense or difficult for general audiences to understand, these types of striking graphics may help climate scientists connect with the public in a way that is both clear and attention-grabbing\\". Two years later, in May 2018 Jason Samenow commented that, though many Hawkins visualizations had \\"resonated among science communicators\\", climate spirals were the scientist's best-known visualizations. After his 2016 development of the climate spiral, Hawkins received the Royal Meteorological Society‚Äôs 2017 Climate Science Communication Prize. After developing the warming stripes graphic in May 2018, Hawkins, a lead author for the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, received the Royal Society's 2018 Kavli Medal \\"for significant contributions to understanding and quantifying natural climate variability and long-term climate change, and for actively communicating climate science and its various implications with broad audiences\\". In a 2019 paper, Hawkins et al. acknowledged that a \\"possible scientific criticism\\" of the design was that uncertainty in the temperature data is not visualized. Also, viewers might interpret the area of the 1.5¬∞C and 2.0¬∞C circles as representing the temperature change rather than the radius of the graphed line itself, though noting the temperature limit circles are clearly labeled. In May 2017 Hawkins responded to a criticism that the human eye might incorrectly interpret the change in area within the spiral rather than the change in radius by noting that the radii are clearly labeled. Informally, climate spirals have been referred to as spirographs.

It was just over long.  History  = Opening = The tramway was originally called the Ty'n y Berth Tramway as it was intended to connect to an incline down from the Ty'n y Berth Quarry to the north of Corris Uchaf. This quarry closed before the tramway was built, so the line was terminated in the village and never reached the quarry it was named for. From the early days of operation, it was called the Upper Corris Tramway, after the English name for Corris Uchaf. The tramway opened in 1859, at the same time as the main Corris Railway. The Upper Corris Tramway around 1885 running below the road to Corris Uchaf. The tips of Gaewern are on the left, and Abercwmeiddaw on the right = Before the First World War = In 1909, part of the tramway was re-sleepered. This was the first track maintenance on the tramway for more than 25 years. = Closure = Slate traffic along the tramway fell steeply between 1924 and 1926. In 1926, the Corris Railway raised its prices for carrying the slate traffic to compensate, and Braichgoch responded by buying a steam road wagon and using that to transport its output to Machynlleth. With the other quarries along the tramway also shut down, the Corris closed the tramway in July 1927.  Proposed extensions  Several plans were made to extend the tramway beyond Corris Uchaf. The first of these, proposed in 1862, would have taken the line above the east end of Tal-y-llyn Lake and over Bwlch Llyn Bach pass, before dropping down to the Tir Stynt copper mines near Cross Foxes, a total distance of . A Bill was introduced in Parliament to authorise this extension, but it also allowed the main Corris Railway to use steam locomotives, and the directors of the Aberystwith and Welsh Coast Railway objected and the Bill failed. The second proposal was for a line running north, then east, about a mile to reach an incline up to the Glyn Iago and Ty'n y Ceunant quarries on the slopes of Tarren y Gesail. Although part of the incline and some earthworks for the tramway extension were built in the 1890s, no track was laid. The third proposal came in the mid-1900s. The manager of the Corris Railway, J. J. O'Sullivan, proposed extending the line towards Tal-y-llyn Lake, but this time running high above the southern shore of the lake and reaching Abergynolwyn where it would connect to the Talyllyn Railway. This proposal was not approved by the company Directors and no work was done on it.  Route  The tramway started at Maespoeth Junction, where it joined the Corris Railway. The tramway separated from the mainline to the south of the locomotive shed at Maespoeth. While the main line continued to rise gently as it headed towards Corris, the tramway ascended more steeply, running beside the Machynlleth to Dolgellau road. As the tramway passed between the locomotive shed and the road, there was a siding used to store empty wagons waiting to return to the quarries. The tramway followed the road, climbing steeply. It passed to the west of Corris village, opposite the Braich Goch Inn. Here the tramway crossed over the road into Corris village on the level then entered a short cut and cover tunnel as it passed between the road and a row of cottages on the east side of the track. This tunnel was too low and narrow to allow steam locomotives to enter, and was the main reason the tramway was horse-worked for its entire existence. After the tunnel, the tramway swung round a very sharp curve below the Hughes Memorial. Running almost due-west and below the level of the road, the tramway ran past Braichgoch Terrace and entered the yard of Braichgoch quarry. A line branched off to the north, dropping into the quarry yard, which sat on a large platform of slate waste. The tramway proper continued to climb and passed to the south of the Braichgoch quarry office and reached the level of the road. It passed over a steep incline down from the Braichgoch level 7 incline, then passed underneath a high bridge that carried the internal quarry tramway from the Braichgoch level 5 adit to the head of a short incline down to the mill. The tramway now followed the route of the road along the south side of the Afon Deri as it swung to the northwest. The road climbed more steeply, while the tramway kept to a narrow ledge. On the left side of the tramway and road were the tips of Gaewern quarry, with a tramway connecting Gaewern to Braichgoch mill running parallel but considerably higher up the mountain. As the road turned north, the tramway swung away from it and was considerably lower. It curved gently as it passed between the road to the west and the river to the east. It passed on the river side of a large house and here the tramway up to Abercorris quarry branched off and crossed the river. The tramway curved back to the northwest, still following but below the road. On the south side of the road lay the main mills of Gaewern quarry, connected to the tramway by a branch when Gaewern operated independently of Braichgoch. At least one adit ran under the road and into the Gaewern vein. The tramway continued, finishing the long curve to run almost due west and enter the village of Corris Uchaf. It passed between a row of houses and the road. The branch to Abercwmeiddaw quarry left here, running north, crossing the Afon Deri by a bridge before ending at the foot of the Abercwmeiddaw exit incline. The tramway continued on northwest for another , passing behind the village post office to a slate enamelling works.  Operations  = Quarries served = The furthest quarry from Maespoeth Junction was Abercwmeiddaw quarry which is on the north bank of the Afon Deri. A branch of the tramway crossed the river from near the terminus in Corris Uchaf, and ended in a long incline up to the quarry mill level. Also on the north bank of the river was Abercorris quarry, which was connected to the tramway by a branch that crossed the river, then ascended the valley side via a reversing spur. Again an incline led up to the quarry mill. On the south bank of the Afon Deri lay Gaewern and Braichgoch quarries. For much of their lives these quarries were worked as a single concern. The Upper Corris Tramway passed through the main yard of Braichgoch quarry, and a number of short branches connected to the mill and stacking yards. = Slate Traffic = Slate was carried in slate waggons which ran in trains down to Maespoeth Junction by gravity. Empty waggons were hauled uphill from Maespoeth to the quarry by horses. = Passenger traffic = No formal passenger services were ever run on the tramway, although there is some evidence that the company may have charged people to ride in slate waggons along the route.  Remains  Much of the route of the tramway was removed when the A487 was widened in the 1980s. The section of the tramway from Braichgoch quarry to the south end of Corris Uchaf was buried under these works. Below Braichgoch quarry, the trackbed is largely intact, including the section above Corris village where the line is in cutting between the road and several local houses: the houses still have slate bridges over the tramway to access their front doors. Several of the branches to the quarries can still be traced in 2019.

The organisation was founded in 2005 as the Association for Research on Mothering ‚Äî Australia (ARM‚ÄìA) by academic, Dr Marie Porter. It was established as a sister organisation to the Canadian Association for Research on Mothering (ARM) which was founded by Professor Andrea O'Reilly at York University. In 2010 the name was changed to AMIRCI to match the Canadian organisation's name change to MIRCI. In Canada, MIRCI partnered with Demeter Press to produce a journal and books on motherhood. MIRCI has since changed its name again to IAMAS ‚Äî International Association of Maternal Action and Scholarship. Like its Canadian counterpart, AMIRCI is focused on developing a matricentric feminist movement through furthering research into motherhood and advocacy for mothers through connection, collaboration and conversation with mothers and feminist professionals. Following the success of a first conference in 2001, the organisation was formed and since 2005 has hosted bi-annual motherhood conferences chaired by a variety of female experts in their field and covering topics such as, ‚ÄúMotherhood in an Age of Neoliberalism and Individualisation‚Äù, ‚ÄúFeminism for Mothers‚Äù, and, ‚ÄúNegotiating Competing Demands: 21st Century Motherhood‚Äù. Recent keynote speakers have included Professor Andrea O'Reilly on regretful motherhood, Dr Petra Bueskens on the failure of the welfare system to support single mothers, Dr Renate Klein on the misogyny of surrogacy, and Professor Eva Cox on the need for a Universal Basic Income. In earlier years notable speakers have included Jackie Huggins, Maurillia Meehan and Gracelyn Smallwood. In 2018, AMIRCI founder Dr Marie Porter received an Order of Australia for her work as, \\"A researcher and advocate for the welfare of women and children\\". Conferences showcase cross-disciplinary work with topics spanning pregnancy and childbirth, human rights violations through child removal, lactation, mothering disabled children, the failures of family law and the welfare system, the impact of mothering on women's creative expression, representations of motherhood in literature and film and also feature performances and display of artwork such as a giant knitted placenta. Leading Australian universities have hosted AMIRCI's conferences, including the University of Sydney, RMIT, University of Melbourne, University of Queensland, and La Trobe University in Melbourne.

The single-story wood-frame structure measures and was built according to a standard National Forest Service design in 1933 by the Civilian Conservation Corps. The structure includes an exterior catwalk and a cable anchor system to protect from strong winds.. The lookout was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 22, 1988. A lawsuit filed in 2010 sought to remove the structure from the mountaintop, a move that was ultimately prevented by the Green Mountain Lookout Heritage Protection Act, which was passed by Congress in 2014.  History  Lookout in 1971 The original structure was built in 1933 and was originally used as a fire lookout tower. Since its initial construction, the lookout has often been subjected to severe winter weather which has, on a number of occasions, caused structural damage requiring extensive repairs. In 1950, the roof was replaced and walls, windows, and doors were repaired after heavy snowfall damaged the building the previous winter. The lookout ceased to be used for fire detection purposes after the 1980s, and in the mid-1990s, the building was closed to the public due to a damaged foundation and catwalk. In 2002, after a newly-installed foundation was severely damaged by snowfall, the building was dismantled piece by piece, with pieces flown by helicopter to be repaired off-site. After delays from road washouts in 2003 and 2006, the foundation was repaired in 2009 and the building was reconstructed shortly thereafter, with the pieces flown back up to the mountaintop via helicopter.. In 2010, an environmental group called Wilderness Watch filed a lawsuit against the Forest Service, claiming that they violated federal law by using helicopters during the lookout restoration process. In 2012, a federal court in Seattle sided with the group and ordered the removal of the structure. In response, Senator Patty Murray introduced the Green Mountain Lookout Heritage Protection Act, which was written to amend existing law to prohibit the Forest Service from removing the lookout unless the structure poses a risk to public safety. The act was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Obama in 2014, superseding the court order and effectively preventing removal of the structure.

Biography  Around 1830, he became a student of Jean-Victor Bertin, then entered the workshop of Horace Vernet at the √âcole des beaux-arts de Paris. He was given an award for his use of perspective in 1832 and came in at second place for historical landscapes at the Prix de Rome of 1837. Four years later, he received the grand prize in the same category for his depiction of the angel Camael driving Adam and Eve from Paradise with a flaming sword.Jean-Michel Leniaud,Dominique Massounie, Proc√®s-verbaux de l'Acad√©mie des Beaux-arts: 1840-1844, p.238, √âcole des Chartes, Paris, 2007. His debut at the Salon came in 1833 and he paid his first visit to Rome that same year. His next exhibit at the Salon would not come until 1847, which brought him a medal. In 1849, he produced a series on the Forest of Fontainebleau when that area first became accessible by train. After his return to France, he toured the valleys of Is√®re. This was followed by trips to Holland (1850) and Russia (1853), where he painted scenes en plein aire. He was awarded another medal at the Salon in 1861. His stylistic change from Naturalism to Romanticism came at a time when the latter had started to gain favor with the bourgeoisie. Several of his works were bought by the French government. He was named a Chevalier in the Legion of Honor in 1864.

The Launceston and Western Railway opened in 1871 and had a track gauge of 5'3\\", this locomotive was their No. 1. This locomotive was in service with another 4-4-0 type of tank engine for the opening of the line on the 10th of February 1871. With the Tasmanian Government taking over the line in October 1873, this locomotive became a member of their A class. In 1885 the line was converted to 3'6\\" and the four A class locomotives became redundant. In 1888 No. 1 was sold to a private company in Victoria \\"The Great Victoria Colliery\\" for use between mines at Woolamai and a jetty at Queensferry. Not long after it began its work for this private company it was put into storage until 1910. It was then sold to Smith and Timms for use on the construction of the railway line to Angaston from Gawler in South Australia. The side tanks were removed, which left the locomotive with only a small tank. It was supplemented with a small four wheeled tank which was coupled to the engine. Once construction was completed on the Gawler to Angaston line the contractors sold locomotive No. 1 to the South Australian Railways in February 1912 and it was renumbered 204. No. 204 eventually got classed as the second O on the S.A.R. network between 1918 and 1919. The O classes service on the S.A.R. mainly consisted of shunting at Mile End and Port Adelaide, during this period it got a boiler off a Q class locomotive during a rebuild at Islington Railway Workshops.

Rumours started spreading in Ayodhya about Sita's chastity, that she had stayed in the house of another man for a year and they did not believe on fire test. Sita decided to stop harassment against women and by going on an exile. Then Sita left Ayodhya and swore not to meet Sri Rama before the completion of her objective. She gave birth to twins Luv and Kush at Valmiki's hermitage after proving her chastity under the pseudonym of vandevi. Fourteen years passed, the brothers start listening to the verses of Ramayan from Sita Valmiki and Shatrughna. During ashvmedha yajna they doubted Ram's love for Sita and stopped the ashva. Then the whole family battled and finally they get their answers. Sita breaks the truth after that they are children of Ayodhya king Rama and she is Sita not vandevi.

The show was launched in Ayodhya in a grand manner. The budget of the series is about ‚Çπ650 crore with the sets set at Umargam in Gujarat. The shoot of the series ended on 7 February 2020.  Critical reception  The series is regarded as one of the costliest Indian television series produced due to its budget of ‚Çπ650 Crores.  Controversy  Protests were started by the Valmiki Community of Punjab to ban the series for representing a disfigured fact on the Sage Valmiki. A bandh of markets was called on 9 September 2019 by them. Admist this issue, a man was shot in Jalandhar, Punjab. After this, the series was banned in Punjab on the orders of the CM Amarinder Singh. This bandh also caused discrepancies in train and bus services in Ludhiana. The ministry of information and broadcasting council sent a notice on 11 September 2019 to the channel giving 15 days time for responding stating, > \\"The show is harming the image of Maharishi Valmiki and causing hurt to the > religious sentiments of a community.\\" It further stated, > \\"Lord Ram has been shown to have visited Maharishi Valmiki‚Äôs ashram and met > Luv and Kush, which is not true. He met Luv and Kush at the time of the > Ashwamedh Yagya, when they captured their horse and waged a war.\\" On 9 September 2019, the Punjab and Haryana High Court refused to stay the ban on the telecast of the series imposed by the state of Punjab. During the hearing, the channel argued on the ban order stating that it was passed without adhering to the principles of natural justice, and without the ingredients of Section 19 of the Cable Operators Regulation Act. They also offered to delete the scenes causing the controversy which was considered by the court thereby adjourning the case for the next hearing on 12 September. This resulted an imposement of FIR against the channel, producers and the actors in Amritsar and Jalandhar. They got an interim stay on the proceedings against them until 28 January 2020. > \\"The show draws from various texts, books and scriptures based on Ramayan > and it is never our intention to hurt sentiments of any particular group,\\" a Viacom18 spokesperson said in a statement issued on 14 September 2019. They further stated, > \\"We are closely working with the group and taking their feedback on board. > We stay committed to working together to make this a show that Indians > across geographies and generations enjoy uninhibited,\\" On 17 October 2019, the court set the ban order aside when the producers agreed to take corrective action for it. The hearing stated, \\"What clearly emerges is that the state government having taken a conscious decision of setting up a committee to look into the entire issue and the committee, post deliberations having suggested certain corrective measures/steps, the same have not only been accepted by the petitioner party but have been implemented in so far as the previous episodes of the serial and now have furnished an undertaking to even adhere to such corrective measures/steps for future telecast as well,\\". Further, the representatives of the channel agreed to delete that scene in all the digital platforms and also to air a special episode on the greatness of Valmiki in accordance with the information provided by the community.

He has been a Global Network Assistant Professor at New York University. He has been also the principal investigator and director of the Game Theory and Learning Laboratory (L&G; Lab) at New York University. Tembine has written about 300 research articles, 2 books, and co- edited 3 books. His research is focused in the areas of auto-regulation, self- regulation, knowledge-based economy and variance minimization of tokens in emerging markets.  Early life and education  Tembine received an M.S. in Applied Mathematics from √âcole Polytechnique in Paris in 2006 and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of Avignon in 2009. His thesis was entitled 'Population Games with Networking Applications'.  Career  In 2010, Tembine was appointed as Assistant Professor at Ecole Superieure d‚ÄôElectricite, Supelec (now Ecole CentraleSupelec), France and taught there until 2013. In 2014, he joined the New York University as Global Network Assistant Professor. He is the principal investigator of the Learning and Game Theory Laboratory (L&G; Lab) at NYU, NYC and Abu Dhabi campuses. Tembine has been the Associate Editor of IEEE Access, of Games, and of AIMS Electronic Engineering since 2017. He has been a game theory consultant, blockchain token economics advisor, senior research scientist at several companies since 2004. = Work = As the director of L&G; Lab, Tembine developed a risk engineering tool based on mean-field-type game theory. The tool was applied to engineering in the areas of multilevel building evacuation, smart energy systems, network security, transportation and mobility and blockchain token economics. The model was further applied to social sciences, user's empathy and psychology, deep strategy and deep learning. Tembine established equivalence between a class of multi-agent distributionally robust generative adversarial networks under various divergence notions and variance-aware distributionally robust games. Mean-field-type filters, which are filters that depend on the distribution of the state, were first proposed by L&G; Lab members. They provided explicit solutions to a class of mean-field-type games with non- linear state dynamics and or non-quadratic cost functions. The non-linearity includes trigonometric functions, hyperbolic functions, logarithmic functions and power (polynomial) cost functions. Tembine has worked on game theory with small, medium and large number of interacting agents. He also contributed to the design, analysis, and implementation of distributed strategic learning. He has established relationships between the domains of strategic learning, evolutionary game dynamics and Kolmogorov forward equations (Markov jump processes). The results were applied to resource allocation problems, user's satisfaction problems, queue-aware power control and allocation problems. Tembine has participated in several projects in West Africa in the areas of informal economy, knowledge-based economy and blockchain token economy. He tested low-cost, self-configurable, solar-power equipment that requires less maintenance in several areas. His conclusion was to base the entire project on a significant participation of the local population. The evidence from these projects showed that when the involvement of the local population is high, the maintenance and the followup were better done by themselves. To improve efficiency, he suggested private portion of the field to be shared depending on the needs of the local population.

The western boundary roughly follows the Great Dividing Range while the southern boundary follows the southern tip of the Drummond Range (and may be the origin of the locality's name). The Tambo Road traverses the locality from north-east (Alpha) to south-west (Blackall/Windeyer). Alpha Creek starts in the south of the locality and flows north through the locality exiting to the north-east (Alpha). Being east of the Great Dividing Range, all watercourses in the area are part of the North East Coast drainage basin. Alpha Creek is a tributary of the Native Companion Creek, then Belyando River, Suttor River and the Burdekin River, which flows into the Coral Sea at Rita Island in the Shire of Burdekin. The principal land use is grazing on native vegetation.  History  In 1910, the pastoral run Drummondslope was offered for a 20-year lease; the property was . Edmund Jowett secured the lease with a bid of per square mile. Jowett operated many pastoral runs in Australia. In 1930, the property was sold to George Oliver Carter. He sold the property in 1935 to B. Hooke & Co. As at 2019, the Drummondslope pastoral run still exists () but is considerably smaller at .  Education  There are no schools in Drummondslope. The nearest primary school is in Alpha. The nearest secondary school is in Alpha but only offers secondary schooling to Year 10. The nearest secondary schools to Year 12 is in Barcaldine.

On 22 November 2019 the Queensland Government decided to amalgamate the localities in the Barcaldine Region, resulting in five expanded localities based on the larger towns: Alpha, Aramac, Barcaldine, Jericho and Muttaburra. Dunrobin was mostly incorporated into Jericho, except for the south-east corner which was incorporated into Alpha and the south-west corner which was incorporated into Aramac.  Geography  The Great Dividing Range passes through the locality from north to south-east, creating a watershed. To the west of the range, the Alice River rises in the south-east of the locality and flows to the south (Garfield) while Clara Creek rises in the south and flows to the west (Upland), eventually becoming a tributary of the Thomson River. Both of these watercourses are within the Lake Eyre drainage basin. In contrast, Dunda Creek also rises in the south-east of the locality but to the east of range. Dunda Creek flows north through the locality exiting to the north-east (Laglan), eventually contributing to the Burdekin River in the North East Coast drainage basin. In the south-east of the locality are two protected areas, the Cudmore National Park and the Cudmore Resources Reserve. Apart from the protected areas, the principal land use is grazing on native vegetation.  Education  There are no schools in Dunrobin. The nearest primary schools are in Aramac , Jericho and Mistake Creek . The nearest secondary school is in Aramac but only offers secondary schooling to Year 10. For Years 11 and 12, the nearest schools are in Barcaldine and Clermont . However, the long driving times on the poor roads in this area make it unlikely that children could feasibly attend any of these schools. Boarding schools and distance education would be the alternatives.

According to the Queensland Railways Department, the railway station was so named because of the surrounding ridges were once covered in cypress pine. On August 1883 there was a land sale for 56 town lots and 180 country lots at Pine Hill. The sale was successful yielding with buyers planning to build hotels and shops in the new town, although the newspaper of the day speculated that the land might be worthless in two years (presumably in the expectation that Pine Hill would not remain the terminus). The railway line opened 1 November 1883. The Queensland National Bank relocated their business from Bogantungan (the previous terminus) to Pine Hill in November 1883.

While on the set, Campbell met Stephen \\"Sam\\" Calder DFC, who had been an RAAF Typhoon pilot during the war, and had recently been taken on as a commercial pilot by Connellan Airways. They married in August 1945 and had a home in Alice Springs. Sam would later have a career in politics as MHR for the Northern Territory 1966‚Äì1980. In August 1947 Campbell was approached by an organising committee from the Alice Springs sub-branch of the Returned Servicemen's League to represent the Northern Territory in the Miss South Australia Quest, preparatory to the Miss Australia Quest. The purpose behind the Quest was fund-raising for the RSL and for the Kindergarten Union, and Campbell was enthusiastic about these causes. An interstate protest was made against her candidature was made on the grounds of her being a married woman, but denied on the grounds of her nomination having been accepted before the rule had been instituted. A fair number of special fund-raising activities were held in the Territory in support of her campaign, including a rodeo and an Australian Rules football match, and Campbell worked as hard as anyone but support was lacking from people who could best afford it, and a spoiling campaign developed on the grounds that she wasn't a \\"true Territorian\\", with the result that her funds raised barely exceeded ¬£800 when expectations had been for considerably more.

Early life Hughes was born in 1895, one of two daughters born to John William Hughes. Her paternal grandfather had been a joiner but her father had instead become a clerk at a solicitor's office in England at the age of 19. Her father became a qualified solicitor at 41 and moved to Conwy in North Wales to set up his own practice, JW Hughes. Her father hoped to provide his daughters with an education and sent them both to the Welsh Girls' School in Ashford, Surrey. They later attended Bangor County School for Girls. Hughes went on to attend the University of London where she gained a second class Bachelor of Science (Economics) in 1918. She also gained first class honours from the Law Society and was first in her class for both male and female students in her Law Finals class of 1923. In doing so, she became the first Welsh woman to qualify as a solicitor. She was awarded The Sheffield Prize and The John Mackrell Prize by The Council of the Law Society, receiving ¬£35 and ¬£13 for the awards respectively.

During World War II it was converted to a parachute role and dropped into Normandy on D Day and across the Rhine during Operation Varsity. Its successors continue in the Army Reserve today. Origin When the Territorial Army (TA) was established in 1921 it did not extend to Northern Ireland; the auxiliary forces in the province were part of the Supplementary Reserve (SR), successors to the old Militia. However, when the TA began to expand in the worsening international situation of the late 1930s, the first TA units of the Royal Artillery (RA) and Royal Engineers (RE) were established in Northern Ireland. One of these was the Antrim (Fortress) Company Royal Engineers, formed in October 1937 with its headquarters at 32 Great Victoria Street, Belfast, County Antrim. Captain J. Maynard Sinclair of the Reserve of Officers was appointed Officer Commanding (OC) with the local rank of Major. The company's role was to man the searchlights (S/Ls) and associated electrical generators at Grey Point Battery and Killroot Battery guarding the entrance to Belfast Lough.Monthly Army List, May 1939.Grey Point Battery at Pillbox Study GroupWatson & Rinaldi, p. 99.Sinclair at 591 (Antrim) Para Sqn site.1939 War Diary at 591 (Antrim) Para Sqn site. World War II =Mobilisation= The unit mobilised on 24 August 1939, before the outbreak of war, as part of Fixed Defences in Northern Ireland District and took up its war stations at Grey Point and Killroot, Maj Sinclar being summoned back from holiday in Scotland.Northern Ireland District at Patriot Files. In 1940 it was decided to transfer responsibility for S/L provision to the Royal Artillery, and in June 'The Antrims' began training to convert into an Army Troops company, though this was delayed while the company established extra S/L positions at Larne, County Antrim, and Magilligan, County Londonderry.Litchfield, p. 5.1940 War Diary at 591 (Antrim) Para Sqn site. On 30 September the company was ordered to move to Portaferry, County Down, to form 591 (Antrim) Army Field Company, RE. The 'engine room' staff remained with the Fixed Defences, while three officers and 29 Other Ranks (ORs) provided the cadre for the new company, which officially came into existence on 1 December. A draft of 100 ORs was received from No 5 Training Battalion, RE, on 25 December. Major Sinclair had been elected to the House of Commons of Northern Ireland in 1938 and in January 1941 he was appointed a junior minister in the Northern Ireland Government; he was replaced as OC by Maj Arthur White.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 172, 185.Home page at 591 Para Sqn. In January 1941 the company went to Halifax, West Yorkshire, and joined II Corps, moving to Ely, Cambridgeshire, in March. It received further drafts of sappers and drivers and trained in bridgebuilding; it was also responsible for demolitions in case of invasion, built hutted camps across the country, and took part in major training exercises. The company was briefly assigned to 76th Infantry Division (18 November‚Äì29 December 1941), then on 31 December it went to Woodbridge, Suffolk, and joined 54th (East Anglian) Infantry Division.1941 War Diary at 591 (Antrim) Para Sqn site.

The 'Antrims' were now designated 591 (Antrim) Parachute Squadron, RE, just under half the men coming from the original company, the remainder being volunteers from other RE units. Squadron HQ moved to Bulford Camp on Salisbury Plain while parties went to Hardwick Hall in Derbyshire to train as parachutists, carrying out their practice drops at No. 1 Parachute Training School at RAF Ringway.Joslen, pp. 106‚Äì7.1943 War Diary at 591 (Antrim) Para Sqn site. The squadron completed its mobilisation for active service on 31 January 1944. 6th Airborne Division was now in intensive training for the planned Allied invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord).1944 War Diary at 591 (Antrim) Para Sqn site. Normandy 'Rommel's asparagus' was planted in French fields in 1944 to damage gliders. 6th Airborne Division's role in Overlord was to make a night drop in the early hours of D Day (6 June) to secure the east flank of the seaborne landings by capturing the vital bridges over the River Orne and Caen Canal and neutralising the Merville Battery. 2 Troop of 591 Para Sqn was attached to 9th Parachute Battalion for the Merville attack. No 7 Section flew in a Horsa glider from RAF Broadwell with the Coup de main party, while Nos 5, 6 and 8 Sections flew in Dakotas to drop with the rest of the battalion. Meanwhile, 1 and 3 Trps were to fly in six Stirlings from RAF Fairford and drop with Advanced HQRE 6th Airborne Division and 5th Parachute Brigade on the bridges.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, pp. 339‚Äì40. Airborne troops drive off Landing Zone N on the evening of 6 June. 591 Parachute Sqn was unlucky on D Day: some of its aircraft had to turn back and others were widely scattered. None of 2 Trp arrived to take part in the Battle of Merville Gun Battery, and their engineering stores were lost in marshes, so although the battery was captured the paratroopers could not fully destroy the guns before withdrawing. The rest of the squadron's 'sticks' landed far and wide. The OC, Maj Wood, his second-in-command, a troop commander, two other officers and a number of ORs were captured. Although the second-in-command (Capt Gordon 'Bud' Davidson) managed to escape and rejoin, it fell to a troop commander and a handful of other offices and men to do what they could. The chief task was to remove anti-glider poles ('Rommel's asparagus') from Landing Zone N; luckily it proved unnecessary to use explosive and the poles could be cleared by hand. Two landing strips were ready when the first gliders arrived at 03.20 on 6 June. Two more strips were prepared for the following evening's mass fly-in of gliders bringing reinforcements and supplies. Meanwhile, other members of 591 Para Sqn assisted 13th (Lancashire) Parachute Battalion in clearing Ranville, and the squadron then collected the mines that had been dropped and laid them to defend the landing zone. Captain Davidson was promoted to command the 'Antrims'.Ellis, Normandy, pp. 149‚Äì56, 204‚Äì5.McKee, pp. 37‚Äì41.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, pp. 341‚Äì3.Davidson at 591 (Antrim) Para Sqn site. An FBE pontoon bridge in France, 1944. 6th Airborne Division remained in Normandy, guarding the left flank of the beachhead until 21st Army Group succeeded in breaking out. The 'Antrims' at Ranville were engaged in general tasks such as laying minefields, maintaining roads, establishing water points and constructing machine gun positions and shelters for ambulances and HQs. When the breakout began on 17 August, 6th Airborne captured Troarn where 591 Para Sqn with a platoon of 249 (East Anglian) Airborne Sqn built Folding Boat Equipment (FBE) bridges across dykes and the River Dives, and opened a ford to allow tanks to cross the river. By 24 August it was using captured German bridging equipment to cross the River Touques at Rocheville to speed the division's advance. At ethe end of August 6th Airborne was pulled out of the line and the 'Antrims' prepared to return by sea to Bulford for rest, re-equipment, and training.Ellis, Normandy, p. 448. Major Allan Jack took over command on 11 November.Jack at 591 (Antrim) Para Sqn site. At the end of 1944 6th Airborne Division was rushed back to the Continent as reinforcements in response to the German Ardennes Offensive. On 22 December 591 Para Sqn went to Folkestone to embark on the SS Canterbury, disembarking at Ostend on 26 December. The division was sent to seal off the northern flank of the German 'Bulge', involving some hard fighting in the Battle of Bure. The Antrims were mainly employed in bridgebuilding and mine clearance. 6th Airborne remained in the Low Countries until late February 1945, when it returned from Ostend to Bulford to prepare for the crossing of the Rhine (Operation Varsity).Ellis, Germany, pp. 181, 191.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, p. 444.1945 War Diary at 591 (Antrim) Para Sqn site. Operation Varsity For the Rhine operation, the airborne landings (Varsity) took place in daylight following a night crossing by ground forces (Operation Plunder). 6th Airborne's objective was to seize crossings over the River Issel beyond the Rhine. 591 Squadron was organised into two troops: No 1 Trp had six glider parties with 6th Airlanding Brigade for the assault on the three Issel bridges, while Maj Jack and No 2 Trp parachuted from four aircraft, accompanied by two gliders carrying Jeeps and stores, supporting 5th Parachute Bde in securing routes to the Issel. They took off from RAF Rivenhall at 05.30 and 07.30, and arrived over the Rhine at 10.00.Ellis, Germany, pp. 290‚Äì1.Rhine Crossing at 591 (Antrim) Para Sqn site.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, p. 497.Saunders, p. 185. The gliders with the coup de main party each contained five sappers with a Jeep, trailer and motorcycle; two of these groups were assigned to each bridge. There was considerable Flak on the run-in: two of the gliders were shot down en route and two others were shot upon landing with considerable casualties; two parties arrived intact, only one (led by Lieutenant Peter Cox) in the correct position. Cox's party arrived at 10.20 and was involved in heavy fighting at the bridge, but once a company of 1st Battalion Royal Ulster Rifles had captured it at 11.15 the sappers were able to prepare it for demolition. The two surviving parties then went to the bridge captured by 2nd Bn Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, but this bridge was under heavy fire and demolition charges could not be placed until after dark. This bridge was successfully demolished next day when threatened by a German armoured counter- attack.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, p. 498.Cox at 591 (Antrim) Para Sqn site.Saunders, pp. 189‚Äì94. A completed Bailey bridge in North West Europe 1944‚Äì45. The parachute party encountered considerable flak and small arms fire, but suffered few casualties. There was chaos at the rendezvous, most of the brigade having been dropped from its target. 2 Troop concentrated at 5th Parachute Bde HQ and dug in, but there was little need for engineering work, so one party left to destroy a captured German gun position and in the evening the troop moved off to join Cox's party with 6th Airlanding Bde.Saunders, pp. 187‚Äì9. After the Rhine, 6th Airborne advanced rapidly across North Germany, even outpacing 11th Armoured Division. On 1‚Äì2 April 591 Sqn built 'Antrim', a Class 40 (40 ton) Bailey bridge across the Dortmund‚ÄìEms Canal. On 5 April the squadron used assault boats to get 6th Airlanding Bde across the River Weser at Petershagen, and then helped 5th Parachute Bde consolidate a bridgehead over the River Leine at Neustadt am R√ºbenberge. 6th Airborne's sappers were held in reserve when 21st Army Group stormed across the Elbe.Ellis, Germany, p. 306.Pakenham-Walsh, pp. 507‚Äì9, 511‚Äì2. By the time of the German surrender at L√ºneburg Heath on 4 May, 6th Airborne had reached Wismar on the Baltic coast.Ellis, Germany, pp. 337‚Äì8. Norway After the end of the war in Europe the squadron was redesignated 591 (Antrim) Airborne Squadron, RE, and transferred on 1 June to 1st Airborne Division, which was serving in Norway as part of Operation Doomsday to disarm German troops. The squadron returned to the UK in early 1946 when it was demobilised and placed in suspended animation on 15 March.Joslen, p. 104.

In 1956 the coast artillery branch was disbanded, and the Antrim unit first raised in 1937 was transferred to the RE as 146 (Antrim Artillery) Corps Engineer Regiment.Litchfield, p. 310. Following the 1966 Defence White Paper 107 (Ulster) Bde was disbanded and 591 Sqn was placed in suspended animation, but the following year it was reformed and amalgamated with 146 Rgt as 74 (Antrim Artillery) Engineer Regiment, forming 112 (Antrim Fortress) Field Squadron.118‚Äì432 Rgts RE at British Army 1945 on.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 298, 315.

In the 1970s she was understudy for Judi Dench in The Good Companions at Her Majesty's Theatre, and she sang for the Ice Capades at Wembley. Family She married in 1947 the conductor Leonard Hancock; the marriage was later dissolved. In 1967 she married Stephen Arlen, the managing director of Sadler's Wells Opera, and they had a daughter, Juliette. Arlen died in 1972. Kells died in 2016, aged 93.

Rosalind Franklin first identified them in a 1951 paper in Proceedings of the Royal Society.. In this paper, she defined graphitizing carbons as those that can transform into crystalline graphite by being heated to 3000¬∞C, while non-graphitizing carbons don't transform into graphite at any temperature. Precursors that produce graphitizing carbon include polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and petroleum coke. Polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC) and sucrose produce non-graphitizing carbon. Physical properties of the two classes of carbons are quite different. Graphitizing carbons are soft and non-porous, while non-graphitizing carbons are hard, low density materials. Non-graphitizing carbons are otherwise known as chars, hard carbons or, more colloquially, charcoal. Glassy carbon is also an example of non-graphitizing carbon. The precursors for graphitizing carbons pass through a fluid stage during pyrolysis (carbonization). This fluidity facilitates the molecular mobility of the aromatic molecules, resulting in intermolecular dehydrogenative polymerization reactions to create aromatic, lamellar (disc- like) molecules. These ‚Äúassociate‚Äù to create a new liquid crystal phase, the so-called mesophase. A fluid phase is the dominant requirement for production of graphitizable carbons.H. Marsh and M.A. Diez (1994) \\" Mesophase of Graphitizable Carbons\\" In: Shibaev V.P., Lam L. (eds) Liquid Crystalline and Mesomorphic Polymers. Springer, New York, NY Non-graphitizing carbons generally do not pass through a fluid stage during carbonization. Since the time of Rosalind Franklin, researchers have put forward a number of models for their structure . Oberlin and colleagues emphasised the role of basic structural units (BSU), made of planar aromatic structures consisting of less than 10-20 rings, with four layers or fewer. Cross-linking between the BSUs in non-graphitizing carbons prevents graphitization. More recently, some have put forward models that incorporate pentagons and other non-six-membered carbon rings See also *Acheson process *Carbonization *Graphite  References  Category:Carbon forms ","title":"Graphitizing and non-graphitizing carbons"},{"id":"61444924","text":"The molecular formula C18H21N3O (molar mass: 295.379 g/mol) may refer to: * Dibenzepin * Dimethyllysergamide * LAE-32 Category:Molecular formulas ","title":"C18H21N3O"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:R}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},B={class:"card-container"};function H(s,e,n,c,u,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),o(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your bitcoinü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",B,[(t(!0),o(h,null,p(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),w(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const I=d(P,[["render",H]]),N=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/54.md","filePath":"glossary/54.md"}'),x={name:"glossary/54.md"},D=Object.assign(x,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(I)]))}});export{N as __pageData,D as default};
