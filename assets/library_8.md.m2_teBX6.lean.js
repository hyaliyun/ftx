It is an irritant and toxic, as are all soluble barium compounds. It is sometimes used in pyrotechnics to produce a green color. It also finds use in the production of chloric acid. Reactions =Synthesis= Barium chlorate can be produced through a double replacement reaction between solutions of barium chloride and sodium chlorate: :BaCl2 \\\\+ 2 NaClO3 ‚Üí Ba(ClO3)2 \\\\+ 2 NaCl On concentrating and chilling the resulting mixture, barium chlorate precipitates. This is perhaps the most common preparation, exploiting the lower solubility of barium chlorate compared to sodium chlorate. The above method does result in some sodium contamination, which is undesirable for pyrotechnic purposes, where the strong yellow of sodium can easily overpower the green of barium. Sodium-free barium chlorate can be produced directly through electrolysis: :BaCl2 \\\\+ 6 H2O ‚Üí Ba(ClO3)2 \\\\+ 6 H2 It can also be produced by the reaction of barium carbonate with boiling ammonium chlorate solution: :2 NH4ClO3 \\\\+ BaCO3 \\\\+ Q ‚Üí Ba(ClO3)2 \\\\+ 2 NH3 \\\\+ H2O + CO2 The reaction initially produces barium chlorate and ammonium carbonate; boiling the solution decomposes the ammonium carbonate and drives off the resulting ammonia and carbon dioxide, leaving only barium chlorate in solution. The green seen in this firework is produced by barium chlorate and barium nitrate =Decomposition= When exposed to heat, barium chlorate alone will decompose to barium chloride and oxygen: :Ba(ClO3)2 ‚Üí BaCl2 \\\\+ 3 O2 =Chloric acid= Barium chlorate is used to produce chloric acid, the formal precursor to all chlorate salts, through its reaction with dilute sulfuric acid, which results in a solution of chloric acid and insoluble barium sulfate precipitate: :Ba(ClO3)2 \\\\+ H2SO4 ‚Üí 2 HClO3 \\\\+ BaSO4 Both the chlorate and the acid should be prepared as dilute solutions before mixing, such that the chloric acid produced is dilute, as concentrated solutions of chloric acid (above 30%) are unstable and prone to decompose, sometimes explosively. Commercial uses Barium chlorate, when burned with a fuel, produces a vibrant green light. Because it is an oxidizer, a chlorine donor, and contains a metal, this compound produces a green color that is unparalleled. However, due to the instability of all chlorates to sulfur, acids, and ammonium ions, chlorates have been banned from use in class C fireworks in the United States. Therefore, more and more firework producers have begun to use more stable compound such as barium nitrate and barium carbonate. Environmental Hazard Barium chlorate is toxic to humans and can also harm the environment. It is very harmful to aquatic organisms if it is leached into bodies of water. Chemical spills of this compound, although not common, can harm entire ecosystems and should be prevented. It is necessary to dispose of this compound as hazardous waste. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lists barium chlorate as hazardous.

The FA Trophy is the oldest football competition in Trinidad and Tobago, dating back to 1927 when Shamrock claimed the inaugural trophy. Since the competition involves clubs of all standards playing against each other, there is the possibility for 'giant-killers' from the lower divisions of eliminating top clubs from the tournament and even theoretically win the trophy, although lower division teams rarely reach the final. The trophy is currently contested each December through March following the National Super League season and the first round of matches in the TT Pro League. The current holders of the FA Trophy are North East Stars, who defeated fellow Pro League side W Connection in the 2014‚Äì15 final on 29 March 2015. Format The competition is a knockout tournament with pairings for each round drawn at random ‚Äì there are no seeds, and the draw for each round is not made until after the scheduled dates for the previous round. The draw also determines which teams will play at home. Each tie is played as a single leg. If a match is drawn after regulation time, then the match is determined by extra time and a penalty shootout, as required. Until the 1990s, a draw would result in the match being replayed two or three days after the original game. In the result of a drawn replay, extra time and penalty shootouts were used to determine the winner. However, beginning in 1999 each match is decided in its current format. There are a total of six rounds in the competition ‚Äì first, second, and third rounds, followed by the quarterfinals, semifinals, and the final. The competition begins in December with the first round where eight teams are entered into the competition. The remaining teams enter the FA Trophy in the second round. Each round is contested until the champion has been decided by single-elimination. Along with presented the trophy, the winning team also receives 23 gold medals and the runners-up receive 23 silver medals following the competition. =The draw= The draw for each round, performed by drawing numbered balls from a bag, is a source of great interest to clubs and their supporters. Sometimes two top clubs may be drawn against each other in the early rounds, removing the possibility of them meeting in the final. Lower-ranked clubs with reputations as 'giant-killers' look forward to meeting a top team. Top-ranked teams look for easy opposition, but have to be on their guard against 'giant-killers' and lower teams with ambition. =Eligible teams= All clubs in the TT Pro League are automatically eligible and the top six clubs following the league season in the National Super League are also eligible to enter the competition. Clubs from the six regional football association leagues that consist the third level of the football pyramid are also eligible. However, qualification is determined by the club's respective regional football association and narrowed to the top three clubs from each league. All clubs entering the competition must have a suitable stadium. The number of entrants increased from 32 to 36 beginning with the 2011‚Äì12 edition. The Trinidad and Tobago Football Association decided to include the top four teams from the Secondary Schools Football League to provide youth players an opportunity to compete with professional and semi- professional clubs. By comparison, the other major Trinidad and Tobago domestic cup, the First Citizens Cup, involves only the members of the TT Pro League. Trophy There have been 35 different trophy winners with Malvern United and Maple Club claiming the most titles with seven each. At the end of the final, the winning team is presented with a trophy, also known as the \\"FA Trophy\\", which they hold until the following year's final. Individual members of the teams playing in the final are presented with winners' and runners'-up medals. The present FA Trophy has been used since the inception of the tournament in 1927. Following the awarding of the winners' medals, the trophy is presented by President of the Trinidad and Tobago Football Association to the winning team's captain. Eight clubs have won consecutive FA Trophies: Everton (1929‚Äì32), Colts (1944‚Äì45), United British Oilfields Trinidad (1950‚Äì51), Malvern United (1960‚Äì61), Maple Club (1970‚Äì72), ASL Sports Club (1982‚Äì83), W Connection (1999‚Äì2000), and Caledonia AIA (2012‚Äì13). However, there has not been any clubs to win consecutive FA Trophies on more than one occasion. With the start of the League Cup in 1997, there has not been any clubs that have won the FA Trophy as part of a League and Cup double. In 1985, Defence Force added the 1985 Champions' Cup crown to their double, an accomplishment known as the continental treble. =Winners from outside the top flight= Since the debut of professional teams into the competition in 1999, clubs from the former Professional Football League (PFL) and the current TT Pro League have won the cup in all but one of those years. WASA of the Super League were surprise winners in 2006, defeating two professional clubs, including the North East Stars 4-2 on penalties after the championship match ended drawn 3-3\\\\. In fact, WASA remains the only club to win the trophy from outside the top flight since the introduction of professional clubs. There has been only one other occurrence of a team outside to the professional ranks to reach the final. In 2001, Carib from the Eastern FA, reached the final after defeating North East Stars and Police of the PFL. However, Carib fell to their third professional opponent, Joe Public, in the final.

Elements having atomic numbers greater than that of uranium are called transuranic. Elements within TRU are typically man-made and are known to contain americium-241 and several isotopes of plutonium. Because of the elements' longer half-lives, TRU is disposed of more cautiously than low level waste and intermediate level waste. In the U.S. it is a byproduct of weapons production, nuclear research and power production, and consists of protective gear, tools, residue, debris and other items contaminated with small amounts of radioactive elements (mainly plutonium). Under U.S. law, TRU is further categorized into \\"contact-handled\\" (CH) and \\"remote-handled\\" (RH) on the basis of the radiation field measured on the waste container's surface. CH TRU has a surface dose rate not greater than 2 mSv per hour (200 mrem/h), whereas RH TRU has rates of 2 mSv/h or higher. CH TRU has neither the high radioactivity of high level waste, nor its high heat generation. In contrast, RH TRU can be highly radioactive, with surface dose rates up to 10 Sv/h (1000 rem/h). The United States currently permanently disposes of TRU generated from defense nuclear activities at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, a deep geologic repository.

During the investigation, a local resident named Posteal Laskey Jr. was declared the main suspect in the killings, and arrested on December 9, 1966 for one of the murders, which he was subsequently convicted of. Despite the fact that he was never charged with the other murders, the media and police blamed him for the other deaths, since, according to the official version of the investigators, the murders ceased after his arrest. Murders As victims, the perpetrator chose women between the ages of 31 and 81, living in Cincinnati's various housing complexes, which were inhabited by poor residents of the city. In five of the seven murders, the victims were sexually assaulted. The first victim was a 56-year-old Emogene Harrington, who was strangled to death on December 2, 1965. Four months later, on April 4, 1966, 58-year-old Lois Dant was found strangled, raped and beaten in her ground floor apartment. She was talking to a friend on the phone and hung up when there was a knock on the door, which, according to the investigators, was made by her killer. On June 10th, the Strangler attacked 56-year-old Matilda Jeannette Messer in one of the city's parks, beating, raping and subsequently strangling her. After killing her, the criminal tied Messer's dog to a tree in the immediate vicinity of the body. The next victim of the serial killer was 31-year-old Barbara Bowman, who was attacked on August 14th. She had been to a bar that day, after which she called a taxi to drive her home. After the car arrived, Bowman got in. The driver was described as a young African-American man. Less than two blocks from her apartment, she was attacked by the cabbie, and stabbed in the throat seven times. She died shortly after the police arrived, but witnesses managed to describe the criminal and even write down his license plate. However, due to her age and the fact that the culprit had used a knife, Bowman was initially dropped from the list of victims, but later re-included. During the investigation, it was established that the perpetrator was travelling in a taxi belonging to the Yellow Cab Company, number 186, which was reported stolen to the police a few hours before Bowman's murder. At age 31, she was the youngest of the killer's victims. On October 11th, the newly-dubbed \\"Cincinnati Strangler\\" killed 51-year-old Alice Hochhausen. Nine days later, on October 20th, 61-year-old Rose Winstsel was found beaten and strangled in her apartment. On December 9th, the criminal attacked 81-year-old Lula Kerrick in the elevator of her downtown apartment building, during which he beat and strangled her with one of her own stockings. Investigation The series of murders caused a moral panic among the Cincinnati population, as a result of which the city recorded a colossal increase in sales of weapons and doorlocks, the level of confidence among girls and women dropped sharply, and the Cincinnati police announced that a special operation to capture the perpetrator. On December 9, 1966, after the murder of Kerrick, 22-year-old Sandra Chapas contacted the police, claiming that a few hours before the Kerrick killing, she was followed by a suspicion black man to her car, who promptly attempted to rape her on the stairwell of her apartment, but was thankfully saved by her neighbor. Chapas and a few other witnesses remembered the license plate of the car which the offender was driving and passed it on to the police. On that same day, the car's owner, 29-year-old Posteal Laskey Jr., a laborer, was arrested. Laskey was living with his mother and in his free time tried to build a career as a musician, acting as a guitarist in a little-known group. Shortly before his arrest, he had left his house and rented an apartment in another part of the city, where he was living with a friend. After digging into his past, police discovered that Laskey had been prosecuted for attacking a woman in 1965, and sentenced to three years' probation in October 1965. It was also revealed that Laskey worked as a taxi driver for the Yellow Cab Company from July to December 1962, when all cars used identical ignition keys, and he drove number 186. The company management told the police that after his dismissal, Posteal pocketed the ignition key and a number of other items that he was supposed to hand over. On the night of August 13, 1966, and on the following morning, after the numbered 186 cab was stolen, somebody answered the dispatcher's calls, and then picked up Barbara Bowman. After surveying visitors to the bar, witnesses told that they had seen Bowman leaving and entering into a taxi. After being presented with photos of the suspect, they identified Posteal Laskey as the driver, and Barbara's likely murderer. After the arrest, 69-year-old Delle Ernst contacted the police, proclaiming that Laskey had robbed her on October 4, 1966. A similar testimony was given by Virginia Hinners, who said that Posteal had robbed her on September 21st that same year. Aftermath Based on the circumstantial evidence and testimony, in April 1967, Posteal Laskey Jr. was convicted of killing Barbara Bowmand and was sentenced to death in the electric chair. The date of his execution was set for July 8, 1968, but by that time his lawyers appealed the verdict, citing the fact that the presumption of his innocence was violated when the Posteal was vilified by the prosecutor's office and the media as the infamous serial killer, which they failed to prove in court. The intense publicity surrounding the case had prevented their client from receiving a fair trial, but the court rejected the appeal, stating that there was no racial or social prejudice in the decision. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court, in June 1972, commuted Laskey's sentence to life imprisonment with a chance of parole. For the rest of his life, Laskey was moved around various penitentiaries in the state. He applied for parole on several occassions, but was denied each time. In February 2007, the 69-year-old was once again denied parole and banned him from applying until 2017. However, he died on May 29, 2007, after spending more than 40 years behind bars.

He published an acclaimed edition of Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh's Leabhar na nGenealach in 2004. He was admitted to the Royal Irish Academy in 2009. Life and career A native of Knock, County Mayo, √ì Mura√≠le attended National University of Ireland, Maynooth where he was a postgraduate student enrolled for a PhD. He was Placenames Officer with the Ordnance Survey of Ireland 1972‚Äì1993. He was Reader in Irish and Celtic Studies at Queen's University Belfast to 2004 and Senior Lecturer at the Department of Irish, National University of Ireland, Galway from 2005‚Äì2014. He is married to Tresa N√≠ Chian√°in and has two children. He lives in Dublin. √ì Mura√≠le and Mac Fhirbhisigh In 1971, at the suggestion of Tom√°s √ì Fiaich, then Professor of Modern History at Maynooth, √ì Mura√≠le began work on Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh's Leabhar na nGenealach. This was continued under the direction of Professor of Old and Middle Irish P√°draig √ì Fiannachta. Upon joining the Placenames Branch of the Ordnance Survey in late 1972, √ì Mura√≠le had already translated over one hundred pages, albeit from Eugene O'Curry's copy. Access to the autograph of Leabhar na nGenealach however remained difficult; only on 28 August 1979, at University College Dublin's new home of Belfield, was he able to begin transcription of the original, which he finished on 10 September 1981. It had taken a total of 88 sessions in UCD Special Collections Reading Room. Typing began in late 1982 and was complete by 4 September 1984. By early 1988, after much tedious work, the Cumire was also successfully in transcript. His PhD dissertation, submitted in September 1991 on the life, background and work of Mac Fhirbhisigh, was fully two volumes, totalling 1,086 pages. Early in 1998, √ì Mura√≠le was approached by fellow Mayoman, √âamonn de B√∫rca, with an offer to publish his edition of Leabhar na nGenealach. De Burca insisted on a full translation of the text into English (with the original Irish text on the facing page) in opposition to √ì Mura√≠le's wish to publish with Irish text only. De B√∫rca prevailed, and the book, titled The Great Book of Irish Genealogies, was published in five volumes (vols. IV and V consisting of indices alone) in 2004, with 3,100 pages in a full buckram gilt presentation box. It remains √ì Mura√≠le's unique contribution to Irish scholarship.

Its status now has been changed to attached department. Initially it was aimed at creating a synergy between national and provincial governments and institutions for using Urdu. However, with time, it expanded its horizons to include standardisation and linguistic aspects such as orthography and lexicography. It also provides recommendations for maximizing use of the language in all walks of life. In this respect, large amounts of legal and scientific documents are translated from English and other languages for publication into Urdu. These efforts have resulted in greater awareness of the language's potential as well as its localisation.Rahman (2004) Recently, the status and name of organization has been changed from National Language Authority to National Language Promotion Department. The National Language Promotion Department is now an attached department of Ministry of National Heritage & Integration. Renowned Short-Story Writer and Educationist Dr. Anwaar Ahmad was the last Chairman of the NLA, as the post has been converted to Director General (D.G).  Objectives  The institution aims to facilitate the use and adoption of Urdu language in grammical Persian through publications and other reading materials for individuals and organisations. It also provides linkages for cooperation and collaboration among various academic, research and educational institutions for use of Urdu language and native languages of the country. Over the years efforts have also been made to promote and facilitate Urdu as an official and business language; as a Medium of instruction; and as a medium of expression in the country. Moreover, the development of Urdu software is also encouraged at various levels to become more distant from Hindustani. Muqtadra (2002)  Organisation  The organisational structure consists of six divisions that include: Dictionary section (Darul Lughaat), Translations section (Darul Tarjuma), Literature section (Darul Tasneef), and Publications section (Darul Isha‚Äôat) respectively. There is also a department of Urdu Informatics (ÿßÿ±ÿØŸà ÿßÿ∑ŸÑÿßÿπ€åÿßÿ™) to carry out research in developing the suitable hardware and software for the use of language in electronic media. A dedicated library contains extensive resources on Urdu, and issues regular Urdu Bulletins.Ahmed(1990), pp. 1-3  Key activities  Urdu keyboard layout The institution has published a wide range of general, scientific and technical dictionaries and an Urdu Thesaurus. Especially, the Qaumi English-Urdu Dictionary has been based on Webster's Dictionary. A vast amount of literature has also been produced to encourage reading habits among children. In 1980, the Authority standardisedSajjad (1999) the Urdu keyboard layoutAziz (1987) for typewriters based on Naskh script. Later on, with the arrival of the digital age, the layout was improved for teleprinters and Information processing.Afzal (1997) Subsequently, in 1998 efforts were initiated to standardize Urdu encoding, which resulted in the formation of Urdu Zabta Takhti (ÿßÿ±ÿØŸà ÿ∂ÿßÿ®ÿ∑€Å ÿ™ÿÆÿ™€å) (UZT). This development was inline with the efforts to cope with the emerging demands of Urdu applications from word processing to mega-scale projects such as Computerised National Identity Cards by NADRA and a number of E-Governance initiatives by the national government. In July 2000, UZT 1.01 was standardised for all kinds of electronic computing, communications, and storage.Afzal and Hussain (2002) Based on this version, Urdu language support was incorporated into the Versions 3.1 and 4.0 of Unicode. Localization of Microsoft applications like Windows and Office in Urdu is also done by then NLA, now NLPD.

Background In 1986, the U.S. Customs Service imposed a drug testing program for \\"employees seeking transfer or promotion to positions having direct involvement in drug interdiction,\\" required to carry firearms, or have access to classified information. The National Treasury Employees Union sued and alleged that the program was violative of the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable search and seizure.

The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals ruling with regard to positions involving drug interdiction and firearms. The ruling for classified information was held over, as the Supreme Court determined that the U.S. Customs Service too broadly included employee groups who would not generally have access to high levels of classified information.

The ruling for classified information was held over, as the Supreme Court determined that the U.S. Customs Service too broadly included employee groups who would not generally have access to high levels of classified information.

Where before she was bubbly, cheerful and unashamedly quirky, she is now a shadow of her former self, appearing tired and withdrawn, living in a shared flat in London and working as a waitress in a caf√© to make ends meet. She avoids social contact with her co-workers and flatmates, and refuses to take drugs when offered them (as opposed to her affinity towards them in the past), and secludes herself in her room. Character history = Series 1 = At the beginning of the first series, Cassie is recently discharged from hospital after a suicide attempt off-screen. Her friend Michelle Richardson (April Pearson) arranges for her to take Sid Jenkins' (Mike Bailey) virginity at a party. The two talk and even briefly kiss, although Cassie reveals she took a \\"shit load\\" of pills and passes out. The gang leave the party in order to get her to the hospital, although as soon as Tony parks up, she regains consciousness. Cassie's central episode develops her eating disorder; her sexually-stimulated parents are introduced, who are usually too busy having sex in order to pay attention to her issues. She informs them that it is her last clinic day. She is then picked up by the clinic taxi driver, Allan, with whom she seems to have a close relationship, and he promises not to tell anyone Cassie has put weights in her underwear in order to fool the clinic into thinking she has gained weight. She is sent to her final group therapy, where fellow patient Madison Twatter tells the group about a student named Sid Jenkins who has not paid him back for the drugs he supplied Sid with. In college, Cassie runs into Sid at the canteen, and they talk. Having developed a crush on him on the previous episode, she reveals to him how she is able to get away with hiding the fact that she is not eating, but he is not impressed with it, and protests. When she states that \\"no-one cares,\\" he responds \\"I care.\\" Cassie also warns Sid that Mad also has his ID card. Throughout the episode, Cassie keeps seeing the word 'EAT!' on post-it notes, the plate of chips that Sid gives her and on text messages. This is implied to be a hallucination as when she asks Sid about it (assuming he sent the texts), Sid proves that he has not texted her. Cassie then calls Allan. She tells him someone keeps telling her to eat, and he suggests she is imagining the texts because she is mentally sending them to herself, because she wants to eat. Cassie gives in and eats a burger as the episode closes. In \\"Chris\\", Cassie gives Sid more hints about her affection towards him and asks him on a date. However, in \\"Sid\\", he is grounded so Cassie tells him she will come over to his house. However, she is stood up due to Tony Stonem (Nicholas Hoult) convincing Sid to accompany him and Michelle at his choir performance, and when Sid admits he was with Michelle, Cassie lashes out at him. Later on she attempts suicide by intaking a large amount of pills mixed with vodka. When Sid tries to visit her in hospital, Jal Fazer (Larissa Wilson) forces him to leave. In \\"Michelle\\", Sid visits rehab in order to make amends with Cassie and she accepts his apology, but Sid is dismayed when she reveals has a boyfriend, Simon (James Buckley). In \\"Effy\\", Sid calls her late at night after a fight with Tony and the two kiss. However, Sid stands her up again to rescue Tony and his sister Effy (Kaya Scodelario) from an overdose. In the finale, her parents move with her to Elgin, Scotland. She postpones her plans after discovering Sid loves her through a letter he wrote at the beginning of the episode, and the series ends with the pair holding hands on the same park bench Cassie attempted suicide on. It is implied that Sid lost his virginity to her at the start of the second series. = Series 2 = In the second series, Cassie is in a long-distance relationship with Sid; the relationship becomes strained when Sid begins to think Cassie has been unfaithful. He angrily accuses her of cheating, mistaking her closeness with her gay Scottish friend. Sid smashes his laptop in frustration and it is left ambiguous whether they have broken up or not, though the next morning, Cassie has blocked Sid's mobile number. After Sid's father Mark (Peter Capaldi) dies, Sid travels to Scotland to meet her as Cassie simultaneously travels back to Bristol to meet Sid. Frustrated at Cassie's disappearance and emotionally confused by his father's death, Sid begins a relationship with Michelle in the latter's central episode, after she finds him at the edge of a cliff, possibly to attempt suicide. However, Cassie catches them kissing in Sid's bedroom and keeps a cool head, although it is shown to have a huge impact on her in the next few episodes. As a result of Sid's relationship with Michelle, Cassie becomes extremely promiscuous (with men and women) and mentally unstable: in \\"Chris\\", her actions result in her roommate Chris Miles (Joe Dempsie) losing his job as a junior property salesman and cause a significant amount of tension between him and his girlfriend Jal Fazer (Larissa Wilson) after Angie, Chris' ex-girlfriend and psychology teacher returns to Bristol; and in \\"Effy\\", she attributes her addiction to \\"mindless sex\\" to her failed relationship with Sid. After Sid becomes aware of her actions, he confronts her about her promiscuity, apologises for dating Michelle, and tells her he loves her. They reconcile. Cassie's subplot in Chris' last three episodes of series 2 focuses on her friendship with him. She witnesses Chris suffering from two subarachnoid haemorrhages, the second fatal, taking his life in Cassie's central episode. She is traumatized and flees to New York City. There, she meets a kind young Iowan named Adam (Stephen Michael Kane), with whom she forms a strong platonic friendship when he offers her a place to stay in his apartment. He later leaves the apartment to find his ex-girlfriend at Cassie's suggestion and, distraught, Cassie gets a job as a waitress at Adam's old diner in Manhattan. The ultimate scene of the second series depicts Sid wandering through Times Square looking for her and ends with him turning to look inside the diner. = Series 6 = Cassie is briefly referred to by Doug in series 6 when he mentions to Liv that he once danced for a girl to help her get through an exam, referring to Cassie's centric episode in the second series. However he does not mention her by name. = Series 7 = Cassie is revisited five years later in series 7 in a feature-length episode, Pure. It is revealed that Sid did indeed find her and that the pair spent several years travelling around America, although she does not mention him by name. After ending the relationship, she moved back to England, though she moves into a shared flat in London instead of heading back to her hometown. She works as a waitress in a caf√©, and later discovers a website titled 'Oblivion', filled with candid shots of her.

He shot images from gas balloons, ships masts, tall buildings and even a home-made pole. He scaled buildings, hung from self-made slings, and scaled dangerous heights to capture his unique images.  Early life  Born to a farming family in Virden, Illinois, Vaniman was the eldest of four sons and attended Valparaiso University in Indiana and Chicago.  Career  = Photography = Vaniman's photographic career began in Hawaii in 1901, and ended some time in 1904. He spent over a year photographing Australia and New Zealand on behalf of the Oceanic Steamship Company, creating promotional images for the company. During this time the New Zealand Government also commissioned some panoramic images. Beginning in 1903, he spent over a year photographing Sydney and the surrounding areas. It was during this time that he created his best known work, the panorama of Sydney, shot from a hot air balloon he had specially imported from the United States. Vaniman is best known for his images of Hawaii, Australia, and New Zealand. = Aerial exploration = The airship Akron Some time around 1904, he gave up photography and took up exploration. This included attempts at the North Pole and the Trans-Atlantic crossing ‚Äì both attempted in Walter Wellman's airship . At the first attempt to cross the Atlantic in 1910, Vaniman sent one of the first aerial radio transmissions when he urged the launch boat to \\"come and get this goddam cat!\\" The cat had caused such a ruckus that it had to be placed inside a gunny sack and suspended below the airship's gondola.\\"Kiddo, the airship cat\\" Purr'n'Fur\\"‚ÄúRoy, come and get this goddamn cat‚Äù was the first ever in-flight radio transmission\\"Copping, Jasper. \\"America the airship: the first transatlantic crossing\\" The Daily Telegraph, 13 October 2010.

They anticipated a five-day crossing, but the airship's motor failed after 38 hours, leaving it adrift until it was rescued two days later by the , a passing Royal Mail steamship.  Death  Vaniman lost his life during his second attempt at a trans-Atlantic airship crossing when his airship, the Akron, exploded off the New Jersey shore on July 2, 1912. Filled with 11,300 cubic meters of hydrogen gas, his was the first American airship that could compare to the better known European manufactured models.\\"The Vaniman Balloon\\" Popular Mechancs, December 1911, p. 810. Vaniman and his crew of four were killed just minutes after the Akron became airborne, when it suddenly exploded in front of the gathered crowd near Atlantic City, and the gondola plunged into an inlet. The other victims were his brother, Calvin Vaniman, Fred Elmer, George Bourtillion, and Walter Guest. Subsequent investigation indicated that internal pressure had split the envelope.Dilks, John.

He was born in Vefsn and grew up near Mosj√∏en, where he received his first piano lessons. He came to Christiania (Oslo) in 1904 to study at the conservatory there, and he continued taking lessons with Catharinus Elling, Iver Holter and others until he went to Berlin in 1915 for further studies. In 1920, he went for a study trip to Paris, and here Stravinsky‚Äôs music came to make a huge impression on him. In addition he met Fartein Valen, which inspired him to start studying dissonant counterpoint. Later, in 1933 and 1935, he spent short periods abroad for further studies. Monrad Johansen‚Äôs study time was extraordinary diverse, and his development was affected by this. It is difficult to categorise his style, with all the different influences that he went through. Before Berlin, he was within the conservative late romanticism, clearly influenced by Edvard Grieg. After Berlin, under the influence of Alf Hurum, he started studying the French Impressionist music, and around 1920 this style is apparent in his music. This was also a very productive period. At the same time, he was influenced by the nationalistic style. He several times used lyrics from Norse literature or Norwegian folk stories/songs, but seldom melodies. He did, however, arrange some folk tunes for piano (opus 9 and 10). Monrad Johansen‚Äôs most famous piece is Voluspaa op. 15 (1926). It was composed for soloists/vocals, choir and orchestra, and it is based on the poem Voluspaa, from the Edda. This piece and the Nordlands Trompet op. 13, are the most pure nationalistic of Monrad Johansen‚Äôs works, and often called a Norwegian impressionism. Regarding sound, they are related to impressionism, but have structures with more polyphonic features than what was common in f. ex. Debussy‚Äôs impressionistic pieces. The basis for the music, which is clearly tonal, has modal features. Dorian, Phrygian and Lydian scales are often apparent. Even though Monrad Johansen had achieved significant recognition with these pieces, it was clear to him that the style was a dead-end, and the following pieces show a composer on a stylistic search. Then, during the studies in 1933 and 1935, he turned more into a neo-classical direction, more polyphonic, more clear tonality, classical forms ‚Äì also more clear sound and colours, and fewer dissonances than in the 1930s. Monrad Johansen had a very central position in Norwegian music life in the 1920s and 1930s. He was the leading person within the musical nationalism around 1925, after having achieved great recognition with the 7 songs to old Norwegian folk stories (opus 6) and the piece for male choir, Draumkvedet, opus 7. This position was strengthened when he got an artist scholarship (from 1925 to 1945). During the German occupation of Norway in the course of World War II, Johansen joined the fascist party Nasjonal Samling and supported the collaborationist government of Vidkun Quisling,Jim Samson.

In 1980, the Shrine was enlarged to honor those Virginians killed in action in the Vietnam War. In 1996, the names of Virginians killed in action during Desert Storm/Desert Shield were added. Today, there are nearly 12,000 Virginians whose names are engraved on the Shrine of Memory's glass and stone walls. Reflecting the different character of war today, Virginia has created a special Memorial Shrine to honor the over 250 Virginians killed in the Global War on Terrorism. The Virginians at War documentary video series, combined with other efforts, significantly increased the War Memorial's public image in the local region and throughout the Commonwealth, and highlighted the message of the \\"Price of Freedom\\". The Memorial added staff and volunteers to meet the increasing demand for its educational offerings and to assist with increased visitors to the Memorial. With over 21,000 people from 45 states and 21 countries visiting the War Memorial in 2008, the facilities were stretched to the breaking point. Some groups would be turned away and individual visitors could not be provided educational support because the single auditorium could not support multiple groups for education and meetings. The Memorial is also used by active military personnel for events such as homecomings, re-enlistments, and promotions. To alleviate the increasing demand on the facilities, an education center was planned to expand the educational opportunities and outreach for students and visitors, and to provide adequate visitor services. A bold design was created to add an 18,000 square foot education center that would provide the needed space to accommodate multiple groups for educational and patriotic programs as well as the casual tourist who is exploring one of Virginia's treasures.  Mission  The Virginia War Memorial is the Commonwealth of Virginia's monument to honor the memory of Virginia's men and women who demonstrated a willingness to serve and fight to defend our way of life from World War II to the present; and through its Education Center, serves as the Center of Excellence for the Commonwealth in education of Virginian's experience of war from the birth of our nation to the present. In its educational mission, the Virginia War Memorial will project a variety of internal and outreach programs, artifacts, research materials, Virginians at War documentaries, exhibitions, seminars, and ceremonies will be used to instill a living memorial to all citizens and citizen-warriors of the nation's commitment to freedom. \\"Honoring our Veterans, Preserving our History, Educating our Youth, and Inspiring Patriotism in All.\\" Paul and Phyllis Galanti Education Center In October 2007, the Memorial Trustees and Directors announced the Center would be named for two American heroes, Paul and Phyllis Galanti. Each has served the United States beyond the call of duty during and since the Vietnam War. By educating this and future generations, the Commonwealth and its citizens have created a lasting tribute to the state's sons and daughters who have served our great country. The Paul and Phyllis Galanti Education Center intends that their sacrifice and service protecting ours and others freedoms will never be forgotten. Visiting Virginia War Memorial Visiting Virginia War Memorial can be breathtaking. As you walked through the front doors you see a display cabinet full of battle coins in the memory of Claiborne G. Thomasson for his dedication and leadership in United States Air Force 1963-1969. As you are looking around you will see a room with displays from all the wars. There is display information for the American Revolution War, Mexican War, American Civil War, Spanish American War, World War I, and World War II, Korean War, and Vietnam War. Each one had a time line from when it started and major events in between, and when it ended. The set-up is very beautiful and very informative. There are also words hanging from the ceiling, which read: Sacrifice, Integrity, Discipline, Patriotism, Duty, Courage, and Loyalty. Those are all the qualities that you need to be a part of the army. Each word had the definition behind it. There are also small displays of each war with uniforms and weapons and information talking about the war. There is a bulletin that was letters from the battlefield; soldiers from every conflict feel a mixture of emotions while far away from their loved ones. Reading one of the letters and it said; his name was Mike and he was writing a letter to his mom, dad and Erin. He basically was saying how God was protecting him and his unit. They didn‚Äôt have major injuries, and he also said he prays that the war comes to an end soon so he can get out of that miserable place and come back home to his family. It was very heart felt. There were many more letters on the wall. You can also go outside to see the Veterans Impact Project, which was a sculpture of various items that were symbolic to veterans and community members. The objects were cast into rubber, creating a wall of clay. The sculpture was molded into three sections and in front of them were honored veterans panels, with their names, rank, branch and years they served. There is a huge wall with writing on it. It was names of soldiers that gave their lives in World War II, Persian Gulf, Vietnam and Korea. Then is also a huge statue of a lady name Memory. There is also a theater called the Reynolds Theater where you can watch information about the wars. They had a conference room, which was called Darrell J. Schumann. They had a Research Library, a display of guns and uniforms from the National Guard in World War I. They also had a piece of the West Wall of the Pentagon. On September 11, 2001, five terrorists hijacked American Airlines Flight 77 and intentionally crashed the plan into the west wall of the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, at 9:37a.m. All sixty-four persons on the flight and 125 persons at the Pentagon were killed. The artifact is a section of the wall from the crash site. The damaged sections of the Pentagon were rebuilt and restored in 2002. The exhibit honors and remembers those Americans. The next room which was the Freedom Hall, which has the Wall of Honor; Virginia‚Äôs Heroes of the Global War on Terrorism. It had their pictures, rank, where they are from, where they served. The room is filled with a lot of pictures. It also has a display of Women in Naval Aviation, there were pictures and uniforms and helmets. They were talking about Kathy Purdy Owens and Marti Bissell. So, there is one more thing that is very interesting. It was called Russell‚Äôs Flight, which they had and Airplane on display in the ceiling with a little man on the back of it. Russell served in the Army Air Forces April 17, 1943. He was flying when he received a direct hit from ant-aircraft fire. The pilot ordered all the crewmen to bail out of the damaged Wabbits Twacks. Russell found that his escape door jammed and returned to the tail of the plane to release the tail gun dome. He climbed on the rear wing and held tight, and then he let go. Tumbling through space and releasing his chute. He fell backward and the impact broke his back. He was captured by the German soldiers and spent 11 months in the German Prisoner of War camp. On his 95th birthday the Virginia War Memorial saluted Russell Scott for his service, and years of being a volunteer at the Memorial. Still to this day, he comes every Wednesday and volunteer at the Virginia War Memorial.

He is known in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Although he was born in Beirut, Aractingi is Franco-Lebanese. Early life Born in a war-ridden country, Aractingi was raised in Beirut. At the age of 8, his father gave him his first camera. He lived on the demarcation line, at the heart of the action, so he put his photography skills to the test and started capturing scenes through his lens that went on to be published in various international news publications. Around that time, film was not yet a discipline taught in schools. However, Aractingi was not discouraged by this and decided to teach himself. At the age of 20, he filmed his first war documentary, in his hometown, Beirut. Recognizing his interest in the audiovisual world, he moved to Paris in 1989, where he continued writing, directing and occasionally producing over 40 documentaries and short films in the following years. He shot most of his works in various countries such as Egypt, France, Mongolia, Morocco, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and Tunisia, among other locations. Achievements In the early 1980s and with no available audio-visual programs in a war-ridden country, Aractingi taught himself the art of filmmaking. Two of his films ‚ÄúBosta‚Äù and ‚ÄúUnder the Bombs‚Äù were the only Lebanese entries in the 2006 and 2008 Oscar ceremonies, respectively. His other releases have been praised and awarded over 40 times at various international festivals, in Venice, Dubai, Thessaloniki, Rotterdam, and at the Sundance Film Festival, among other events in the film industry. With his passion for the arts and dedication to defending the Lebanese Film Industry, Aractingi is also the co-founder of the Lebanese Cinema Foundation (FLC) and the vice-chairman of the Beirut Screen Institute committee. In 2018, Aractingi was appointed Chevalier de l‚ÄôOrdre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Ministry of Culture. Documentaries(1984‚Äì2005) At the age of 25, Aractingi left for Paris, France. He dedicated the following 12 years of his career to directing, producing and co-producing over 40 short-films and documentaries, including ‚ÄúVol Libre au Liban‚Äù in 1991 that won the Best Short Film Award at the Saint-Hilary Film Festival; ‚ÄúPar le Regard des Meres‚Äù in 1992 that competed in the ‚ÄúVision du reel‚Äù, Nyons Film Festival and ‚ÄúBeyrouth de Pierre et de M√©moires in 1992 that won the gold medal of the games of La Francophonie. In 1995, he also released ‚ÄúLe R√™ve de l‚ÄôEnfant Acrobat‚Äù and it won the Grand Jury Prize at the Beirut Film Festival. Feature films (2005‚Äìpresent) In 2005, Philippe Aractingi released his first feature film ‚ÄúBosta‚Äù. The film was critically acclaimed and broke audience records in Lebanon with more than 140,000 box office admissions. 100% Produced and financed by Lebanese contributors, this playful and realistic musical breaks the traditional depiction of war in films. ‚ÄúBosta‚Äù also went on to reconcile the Lebanese public with the cinema and opened the door to a new generation of Lebanese films. The film received eight awards including Best Screenplay at the Carthage Film Festival (JCC), the Golden Murex in Beirut in 2006, and the Best First Work Award at the Arab Film Festival in Rotterdam. In 2006, when another war broke out in Lebanon, Philippe Aractingi was driven to relate the story through the eyes of two fictional characters, filmed at the very heart of the drama. That‚Äôs when he filmed ‚ÄúUnder the Bombs‚Äù, which was later released in 2008. The story accompanies two professional actors throughout the turmoil and they later come face to face with real players who partook in the 2006 Lebanese-Israeli war. ‚ÄúUnder The Bombs‚Äù was distributed in 30 countries and was nominated at the Venice, BAFTA, Dubai and at the Sundance Film Festival. It also won 23 awards, including the Best Actress Award and the Golden Muhr at the International Film Festival. The Audience Award at the Dubai Film Festival (DIFF); the Best Music and the Jury's Choice at the Luchon Festival in 2008, the Netpac and Critic's Awards in Antalya in 2007 and the Fipresci Prize at the Bratislava International Film Festival. Under the Bombs and Bosta were selected to represent Lebanon at the Oscars in 2006 and 2009. In 2014, Philippe Aractingi went on a limb and decided to write and produce an autobiography, ‚ÄúHeritages‚Äù. This autobiography was a revamped documentary with a hint of fiction that helped Aractingi tell his story. It recounted the various exiles that he and his family had to go through over the past 4 generations, summing up to 100 years of history. The film was nominated at the Dubai International Film Festival (DIFF), the Thessaloniki International Film Festival, and the FIPA, International Festival of Audio Visual Programs, the film is currently a subject of study in more than 30 schools and universities around the world including Boston University. In 2017, Aractingi released ‚ÄúListen‚Äù. The film was about a modern-day love story that defied the well- defined social norms. ‚ÄúListen‚Äù is a story of a sound engineer meets and falls in love with a strong and free-spirited girl who suddenly slips away in a coma. It is a story that deals with the emancipation of women in the Middle East nowadays. It is a journey through sound and the importance of hearing. When it aired for the first time at the Dubai International Film Festival (DIFF), \\"Listen\\" moved and shocked audiences. PG 18 in Lebanon, the authorities prohibited its distribution in the rest of the Arab world but the film still went on to win the Best Sound, Best Picture and Best Director awards at the Lebanese Movie Awards (LMA) and represented Lebanon at the Golden Globes in 2017. Production house In 1989, Aractingi founded his own production company, Fantascope, which allowed him to direct his feature films in a country where cinema was virtually non-existent. Fantascope Production has produced to date more than a hundred films broadcast on international TV channels such as the Discovery Channel, France 2, France 3, or Arte. Aractingi also produces many films on commission. Among them are films for the Museum of the American University of Beirut's 150th Anniversary, the Museum of the Central Bank of Lebanon and the in-flight safety regulations instructions for Lebanon‚Äôs Middle East Airlines (MEA) The Museum of Ksara wine in the Bekaa valley. In 2019, he also directed \\"Sur les pas du Christ\\" (‚ÄúOn The Footsteps of Christ‚Äù), a film coproduced with the Maronite Foundation. The film retraces the journey of Jesus Christ in southern Lebanon. Photography and videography From the age of 8, Philippe Aractingi gets behind the camera. When the war broke out, he went out on the streets to capture the scenes. Horrified by what he saw, Aractingi decided to stop taking pictures for quite some time. In 2010, he finally decided to get back behind the camera and develops a series for an exhibit in Paris. The exhibit ‚ÄúNuit sur Beyrouth‚Äù displayed a wide array of shots of Beirut by night. Some of the shots also showed a patchwork of color where the city could be seen, fully lit up on one side but on the other side, it was overcome by darkness due to its infamously frequent power cuts. His second exhibit ‚ÄúObsession‚Äù took place in Beirut in 2018 and depicted the city‚Äôs evolution over time. On one hand, you can clearly see the peaceful care-free days before the war but on the other hand, you can also see how the city was ravaged and disfigured by the war and how today, it‚Äôs almost unrecognizable and lies bare for all to see. The exhibition was accompanied by an installation called ‚ÄúBeirut Through Time‚Äù. The installation was a setup of three screens showing the city of Beirut from three different perspectives each showing a picture of the same place in different times and stages; life, death and afterlife.

An open conference is a conference that is open to the general public (usually at no cost) and encourages or requires participants to relax or eliminate intellectual property restrictions on ideas generated and presentations delivered during the conference. Presenters often make presentations and materials available to the public for free access and use, for example through the use of a Creative Commons non-commercial attribution license. Open conference organizers seek to open access to the conference for attendees by elimination of cost (relying on community support and sponsorships), they also provide community access to archived presentations and discussions through similar licensing agreements. Additionally, attendees are encouraged to become participants in a collaborative community that supports and grows the conference‚Äîeven to derive new open conferences.

This image shows it in the safe, scrammed, state. The Lady Godiva device was an unshielded, pulsed nuclear reactor originally situated at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), near Santa Fe, New Mexico. It was one of a number of criticality devices within Technical Area 18 (TA-18). Specifically, it was used to produce bursts of neutrons and gamma rays for irradiating test samples, and inspired development of Godiva-like reactors. The radiation source within the Godiva device was a fissile metallic mass (usually highly enriched 235U),McLaughlin et al. page 109, \\"93%\\" about in diameter. This was located at the top of a high metal tower. The burst of radiation was produced when a piston of fissile material was quickly inserted into and extracted from a cavity within the larger fissile mass. During the time these two masses were combined, they formed a critical mass and a nuclear chain reaction was briefly sustained.Garcia page 1 Godiva's design was inspired by a self terminating property discovered when incorrectly experimenting with the Jemima device in 1952. Jemima operated by remotely lifting one stack of enriched uranium-235 disks up towards another, fixed, stack. On 18 April 1952, due to a miscalculation, Jemima was assembled with too many disks; this caused an excursion of 1.5 x 1016 fissions‚Äîan automatic scram‚Äîbut no damage. On 3 February 1954 and 12 February 1957, accidental criticality excursions occurred causing damage to the device, but only insignificant exposures to personnel. This original Godiva device, known as Lady Godiva, was irreparable after the second accident and was replaced by the Godiva II.McLaughlin et al. pages 78, 80-83. \\"Jemima ... apparent self terminating property of this excursion stimulated study with Lady Godiva,46,47,48\\" Godiva II A cylindrical wire cage encloses the spherical uranium mass at the top of this image of Godiva II. Godiva II was constructed inside a concrete building with walls and roof in a canyon a quarter-mile (400 m) away from the control room.Engelke pages 3-4 In 1959, Los Alamos agreed to make Godiva II available to DOD contractors free of charge for 2 days each month, acknowledging its unique facility for radiation tests.Zipprich, L.J. Godiva's success in creating intense bursts spurred development of similar pulsed reactors, which also suffered accidental excursions, for example: 28 May 1965 at the White Sands Missile Range (parts were thrown );McLaughlin et al. page 86, \\"Unreflected uranium‚Äìmolybdenum metal fast burst reactor\\" and 6 September 1968 at the Aberdeen Proving Ground (middle melted, disks warped and bolts stretched).Kazi et al., \\"center third of the safety block was melted\\" In December 2002, the U.S. Department of Energy announced it was to move its TA-18 testing equipment including the Godiva burst machine from the LANL to the Device Assembly Facility (DAF) at the Nevada Test Site (NTS).U.S. Department of Energy page 1 See also *Flattop (critical assembly) Notes References  id=UCRL-TR-214269 McLaughlin et al. ** LA-13638 covers United States, Russia, United Kingdom, and Japan, and is also available here and at this page, which also tries to track down documents referenced in the report. * U.S. Department of Energy. * OSTI ID: 4268715 External links * Nuclear reactors Nuclear research reactors Los Alamos National Laboratory Nevada Test Site Nuclear accidents and incidents in the United States ","title":"Godiva device"},{"id":"9656305","text":"Jules Maxwell (born October 28, 1965 in Bangor, Northern Ireland) is a songwriter, and composer. He is currently keyboard player for Dead Can Dance. His composition work for dance and theatre draws upon minimalism and is often recorded, incorporating strong melodic montages of sampled sound influenced by the work of Gavin Bryars. Queen's University, Belfast Jules Maxwell‚Äôs career in music began in rather unlikely circumstances. As a politics undergraduate at Queen's University in Belfast he hooked up with the drama society and began composing music for their productions. Up to that point he had no intention of working professionally as a musician. Subsequently, however, this unlikely group of actors, writers, directors and musicians went on to form Tinderbox Theatre Company. Early years From 1988 through to 2002 Maxwell composed for fifteen of the first Tinderbox shows. These included Lynne Parker‚Äôs production of Catchpenny Twist by Stewart Parker, Gary Mitchell‚Äôs ‚ÄúIndependent Voice‚Äù, Marie Jones ‚ÄúRuby‚Äù and Tim Loane‚Äôs ‚ÄúCaught Red Handed‚Äù. One thing led to another and during this period he also began picking up work as a composer for contemporary dance, working for 4 seasons with Limerick based Daghdha Dance Company. He moved from Belfast to Dublin in 1994 and forged an exciting relationship with fledgling animation house Moving Still with whom he collaborated on 2 series for television: ‚ÄúRi Ra‚Äù was an Irish language programme for RT√â/UTV, and ‚ÄúStop, Look, Listen, Animals‚Äù was a 6-part series for Channel 4. 1997 marked a significant turning point in his career. He made the soundtrack for Oscar nominated short film \\"Dance Lexie Dance‚Äù directed by Tim Loane, an old college friend from Queen‚Äôs, and also collaborated with Wayne McGregor for the first time on an audacious dance project called ‚ÄúCybergeneration‚Äù for Belfast Festival.

Yet through it all Jules Maxwell‚Äôs roots are as a piano player, and he continues to play and write with various bands and artists. In Belfast he collaborated for a number of years with Brian Houston and co-produced his debut solo album Crush. He also played piano with Peacefrog, Iain Archer, Disreali Gears and with these artists over the years opened for the likes of INXS, Van Morrison, David Bowie, Elvis Costello, The Cranberries, Squeeze, Hal Ketchum, Jools Holland and Nick Lowe.

The film is based on the novel by Bernard MacLaverty, who also wrote the screenplay. Plot Lamb tells the story of a young priest, Brother Sebastian, who works in a Roman Catholic institution for troubled boys on the west coast of Ireland, referred to as \\"a finishing school for the sons of the Idle Poor\\" by its head, Brother Benedict. There, the Brothers teach boys to conform in a harsh, uncompromising regime which Brother Sebastian, whose real name is Michael Lamb, finds deeply distasteful. The Brothers teach the boys \\"a little of God and a lot of fear.\\" When his father dies, leaving him a small legacy, the tie which kept him at the home is gone and he decides to leave and take Owen Kane, a bullied, unhappy 10-year-old boy with him. His decision is also affected by the fact that he has made a vow of poverty and Brother Benedict expects him to hand his inheritance over to the Brothers. Michael has formed an attachment to Owen. He is the youngest boy there and has been in the home for two years. Brother Benedict beats him for painting graffiti on the wall outside, because it ends with the word OK ‚Äì Owen's initials ‚Äì despite knowing that it was not Owen who did it. Owen comes from a broken family and a drunken, abusive father. Michael cannot see how he will survive there and wishes to give him his freedom. He secretly leaves the school and takes Owen with him to London hoping to be the boy's saviour, although he knows he is committing a criminal act. They pass themselves off as father and son and move from hotel to hotel. Michael lets Owen smoke, play on gaming machines and takes him to a football match to see his favourite team Arsenal play, but Owen, an epileptic, has a fit. They have to slip away from the medical centre before questions are asked. Owen sometimes prattles on and on and sometimes just sits silently. Michael feels embarrassed during the silences and recognises that Owen controls the communication between them. As the days and weeks go by, Michael became more comfortable with the silences and they laugh a lot. As his money dwindles and news of the kidnapping reaches the Irish community, with Owen's picture in the newspaper, Michael finds himself running out of ideas on how to save the boy's life. About to fly back to Ireland, they come across an ex-army man called Haddock who tells them about a nearby squat and says they can move in. Michael returns to the hotel to find Owen in floods of tears, thinking Michael has left him. In an emotional scene, Michael tells Owen he loves him and man and boy hug and hold each other tight. Michael gets a job, leaving Owen at the squat, but returns to find that Haddock, who he knows is gay, is in his dressing gown, has his arm around the boy's shoulders and has been letting Owen smoke pot. Michael is worried Haddock may have molested the boy, or will try to, and decides they have to leave. The denouement of the novel is grim. Determined to save Owen from being forced to return to the home, but realising he cannot look after the boy himself, Michael drowns him in the sea during Owen's next seizure, after hearing him describe the experience of a seizure as a form of joy. Having murdered the boy, Michael tries to drown himself, but is unable to.

He also wrote regularly for Opera Quarterly, was London editor for the magazine Stereo Review, and for 30 years, beginning in 1967, was the London music critic for the International Herald Tribune. In 1964, he retired from the service and settled in London with his wife, Virginia Pleasants, a harpsichordist and fortepianist. His most famous and controversial work was his 1955 publication The Agony of Modern Music, a polemical attack on the direction taken by much of twentieth-century music and an argument in favor of jazz as the \\"true\\" master music of the time. The book stated, \\"Serious music is a dead art. The vein which for 300 years offered a seemingly inexhaustible yield of beautiful music has run out. What we know as modern music is the noise made by deluded speculators picking through its slag pile.\\" He further developed this critique of contemporary music in Death of a Music?: The Decline of the European Tradition and the Rise of Jazz (1961) and Serious Music and All That Jazz (1969). Henry Pleasants‚Äôs first and major enthusiasm, however, was the human voice. His The Great Singers: From the Dawn of Opera to Our Own Time (1966) became a standard reference work. Other books on singers and singing were The Great American Popular Singers, Opera in Crisis: Tradition, Present, Future, and The Great Tenor Tragedy: The Last Days of Adolphe Nourrit, about the nineteenth-century French singer who committed suicide after his vocal style became outdated. His article \\"Elvis Presley,\\" reprinted in Simon Firth, ed., Popular Music: Ciritical Concepts in Media and Cultural Studies, volume 3 (2004), describes in detail Elvis Presley's \\"extraordinary compass and very wide range of vocal color.\\" Henry Pleasants Lecture Series The American Institute of Musical Studies in Graz, Austria, holds an annual lecture series named in honor of Henry Pleasants, who lectured and conducted seminars on singing there for 29 years. https://books.google.com/books?id=1Y1_AwAAQBAJ&pg;=PA221&lpg;=PA221 A Dictionary for the Modern Singer, p. 221 https://aimsgraz.com/the- program/course-descriptions/#henry-pleasants-lecture-series Henry Pleasants Lecture Series at AIMS https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/13/news/obituary-henry- pleasants-89-music-critic-dies.html NY Times Jan 13, 2000 OBITUARY : Henry Pleasants, 89, Music Critic, Dies Death On January 4, 2000, Pleasants died aged 89 in a London hospital after suffering a ruptured aorta.

He is portrayed by actor Mitch Hewer. Characterisation Maxxie is portrayed as proficient at several styles of dance, including tap dance. He is also shown as being a brilliant artist, seductive, well-liked and well-adjusted. He is hinted to having many promiscuous relationships throughout the series. He is somewhat of a comedian, particularly with best friends Anwar Kharral and Chris Miles. According to a Myspace-style \\"about me\\" section on the Skins website,Channel 4 - Skins - Us - Maxxie he describes his favorite things as toast, boys, dancing, drawing, Arcade Fire and the Sistine Chapel, and he wants to meet Johnny Depp, Nigel Reo-Coker and Ron from Harry Potter. Like Anwar, Maxxie does not have an episode name to himself, instead being the centric character in \\"Maxxie & Anwar\\" and \\"Tony & Maxxie\\". Although the episode \\"Sketch\\" greatly involves him, as it is about his stalker. Character history =Series 1= In \\"Tony\\", he convinces Anwar and Chris to join him on a \\"big gay night out\\", but eventually goes to Abigail Stock's party after the night out wasn't what was expected. In \\"Maxxie and Anwar\\", on a school trip to Russia, Maxxie and his best mate Anwar face issues regarding their status as best friends, with Anwar's faith condemning homosexuality. Maxxie indicates he views Anwar as homophobic and hypocritical ‚Äì as a Muslim, Anwar dislikes gay people but at the same time has pre-marital sex, takes drugs and drinks alcohol. Maxxie then swaps rooms with Sid, so he is now sharing a room with Tony Stonem, who tries repeatedly to seduce Maxxie to 'try something new' which Maxxie refuses because of Tony's girlfriend Michelle Richardson. After his fight with Anwar (which was somewhat promoted by Tony), he is confronted by a Russian woman, who eventually invites him to her private headquarters to drink vodka after seeing his Neil Diamond t-shirt. He gets very drunk and after he tries to save Anwar from a standoff, he tries one more time to heal their friendship. In his distraught state he gives into temptation with Tony for means of comfort ‚Äì and informs Tony that he wasn't good. Unknown to them, Michelle has witnessed the entire thing. In \\"Michelle\\", Tony is seen continuing to flirt with Maxxie, and Michelle subsequently dumps Tony. Maxxie is quick to apologise to Michelle for the incident in Russia, and he is upset when she derides him as a \\"dirty little slut who fucks around with other people's boyfriends\\". Later, racked with guilt over his friends' breakup, Maxxie states in his psychology lesson that it was his fault that Tony ended up giving him head, to quote 'I lost my head and then he [Tony] gave me head', despite the fact that everything that happened had been pushed for and orchestrated by Tony. In the series 1 finale, Maxxie calls Anwar to wish him a happy birthday, however, he refuses to attend his party until Anwar tells his parents that Maxxie is gay. Anwar, desperate to see Maxxie, eventually finds him waiting outside, still refusing to go inside. Mr. Kharral eventually arrives outside, spotting Maxxie and the two talk until Anwar tells his father that Maxxie is gay. Mr. Kharral seemingly ignores Anwar until Maxxie restates it himself. Mr. Kharral then explains that there are a lot of things in the world he doesn't understand ‚Äì particularly homosexuality ‚Äì but that his faith in Allah means he believes God one day will reveal to him all he does not understand and until then, will treat Maxxie no differently. With that, Maxxie and Anwar's friendship is renewed. Maxxie and Anwar also back up Chris in the brawl later that night and in the end Maxxie happily ends up in an embrace with one of Chris' attackers who has seemingly fallen for him. =Series 2= The series two premiere episode, which is focused on Tony, introduces Maxxie's parents: Jackie (Fiona Allen) and Walter Oliver (Bill Bailey), revealing Maxxie's surname, that he has a dog called Taz and the situation with his parents. After Tony's accident in series one and his subsequent brain trauma, Maxxie, Jal Fazer and Chris are the only friends who are still there for him. His mother, who used to work as Tony's nanny, is taking on that role again. Like Maxxie, his father and even his dog dance in their spare time, although Maxxie struggles to convince his dad to let him drop his A Levels and audition for musicals in London. Though Maxxie generally comes from a stable home with loving parents, he remains subject to homophobic abuse from \\"chavs\\" on the council estate where he lives. It later turns out that one of the chavs ‚Äì Dale ‚Äì is in fact gay after tackling Maxxie to the ground and kissing him at a later opportunity. Maxxie resists at first but eventually gives in and they end up sleeping together. When Maxxie returns home the next morning, he sees a distraught Tony and comforts him. Eventually in the episode, after Walter has had much time to reflect on his relationship with his son, they agree that he will at least continue his A Levels, even if he does not join his father as a builder afterwards as Walter would prefer. At a couple of points (including having pictures taken on him), Maxxie becomes suspicious of stalking, setting up the next episode. In \\"Sketch\\", Maxxie is stalked by Sketch, a young Welsh student who cares for her ailing mother in the flat opposite Maxxie's. Sketch takes pictures of Maxxie and pins them up on a board of her room, leaves Maxxie several gifts in his locker, leaving him to wonder who they're from, makes herself appear more masculine (such as wearing male clothing and flattening her chest with a sash) to appear attractive to him, and watches him practice a performance with Michelle in a musical. Following this, in the Unseen Skins episode \\"A Cycological Romance\\", Monday: Maxxie meets a new love interest: James (played by Sean Verey), who is also gay and a cyclist. Maxxie seems very interested, leaving him a note on his bicycle. Sketch steals this note, later slashing Maxxie's tires. Tuesday: Maxxie is forced to take the bus, and so leaving a window for Sketch to approach James warning him off on the grounds that she was his ex-girlfriend and he stalks her (both lies). Wednesday: James tells Maxxie to leave him alone, only to work out Sketch was lying. The next morning (Thursday), James finds his tires slashed and is also forced to get the bus, meeting Maxxie on board. They talk and work out that this is all Sketch's work; they decide to start again. Sketch is seen outside looking in with a face of melancholy, as the two exchange names. In the television episode \\"Jal\\", Maxxie proudly introduces James to everyone at college. Sketch seems to look jealous at the pairing whilst Anwar looks uneasy. In his last episode, Maxxie and James move to London together, also being joined by Anwar, who abandons Sketch at the bus stop. =Post-Series 2= In the fourth Skins Short, which was made alongside series 4, Thomas and JJ are applying for a job at the cinema, where the latter is seen wearing Maxxie's Superman costume, a reference to the fancy-dress party scene in Sketch's episode and is later seen wearing Sketch's costume. U.S. adaption Maxxie was the only character from the original UK version who didn't appear in the American adaptation. He was replaced by Tea Marvelli, a self-proclaimed lesbian.

In 1991, he became the fourth player in the history of the Puerto Rico Baseball League to win the triple crown. Career H√©ctor Villanueva attended Cupeyville High School in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico. He later went to the University of Alabama at Birmingham because his parents insisted that he attend college. His father was a salesman and his mother Lourdes was a schoolteacher. On March 26, 1985, he was signed as a free agent by a scout from the Cubs named Joaquin Velilla. Hector married Gizelle Krebs on December 26, 1987. They have four children, Alana, Soleil, Omar, and Joshua. In 1986 he had a .318 average, with 13 home runs and 100 RBIs during his second season playing Class-A baseball for the Carolina league. He then advanced to Double-A and played in the Eastern league. Other catchers that eventually became big league players were in the Cubs system, including Joe Girardi and Rick Wrona so H√©ctor began to play mostly at first base. By 1989 he had reached Triple-A in the American Association league with a .252 batting average, 15 home runs, and 57 RBIs. During the winter he played baseball in Puerto Rico where he excelled as a player for different teams, which included, Los Cangrejeros de Santurce, Los Senadores de San Juan, and the Leones de Ponce. In 1991 he made his Major League debut for the Chicago Cubs against the St. Louis Cardinals as a pinch-hitter replacing Mark Grace. In his first at-bat, he popped up to second base. He stayed in the game playing first base and in his second at-bat he hit a two-run-homer that was estimated to be 430-feet. As a rookie for the Cubs, he hit 3 home runs in his first 6 games. After catcher Damon Berryhill returned from shoulder surgery, Villanueva became the number-three receiver on the team. He drew a cult-like following while he was in Chicago some in part was due to the comedic way Harry Carey would mispronounce his name. He ended his rookie season with a .276 average, 13 home runs and 32 RBIs in 192 at- bats. In December 1992 he signed with the St. Louis cardinals and made the roster in 1993 as a backup catcher. However, Hector did not hit very well that year and had a .175 batting average. He was later sent down to the minors to play in Louisville. He was somewhat successful playing in Louisville but never garnered momentum and was eventually released in August. In 1993 during the winter he played in Puerto Rico for the Cangrejeros de Santurce and the team won the league championship. They clinched a spot to play in the Caribbean Series representing Puerto Rico and went on to win the series. Villanueva played first base and had the honor of being named the MVP. In 1994 H√©ctor moved to Mexico where he played for the Tigres of Mexico City. He led the league in home runs and RBIs with a batting average of.333. He later signed a contract that year to play for the Expos on a minor league triple-A team for the Ottawa Lynx. Villanueva was never called up to the Majors so in 1996 he went back to play in the Mexican league. This time he played for the team in Monclova, Mexico. He then spent one season during 1997 playing baseball in the Chinese league for the China Times Eagles. He did not have a good experience in China because he was away from his family and had a misunderstanding with the team manager concerning tickets for his family members to visit him and watch him play. He also felt very uncomfortable with the type of gambling that was going on so he ultimately traveled back to play in Mexico again where would move from one ball club to another. After a while, H√©ctor became tired of the traveling he had to do in Mexico and decided to retire from playing summer baseball there. He took a job back in his hometown where he would be in charge of the baseball parks where he grew up. This meant he could also be with his family and be there for his kids as they grew up. He always played in the Puerto Rican winter league during the Major league offseason when he was a professional and a few years after his time in Mexico. He also managed a few amateur teams in Puerto Rico later on in his career. He finally quit playing baseball altogether after the 2002‚Äì2003 season in Puerto Rico. Villanueva was very passionate about the sport and loved to play the game. He was always a popular player among the fan base because of his likable character and easygoing personality. He displayed tremendous strength whenever he connected the ball but struggled as a defensive player. In The Puerto Rican league H√©ctor achieved 105 home runs, which ties him for third on the league's lifetime list. He also compiled 425 RBIs and a career batting average of .259 in 754 games. He ended up winning a total of three championships in the league. Like many other baseball players, Villanueva never became a breakthrough star in the Major Leagues but found a fair amount of success playing in the minors and leagues outside of the United States, especially in Mexico. He was a right-handed hefty slugger with a knack to pull the ball down the left field line. H√©ctor would at times come up with a streak of hits and home runs during clutch moments, but he lacked consistency and this made his professional career in the Major Leagues last for a short amount of time.

One of the most popular German concert violinists of the 1930s and 1940s, he was considered one of the finest violinists of the 20th century. Kulenkampff was best known for his interpretations of works from the Romantic period. He gave the premiere performance of Robert Schumann's violin concerto and made the first recording of the piece. Additionally, his performances of the violin concertos of Bruch, Beethoven, Mendelssohn and Glazunov are considered among the finest on record, but his early death from encephalitis and the fact that his recording career coincided with the Nazi era have prevented his name from being better known to modern listeners. Biography Georg Kulenkampff was the son of a well-to-do merchant family in Bremen. He took an interest in the violin from a very young age, and from 1904 (aged 6) began to receive instruction from the concertmaster of the Bremen Philharmonic Orchestra, and afterwards with its conductor Ernst Wendel. He then received lessons and encouragement from Leopold Auer (teacher of Mischa Elman, Efrem Zimbalist, Jascha Heifetz, Nathan Milstein and others) in Dresden, and made a concert debut in 1912 as solo violinist. On Auer's recommendation he was sent to study with Willy He√ü at the Berlin Music Hochschule, and became in time director of the Hochschule Orchestra. Kulenkampff's health was fragile from early life, and towards the end of the First World War he returned to his home town to become concertmaster of the Bremen Philharmonic. He made rapid progress, especially as a soloist, and in 1923 became professor-in-ordinary at the Berlin Music Hochschule. He taught there until 1926, when his solo career became all-absorbing, but resumed teaching there in 1931 until his departure from Germany in 1944. At the same time he gave concerts throughout Germany and, increasingly, in various parts of Europe, and had a busy broadcasting career. In 1927, he performed the Bach Double Violin Concerto in D minor with Alma Moodie (a student of Carl Flesch) and the Berlin Philharmonic (BPO)Kay Dreyfus, Alma Moodie and the Landscape of Giftedness, 2002 In 1935 he formed a celebrated trio with the pianist Edwin Fischer and the cellist Enrico Mainardi, with whom he remained active until 1948. Following his death, he was replaced as violinist by Wolfgang Schneiderhan. He also played in piano duos, especially with Georg Solti and Wilhelm Kempff: with Solti he recorded the Brahms sonatas, Mozart's 20th sonata and Beethoven's Kreutzer sonata for Decca, and there is also a Kreutzer with Kempff (DGG, 1935). His (Decca) recording of the Brahms Double Concerto with Mainardi, under the baton of Carl Schuricht, is notable as well. In 1937 he gave the premiere of the rediscovered Violin Concerto in D minor of Robert Schumann, which had been studied and suppressed by Joseph Joachim, but which Kulenkampff now revived with the help of Georg Sch√ºnemann, the Nazi-appointed Director of the \\"Prussian State Library\\" (German: Preu√üische Staatsbibliothek), where the autograph score was housed, and Paul Hindemith, whose compositions were already banned by the Nazi authorities. The addition of this work to the repertoire was important, and soon afterwards Kulenkampff made the world premiere recording. Before the war he recorded the Beethoven (BPO under Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt) and Mendelssohn concerti: he continued to perform the Mendelssohn work in Nazi Germany despite the antisemitic ban on his music, and for other concertos used the highly regarded cadenzas by the Jewish Fritz Kreisler. Kulenkampff gave various other world premieres, notable of works by Ottorino Respighi (Violin Sonata No. 2) and by Jean Sibelius. He was very much in demand and very busy during the Nazi period, as an \\"Aryan\\" musician although he did not subscribe to Nazi racist-nationalist theories and, by virtue of his importance and his \\"Aryan\\" status, was able to maintain proscribed parts of the repertoire. In 1940 he moved to Potsdam, and in 1944, with increasingly unacceptable and intolerant demands from the prevailing powers, he left Germany for Switzerland. From 1943 there is a live recording from Berlin of a performance of the Sibelius concerto conducted by Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler with the BPO. From Switzerland he continued to develop his international solo career, and he became successor to Carl Flesch as violin professor at the Lucerne Conservatory. He was first violin of the Kulenkampff Quartet from 1944, and among his students was the Italian-American Ruggiero Ricci from San Francisco. Kulenkampff died in Schaffhausen, Switzerland of encephalitis (spinal paralysis) at age 50, suffering a rapid onset soon after his last concert. His memoirs appeared posthumously in 1952, entitled 'A Violinist's Observations' (Geigerische Betrachtungen).

Pierce Marshall, were each given shares representing a 4% stake in Koch Industries by their father, J. Howard Marshall II, who said \\"these are the crown jewels, take care of them.‚Äù In 1980, the 4 sons of Fred C. Koch fought over control of Koch Industries, founded by their father. Marshall III sided with Bill Koch and Frederick R. Koch, while J. Howard Marshall II and E. Pierce Marshall sided with Charles Koch and David Koch. Charles and David got control of the company in 1983. Marshall II then demanded that Marshall III return the 4% interest in Koch Industries that was gifted to him. Marshall III forced his father to pay $8 million for the shares. Even though the shares are worth billions today, at the time, his father thought the price was exorbitant and cut Marshall III out of his will and testament, saying the $8 million was \\"all he‚Äôd get\\". After his father died in 1995, Marshall III sued his father's estate, as well as his brother, sister in-law, and nephew for an inheritance. He also sued Koch Industries and Charles and David Koch, accusing them of conspiring with his brother, E. Pierce Marshall, to influence his father and cheat him of his inheritance. In March 2001, a Texas probate jury found that J. Howard's will and trust were valid and had not been executed under fraud or malice, Pierce had not committed any wrongdoing, and that Marshall III his father's widow, Anna Nicole Smith, were not entitled to any part of his estate. Further, the jury found Marshall III had committed fraud with actual malice for filing the lawsuit and forced Marshall III to pay his brother $35 million plus legal fees at a time when Marshall III claimed his net worth was $26 million. Even though the award was reduced to $11 million plus legal fees, Marshall III filed bankruptcy on July 11, 2002. In popular culture J.

Michel wins the race, which spikes the wrath of Bob Cramer, a ruthless rival driver who was blocked by him during the race. Cramer confronts Michel's co- pilot, David Wood, over the matter. A few days later, Henri announces that the Vaillante team has purchased engines for the upcoming 24 Hours of Le Mans, and that Wood has been promoted to the driver's seat, promising him a seat at Michel's Le Mans car if he does well in the Rally of Italy. During the race in Italy, Cramer forces Wood off the road. Wood's car crashes violently, and he dies after getting caught in the resulting explosion. At the funeral for David Wood, Michel meets Julie, Wood's wife, who asks him a favor. Michel then convinces his brother to let Julie join the team so she can take her late husband's place. Meanwhile, the Leader team, now under the management of Ruth, the team founder's daughter, returns to racing. They announce that they will race at Le Mans with the number 13, hiring Bob Cramer as one of their drivers. √âlisabeth starts to worry that her nightmare may soon become a reality, and unsuccessfully pleads with Henri to withdraw from Le Mans. At the weekend before the Le Mans race, Ruth, determined to rid the race of Vaillante, has her henchmen sabotage the Vaillante car delivery. Both Vaillante cars are forced to speed through the streets to Le Mans, and they barely make it in time to compete. Infuriated, Ruth decides to kidnap Henri, planning to blackmail Vaillante into losing the race if they wish to have her spare Henri. Michel initially complies, losing a lot of time each lap, but later tells his brother about Ruth's plot to kill their father. Michel is cleared to go out to save his father after having Julie pose as him during the race. While trying to track his father's location through the GPS in Ruth's car, Michel is caught by Ruth, who gets him to drive the #13 Leader car, posing as Cramer after an accident puts him out of the race. The #10 Vaillante car and the #13 Leader car eventually meet each other on the track and end up colliding violently, just like in √âlisabeth's nightmare. Both drivers, revealed to be really Julie and Michel, come out of the wreckage unharmed following such a horrific crash. Julie and Michel proceed to go with Warson to leave the race and save Henri. The three manage to go back to the race, but unfortunately, Warson sustains a gunshot wound while fleeing from Ruth's henchmen after rescuing Henri. Michel decides to replace Warson during a pitstop for the #8 Vaillante car, posing as him for the remainder of the race. In the final lap of the race, when it looks like the #22 Leader car is going to win the race, the Vaillante car gets a flat tire. Meanwhile, the Leader car suddenly starts to slow down due to an engine failure, eventually stopping a few metres before the finish line. The Vaillante car eventually arrives at the final stretch as the Leader car is being pushed toward the finish line by its driver, before proceeding to cross the finish line first, beating the Leader car by a close call. The Vaillante team go on to celebrate their most recent victory, while Ruth stares blankly in defeat.

Event organizers added two cars to the field specifically to accommodate the filming, but the production had to hire 6 professional drivers to drive the cars during the actual race.  Reception  The film was poorly received by critics, who felt it didn't honor the widely successful comics it was based on, underdeveloping the main characters and favoring a stylized and advert-like look. However, some of them praised its photography and exciting racing scenes. Despite a strong marketing campaign, it failed to reach 1 million viewers in France.

They constitute service-based (as opposed to geographical) decentralized administration in terms of the Turkish constitution. Independent regulatory agencies represent a historically unfamiliar mode of governance in Turkey whose tradition of public administration favors a strong and centralized state with a preference of market intervention. The waves of liberalization and privatization measures taken following the 1980 coup d'etat, the conditionalities imposed by the European Union and the economic crises during the 1990s and early 2000s provided the necessary momentum for their establishment. Despite a certain degree of controversy in the Turkish legal doctrine most scholars have accepted that the concept has been well- established within Turkish legal and administrative system even though there is no legal framework governing these bodies nor a sufficient body of case-law by the supreme judicial courts that clarify their administrative nature. Independent regulatory agencies in Turkey include: *the Competition Authority *the Banking Regulation and Supervision Authority *the Capital Markets Authority *the Energy Market Regulation Authority *the Public Procurement Authority *the Radio and Television Supreme Council *the Savings Deposit Insurance Fund (previously a branch of the Banking Regulation and Supervision Authority) *the Telecommunication Authority *the Tobacco, Tobacco Products and Alcoholic Beverages Markets Regulation Board.

According to the Associated Press, Halligan was repeatedly sent homophobic instant messages, and was \\"threatened, taunted and insulted incessantly\\". His father, John P. Halligan, a former IBM engineer, subsequently lobbied for laws to be passed in Vermont to improve how schools address bullying and suicide prevention. He has also given speeches at schools in other states about the story of his son. Halligan's case has been cited by legislators in various states proposing legislation to curb cyber-bullying. In Vermont, laws were subsequently enacted to address the cyberbullying problem and the risk of teen suicides, in response. In 2008, his suicide and its causes were examined in a segment of the PBS Frontline television program entitled \\"Growing Up Online.\\" His suicide has also been referenced in many other news stories on bullying.  Biography  = Early life = Halligan was born on December 18, 1989, in Poughkeepsie, New York, the son of John P. and Kelly Halligan. His family moved to Essex Junction, Vermont, where Halligan attended Hiawatha Elementary School and, later, Albert D. Lawton Middle School. He was described by his father as a \\"gentle, very sensitive soul,\\" who experienced some developmental delays affecting speech and physical coordination in his early school years. Although he overcame those difficulties by the fourth grade, \\"He still struggled; school was never easy to him, but he always showed up with a smile on his face, eager to do his best,\\" said his father. = Bullying =  2000‚Äì2001  When Halligan was in 5th grade, he started to suffer bullying at the hands of a group of students at his school because of his learning disorder, his passion for music (drums and guitar), and his love for drama. His father said that when Halligan told him he was being picked on, his initial response was to ignore the boys, as they were just bullying him with words. The family later said in a short documentary that Halligan enrolled in counseling, with little success. After that he moved up to middle school, where the bullying continued when Halligan was in 7th grade.  2002‚Äì2003  In December 2002, Halligan told his father that the bullying had started again. He asked for a Taebo Kick Boxing set for Christmas in order to learn how to defend himself. At first, his father wanted to go to the school principal and sort things out, but Halligan insisted that he wanted to learn how to fight, believing that complaining to the school about the boys would make things worse. After Christmas, Halligan and his father developed a routine of practicing downstairs in the basement for 2 hours every night. After he had learned to defend himself, his father told him not to pick fights at school, but said that if any student ever touched him aggressively, Halligan had his father's permission to defend himself. In February 2003, Halligan had a fight with a bully, which was broken up by the assistant principal; after that, the bully stopped bothering him. Halligan's father said that he was proud of his son for sticking up for himself. Toward the end of 7th grade, Halligan told his father that he and the bully had become friends. His parents warned him to be careful about the friendship, because the bully had been harassing him for a long time. The two boys were friends for a short amount of time. After Halligan told the bully about an embarrassing examination required after he had stomach pains, he learned that the bully misused the story to spread a rumor that Halligan was gay.  Summer 2003  According to his father and news reports, during the summer of 2003, Halligan spent much of his time online, particularly on AIM and other instant messaging services. Halligan did not tell his parents about this. During the summer, he was cyber-bullied by schoolmates who taunted him, thinking he was gay. Halligan was also bullied at school about this; his father later learned that on one occasion, Halligan ran out of the classroom in tears. As Halligan had unintentionally archived these online conversations on his hard drive when he installed DeadAIM, his father was able to read these discussions. Halligan had deliberately saved transcripts of online exchanges in which Ashley, a popular girl whom Halligan had a crush on, pretended to like him. Later at school, Ashley told him that she was only kidding and that he was a \\"loser\\". According to an ABC Primetime report, she had once been his friend and defended him when the bullying first started, but as she became more popular, she left him behind. He found out she only pretended to like him to gain personal information about him. She copied and pasted their private exchanges into other IMs among his schoolmates to embarrass and humiliate him. After Ashley had called him a \\"loser\\", Halligan said, \\"It's girls like you who make me want to kill myself.\\" His father found out about this later because it was a matter of record with the local police. Halligan's father also discovered some disturbing conversations between Halligan and a boy with a screen name he did not recognize. Halligan began communicating online with a pen-pal about suicide and death, and told him he was thinking about suicide. They had been exchanging information they had found on sites relating to death and suicide, including sites that taught them how to painlessly kill themselves. The pen-pal answered \\"Phew. It's about fucking time,\\" shortly after Halligan told him he was thinking about suicide, two weeks before he killed himself. This was the last conversation he had with the pen-pal. As Halligan's father found out, contrary to popular belief, Halligan's pen-pal was a boy he knew up until third grade, when the boy and his parents moved away. When they found each other online, they reconnected. The pen-pal had, according to Halligan's father, turned into a very negative person with a bleak outlook on life. Online, the boys discussed how much they hated their popular classmates and how they made them feel. The pen-pal suggested suicide as a way out, writing, \\"If you killed yourself you would really make them feel bad.\\" Halligan's father said that the boy was the worst possible friend that Halligan could have had at that time. The parents acknowledged that Halligan had discussed some of his worries and brought up suicide. He had told them his report card would be bad, and worried that his parents would be disappointed in him. One night he asked his dad if he had ever thought of suicide, who responded that he had, but also said, \\"Ryan, imagine if I did do that. Look at all the things we would have missed out on as a family.\\" = Death and subsequent cyberbullying scandal = On October 7, 2003, Halligan's father was away on a business trip. Early in the morning, when the other family members were still sleeping, Halligan hanged himself with a bathrobe tie that belonged to his older sister, who later found his body. Although Halligan left no suicide note, his father learned of the cyberbullying when he accessed his son's computer. He checked his son's yearbook first and found the faces of the bullying group scribbled out. Halligan had scribbled over the face of the ringleader (the same boy who bullied Halligan, befriended him, and then started the gay rumor) so aggressively he had torn the paper. Halligan accessed his son's computer and first learned of the cyber-bullying when his son's friends told him. When he learned that Ashley was being blamed for Halligan's suicide, Halligan had her brought over to his house. He reportedly said to her, \\"You did a bad thing, but you're not a bad person.\\" She appeared with Halligan on ABC's Primetime to speak out against bullying. Although the Halligans moved out of Vermont, she still maintains contact with them. He later confronted the bully who had started the gay rumor after finding out that he made fun of how Halligan killed himself. At first, he was so angry that he wanted to go to the boy's house and \\"crush that little jerk,\\" but had time to think about it while stuck in traffic. Halligan reportedly said to the boy, \\"You have no idea the amount of pain you caused my son. And you're still bullying him now even when he's defenseless and you are still lying to your parents about it. I refuse to believe that you are so cruel and that you don't have a heart.\\" Shortly afterward the bully broke down in tears and repeatedly apologized for what he did. Halligan wanted to file charges against the bully but the police said there was no criminal law that covered the relevant circumstances. Halligan forgave the boy as well as Ashley. After learning the name of the pen-pal, Halligan's father went to his house and talked with his parents. Halligan said that he did not want the pen-pal to use the conversations for \\"something dark.\\" While at the pen-pal's house, Halligan learned that the boy's father never received any hard copies of the conversations. The pen-pal's mother came and pulled out the hard copies from under the sofa, showing them to the father for \\"what appeared to be the first time.\\" While the father was looking at the copies, the mother threw Halligan out. Halligan said that he never got a satisfying response from the boy or his family. He still visits the boy's website, which contains several references to death and suicide. Halligan soon began lobbying for legislation in Vermont to improve how schools address bullying and suicide prevention. He has also given speeches to schools in various states about the story of his son and the devastating effects of cyber-bullying among teens. Vermont enacted a Bullying Prevention Policy Law in May 2004 and later adopted a Suicide Prevention Law (Act 114) in 2005, closely following a draft submitted by Halligan's father. The law provides measures to assist teachers and others to recognize and respond to depression and suicide risks among teens. Halligan's case has also been cited by legislators in other states proposing legislation to curb cyber-bullying. Halligan's story was featured on a Frontline television program entitled \\"Growing Up Online\\", produced in January 2008, by WGBH-TV in Boston and distributed nationwide over PBS. In it, his father recounts his shock upon discovering the extent of the abuse his son endured, saying he believes that bullying on the internet \\"amplified and accelerated the hurt and pain he was trying to deal with, that started in the real world.\\" Halligan's story has also been featured on Oprah in a report they did on a rise in homophobic teasing in schools. In addition, he presented his powerful assembly to many schools across the country. Halligan's story was also featured in Max Hechtman's 2018 documentary, Stories of Strength and Hope: Preventing Youth Suicide, supported by an on-screen interview with John Halligan. Today Halligan visits other schools to inform students about his son's death and how it has changed his life.

Early life and career Plunkett was the second son of Edward Plunkett, 16th Baron of Dunsany (1808‚Äì1889), and Lady Anne Constance Dutton (1816‚Äì1858), daughter of John Dutton, 2nd Baron Sherborne and the Hon. Mary Bilson-Legge (1780‚Äì1864), daughter of Henry Bilson-Legge, 2nd Baron Stawell and Hon. Mary Curzon. His father pursued military interests, and wrote on the topics of a Channel Tunnel to France. His elder brother, Hon. Randal Edward Sherborne Plunkett, predeceased him. John William Plunkett received a Bachelor of Arts Degree from Trinity College, Dublin (1877). He studied at Trinity College, Cambridge (B.A., 1878; M.A., 1881). He was Lieutenant R.N. Artillery Volunteers and a Conservative Party Member of Parliament for the Thornbury (or Southern) division of Gloucestershire from 1886 to 1892. He proved his right to vote at the elections of Representative Peers (Ireland) 1890 and Representative Peers (Ireland) 1893‚Äì99. Family John William married on 3 April 1877, at St George's, Hanover Square, London, England, his second cousin, Ernle Elizabeth Louisa Maria Grosvenor Burton (later Ernle-Erle-Drax), the only daughter and heir to Colonel Francis Augustus Plunkett Burton, Coldstream Guards, by Sarah Frances Elizabeth, younger daughter and coheir of John Samuel Wanley Sawbridge-Erle-Drax, of Charborough Park, Dorset. Ernle Burton's paternal grandmother, the Hon. Anna Maria Plunkett, wife of Admiral James Ryder Burton, was a sister of her husband's paternal grandfather, Edward Wadding Plunkett, 13th Baron of Dunsany. In addition, Ernle, Lady Dunsany, was descended via her maternal line from James Drax, a young Englishman who, with a few hundred pounds, had sailed from the Port of London for Barbados in the late 1620s. There he had made a fortune developing sugar and slave-trading into a hugely profitable business. Just before the turn of the seventeenth century, the family returned to England and purchased an estate in Dorset. Lady Dunsany inherited Charborough Park in 1905. Her unusual Christian name, Ernle, was inherited from an ancestress, Elizabeth Ernle (1697‚Äì1759), wife of Henry Drax, Esq., who was the daughter and eventual heiress of Sir Edward Ernle, 3rd Baronet, P.C., M.P., (1673‚Äì1729) of Maddington, Wiltshire, by his wife, Frances (d. 1728) only daughter and heir of Lieutenant General Thomas Erle (1650‚Äì1720), of Charborough House, the source of a further barrel of her surname. John William and Ernle Elizabeth had two sons, the author Edward John Moreton Drax, 18th Baron of Dunsany and Admiral The Honourable Sir Reginald Aylmer Ranfurly Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax (Charborough Park was left to Reginald, who changed his name to include Drax, the family who had formerly owned it, as well as including references to the Ernle and Erle families from which various of his mother's legacies to him came). Lady Dunsany was a cousin of Sir Richard Burton, the great traveller, scholar, writer, and translator of the Arabian Nights. Her son and heir, Edward, the noted author, may have inherited his imaginative streak partly from the Burton family. Personal life He lived at the family seat of Dunsany Castle, County Meath, Ireland, and in London and Shoreham, Kent. He was an exceptional sportsman, and was reputed to have been the best marksman in England. He was deeply interested in mechanical things and developed his own X-Ray machine, which was in operation in Dunsany Castle before his death in 1899.R√∂ntgen delivered his seminal paper on the subject in Berlin in 1895. The Dunsany version of the R√∂ntgen ray machine was given to Sevenoaks Hospital in 1918. He had acquired the right to drive the Irish Mail Train and regularly took charge of the branch line train from Dublin to Drumree, near Dunsany. He was also responsible for having the first Irish telephone system installed in Dunsany Castle. The 17th Baron of Dunsany died, after a short illness, on 16 January 1899, at Dunsany Castle, aged forty-five years. His widow, from whom he was separated in his last years, and who, by Royal Licence of 20 December 1905, assumed the names of Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax, died at her residence, Dunstall Priory, Shoreham, near Sevenoaks, Kent, England, on 28 February 1916.

Characterisation Jal is described by the official Skins website as \\"super bright and the most talented young clarinet player in the country\\".Channel 4 - Skins - Us The daughter of fictional celebrity Ronny Fazer, she is easily the most affluent of all of her friends, of whom she is closest to Michelle Richardson and Chris Miles. As a highly talented and intellectual teenager, she defies various stereotypes. Her school is quick to take pride in (and responsibility for) her success, despite carrying little interest in the naturally gifted Jal. She is very straightforward and self-aware, and has contempt for her brothers' fake \\"ghetto\\" personas as well as Tony Stonem's poor treatment of Michelle, and the way in which Sid Jenkins ignores Cassie. Despite this, she can occasionally come across as something of a goody-goody, as several characters occasionally point out her preference for her clarinet over her friends, with Chris making a pact with her, in which she has to \\"stop saying \\"no\\" all the time.\\" According to her Myspace-style \\"about me\\" section on the Skins websiteChannel 4 - Skins - Us - Jal she dislikes modern pop artists and wishes to \\"sue MTV Base for prolonged emotional distress\\". Her favourite \\"musical dynamics\\" are Dolce, Affettuoso, Rubato and Giocoso. Her other favourite things include eating chips, Maxxie Oliver's dancing, and the correlation between maths and music (Pythagorean triples). She is also incredibly driven, finding herself knowing more than her careers advisor, having planned out her future, and having to pass up a fifteen-minute interview in awkward silence. Character history =Series 1= Jal is first seen in the opening episode practising her clarinet when she is interrupted by Tony's phone call. She tells him to stop calling Michelle 'nips' and rejects the invitation to Abigail's party, hinting at her anti-party lifestyle which is explored further in her central episode. In \\"Jal\\", Jal anticipates her clarinet recital (for place of BBC Young Musician of the Year) and impresses all her friends by looking great with the aid of Michelle. She also spots Tony flirt with Abigail, much to Jal's disgust. Her clarinet is broken by Sid's drug dealing enemy Madison Twatter, who smashes it before being chased away by her brothers Ace and Lynton (who are subsequently beaten into hospital). Her dad surprises her by buying her a new clarinet and having Madison abducted (presumably killed). Later, in \\"Chris\\" it is revealed she did not win Young Musician of the Year and only received ¬£25 to cover her traveling costs. She grows closer to Chris as he is abandoned by both parents and left homeless, whilst beginning to become aware of his drug addiction. In \\"Sid\\" she is critical of Sid for how he treats Cassie and is there to take Cassie to hospital after an overdose. She tells the doctors that she is Cassie's sister, and gets rid of Sid, with whom she is angry, hoping Cassie will recover. In \\"Maxxie and Anwar\\", she tries to inform Michelle that Tony cheated on her with Abigail but she does not listen. This ultimately blows off in Michelle's episode where they fall out due to Jal's inability to tell her about Tony's long list of infidelities. However, they reconcile towards the end of the episode. In the series finale, she dances with Kenneth at Anwar Kharral's birthday party and the two seem to grow closer. When Chris starts a brawl, she makes easy work in fighting some of the large male attackers. =Series 2= In episode five of the second season, \\"Chris\\", we see Jal and Chris make a deal that he will give his life a go and stop saying 'fuck it' and that Jal will stop saying no to everything, as Chris had previously told her in \\"Sid\\" that \\"you don't have sex at all. You have clarinet lessons.\\" At a party that night, Jal shows her wilder side when Chris dares her to go and get the hat off the head of the singer at the party. She downs a can of beer and snogs the singer right on stage for his hat. Inevitably, she and Chris end up getting together. In a later episode, Angie turns up. However, Chris pulls out of his romp in the toilet with her when he thinks of Jal. When they come out of the bathroom, Jal is there and puts two and two together. Chris then attempts to get Jal back and they get back together, however he doesn't yet know that Jal is pregnant with his baby. In the following episode, \\"Tony\\", she is seen in the club with the others but doesn't appear to drink alcohol. Tony tells her she is a bad liar and knows she has a secret. It isn't clear if she told him she was pregnant or not. During episode eight, Jal's central episode, she continues to battle with the many decisions she needs to make in the foreseeable future. Whilst Jal struggles to decide when to reveal her pregnancy to boyfriend Chris, it is heavily hinted that Chris has a secret of his own. Half way through the episode, it is revealed that Cassie somehow knows of Jal's pregnancy. Michelle and Jal's dysfunctional family discover her secret shortly after. The next day, Jal heads for a musical audition at a prestigious college of arts, and performs well.

The song is a moderately up-tempo number, with a sound similar to rock music from the late 1960s. Endresen delivers a paean to San Francisco as an idealised paradise from that decade, with lyrics containing many references to slogans (\\"Make love not war\\"), people (Jimi Hendrix and John Lennon) and song titles (\\"California Dreamin'\\", \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\") from that era, as well as key events such as the moon landing and the Woodstock festival. The chorus further idealises the city and the period, with it being described as \\"A time of peace, a spring of youth/No guns, no war, no disco/Just lovely flowers in your hair\\". The song was performed third on the night, following Turkey's ≈ûebnem Paker & Grup Etnic with \\"Dinle\\" and preceding Austria's Bettina Soriat with \\"One Step\\". At the close of voting, it had received no points, placing 24th (joint last) in a field of 25 and further extending Norway's unwanted record of recording zero points on the most occasions. Additionally, as the result followed on a second place and a victory, Norway achieved a dramatic reversal of fortunes. Prior to the next Contest, the decision was taken to restrict entry to the 18 countries with the best average score over the previous five years, a group which included Norway courtesy of Secret Garden's victory in 1995 and Elisabeth Andreassen's second- place the year after.

Biography Amos B. Eaton was born in Catskill, New York. He graduated from West Point in 1826; he was an infantry lieutenant until the Florida campaigns of the late 1830s. After that, his only fighting experiences took place in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, for which service he was appointed a brevet major. Eaton served for 12 years as a field officer in the U.S. Army, then joined the commissary department for 23 years. Appointed a lieutenant colonel and assistant commissary general in 1861, Eaton was given the task of creating an effective supply system for the fledgling Union army. The large number of troops entering the Army at the beginning of the war was overloading the existing system. His work provisioning and distributing supplies to the troops led to President Abraham Lincoln's July 6, 1864, appointment of Eaton to the rank of brigadier general, U.S. Army, to rank from June 29, 1864.Eicher, John H., and David J.

Taylor on June 29, 1864.Eicher, 2001, p. 717 On March 8, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Eaton for appointment to the brevet grade of major general to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the nomination on May 4, 1866, and re-confirmed it on July 14, 1866, in order to have line officers precede staff officers in rank.Eicher, 2001 p. 707 He retired May 1, 1874, with the grade of brigadier general, USA, and commissary general of subsistence.Eicher, 2001, p. 221 He then moved to New Haven, Connecticut. Eaton died in New Haven, on February 21, 1877, and was buried there. Relations His daughter Frances Spencer Eaton married Charles Atwood White, the great-grandson of American founding father Roger Sherman. They were the parents of U.S. Secretary of War Henry L.

Early life and education Dutt was born into a distinguished Bengali Kayastha family well known for its members' literary and academic achievements. His parents were Thakamani and Isam Chunder Dutt, a Deputy Collector in Bengal, whom Romesh often accompanied on official duties. He was educated in various Bengali District schools, then at Hare School, Calcutta. After his father's untimely death in a boat accident in eastern Bengal, his uncle, Shoshee Chunder Dutt, an accomplished writer, became his guardian in 1861. He wrote about his uncle, \\"He used to sit at night with us and our favorite study used to be pieces from the works of the English poets.\\"R. C. Dutt (1968) Romesh Chunder Dutt, Internet Archive, Million Books Project. p. 10. He was a relative of Toru Dutt, one of nineteenth century Bengal's most prominent poets. He entered the University of Calcutta, Presidency College in 1864. He passed the First Arts examination in 1866, ranking second in order of merit and won a scholarship. While still a student in the B.A. class, without his family's permission, he and two other friends, Behari Lal Gupta and Surendranath Banerjee, left for England in 1868.Jnanendranath Gupta, Life and Works of Romesh Chandra Dutt, CIE, (London: J.M.Dent and Sons Ltd., 1911); while young Romesh came out unnoticed, Beharilal, possibly his closest friend ever, was chased all the way down to the Calcutta docks by his \\"poor\\" father, who could not, however, successfully persuade his son to return to the safety of his parental home. Later, in England, both the friends took the civil service examination successfully, becoming the 2nd and 3rd Indians to join the ICS. The third person in the group, Surendranath Banerjee, also cleared the test, but was incorrectly disqualified, as being over-age. At that time, only one other Indian, Satyendra Nath Tagore, had qualified for the Indian Civil Service. Dutt aimed to emulate Tagore's feat. For a long time, before and after 1853, the year the ICS examination was introduced in England, only British officers were appointed to covenanted posts.Nitish Sengupta (2002) History of the Bengali-speaking People, UBS Publishers' Distributors Pvt.

A famine in Meherpur district of Nadia in 1874 and another in Dakhin Shahbazpur (Bhola District) in 1876, followed by a disastrous cyclone, required emergency relief and economic recovery operations, which Dutt managed successfully. He served as administrator for Backerganj, Mymensingh, Burdwan, Donapur, and Midnapore. He became Burdwan's District Officer in 1893, Commissioner (offtg.) of Burdwan Division in 1894, and Divisional Commissioner (offtg.) for Orissa in 1895. Dutt was the first Indian to attain the rank of divisional commissioner. Post-retirement Dutt retired from the ICS in 1897. In 1898 he returned to England as a lecturer in Indian History at University College, London where he completed his famous thesis on economic nationalism. He returned to India as dewan of Baroda State, a post he had been offered before he left for Britain. He was extremely popular in Baroda where the king, Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III, along with his family members and all other staff members used to call him ‚ÄòBabu Dewan‚Äô, as a mark of personal respect. In 1907, he also became a member of the Royal Commission on Indian Decentralisation. Hansard, HC Deb 26 August 1907 vol 182 c149 =Politics= He was president of the Indian National Congress in 1899.

This book was presented by Thacker, Spink & Co. in Calcutta and Archibald Constable in London in 1895, but the idea had formed earlier in Dutt's mind while he managed famine relief and economic recovery operations in Dakhin Shahbazpur. It had appeared originally under the disguise of an assumed name in 1877. It was dedicated to his esteemed uncle, Rai Shashi Chandra Dutt Bahadur. History He was a major economic historian of India of the nineteenth century. His thesis on de-industrialization of India under the British rule remains forceful argument in Indian historiography.

It may be referred to as streaming or phasing in certain schools. In a tracking system, the entire school population is assigned to classes according to whether the students' overall achievement is above average, normal, or below average. Students attend academic classes only with students whose overall academic achievement is the same as their own.  Description  Ability grouping is not synonymous with tracking.Slavin, R. E. (1987). Ability grouping: A best- evidence synthesis. Review of Educational Research, 57, 293‚Äì336. Tracking differs from ability grouping by scale and permanence. Ability groups are small, informal groups formed within a single classroom. Assignment to an ability group is often short-term (never lasting longer than one school year), and varies by subject. Assignment to an ability group is made by (and can be changed at any time by) the individual teacher, and is usually not recorded in student records. For example, a teacher may divide a typical mixed-ability classroom into three groups for a mathematics lesson: those who need to review basic facts before proceeding, those who are ready to learn new material, and those who need a challenging assignment. For the next lesson, the teacher may revert to whole-class, mixed-ability instruction, or may assign students to different groups. History in the United States = Background = Tracking and its various modifications are among the predominant organizing practices of American public schools, and have been an accepted feature of the country's schools for nearly a century.Rubin, B. (2008). Detracking in Context: How Local Constructions of Ability Complicate Equity-Geared Reform. Teachers College Record. Retrieved from: Coming into use at a time when schools were enrolling growing numbers of immigrant children as the result of compulsory schooling laws, tracking was adopted as a means of sorting those children viewed as having limited preparation or capacity for schooling from native children. Unfortunately, however, tracking quickly took on the appearance of internal segregation.Wheelock, A. (1992). Crossing the tracks: How \\"untracking\\" can save America's schools. New York: New Press. The types of tracks have changed over the years. Traditionally, there were academic, general, and vocational tracks, identified by the kind of preparation they provide. By the 1920s, some schools had developed up to eight distinctly labeled tracks that represented particular curricular programs that reflected an assessment of students‚Äô probable social and vocational futures. Many secondary schools now base track levels on course difficulty, with tracks such as basic, honors, or college-prep. Public schools might track in terms of high, average, or lower ability. As noted by Oakes and Martin, \\"school policies determine three structural qualities of the tracking system: extensiveness (the number of subjects tracked and the type of distinct curricula offered); specificity (the number of track levels offered); and flexibility (whether students move from one track to another)\\".Oakes, Jeannie and Lipton Martin. \\"Tracking and Ability Grouping: A structural Barrier to Access and Achievement.\\" Goodlad, John I. and Pamela Keating.\\"Access to Knowledge.\\" New York: College Entrance Examination Board, 1994. 187‚Äì204 Although, in theory, track assignment is based on academic ability, other factors often influence placement. =Origins of race-based tracking in school desegregation= The origins of race-based tracking reach as far back as the federal court ruling in Roberts v. The City of Boston in 1850, a case that upheld separate school curricula for blacks and whites on the belief in inherent racial differences in intelligence. With the Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka Supreme Court ruling of 1954, which determined that the separate school statute established by Plessy v. Ferguson was unconstitutional, the stage was set to address between-school segregation/tracking. However, for schools in most southern regions of the United States, integration did not occur until the early 1970s. Moreover, desegregation at the school level often led to pronounced tracking within schools, as Grant ([1990] 1988) chronicled in The World We Created at Hamilton High. Haney‚Äôs (1978) historical analysis at the secondary school level found that less qualified teachers were assigned to teach racially tracked classes. During the mid- to late-1980s, federal court cases in Mississippi and Georgia took up the question of unfair race-based tracking in school systems. However, Quarles v. Oxford Municipal Separate School District, NAACP v. Georgia, and Montgomery v. Starkville Municipal Separate School District each ruled in favor of school districts based on the argument that tracking was being properly utilized for the purpose of assisting students‚Äô ability to learn‚Äîin spite of statistical imbalances in track assignment. In Mickelson‚Äôs (2003) detailed study of between and within school tracking/segregation in Charlotte North Carolina, she argued that tracking was used as a tool to maintain white privilege by placing African-American students in lower academic tracks. Other studies by Lewis and Diamond (2015), Kelly (2009), Riegle-Crumb, Kyte, and Morton (2018), Schuhrer, Carbonaro, & Grodsky (2016), and others continue to show large disparities in course taking among whites and minorities.Riegle- Crumb C., Kyte, S.B., & Morton, K.

(Eds.) Models of Secondary Education and Social Inequality-An International Comparison. Edward Elgar. The baseline chances of being in the high track are often twice as high for whites as disadvantaged minorities. Track assignment The ways by which students are assigned to tracks differs both between and within schools. Today, it is less common for schools to rigidly track students in all subjects. Administrators and teachers in a given school may purposefully avoid using the term ‚Äútracking‚Äù to describe the organization of their school‚Äôs curriculum. Yet, schools maintain a variety of policies that sort students into different programs of study including: test scores and grade requirements, pre- and co-requisite requirements, and teacher recommendations. Schools also use over-arching programs of study such as ‚Äúcollege prep‚Äù as a guidance technique to track students. Non-academic factors such as schedule conflicts can limit students from taking courses of varying level as well. Thus, while most systems allow for some amount of student and parent choice, this choice is constrained by course taking requirements and guidance policies. Within the context of this system, researchers disagree over the extent to which highly involved parents intervene to give their own student a course taking advantage. Historically, high school students were sorted into ‚Äúbusiness/vocational,‚Äù ‚Äúgeneral,‚Äù or the ‚Äúcollege‚Äù track, which had profound implications for the nature and extent of academic course taking. In more recent decades, vocational course taking has declined, while academic course taking has increased. For example, Domina and Saldana (2012) report that the graduating class of 1982 took an average of 14.6 academic courses while the class of 2004 took 19.1 academic courses. Likewise, the percentage of students graduating with pre-calculus or calculus coursework increased from about 10.3% of students to 32.9% of students. This increase in academic course taking, especially in the public sector, has narrowed the differences in academic rigor between high- and low-track students somewhat. Academic intensification has also reduced differences in the academic experiences of public vs. private school students. Despite some loosening of high school tracking systems, most schools remain highly differentiated, with policies that encourage students to take the same level of coursework in different subjects. In a study of high school tracking policies in North Carolina, Kelly and Price (2011) report that the typical school had five or more levels of mathematics, with some schools having three or more levels of Geometry alone. Larger schools and schools with a greater diversity of student achievement level have more extensive tracking systems than smaller, homogenous schools. In many schools the track assignment process remains a high stakes decision.  Debate  =Advantages= Proponents of tracking say that tracking has several important strengths.  Lessons in adequation with the ability level of the students  A major advantage of tracking is that it allows teachers to better direct lessons toward the specific ability level of the students in each class. While tracking for regular instruction makes no real difference in scholastic achievement for low and average ability students, it does produce substantial gains for gifted students in tracks specially designed for the gifted and talented.Rogers, Karen B, Ph.D., The Relationship of Grouping Practices to the Education of the Gifted and Talented Learner, (The National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented, 1991 ) p. x. Tracking meets the need for highly gifted students to be with their intellectual peers in order to be appropriately challenged and to view their own abilities more realistically. Tracking can allow students to receive lessons targeted at their ability for each subject separately, attending lessons set at different levels at the same school. For example, a student at a higher level in math may attend a class with advanced math students, but if at a lower level in English they may be grouped with peers at their level in English. Another positive aspect of tracking is that since it separates students by ability, students' work is only compared to that of similar-ability peers, preventing a possible lowering of their self-esteem that could result from comparisons with the work of higher ability students, or inflating the egos of the high-ability students when compared to low-ability, same-age students. Being with students of similar ability could allow students to realistically compete against one another for the highest marks with a reasonable chance of reaching the top of a class.  Higher achievement of high-ability students  Supporters of tracking also note that it allows for higher achievement of high-ability students. Kulik and Kulik (1992) found that high-ability students in tracked classes achieved more highly than similar-ability students in non-tracked classes. Similarly, Rogers (1991) recommends that gifted and talented students spend the majority of their school day with ability peers.Rogers, The Relationship...\\" In 1982 and 1990, the Kuliks also found a moderate improvement in attitude toward subject material for all ability levels.Rogers, p. xi. Another factor of ability grouping that has been advocated is the Joplin Plan that refers directly to ability grouping for reading. These groups are generally more interchangeable and less defined. In another study, Argys, Rees, and Brewer (1996) found that high-track students‚Äô achievement dropped when lower-ability students were integrated into the same class. Both of these studies suggest that tracking is beneficial to high-track students. Tracking can also encourage low-ability students to participate in class since tracking separates them from intimidation of the high-ability students. Some supporters of tracking also view tracking as an effective means of allocation since it helps direct students into specific areas of the labor market. Rogers classifies tracking as one of ten types of grouping.Rogers, Karen B, Ph.D., Re-forming Gifted Education (Great Potential Press, Scottsdale, AZ, 2002), pp. 209. High ability groups are often assigned special work that is more advanced than that of the other students in the class. For gifted children, such advanced work contributes to their social and emotional well-being.The Social and Emotional Development of Gifted Children: What Do We Know?, Edited by Maureen Neihart, Sally M. Reis, Nancy M. Robinson, and Sidney M. Moon; National Association of Gifted Children (Prufrock Press, Inc.), 2002, p. 286. =Disadvantages=  Heterogeneity inside tracks  Despite the positive aspects of tracking, some scholars have noted limitations of the system. Tracking often does not work as effectively as it should because of the composition of the tracks. In practice, tracks are generally not as homogeneous as they could be (although they are more homogenous than a non- tracking system, which randomly assigns students to classrooms), so some of the potential benefits can't be fully exploited. Even when tracks initially are nearly homogeneous in students' academic abilities, heterogeneity can develop over time, since students learn at different rates. Some systems reassess all students periodically to keep students of comparable ability together as they progress.  Racial and social discrimination  Low- track classes tend to be primarily composed of low-income students, usually minorities, while upper-track classes are usually dominated by students from socioeconomically successful groups. In 1987, Jeannie Oakes theorized that the disproportionate placement of poor and minority students into low tracks does not reflect their actual learning abilities. Rather, she argues that the ethnocentric claims of social Darwinists and the Anglo-Saxon-driven Americanization movement at the turn of the century combined to produce a strong push for \\"industrial\\" schooling, ultimately relegating the poorer minority students to vocational programs and a differentiated curriculum which she considered a lingering pattern in 20th century schools.  Teachers appointment to classes  In 1984, Merrilee Finley‚Äôs ethnographic study of ‚Äúsuburban high school‚Äù drew attention to the practice of teacher tracking‚Äîthe matching of teachers to tracked classrooms. Finley found that at Suburban, advanced, high-track classes were considered by teachers to be the most desirable classes to teach, and were taught by the most experienced, highly trained, and motivated teachers. Using nationally representative data Kelly (2004) confirmed Finley‚Äôs findings, arguing that teacher tracking perpetuates educational inequality by placing the least effective teachers in the most challenging teaching contexts. Teacher tracking also maintains the practice of student tracking, because all but the newest teachers are invested in the informal reward system created by teacher tracking. Analyses of state administrative data by Clotfelter et al. (2006), Kalogrides et al. (2013) and others continue to show uneven access to high quality teachers within schools.  Curricula  Scholars have found that curricula often vary widely among tracks, as teachers adjust instruction to match student achievement levels. However, while the enrichment and/or acceleration of curricula is considered to be a major benefit to high-track students,Rogers, The Relationship..., p. xi. lessons taught in low-track classes often lack the engagement and rigor of the high-track lessons, even considering that low-track students may enter class with lower academic achievement. Oakes (1985) found that in high-track classes, teachers often used course materials and taught concepts which required extensive critical-thinking skills, whereas teachers in low-track classes tended to draw heavily from workbooks and rarely assign work that required critical thinking. In general, curricula of high-track courses are much more intensive and in-depth than those of low-track courses, as would be expected by differences in students' academic readiness. Teachers also report spending less time addressing disciplinary issues in high-track classrooms than in low-track classes, which leads to differences in content coverage. Importantly, research finds that instructional differences across track levels goes beyond what would be expected based simply on differences in student readiness. For example, In English language arts classes, Northrop and Kelly (2018) found that in 8th grade low-track students read less challenging texts than students of similar achievement in grade-level classes, part of a pattern of more skill and strategy instruction and less literature analysis.  Social effects and stigmatization  Some studies suggest that tracking can influence students' peer groups and attitudes regarding other students. Gamoran's study (1992) shows that students are more likely to form friendships with other students in the same tracks than students outside of their tracks. Since low-class and minority students are overrepresented in low tracks with Whites and Asians generally dominating high tracks, interaction among these groups can be discouraged by tracking. However, there is no research showing an academic benefit to low track students from such interaction. Tracking can also result in a stigmatization of low-track students. In some cases, this stigmatization is thought to have a negative impact on students' academic performance and to influence students' attitudes. In one study, it was found that, among low-achieving students, students in tracked classes were more likely than students in non-tracked classes to believe that \\"their fate was out of their hands\\". According to Carol Dweck, this could be because their teachers impose upon them a 'fixed mindset,' but it is not an inherent attribute of tracking itself.Dweck, C. S. (2006). Mindset: The new psychology of success. New York: Random House. p. 66. Dweck implies that teachers who promote a growth mindset could stimulate students to greater academic achievement regardless of tracking. So whether a fixed mindset is predictive of, or resulting from, a low track assignment is unknown. The effects of social stigmatization can be some of the worst outcomes for students in lower academic tracks. Schafer and Olexa (1971) interviewed high school students in lower academic tracks to examine the effects of tracking on self-esteem and perceived academic competence. They found that students lost confidence in their abilities by their placements in low-ability classes in which teacher expectations for them were low. These dilemmas were very common as students made transitions to new schools (e.g., elementary to middle school, middle to high school). The tracking of African-American students in elementary schools reflected remnants of early desegregation in which African-American secondary school teachers were demoted to teaching in lower grades (Haney, 1978). In these elementary schools, class-based tracking disproportionately placed African-American students in lower tracks with African-American teachers, regardless of ability. In transitions to middle and high school, tracking by ability created a division among these students and stripped students in lower tracks of their perceived academic efficacies. Goodlad (1983) and Oakes (1985) found that students in lower tracks were more likely to drop out of school or participate in criminal activities. Proponents of tracking would have said that students dropped out due to lack of ability, but Mickelson (2003) stated that students differed widely even within lower tracks. Even when students demonstrated high academic ability, it was virtually impossible to change their academic tracks without delaying high school graduation (Mickelson, 2003). International perspective = Background = Across countries there are wide differences in the use of formal tracking systems. Even though some countries track students into differing-ability schools by age 10, others such as the United States keep their entire secondary-school system comprehensive. Eric Hanushek and Ludger Woessmann identify the impact of tracking by comparing differences in student outcome between primary and secondary school across tracked and non-tracked systems.Eric A. Hanushek and Ludger Woessmann, \\"Does educational tracking affect performance and inequality? Differences-in- differences evidence across countries.\\" Economic Journal 116( 510), March 2006: C63-C76. The results suggest that early tracking increases educational inequality. While less clear, there is also a tendency for early tracking to reduce mean performance. = Tracking by country = Tracking was once popular in English-speaking countries, but is less used now; tracking systems formed the basis of the Tripartite System in England and Wales until the 1970s, and in Northern Ireland until 2009. In the UK the term \\"Tracking\\" refers to recording data as to individual pupils progress, the term \\"Streaming\\" commonly translates to the meaning of Tracking in the sense of this article. Weak tracking systems have been used in American schools. In this approach, local schools assign students to classrooms according to their overall achievement, so that a given classroom is primarily composed of students with either high, average, or low academic achievement. Germany uses a tracked system. In Germany, students' achievements in their last of generally four years of primary school determine the type of secondary school they will be permitted to attend, and therefore the type of education they will receive. A tracking system has been in place since the advent of modern education in the Netherlands. After it was relaxed in the 70s and 80s, the tracking system has been gaining substantial strength again since the late 1990s. In Switzerland, at the end of primary school (or at the beginning of secondary school), pupils are separated (see Indicator C for Fribourg under Primary School) according to their capacities and career-intentions in several (often three) sections for a period of 2‚Äì3 years (Sekundarschule) in either Pre-higher secondary school section, General section, or Basic section (Basic may be called Realschule in German or Classe d'exigence de base in French). Students who aspire for an academic career enter Mittelschule (also named Gymnasium, or Kantonsschule, a public school by the canton/state) to be prepared for further studies and the Matura (normally obtained after 12 or 13 years of school usually at the age of 18 or 19). Students intending to pursue a trade or vocation complete three to four additional years before entering Vocational Educations. This so-called \\"dual system\\" splitting academic and vocational training has its continuation in the higher education system. While the academic training leads to the matura and free admission to universities, successfully completed vocational education gives access to third level of practical education, the H√∂here Fachschule (Schweiz). A Small Act and similarities to class-based tracking abroad The 2010 HBO documentary, A Small Act, documented the difficulty of Kenyan students being able to afford attending secondary schools. These elite schools were viewed as pathway to law school, medical school, and other forms of advanced education. Students who were kicked out of school for insufficient funds were fated to lives of poverty. In Kenya, having only a primary school education prepared one for menial labor, while secondary school equated to future social mobility for poor Kenyan children. The Kenyan system of education closely mirrored tracking in American high schools where students in college-preparatory tracks were able to attend four-year universities immediately after graduation and vocationally tracked students could only enter community colleges and technical schools. Middle-class Kenyans were more likely to complete secondary schools and attend college, similar to college- preparatory students in the United States. Despite displaying promising academic ability, both low track students in the United States and poor children in Kenya can be at disadvantages in their educational advancement. For those in the United States, they acquire vocational skills at the sacrifice of reaching their full academic potential and the job security of a college education. The prospects for poor children in Kenya are even worse, having acquired few job skills in their primary school education. Poor children in Kenya did have the opportunity to gain admission to secondary schools through merit scholarships, which required that students attained satisfactory scores on entrance examinations. There were indeed opportunities for bright poor children, but merit scholarships were limited in the number of students who could be awarded. In the United States, bright students in vocational tracks can enroll in two-year universities, but they lack the scholarships and post-secondary funding of their college-preparatory counterparts. Vocational students negotiate with the burden of scant financial support for college, and poor Kenyan children have the stress of passing entrance examinations even if they have academic ability similar to that of middle-class children or those in college-preparatory tracks. Detracking Detracking occurs when students are deliberately positioned into classes of mixed ability. As opposed to tracking, students are no longer placed in groups based upon academic achievement or ability.Hallinan, M. (1005) Tracking and Detracking Practices: Relevance for Learning. Transforming Schools. Tracking can be associated with giving students in low-track classes less resources, fewer experienced teachers, low expectations, and unchallenging curricula.Brewer, D., & Rees, D. (1995). Detracking America's Schools: The Reform without Cost? Phi Delta Kappan, 77. Retrieved from: Online: Proponents for detracking believe that low-track students will greatly benefit in school achievement if they are mixed in with high-track students. =Benefits of detracking= Critics of tracking such as Kevin Welner say that detracking will help close the class-based and race-based achievement gap. Often students in low-track classes are disadvantaged racial and ethnic minority students.Burris, C., & Welner, K. (2005). A Special Section on the Achievement Gap-Closing the Achievement Gap by Detracking. Phi Delta Kappan, 86. Retrieved from https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst;jsessionid=MY2YJljsCFJyzltpDmFp7fMbLNVjTS7WswJfvTK49FZJC29k057Z!1380883283!427202863?docId=5009329171 Those in favor of detracking say that detracking challenges social views about race and intelligence. Tracking has been shown to produce less academic achievement for low-ability students, and higher academic achievement for high-ability students; de-tracking would increase the achievement of the worst students and harm the achievement of the best students. Critics say that not challenging all students with the most advanced curriculum results in overall low student educational achievement, and that students in low tracks do not learn as much as their peers in higher tracks, e.g., advanced mathematics.Oakes, J., & Stuart, A. (2000). Change Agentry and the Quest for Equity: Lessons from Detracking Schools. The Sharpe Edge of Educational Change: Teaching, Leading, and the Realities of Reform. Teachers typically have higher expectations for students in high-track classes and low expectations for students in low-tracked classes, which affects the self-image of students. =Concerns of detracking= Detracking has been proven to reduce the achievement of students who would otherwise be placed in high-track classes. Parents of high-ability students and other proponents of tracking say that academically gifted students should have access to classes that maximize their potential. Detracking holds back high-ability students because teachers must reduce the amount and complexity of material so that all students in the class, including low-ability students, can understand it. Putting all students together in a heterogeneous group makes the teacher's job more difficult by increasing the range of performance of the students in a class. The teachers' perception of a students' academic abilities determines how detracking is carried out in the classroom. For example, in a school with many disadvantaged students, teachers assumed most students had low ability, and therefore the classroom curriculum was easier than what the students were capable of achieving. On the other side, in a wealthy school, teachers typically assumed students were college-bound and intelligent, and followed a creative and challenging curriculum. Proposed reforms Maureen Hallinan offers many suggestions for reforming the tracking system and counterbalancing its perceived negative consequences. Although tracking can segregate students by race and socioeconomic status, she says that, by ensuring that students are engaged in integrated settings during the school day, some of the negative effects of the segregation could be avoided. Some studies suggest that low- track students often have slower academic growth than high-track students, but Hallinan says that providing more-engaging lessons in class, altering assumptions about students, and raising requirements for students' performance could help. Research is needed in this area to test her hypotheses. In order to prevent stigmatization of low-track students, Hallinan suggests that schools challenge low-track students to achieve highly and should offer public rewards for gains in academic achievement. Such rewards would be necessary in all tracks to avoid the perception of unfairness. Heterogeneous class assignment with part-time homogeneous groupings is one possible compromise. Allen Graubard suggests that creating \\"small schools\\" within larger school systems would be a progressive proposal for reformation. The school experience could be reformatted by having students select programs themselves that cover both traditional learning as well as vocational real-world experiences. Reform would also benefit from improving the instruction that is provided to students within the classroom. In order to have all students benefit from eliminating tracking, teachers must have the tools to teach all students, as well as the tools to decrease stigma that may arise from students who feel that they are at different learning levels from their peers. There is evidence that as it stands, many teachers are not given proper training to teach/guide differentiated classrooms. In order to successfully accomplish a reformation of the educational experience, teachers and faculty must be provided the proper time and support to complete training.

How is the existence of the independent universe to be scientifically studied? If people set up a camera to photograph the moon when they are not looking at it, then at best they determine that there is an image of the moon in the camera when they eventually look at it. Logically, this does not assure that the moon itself (or even the camera) existed at the time the photograph is supposed to have been taken. To establish that it is an image of an independent moon requires many other assumptions that amount to begging the question. This relates to Kantian transcendental aspects of the world, in which a new factor can be included, if the current axioms neither validate nor invalidate it. The continuum hypothesis and the axiom of choice, are examples of possible transcendental decision points. Solipsism in its weak form is characterized by the repeated decision not to accept transcendental factors, a logical minimalism. In its strong form, the denial of the existence of an argument for the existence of an independent universe may be justified in principle in an empirical manner. Whether the nonexistence of a proof means the nonexistence of the entity is a transcendental choice.

Greenbelt Alliance promotes the creation of walkable neighborhoods with a mix of shops, homes, and jobs near public transit. The organization encourages cities to adopt smart growth policies, to accommodate the Bay Area's increasing population while protecting open space and making the region's cities better places to live. It has been involved in the adoption of urban growth boundaries in more than 20 cities and 5 counties in the Bay Area. These boundaries draw a line to define where growth should and should not go, and are generally either adopted by voters through the initiative process, or by city councils or county boards of supervisors. Greenbelt Alliance works to get Bay Area residents involved in their local urban planning processes and development decisions. To help people learn more about the region's open space and its cities, the organization leads hikes, farm tours, and urban walks throughout the Bay Area that are open to the public. It also endorses development proposals that meet smart growth guidelines and include homes people can afford. Greenbelt Alliance publishes reports on land-use policy, affordable housing, smart growth, sprawl development, open space protection, and farming. Recent publications include: * At Risk: The Bay Area Greenbelt -- A regular survey of the region's land at risk of sprawl development. The 2017 report found that of Bay Area farms, ranches, and natural lands are at risk of development in the next 30 years. At Risk: The Bay Area Greenbelt * HomeGrown -- A collection of creative tools and strategies that are working around the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond to support local agriculture, including five things that each county can do to help farms and ranches succeed. HomeGrown: Tools for Local Farms and Ranches * Fixing the Foundation -- A resource for decision-makers, city planners, and interested residents that identifies the top 10 barriers to infill housing development across 12 major Bay Area cities and provides local solutions for overcoming these barriers. The accompanying city-by-city analysis applies the report findings to each of the 12 cities, offering specific recommendations for local, tangible impact in the Bay Area. Fixing the Foundation: Local Solutions for Infill Housing * Bay Area Smart Growth Scorecard -- An evaluation of the policies of all 109 cities and counties in the Bay Area to assess how well each is doing at preparing for regional growth. On average, cities scored 34%; counties scored 51%. The report won a statewide award from the American Planning Association. * Smart Infill -- A guidebook for planners, decision-makers, and interested residents on how to encourage good infill development‚Äîgrowth within existing cities to create walkable neighborhoods. Greenbelt Alliance is involved in statewide efforts in California to fight climate change through better land use. This is based on the idea that transportation is the largest contributor of greenhouse gases, and transportation is dictated by land use. Put another way, if homes and jobs are built far apart, people will drive more, and that will have a negative impact on the Earth's climate. Greenbelt Alliance advocates for changing how cities are built‚Äîfocusing new development in downtowns and around transit stations‚Äîto reduce driving and so reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  History  Greenbelt Alliance was founded in 1958 as an organization called Citizens for Regional Recreation and Parks. One of its first campaigns was helping to halt the filling of San Francisco Bay for development. In 1969, the organization was renamed People for Open Space to reflect the organization's additional interest in preserving ranch lands, agricultural lands, and wildlife preserves. In the 1970s, People for Open Space helped to establish a public park district called the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District (1972), as well as Suisun Marsh (1974). It was also involved in campaigning for a regional government for the Bay Area, but was defeated in Sacramento by one vote. In 1976, People for Open Space added the goal of establishing a permanent regional greenbelt to its agenda, and in 1984 created a group called Greenbelt Congress to work on open space protection through activism and grassroots organizing. In 1987, Greenbelt Congress and People for Open Space merged to become Greenbelt Alliance, and established a dual focus of grassroots activism and policy research. Greenbelt Alliance expanded outside San Francisco with a field office in the South Bay in 1988. In 1995, East Bay and Sonoma-Marin field offices opened their doors, and in 2001, a Solano-Napa office opened in response to growth along the Interstate 80 corridor between San Francisco and Sacramento. In the 1990s and 2000s, Greenbelt Alliance was involved in stopping sprawl development proposals and protecting Pleasanton Ridge (1993), Bear Creek RedwoodsBear Creek OSP (accessed 2 Nov 2010)(1999), and Cowell Ranch/John Marsh SHPCowell Ranch/John Marsh SHP, CA State Parks (accessed 2 Nov 2010) (2002) as state parks or open space preserves. It helped to create the Santa Clara Valley Open Space Authority in 1994, and was part of defeating a freeway proposal called the Mid-State Toll Road in 1995. Greenbelt Alliance has acted as the fiscal sponsor for several organizations, including: the Transportation and Land Use Coalition (now an independent organization); the Bay Area Open Space Council; the San Francisco Housing Action Coalition; and the Bay Area Environmental Education Resource Fair.

Early life Thomas A. Thacher was born in Hartford, Connecticut, the son of Anne (n√©e Parks) and Peter Thacher. His first American ancestor on his father's side was Thomas Thacher who emigrated from England to Massachusetts in 1635, and later became minister of the Old South Church in Boston; on his mother's side he was descended from the Rev. Thomas Buckingham of Saybrook, one of the founders of the Collegiate School of Connecticut, since known as Yale College. He had his preparatory training at the Hopkins Grammar School, Hartford, and graduated from Yale with the class of 1835; where he was a member of Skull and Bones. Career For a short time he held a temporary teaching position in New Canaan, Connecticut, and then went to a school in Georgia, which was later to become Oglethorpe University. In all he spent three years teaching in two academies in Georgia, returning to Yale College on Dec. 1, 1838, to take the position of tutor. He was appointed assistant professor of Latin and Greek in 1842 and one year later the title was restricted to Latin and he was given a year's leave of absence for study in Europe. This year was eventually extended to two years and from 1843 to 1845 he studied in Germany and Italy. While in Berlin he instructed the Crown Prince of Prussia, and his cousin, Prince Frederick Charles. Six years after his return to Yale he was made professor of Latin. He was long a trustee of Hopkins Grammar School in New Haven and was a member of the state board of education 1866-77. He was on the committee for building the Yale Art School, serving with President Noah Porter and Professor Daniel Coit Gilman. Thacher was identified with Yale College more closely than any of his contemporaries. President Timothy Dwight V said of him, \\"His influence with the Faculty and the Corporation equaled or even surpassed that of any other College officer.\\" This extraordinary position was due not primarily to his scholarship, although he had the reputation of being a sound and thorough scholar, but to his keen interest and constant activity in the management of college affairs both faculty and undergraduate. Before the day of deans, Thacher did much of the work which a dean would perform today. He was known as one of the best disciplinarians that the college ever had and yet he retained the devotion and affection of undergraduates to an extraordinary degree. As an undergraduate he had been \\"exuberant in spirit,\\" and one who was a student under him in Yale writes of \\"Tutor Thacher, the florid and fiery, of perpetual youth and enthusiasm.\\" He and Professor Theodore Dwight Woolsey were the first advocates at Yale of graduate instruction in non-technical fields and he himself was one of the first classicists to go abroad for the advancement of his scholarship. This scholarship was never very productive. He edited Cicero's De Officiis in 1850, and largely as a result of his work with Karl Zumpt in Berlin he published in 1871 A Latin Grammar for the Use of Schools, a translation of the work of Johan Nikolai Madvig. Aside from these productions, a few slight essays and book reviews in the New Englander make up his professional output. A teacher always, rather than an investigator, he seems even to have had a slightly suspicious attitude toward those who gave too much time to research. Even in his teaching he was possibly too much of a disciplinarian and was sometimes thought to stick too rigorously to the grammar. To his work as administrator, Thacher brought exceptional qualifications and in this line lay his great achievements. As a teacher he contributed his share to the department's prestige while, with his strong convictions and fearless courage, his energy in raising and administering funds, his interest in people, his wide acquaintance with Yale alumni, and his devout and conscientious character, he played a larger role in the building of modern Yale than that of any one of his contemporaries. -- Clarence W. Mendell Family On Sept. 16, 1846, he married Olivia Day, better known as Livy, the daughter of President Jeremiah Day of Yale. She died on May 18, 1858, leaving five sons, and on Aug. 1, 1860, he married her cousin Elizabeth Baldwin Sherman, who with three sons and one daughter survived him. Both wives were granddaughters of founding father Roger Sherman. His son Thomas Thacher was a prominent lawyer. His sons Sherman Day Thacher and William Larned Thacher were the founders of the Thacher School in Ojai, California; and his daughter Elizabeth Sherman Thacher married William Kent. He was also the paternal grandfather of US Solicitor General Thomas D. Thacher and Molly Kazan, and the great-great-grandfather of actress and writer Zoe Kazan.

Public rights cannot be vindicated by private citizens. A right must normally be a private right to be vindicated in court. An exception to this general proposition is found in Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83 (1968). In Flast, the U.S. Supreme Court held that a private citizen could challenge the constitutionality of a federal tax if the citizen established \\"a logical link between [their] status [as a taxpayer] and the type of legislative enactment attacked [and] . . . a nexus between that status and the precise nature of the constitutional infringement alleged.\\" In Australia, public rights is an entitlement enjoyed by the community, in contrast to a private or personal entitlement.

Toadshade can be distinguished from other Trillium species by its single, foul smelling, stalkless, flower nestled in the middle of its three bracts. The bracts are sometimes, but not always mottled with shades of light and dark green. The specific epithet comes from the Latin word sessilis which means low sitting, referring to its stalkless flower. Description Trillium sessile has three oval to nearly circular bracts, up to long and across. The bracts are green or sometimes bluish, typically with mottling which fades as the flower matures. Each flower has three sepals and three petals. The petals are typically maroon or brownish, sometimes green or yellowish green, up to long and broad. It flowers between May and June. This plant is clump forming from a thick rhizome. The above ground parts of the plant die back by mid-summer, but may persist longer in areas that do not completely dry out. Taxonomy Population with yellow-green petals Uncommon, green flowered forms of this plant are sometimes classified as Trillium sessile f. viridiflorum Beyer. , Kew's Plants of the World Online accepts no infraspecific taxa for Trillium sessile. The term Trillium sessile var. luteum used by some nurseries may cause confusion, since this is an older synonym for Trillium luteum, not of T. sessile. Ecology Trillium sessile is most common in rich, moist woods but also can be found in limestone woods, flood plains, and along fence rows. It is persistent under light pasturing. The foul smelling flowers attract its primary pollinators, flies and beetles.Missouri Plants: T. sessile The seeds have an elaiosome which attracts ants and wasps such as Vespula species. This fatty appendage increases the range of seed dispersal. Conservation Toadshade is listed as state threatened in Michigan and state endangered in New York; both states are on the northern edge of its range. It is threatened by habitat fragmentation, deer browse, and invasive species such as Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) and wild boar (Sus scrofa). Uses Although some accounts indicate that the cooked greens of this plant may be edible as an emergency food, the entire plant, and especially the root, is known to induce vomiting. The fruit is considered a suspected poison. Trillium sessile has been used medicinally to treat tumors. T. sessile is sometimes cited as having been used as a poultice for boils and as a panacea-like decoction, but this is doubtful as it is attributed to Native American tribes (the Yuki and Wailaki) of California, where this plant is not known to occur. This plant is sometimes used in woodland wildflower gardens. Like many trilliums, T. sessile often does not transplant successfully from the wild.

The shorter the average E2K time, the more timely an organization‚Äôs financial information will be.  Importance of E2K  Timeliness is one of the most important characteristics of financial information. The more timely information is, the more relevant it is to the reader. E2K helps organizations focus and improve their internal accounting processes. E2K measures a number of events. Firstly, it considers the time for a sub-ledger or supporting system to record an event. If a sub-ledger performs no reporting on its own and it posts to the general ledger on a batch basis (nightly, weekly, monthly, etc.); then this will elongate the E2K time. The faster the general ledger can report the impact of an event, the smaller the E2K value. Waiting for all accounting journals to be posted, balancing, reconciliation and producing paper reports adds to the E2K time. There are two key E2K measures, the maximum and average E2K values. The maximum value is the time from when the first transaction is entered in a system during a new fiscal period to when it is reported. An average E2K time may be for an entire system or a sub- component. For example, E2K can be reported by each sub-ledger (accounts payable, payroll, manufacturing, etc.) or for the entire system.  Best E2K practice  Organizations can reduce their E2K time through a number of strategies: 1\\\\. Implementing and upgrading systems to take advantage of faster close cycles 2\\\\. Use of workflow technologies to communicate exceptions and critical events to those responsible 3\\\\. Reporting Marts and the like away from the OLTP system for internal reporting 4\\\\. Adjust accounting cycles to natural business cycles. 5\\\\. Benchmark and set targets to improve current practice.  References  Event to knowledge Frank Potter. CMA Management. Hamilton:Jul/Aug 2001.

He was the second son of Emperor Wen's son Yang Guang the Prince of Jin and Yang Guang's wife Princess Xiao. Yang Jian was considered handsome in his childhood, and Emperor Wen loved him. In 593, Emperor Wen created him the Prince of Yuzhang. As he grew in age, he studied the Confucian classics and histories. In 599, Emperor Wen made him the head of the legislative bureau (Neishi Sheng, ÂÖßÂè≤ÁúÅ), one of the five main bureaus of government. In 600, due to Yang Guang's machinations, Emperor Wen deposed Yang Jian's uncle Yang Yong the Crown Prince, and created Yang Guang crown prince instead. In 601, Yang Jian was made the commandant at Yang Province (ÊèöÂ∑û, roughly modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), to replace his father Yang Guang.Book of Sui, Vol. 59, Twenty-fourth biography (ÂàóÂÇ≥Á¨¨‰∫åÂçÅÂõõ) During Emperor Yang's reign =604‚Äì618= In 604, Emperor Wen died‚Äîa death that traditional historians, while admitting a lack of direct evidence, generally believed to be a murder ordered by Yang Guang. Yang Guang took the throne as Emperor Yang. In 606, Emperor Yang created Yang Jian the greater title of Prince of Qi. Soon thereafter, Yang Jian's older brother Yang Zhao the Crown Prince died, and while under traditional Confucian principles of succession, one of Yang Zhao's sons should be created crown prince, but Emperor Yang did not do so, creating Yang Zhao's sons only imperial princes, and it was commonly believed that Yang Jian would become crown prince. As a result, Yang Jian became particularly honored by others, and when Emperor Yang sought people to serve on Yang Jian's staff, young nobles were anxious to be included, and Yang Zhao's guards were transferred to Yang Jian. He was made the mayor of the eastern capital Luoyang as well. As a result, Yang Jian became arrogant, and he and his staff member often carried out illegal deeds, and he particularly liked to seize commoner women to make them his concubines. In one instance, his aunt Yang Lihua the Princess Leping initially offered a beautiful woman from the Liu () clan to Emperor Yang, but Emperor Yang did not act quickly, and the princess offered Lady Liu to Yang Jian instead. When Emperor Yang subsequently wanted Lady Liu, he found out that Yang Jian already took her, a fact that irritated him. The relationship between father and son further deteriorated when, on a visit to Yulin, they hunted together‚Äîas Emperor Yang's guards were able to kill few animals, they blamed Yang Jian's guards for taking all of the animals, which made Emperor Yang further irritated at Yang Jian. Emperor Yang began to investigate Yang Jian's faults. Soon, one incident gave Emperor Yang the excuse to investigate further‚Äîas one of Yang Jian's favorite officials, Huangfu Xu () the county magistrate of Yijue County (‰ºäÈóï, a suburb of Luoyang), was taken by Yang Jian to Fenyang Palace (Ê±æÈôΩÂÆÆ, in modern Linfen, Shanxi) in contravention of regulations that county magistrates were not allowed to leave their counties without good cause. The official Wei Deyu (), in order to please Emperor Yang, filed an indictment against Yang Jian. Emperor Yang sent his guards to Yang Jian's palace and searched it, seeking evidence of further wrongdoing, and they found a major scandal. Yang Jian's wife Princess Wei () had died sometime ago, and Yang Jian then carried out an affair with her sister Lady Wei () who had already married a man from the Yuan () clan. Believing in a fortuneteller who told him that Lady Wei would one day be empress and believing Yang Zhao's three sons to be in the way, Yang Jian engaged witches to curse his nephews. In anger, Emperor Yang executed some of Yang Jian's close associates and ordered Lady Wei to commit suicide. Emperor Yang commented, \\"I only have Yang Jian as a son; otherwise, I would have dragged him to the execution field and had him beheaded, to show the power of laws.\\" Yang Jian was not removed from his post, but thereafter exerted little influence. Emperor Yang sent a guard commander to watch over Yang Jian, with orders to report any wrongdoing immediately. He also gave Yang Jian a small number of guards, and those who were assigned to Yang Jian were all weak or old. There were few references to Yang Jian in history for the rest of Emperor Yang's reign. One such reference was in spring 610, when a number of people claiming to be incarnations of the Maitreya Buddha entered into Luoyang and seized weapons, intending to attack the palace, but before they could do so, Yang Jian encountered them. Yang Jian seized them and executed all of them. =618 and the coup's aftermath= In 618, with most of Sui territory engulfed in agrarian rebellions, Emperor Yang was at Jiangdu (Ê±üÈÉΩ, the capital of Yang Province), and Yang Jian was with him. A coup led by the general Yuwen Huaji killed Emperor Yang, with Emperor Yang initially stating to Empress Xiao, \\"Does not Ahai do this?\\" Doubting that it was Yang Jian who led the coup. The troops involved in the coup then went to arrest Yang Jian. Yang Jian, believing the troops to be sent by Emperor Yang, pleaded, \\"Honorable imperial messenger, please do not carry out the edict yet. I will surely not rebel against the state.\\" The troops did not respond, and they dragged Yang Jian and his two sons out to the streets and beheaded them. One of Yang Jian's concubines was pregnant at the time of his death. Later, she accompanied Yang Jian's mother Empress Xiao to Tujue to join Princess Yicheng (Áæ©ÊàêÂÖ¨‰∏ª), a Sui princess who had married G√∂kt√ºrk Shibi Khan Ashina Duojishi. Yang Jian's concubine had earlier given birth to a posthumous son, Yang Zhengdao, and Yang Zhengdao was created the King of Sui ()Gu√≥w√°ng () is a term of the monarch of a kingdom in Chinese (see Zhou dynasty), but in this case, the G√∂kt√ºrk Khaganate probably referred to Yang Zhengdao more as a client king than as the Chinese monarch, which was then competed between Sui princes Yang Hao, Yang Tong and other claimants. by Ashina Duojishi's brother and successor the Chuluo Khan Ashina Qilifu. Yang Zhengdao later returned to China during the reign of Emperor Taizong of Tang and was made Yuanwai sanqi shilang (). Yang Jian's male descendants through his only surviving son, Yang Shenjin and his two brothers, later were forced to commit suicide in 747 by Emperor Xuanzong due to their conspiracy with Yang Guozhong against the other Tang officials, ending the male-line of Sui imperial house of Yang.

Early and family life Born in Turkey Cove, Lee County, Virginia on February 27, 1842 to Jonathan Richmond (1805 - 1871) and his wife Mary Dickenson Richmond (1808 - 1879), James Richmond had many brothers and sisters. He attended Emory and Henry College, then read law. He married Sarah Elizabeth (Lizzie) Duncan (1845-1869) in 1864 and had a son (Henry C. L.Richmond) and daughter (Mary Elizabeth Richmond Cox Deisher) before her death. The year following Lizzie's death, Richmond married Catherine (Kate) Morison (1844-1911) of Scott County. His son, Henry C. L. Richmond, like his father became a lawyer and later married the daughter of Richmond's fellow 64th Virginia officer, Harvey Gray. Lewis Preston Summers, History of Southwest Virginia (1903) Career Richmond began his legal practice in the circuit and county court of Lee County and neighboring Scott and Wise Counties as well as in the court of appeals in Wytheville, Virginia. Confederate service As the American Civil War began, Richmond enlisted in the Confederate Army, as did his elder brothers William, Jonathan and Henry (although Jonathan died of typhus in August 1861). James Richmond initially served as an orderly sergeant and was promoted to captain of Company A of the 15th Virginia Infantry. When that was consolidated with the 64th Virginia Mounted Infantryin late 1863 (where his brother William was a Captain), James Richmond received a promotion to major and later another promotion to lieutenant colonel. He served under Col. Auburn Pridemore (whom he later defeated to represent the same Congressional district). Political career After Virginia surrendered and James Richmond and his brothers received pardons, he resumed his legal practice. Lee County voters elected him to represent them (part time) in the Virginia House of Delegates in 1873 and he served from 1874 until 1875. Richmond succeeded William P. Queen and was succeeded by Democrat Ira Robinette. In 1878, advocating sound money, Richmond defeated Congressman Pridemore in the primary, and was elected as a Democrat to the United States House of Representatives. He served a single term, from 1879 to 1881, losing in the Democratic primary to fellow Confederate veteran Abram Fulkerson, who helped organize the Readjuster Party but retired after one term. In 1886, the Virginia General Assembly elected Richmond judge for Scott County, Virginia. He served for six years, from 1886 to 1892. He then became chief counsel of the South Atlantic & Ohio Railroad Company for several years, and also engaged in banking. Richmond also represented Scott County at the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1902, which disenfranchised black and poor white voters, but attempted to modernize treatment of corporations. Death and legacy Richmond died at Johns Hopkins hospital in Baltimore, Maryland on April 30, 1910.http://genealogytrails.com/vir/scott/obituaries.html His widow would also be interred in Estill Cemetery in Gate City, Virginia the following year. His son Henry C.L. Richmond, who also attended Emory and Henry College before becoming a lawyer, served as Commonwealth Attorney of Scott County 1891-1895, and again 1919-1920, resigning when elected mayor of Gate City in 1920. He was a Republican like Campbell Slemp and his son C. Bascom Slemp, who were both born less than a mile from James B.

Similar to projects like Lull and Lustmord, Atrium Carceri uses synthesizers, sound effects, samples from films and anime, piano and other instrumentation to create slow rhythms, bitter melodies and complex textures generally based on themes of desolation, loneliness (solitary confinement) and environmental decay. Atrium Carceri has been praised by music critics and embraced by a cult audience for its depth of atmosphere.http://www.maelstrom.nu/ezine/review_iss16_1280.php According to Heath himself, each of Atrium Carceri's solo releases are centered around specific 'story arcs' within a 'grand story,' and following the releases of Reliquiae and Void in 2012, has made a flowchart detailing the story progression up to that point.

Sphyraena barracuda in French Polynesia Great barracuda is blue-gray above, fading to silvery and chalky-white below. Sometimes, a row of darker cross- bars occurs on its upper side, with black blotches on each lower side. The second dorsal fin and the anal and caudal fins range from dark violet to black with white tips. In general, barracudas are elongated fish with powerful jaws. The lower jaw of the large mouth juts out beyond the upper. Barracudas possess strong, fang-like teeth that are unequal in size and set in sockets in the jaws and on the roof of the mouth. The head is quite large and is pointed and pike-like in appearance. The gill covers do not have spines and are covered with small scales. The two dorsal fins are widely separated, with the first having five spines and the second having one spine and 9 soft rays. The second dorsal fin equals the anal fin in size and is situated more or less above it. The lateral line is prominent and extends straight from head to tail. The spinous dorsal fin is situated above the pelvis. The hind end of the caudal fin is forked or concave, and it is set at the end of a stout peduncle. The pectoral fins are placed low down on the sides. The barracuda has a large swim bladder. Behavior and biology Great barracuda with prey Barracudas appear in open seas. They are voracious predators and hunt by ambush. They rely on surprise and short bursts of speed (up to 27 mph (43 km/h) to overrun their prey, sacrificing maneuverability. Barracudas are more or less solitary in their habits. Young and half-grown fish frequently congregate in shoals. Barracudas can reach at least 14 years of age. The spawning season lasts from April to October. Females can release about 5,000 to 30,000 eggs. The diets of these top predators of reefs are composed almost totally of fish, cephalopods, and occasionally shrimp. Large barracudas, when gorged, may attempt to herd a school of prey fish in shallow water where they guard over them until they are ready for another hunt. Barracudas and humans Barracudas are scavengers, and may mistake snorkelers for large predators, following them in hopes of eating the remains of their prey. Swimmers have been reported being bitten by barracuda, but such incidents are rare and possibly caused by poor visibility. Barracudas may mistake objects that glint and shine for prey.Florida Museum of Natural History Ichthyology Department Barracuda attacks on humans are rare, although bites can result in lacerations and the loss of some tissue. They are also frequently caught as a source of sustenance, though they are known for the strong odor they release upon being caught.

Early life Charles Chewings was born the third son of John Chewings, a pastoralist, and his wife Sarah (n√©e Wall) at Woorkongoree station, near Burra, South Australia. He was educated by a tutor and at Prince Alfred College, Adelaide. After engaging in sheep farming, Chewings travelled to the Finke River in Central Australia in 1881 with two camels and found them so useful that he imported more of them and started a carrying business. He gave some account of his explorations in his The Sources of the Finke River (1886). Chewings married Miss F. M. Braddock in 1887, and they had two sons and two daughters. Career Chewings went to Europe in 1888 and studied geology at University College London and University of Heidelberg, obtaining the degree of Ph.D. After returning to Australia, Chewings worked in Western Australia reporting on mines before going back to South Australia to resume camel carrying. He was much interested in the Indigenous Australians and made a careful study of them. Chewings was very interested by the discovery of marine fossils on Tempe Downs station by his manager F. Thornton and in 1891 published \\"Geological notes on the Upper Finke Basin\\" in the Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of South Australia. He listed the fossils and began a tentative interpretation of the region's succession of rock strata. Chewings became a mining consultant in Coolgardie, Western Australia, in 1894, and later worked in Central Australia for almost 20 years. Late life After the First World War, Chewings retired to Adelaide and contributed several more scientific papers relating to central Australia to the Transactions. He worked on a dictionary of the Aranda language and towards the end of 1936 published a popular book on the Indigenous Australians titled Back in the Stone Age. He died on 9 June 1937 and was buried in West Terrace Cemetery. Chewings was a fellow of the Geological Society of London and of the Berlin Geological Society.

Early life Chevalier was born in St Petersburg, Russia, the son of Louis Chevalier, who came from Vaud, Switzerland, and was overseer to the estates of the Prince de Wittgenstein in Russia. Nicholas' mother was Russian. Nicholas left Russia with his father in 1845, and studied painting and architecture in Lausanne, Switzerland and at Munich. The materials used in this painting are oil paints on canvas. Career Chevalier's 1864 painting The Buffalo Ranges was the first painting of an Australian subject added to the National Gallery of Victoria's art collection In 1851 Chevalier moved to London and worked as an illustrator in lithography and watercolour. He also designed a fountain which was erected in the royal grounds at Osborne, and two of his paintings were hung at the Academy in 1852. Further study in painting followed at Rome. In late 1854 Chevalier sailed from London to Australia on board the 'Swallow' to join his father and brother, and arrived in Melbourne on 25 December. In August 1855 he obtained work as a cartoonist on the newly established Melbourne Punch. Later he did illustrative work for the Illustrated Australian News and also worked in chromolithography. He accompanied explorer/meteorologist Georg von Neumayer on trips to remote areas of Victoria, and the material gathered on such journeys resulted in some of his most recognised pieces of this period, including his painting of Mount Arapiles in Western Victoria. In 1864, when the National Gallery of Victoria was founded, an exhibition of works by Victorian artists was held. The government agreed to buy the best picture exhibited for ¬£200. Chevalier's oil painting The Buffalo Ranges was selected, and was the first picture painted in Australia to be included in the Melbourne collection. In 1865 Chevalier visited New Zealand, travelling widely and doing much work there which was exhibited at Melbourne on his return. In 1869 he joined as an artist with the Duke of Edinburgh, on the voyage to the East and back to London with stops in Tahiti, Hawaii, Japan, China, Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and India. The pictures painted during the voyage were exhibited at South Kensington. In January 1874 Chevalier was commissioned by Queen Victoria to travel to St Petersburg and paint a picture of the marriage of the Duke of Edinburgh. Chevalier made London his base and was a continual exhibitor at the Academy from 1871 to 1887. He had one picture in the 1895 Academy but had practically given up painting by then. Chevalier died in London on 15 March 1902. Legacy Self-portrait, 1857 Chevalier married Caroline Wilkie in 1855, a relative of Sir David Wilkie, who survived him. Chevalier was a man of much personal charm and spoke fluent French, English, Russian, German, Italian and Portuguese. He was a good amateur musician being second violinist in the Royal Amateur Orchestral Society which had been started by officers in the Galatea and in which the duke was first violin. The Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, the Dunedin Public Art Gallery (New Zealand), the Honolulu Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Victoria, the Ballarat Fine Art Gallery, Art Gallery of New South Wales and the National Library of Australia (Canberra) are among the public collections holding works by Nicholas Chevalier. In 2011 Nicholas Chevalier was the subject of a major survey exhibition and publication, 'Australian Odyssey', mounted by the Gippsland Art Gallery, and subsequently toured to the Geelong Gallery, Victoria.

Life She was born Anna Maria Gallo, the daughter of Francesco Gallo and Barbara Basinsin, in the Quartieri Spagnoli (Spanish Quarter) of Naples, a red-light district of the city, still known for its high crime. According to tradition, another saint, the Jesuit, Francis de Geronimo, predicted her future sanctity while she was still an infant. Her family was of the middle class, but her father, a weaver of gold lace, was a very violent man, who regularly abused his family physically, often severely.Heckmann, Ferdinand. \\"St. Mary Frances of the Five Wounds of Jesus.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 6 Aug. 2013 When Gallo was sixteen, her father attempted to force her into a marriage with a young man of means who was seeking her hand. She refused and asked to join the Franciscan Third Order, through which she could live out a religious life in the family home. The friars of Naples were part of the reform of Peter of Alcantara, and they and the tertiaries under their rule were known for the strictness of their lives. Through the intervention of a friar, Father Theophilus, permission to enter the Order was eventually granted by her father. Gallo was received into the Order on 8 September 1731 and began wearing the religious habit of the Order, which was an uncommon practice by that era. She also adopted the use of the religious name she took upon being received into the Order, out of her devotion to the Blessed Mother, Francis of Assisi and the Passion of Christ. She continued to live in the family home to serve God as a consecrated virgin, as was customary in those days.The Franciscan Book of Saints, ed. by Marion Habig, ofm., Franciscan Herald Press, 1959 She took as her spiritual director, the Franciscan friar, John Joseph of the Cross, while her confessor was the Barnabite priest, Francis Xavier Bianchi, and she began to be known among her neighbors for her work of charity, helping the poor of the sector. She was a person of deep prayer, often spending long hours in meditation. In 1753 she joined with another Franciscan tertiary, known only as Maria Felice, and they moved into a small palace owned by a priest, Giovanni Pessiri, who became their spiritual director. The two women occupied the second floor, sleeping on the floor, and the priest the floor above. She is said to have received the wounds of the stigmata while living there and suffered patiently many physical afflictions and spiritual trials. She would wear gloves to cover the marks on her hands, while she did her work. She is also said to have had visions of Raphael the Archangel, who healed her of several afflictions.\\"Archangel Raphael\\", Queen of Angels Foundation Veneration Gallo was buried in the Franciscan Church of Santa Lucia al Monte in Naples, which she attended during her life. This church also contains the tomb of John Joseph, now also declared a saint. Gallo was declared Venerable by Pope Pius VII, on 18 May 1803. She was beatified by Pope Gregory XVI on 12 November 1843. She was soon canonized by Pope Pius IX on 29 June 1867. Her feast day is celebrated on 6 October. She was the first woman from Naples to have been declared a saint by the Catholic Church. Devotion to Gallo has long continued to be strong in the neighborhood where she lived, and of which she is the patron saint. The residents credit her intercession with the little damage the sector endured during World War II, when over 100 bombs were dropped on it. Her home has been preserved as a chapel and museum. Pope Pius IX, who canonized Gallo, declared her to be a patroness of expectant mothers and of women having difficulty conceiving. She is also the patroness of the Gallo World Family Foundation, which was founded to promote the development of Judeo-Christian values in the betterment of the world by members of the Gallo family scattered worldwide. On 6 October 2001, her remains were transferred from the Church of Santa Lucia to the house where she had spent the last half of her life. It is now the Shrine of St. Mary Frances of the Five Wounds. It is still a common practice for expectant mothers to go there to be blessed with her relic. Many votive offerings from mothers who credit her with their successful deliveries are displayed in the sanctuary. In Scotland, Margaret Sinclair took the religious name Sister Mary Francis of the Five Wounds during her short-lived vocation in London. Her major shrine in St Patrick's Church, Edinburgh has been given status by both Pope Paul VI declaration, and Pope John Paul II description of The Blessed Margaret as being \\"one of God‚Äôs little ones who, through her very simplicity, was touched by God with the strength of real holiness of life.\\" References 1715 births 1791 deaths 18th-century Neapolitan people Members of the Third Order of Saint Francis Stigmatics Franciscan saints 18th-century Christian saints Italian Roman Catholic saints Canonizations by Pope Pius IX Angelic visionaries Christian female saints of the Early Modern era 18th-century Italian women ","title":"Mary Frances of the Five Wounds"},{"id":"9657837","text":"Vulgaires Machins is a French Canadian punk rock group from Granby, Quebec.

This occurs mainly in the wet seasons of the Quaternary.In this geological time span (2,5 million years to the present) of weathering, erosion and denudation of the mountain range, the river and the river valley have shaped their modern morphology. The river was probably much larger in those days, transporting large woody debris, sand, gravel, boulders and water in bigger quantities.

Its name is ‚ÄúKatsana‚Äù.See External Links: Map of Katsana, Achaea, the area of valley by toponavigator Ancient Greece Pausanias (110-180 AD) in his book ‚ÄúDescription of Greece‚Äù (Ancient Greek: ·ºôŒªŒªŒ¨Œ¥ŒøœÇ Œ†ŒµœÅŒπŒÆŒ≥Œ∑œÉŒπœÇ) already used the name ‚ÄúAroanios‚Äù for the valley's river.Pausanias, Description of Greece.

That river flows generally southwest bound and pours into River Erymanthos at the community Psofida. The karst springs The karst springs of River Aroanios (for other karst springs on the Peloponnese see :el:ŒöŒ±œÅœÉœÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆ œÄŒ∑Œ≥ŒÆ) emerge in a small forest of ‚Äûplane trees‚Äú (580x30m) next to the village of Planitero (Achaea). The plane trees obviously benefit from the karst springs water. The very small outlets together issue a huge amount of karst water after a fairly short distance. They feed River Aroanios. A detailed international geological study lists 41 of these spring outlets.A. Morfis, etal, p. 123 According to this study the waters of the outlets emerge directly from local karstic rock layers, which outcrop here, or they rise from the loose Sedimentation (Silicate minerals, sand and gravel). Rainbow trout farms, restaurants and displays of tourist ware crowd the whole area. In summer the forest is part of an excursion for residents, who come in busses and private cars even from Patras, despite the long distance. Environment and nature The springs under the wooded area are an extraordinaryly valuable piece of nature - a true ‚ÄúGeotope‚Äú - rare not only in Greece.

The main reservoirs of Stenotrophomonas are soil and plants. Stenotrophomonas species range from common soil organisms (S. nitritireducens) to opportunistic human pathogens (S. maltophilia), the molecular taxonomy of the genus is still somewhat unclear.  Importance  The most common species, S. maltophilia is very versatile and can be beneficial for plant growth and health, can be used in agriculture, biocontrol, bioremediation and phytoremediation strategies as well as the production of biomolecules of economic value. On the other hand, some of S. maltophilia strains are pathogenic to humans with multidrug resistant profile. S. indologenes can also cause or be part of polymicrobial infections in humans, especially small children. Stenotrophomonas can also be phytopathogenic unlike closely related genera Xylella and Xanthomonas. Members of the genus Stenotrophomonas have an important ecological role in the nitrogen and sulphur cycles. Stenotrophomonas species, especially S. maltophilia and S. rhizophila, are often found in association with plants, such as cucumber, oilseed rape, potato, strawberry, alfalfa, sunflower, maize, rice, wheat, various weeds, willow and poplar. Stenotrophomonas can be isolated from the rhizosphere or from internal plant tissues, particularly from the vascular tissues of the root and stem.  History  The first species described was S. maltophila by Hugh and Ryschenko in 1961. At the time it was named Pseudomonas maltophilia, but later transferred to the genus Xanthomonas before it was given its own genus. The genus name (from the Greek ‚Äòstenos‚Äô, meaning narrow, ‚Äòtrophus‚Äô, meaning one who feeds and ‚Äòmonas‚Äô, meaning unit) was intended to highlight the limited nutritional range of the bacterium. However, several studies subsequently demonstrated that the genus is capable of great metabolic versatility and intraspecific heterogeneity.  Genetics  Full genome sequence of an environmental isolate, S. maltophilia R551‚Äë3, and a clinical isolate, S. maltophilia K279a, are available. Both strains contain genes that encode type I pili, which have been implicated in adhesion and the early stages of biofilm formation, and type IV pili, which have been implicated in adherence, auto-aggregation, twitching motility and biofilm formation. Conserved distribution of pili-coding gene clusters in sequenced genomes may indicate similarities in the plant and animal colonization strategies. The identification of Stenotrophomonas spp. is problematic, as these bacteria show no activities in most of the standard metabolism-based phenotyping panels. Additionally, the species are genotypically similar, with 95.7‚Äì99.6% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities. One of the housekeeping genes gyrB, encoding the B-subunit of the DNA gyrase , has successfully employed for typing. Moreover, gyrB sequence comparisons, indicate that strains identified as S. maltophilia may represent distinct new species. Small palindromic elements that carry tetranucleotide GTAG at one terminus were found to be widespread in the genome of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The repeats are species-specific variants of the superfamily of repetitive extragenic palindromes (REPs). Hundreds of genes are immediately flanked by these repeats and they likely function as RNA control sequences by the folding of the repeats in the mRNA and either stabilizing upstream transcripts or favoring their degradation.  Metabolism  Stenotrophomonas spp. can efficiently colonize such different biotopes as plants, humans and marine environments. Stenotrophomonas spp. metabolize a large range of organic compounds present in the rhizosphere, including phenolic compounds found in plant root exudates. S. maltophilia can degrade p‚Äënitrophenol and 4‚Äëchlorophenol, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, selenium compounds, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xenobiotics. Stenotrophomonas spp. produces plant growth hormone indole‚Äë3‚Äëacetic acid (IAA), it can also promote plant growth due to nitrogen fixation and the oxidation of elemental sulphur, which in turn provides sulphate for the plants. Many S. maltophilia strains have intrinsic resistance to various heavy metals. Most S. maltophilia isolates produce antifungal compounds, such as maltophilin and xanthobaccin or volatile organic compounds with antifungal activity. S. maltophilia strains have an extraordinarily high hydrolytic potential; they produce diverse proteases, chitinases, glucanases, DNases, RNases, lipases and laccases. S. maltophilia are equipped for iron uptake, as they produce the siderophore enterobactin and many TonB‚Äëdependent receptors (TBDRs) used for the active transport of iron‚Äìsiderophore complexes.

It was derived from the neighboring Wielbark culture with influences from the Elbe region. The culture was superseded as the result of the later migrations of West Slavs, in particular of the Pomeranians (Slavic tribe).  Origins  \\"Dƒôbczyno group\\" was defined in archaeological literature at the beginning of the 1980s. In the second half of the third century, this culture succeeded the Wielbark culture between the Persante and Drage rivers. Whether the eastern Dƒôbczyn culture replaced or evolved from the Wielbark culture is not yet known, in the western areas, settlement was continuous. The emergence of this group is characterized by an influence of the Vistula region (Wielbark culture), the expansion of the Gustow group, and many paralleles to the Elbe Germanic areas.Karl-Heinz Otto, Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin Institut f√ºr Ur- und Fr√ºhgeschichte, Ost Universit√§t (Berlin, Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin Institut f√ºr V√∂lkerkunde und deutsche Volkskunde, Ethnographisch-arch√§ologische Zeitschrift (EAZ), v.43:no.1-4, Verlag der Wissenschaften, 2002, p.390 Also the Lebuser (Lubusz) cultural group preceded Debczyn culture.

History The Punch newspaper was founded by two friends, James Aboderin, an accountant, and Sam Amuka, a columnist and editor at the Daily Times of Nigeria. Amuka became the first editor of the Sunday Punch. In November 1976, a few years after the first print of its Sunday edition, the duo started printing their trademark daily newspaper. Both editions were designed to favour a friendlier apolitical approach to news reporting, combining footage of social events with everyday political news. The paper sustains itself by delving into broad issues that interest myriad people.Adigun Agbaje, \\"Freedom of the Press and Party Politics in Nigeria: Precepts, Retrospect and Prospects\\", African Affairs, Vol. 89, No. 355, April 1990. However, during the twilight of the Second Republic, political exigencies had introduced conflicts to its original intentions, Aboderin and Amuka parted ways due partly to political conflicts. Aboderin later secured the support of his former foe, M. K. O. Abiola, after the latter left the NPN. The paper began to take on a political stance, mostly against the Shagari regime. Supposedly, days before the end of the administration of Shagari, a few Punch editors were aware of a coup approaching and injected strong anti-government tones in their reporting. Press freedom The Punch was not immune to the excess of authoritarian regimes in the country. In 1990, its editor was jailed for 54 days. In 1993 and 1994, the publishing house was closed on the direction of the nation's ruler. Punch place Arepo  The Company Punch Nigeria Limited was registered on August 8, 1970, under the Companies Act of 1968 to engage in the business of publishing newspapers, magazines and other periodicals of public interest. It was designed to perform the tripartite functions of the popular mass media: informing, educating and entertaining Nigerians and the world at large. The company has a Board of Directors, hereinafter referred to as the Board, which is the highest policy- making organ of the company. Its policies and directives are implemented by a Management team led by the Managing Director (MD) who is the Company's Chief Executive Officer. As a corporate business entity, the company exists to make profit and by doing so, seeks to improve the lot of its owners and employees and also contribute its quota to the country's economic development. In 1971, the company made its debut with the publication of HAPPY HOME, a glossy family-oriented magazine. Its first editor was Bunmi Sofola. On Sunday, March 18, 1973, its first weekly newspaper, Sunday PUNCH, hit the newsstands. Edited by Ajibade Fashina-Thomas. THE PUNCH, a daily tabloid followed on November 1, 1976. Its pioneer editor was Dayo Wright. However, by the 1980s, the two tabloid had been repackaged. On April 29, 1990, a week after an attempted coup d'√©tat against the Federal Military Government, the company was closed down. The closure lasted a month while the then Deputy Editor of THE PUNCH, Chris Mammah, was detained for 54 days. Again in July 1993, The Federal Military Government shut the company's premises, vide Decree No 48 of 1993, and banned all its publications from circulating in the country. The closure followed the political crisis caused by annulment of June 12, 1993, Presidential election. On November 17 of the same year, the proscription order was repealed vide the Decree No 115 of 1993. The Federal Military Government struck on the July 24, 1994, and proscribed all the titles including TOPLIFE, which had been revived and published as a weekly magazine then. The then editor of THE PUNCH, Bola Bolawole, was detained for three days in his office in the old building. During the closure, the government ignored a court order that it should vacate the premises of the company and also pay the sum of N25 million and N100,000.00 respectively to the company and Bolawole. It was not until October 1, 1995 that government de-proscribed the publication vide a national day broadcast by the Head of State. In spite of all these, the company has pledged not to abdicate its responsibilities to the country. The current Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Ajibola Ogunshola, had on March 22, 1996, at the first Victor Adebamgbe Memorial lecture assured that \\".

PUNCH press: Goss Community Introduced in 1963, the Goss community began life as a single unit sitting on top of a reel stand. At that time it had a maximum speed of 12,000cph and a cut-off 22.75ins or 578mm. In recent years, enhancement made to the Community included speed and functionality upgrades and the addition of high specification model called magnum. Today, the Community offers a range of cut- offs (546-630mm): four-high configurations; web widths up to 1,000mm and a range of jaw and rotary folder options. PUNCH's Goss Community was delivered in November 1998. It is capable of producing 30,000(cphs).

Chronic infection may lead to cholangiocarcinoma, a malignant cancer of the bile ducts. Medical care and loss of wages caused by Opisthorchis viverrini in Laos and in Thailand costs about $120 million annually.Muller R. & Wakelin D. (2002). Worms and human disease. CABI. page 43-44. Infection by Opisthorchis viverrini and other liver flukes in Asia affect the poor and poorest people. Opisthorchiasis is one of foodborne trematode infections (with clonorchiasis, fascioliasis and paragonimiasis) in the World Health Organization's list of neglected tropical diseases.. Signs and symptoms Symptoms of opisthorchiasis/clonorchiasis. Symptoms of opisthorchiasis (caused by Opisthorchis spp.) are indistinguishable from clonorchiasis (caused by Clonorchis sinensis). About 80% of infected people have no symptoms, though they can have eosinophilia. Asymptomatic infection can occur when there are less than 1000 eggs in one gram in feces. Infection is considered heavy when there are 10,000-30,000 eggs in one gram of feces. Symptoms of heavier infections with Opisthorchis viverrini may include: diarrhoea, epigastric and upper right quadrant pain, lack of appetite (anorexia), fatigue, yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice) and mild fever. These parasites are long-lived and cause heavy chronic infections that may lead to accumulation of fluid in the legs (edema) and in the peritoneal cavity (ascites), enlarged non- functional gall-bladder and also cholangitis, which can lead to periductal fibrosis, cholecystitis and cholelithiasis, obstructive jaundice, hepatomegaly and/or fibrosis of the periportal system. =Chronic opisthorchiasis and cholangiocarcinoma= Incidence of cholangiocarcinoma and O. viverrini in Thailand from 1990‚Äì2001.Both experimental and epidemiological evidence strongly implicates Opisthorchis viverrini infections in the etiology of a malignant cancer of the bile ducts (cholangiocarcinoma) in humans which has a very poor prognosis. Clonorchis sinensis and Opisthorchis viverrini are both categorized by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as Group 1 carcinogens. In humans, the onset of cholangiocarcinoma occurs with chronic opisthorchiasis, associated with hepatobiliary damage, inflammation, periductal fibrosis and/or cellular responses to antigens from the infecting fluke. These conditions predispose to cholangiocarcinoma, possibly through an enhanced susceptibility of DNA to damage by carcinogens. Chronic hepatobiliary damage is reported to be multi-factorial and considered to arise from a continued mechanical irritation of the epithelium by the flukes present, particularly via their suckers, metabolites and excreted/secreted antigens as well as immunopathological processes. In silico analyses using techniques of genomics and bioinformatics is unraveling information on molecular mechanisms that may be relevant to the development of cholangiocarcinoma. In regions where Opisthorchis viverrini is highly endemic, the incidence of cholangiocarcinoma is unprecedented. For instance, cholangiocarcinomas represent 15% of primary liver cancer worldwide, but in Thailand's Khon Kaen region, this figure escalates to 90%, the highest recorded incidence of this cancer in the world. Of all cancers worldwide from 2002, 0.02% were cholangiocarcinoma caused by Opisthorchis viverrini. The cancer of the bile ducts caused by opisthorchiasis occur in the ages 25‚Äì44 years in Thailand. A few cases have appeared in later life among veterans of the Vietnam war in the United States, who consumed poorly cooked fish from streams in endemic areas near the border of Laos and Vietnam. Diagnosis The medical diagnosis is established by finding eggs of Opisthorchis viverrini in feces using the Kato technique.World Health Organization (1995). Control of Foodborne Trematode Infection. WHO Technical Report Series. 849. PDF part 1, PDF part 2. page 89-91. An antigen 89 kDa of Opisthorchis viverrini can be detected by ELISA test.A PCR test capable of amplifying a segment of the internal transcribed spacer region of ribosomal DNA for the opisthorchiid and heterophyid flukes eggs taken directly from faeces was developed and evaluated in a rural community in central Thailand.. The lowest quantity of DNA that could be amplified from individual adults of Opisthorchis viverrini was estimated to 0.6 pg. Prevention Effective prevention could be readily achieved by persuading people to consume cooked fish (via education programs), but the ancient cultural custom to consume raw, undercooked or freshly pickled fish persists in endemic areas. One community health program, known as the \\"Lawa\\" model, has achieved success in the Lawa Lakes region south of Khon Kaen. Currently, there is no effective chemotherapy to combat cholangiocarcinoma, such that intervention strategies need to rely on the prevention or treatment of liver fluke infection/disease. Cooking or deep-freezing (-20 ¬∞C for 7 days)World Health Organization (2004). REPORT JOINT WHO/FAO WORKSHOP ON FOOD- BORNE TREMATODE INFECTIONS IN ASIA. Report series number: RS/2002/GE/40(VTN). 55 pp. PDF. pages 15-17. of food made of fish is sure method of prevention. Methods for prevention of Opisthorchis viverrini in aquaculture fish ponds were proposed by Khamboonruang et al. (1997).. Treatment Chloroquine was used unsuccessfully in attempts to treat opisthorchiasis in 1951‚Äì1968. Control of opisthorchiasis relies predominantly on antihelminthic treatment with praziquantel. The single dose of praziquantel of 40 mg/kg is effective against opisthorchiasis (and also against schistosomiasis). Despite the efficacy of this compound, the lack of an acquired immunity to infection predisposes humans to reinfections in endemic regions. In addition, under experimental conditions, the short-term treatment of Opisthorchis viverrini-infected hamsters with praziquantel (400 mg per kg of live weight) induced a dispersion of parasite antigens, resulting in adverse immunopathological changes as a result of oxidative and nitrative stresses following re-infection with Opisthorchis viverrini, a process which has been proposed to initiate and/or promote the development of cholangiocarcinoma in humans. Albendazole can be used as an alternative. A randomised-controlled trial published in 2011 showed that the broad-spectrum anti-helminthic, tribendimidine, appears to be at least as efficacious as praziquantel. Artemisinin was also found to have anthelmintic activity against Opisthorchis viverrini.. Epidemiology Opisthorchiasis is prevalent where raw cyprinid fishes are a staple of the diet. Prevalence rises with age; children under the age of 5 years are rarely infected by Opisthorchis viverrini. Males may be affected more than females. The WHO estimates that foodborne trematodiases (infection by worms or \\"flukes\\", mainly Clonorchis, Opisthorchis, Fasciola and Paragonimus species) affect 56 million people worldwide and 750 million are at risk of infection. Eighty million are at risk of opisthorchiasis, 67 million from infection with Opisthorchis viverrini in Southeast Asia and 13 million from Opisthorchis felineus in Kazakhstan, Russia including Siberia, and Ukraine. In the lower Mekong River basin, the disease is highly endemic, and more so in lowlands, with a prevalence up to 60% in some areas of northeast Thailand. However, estimates using newer polymerase chain reaction-based diagnostic techniques indicate that prevalence is probably grossly underestimated. In one study from the 1980s, a prevalence of over 90% was found in persons greater than 10 years old in a small village near Khon Kaen in northeast Thailand in the region known as Isaan. Sporadic cases have been reported in case reports from Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines. Although overall prevalence declined after initial surveys in the 1950s, increases since the 1990s in some areas seem associated with large increases in aquaculture. Research Using CRISP gene editing technology, researchers eliminated the genes responsible for symptoms of O viverrini infection in animal models, which may lead to further research toward novel treatment and control of opisthorchiasis and prevention of cholangiocarcinoma.

Pitch contour may include multiple sounds utilizing many pitches, and can relate the frequency function at one point in time to the frequency function at a later point. It is fundamental to the linguistic concept of tone, where the pitch or change in pitch of a speech unit over time affects the semantic meaning of a sound. It also indicates intonation in pitch accent languages. One of the primary challenges in speech synthesis technology, particularly for Western languages, is to create a natural-sounding pitch contour for the utterance as a whole. Unnatural pitch contours result in synthesis that sounds \\"lifeless\\" or \\"emotionless\\" to human listeners, a feature that has become a stereotype of speech synthesis in popular culture. In music, the pitch contour focuses on the relative change in pitch over time of a primary sequence of played notes. The same contour can be transposed without losing its essential relative qualities, such as sudden changes in pitch or a pitch that rises or falls over time. Pure tones have a clear pitch, but complex sounds such as speech and music typically have intense peaks at many different frequencies. Nevertheless, by establishing a fixed reference point in the frequency function of a complex sound, and then observing the movement of this reference point as the function translates, one can generate a meaningful pitch contour consistent with human experience. For example, the vowel e has two primary formants, one peaking between 280 and 530 Hz and one between 1760 and 3500 Hz. When a person speaks a sentence involving multiple e sounds, the peaks will shift within these ranges, and the movement of the peaks between two instances establishes the difference in their values on the pitch contour.

Early life Chapman was born at Kennington, London, the son of Henry Chapman, English civil servant, and his wife Ann, daughter of Rev. Thomas Hart Davies.Parish register, St Mary, Portsea, Hampshire. 13 December 1778 Chapman was educated privately at Bromley, Kent. In 1818, he entered a bank, then in 1823 emigrated to Quebec, Canada where he went into business as a commission merchant. In 1833 he started the first Canadian daily newspapers, the radical Montreal Daily Advertiser, in association with Samuel Revans. In 1835, Chapman returned to England as a salaried intermediary between the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada and its friends in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. Chapman remained in England for some time and took up the study of law, being admitted to the bar of the Middle Temple in 1840. Five years earlier he had published The Act for the Regulation of Municipal Corporations . . . with a complete index and notes. He was also involved in journalism and various Liberal reform movements e.g. the anti-corn law agitations. He served on several Royal Commissions on industry, e.g. on the Yorkshire wool industry, and contributed to reviews and to the seventh edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. New Zealand and Australia Chapman founded the New Zealand Journal, which he edited and published in London from 1840 to 1843; he also published the New Zealand Portfolio. He supported the colonising ideas of Edward Gibbon Wakefield, and had a passion for colonial self- government, on which he published several treatises. In 1843 he published the New Zealand Portfolio, Papers on Subjects of Importance to the Colonists, and was appointed a judge of the Supreme Court of New Zealand. He was stationed at Wellington, residing at Karori. The size of the district meant covering such distances as Kawhia to New Plymouth () and New Plymouth to Wellington () on foot. But he was under the Chief Justice William Martin and, according to Charlotte Godley, always \\"considered himself too good for his present position\\". During this time Chapman gave what has become an influential judgment on native title in R v Symonds (1847). So in 1852 he accepted a position in Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania). Chapman went to Van Diemen's Land as Colonial Secretary in 1852, arriving in April. Later that year, as a nominee member of the council, left the chamber when a vote on the transportation question was being taken. Governor Denison held that as a representative of the government in the legislative council Chapman should have supported its transportation policy and virtually dismissed him, though he gave him leave of absence on half pay until the question could be referred to the Secretary of State. The governor's action was confirmed and Chapman went to Melbourne in 1854 and practised as a barrister. On 13 February 1855 he was elected a member of the Victorian Legislative Council for South Bourke, Evelyn and Mornington, and early in 1856 drafted the bill which brought in the ballot system of secret voting, afterwards known as the 'Australian' or 'Victorian' system and adopted by other countries all over the world. The Australian Encyclopaedia, entry under \\"ballot\\", points out that it became law in Victoria on 19 March 1856 and in South Australia on 2 April 1856; though the South Australian proposals had been made first. In Victoria there were very vague ideas about the working of a secret system of voting. Chapman's special contribution was that he devised a method that was workable, and drafted the first bill to become law in any part of the world. Under it the voter struck out the name of any candidate he did not desire to be elected, and this procedure was followed in Victoria until federation came in. Though without a seat in parliament, he had been defeated at an election at St Kilda, Chapman was Attorney-General in the first O'Shanassy ministry for a few weeks in 1857, and securing the St Kilda seat in December, in the following March was asked to form a ministry. This was done with O'Shanassy as premier and Chapman as attorney-general. This government resigned on 27 October 1859. In 1860 Chapman was a lecturer in law at the University of Melbourne. In 1861 he was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly for Mornington. He resigned his seat in February 1862 to become an acting-judge of the Supreme Court of Victoria, while Redmond Barry took a year's leave of absence. In March 1864, Chapman was appointed a judge of the Supreme Court of New Zealand, at Dunedin. He was involved there with the University of Otago and the Otago Institute. Chapman retired in 1875 taking up commerce and sheep farming in Central Otago, he died of cancer in Dunedin, New Zealand. He had an obituary notice in The Times. Family Chapman married twice; firstly on 6 June 1840, to Catherine DeLancy Brewer (born 1810), (daughter of T. G. Brewer, a London barrister), who was drowned while returning to Australia from visiting England along with two sons and a daughter when the passenger ship SS London foundered in the Bay of Biscay in January 1866. They had seven children together, six sons and a daughter. Chapman revisited England, and on 11 April 1868 married Selina Frances Carr, sister-in-law of Richard Davies Ireland, who survived him, with at least three sons of the first marriage. His third son, Martin Chapman, was amongst the first seven King's Counsel to be appointed in New Zealand in 1907. His fifth son, Sir Frederick Revans Chapman, became a Supreme Court judge in New Zealand, and President of the Court of Arbitration.

It is thought that the first Collegium of canons with its own chapel was formed in St. Andrews in the 13th century, and it is thought that by the Reformation there were more than 50 secular religious houses. The proscription of the Catholic faith in 1567 meant that these houses had to close. Although Scotland endured the Iconoclasm of the Reformation, there are still some handsome structures extant. Some Collegiate churches were converted into local parish Kirks, whilst others have fallen to ruin, some a mixture of the two. As a response to the power of medieval monastiscm, the rulers of Scotland‚Äîin common with many other Northern European states‚Äîtried to control the power of the church by encouraging local magnates to commission secular houses of worship within their lands and often within their own fortalices. These churches were often considered as private fiefdoms within certain families as a means to ensure prayers for their souls and for the glory and immortality of their lines.

Chambers ca. 1888 Charles Haddon Spurgeon Chambers (22 April 1860 ‚Äì 28 March 1921) was an Australia-born dramatist, active in England. Early life Chambers was born in Petersham, Sydney, the son of John Ritchie Chambers, who had a good position in the New South Wales civil service, came from Ulster, his mother, Frances, daughter of William Kellett, from Waterford. Charles was educated at the Petersham, Marrickville, and Fort Street High schools, but found routine study tedious and showed no special promise. He entered the lands department at 15 but did not stay long. After two years in the outback working as a boundary rider, in 1880 he was invited by cousins to return with them to Ulster, from there he visited England. On Chambers' return he was in the managerial department of the Montague-Turner opera company. Career In 1882 Chambers moved to England; he had no friends there and had to try various occupations in order to make a living. Chambers wrote letters from London for The Bulletin. In 1884 his first story was accepted, and other work appeared in popular magazines of the time like Society and Truth. In 1886 a one-act play, One of Them, was acted in London and another curtain-raiser, The Open Gate, was played at the Comedy Theatre in 1887. His first real success was Captain Swift, which was produced by Beerbohm Tree at the Haymarket Theatre in the autumn of 1888. In the United States Maurice Barrymore played Captain Swift on Broadway. This play had a good run and was played all over England, in America, and in Australia. He had another success with The Idler (1890). His next three plays The Honourable Herbert, The Old Lady, and The Pipes of Peace did not achieve success, but John-O-Dreams, first played in 1894, was successful. Also in 1894, he had some success with The Fatal Card. In 1899 possibly his best play, The Tyranny of Tears, was produced by Charles Wyndham and was frequently revived. Among his later plays Passers By (1911) and The Saving Grace (1917) are possibly the best. The famous London-based Australian operatic soprano, Dame Nellie Melba, was his mistress for a number of years. The relationship ended in 1904 for reasons which remain unclear. Late life Chambers retained his interest in Australia and spoke of returning there but never did so. He died at the Bath Club, London of cerebro-vascular disease on 28 March 1921 and was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery. He was twice married, and was survived by his second wife, originally Nelly Louise Burton but known professionally as 'Pepita Bobadilla', and a daughter of the first marriage to Mary, n√©e Dewer. His widow married Sidney Reilly, \\"Ace of Spies\\", in 1923.

It is planned to have a runway and sixteen international parking bays. The project is financed by a loan and grant aid from the Asian Development Bank. The contract to upgrade the airport was awarded to the Chinese company Northwest Civil Aviation Airport Construction Group in October 2014. The construction of the airport was set to be completed by the end of 2017 but the process was delayed for more than six months and the deadline of the completion was extended to 2019 due to the 2015 Nepal earthquake and the 2015 Nepal blockade. In July 2019, the project's deadline was extended and the expansion was expected to be completed by December 2019. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal, the opening of the airport was postponed to March 2021 in July 2020.

Style of play Rezball is transition-based basketball that forces tempo with aggressive play, quick scoring (or at least shooting) and assertive defense that looks to force turnovers through pressing or half-court traps. There are slight variations from program to program. Keys to a good rezball offensive play are sound fundamentals and being in very good condition. Many Native Americans adapted to basketball to bring them together with each other and is their way to overcome strife on the reservation.  Following  The Apache, Pueblo and Navajo tribes in northeastern Arizona and northwestern New Mexico are home to several high schools. In these areas basketball is very important. In Arizona, three of the top six largest crowds at a boys' basketball game are rezball games (regardless of school size), with one of the two games tied for the highest-ever attendance being a game between Apache and Navajo schools. Arizona's Native American largest high school arenas are; The Nash Center (Kayenta, AZ) seats 3,800, The Warrior Pavilion (Tuba City, AZ) seats 4,518, the Ganado Pavilion (Burnside, AZ) seats 5,500, The Wildcat Den (Chinle, AZ) seats 7,510, and the Bee H√≥≈Çdzil Fighting Scouts Events Center (Fort Defiance, AZ) seats about 6,532. These massive arenas draw large crowds from all around the Navajo Reservation. The border town teams for Arizona that are within the AIA 3A Division are Winslow, Holbrook and Page ‚Äî which consists mainly of Native Americans. Some other examples of the intense following of basketball in this region were noted in February 2013 by a writer for MaxPreps.com, the high school arm of CBSSports.com. First, early in the month, the Wildcat Den hosted an Arizona Interscholastic Association (AIA) sectional tournament featuring four boys' and four girls' reservation teams. Even though neither Chinle High team participated in the sectional, more than 12,000 attended over the two-day event, with hundreds of fans arriving hours before the doors opened to get the best seats. The scheduling of the AIA's state tournament later that month at the venue then known as Jobing.com Arena in Glendale, home to the NHL's Arizona Coyotes, also reflected rezball influence. In most states that host multiple state championship games at one site, the last game scheduled is the boys' championship game in the largest enrollment class. Here, however, the marquee slot was reserved for the girls' title game in Class 3A (the state's largest schools are in Class 5A)‚Äîa classification that has traditionally been dominated by reservation schools. New Mexico has produced many high schools that are nationally ranked by the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) according to the New Mexico Activities Association (NMAA)--for producing over 100 State Championships combined, from numerous high schools. New Mexico functions each year on building tradition in basketball for both boys and girls. The big gyms in New Mexico from the Native American high schools are the Bronco Arena at Kirtland Central High School (Kirtland,NM) seats over 4,000, the Chieftain Pit at Shiprock High School (Shiprock,NM) seats 3,100, and the Pueblo Pavilion Santa Fe Indian School (Santa Fe,NM) seats 4,500. Both Shiprock and Kirtland Central have a unique glass going around the court. The border town teams for New Mexico are Kirtland Central, Gallup, and Santa Fe Indian‚Äîwhich consists mainly of Native Americans. New Mexico is well known around the country for its power houses in girls basketball such as from Kirtland Central, Shiprock, Gallup, Santa Fe Indian, Navajo Prep and Navajo Pine. Kirtland Central's girls basketball program leads with the most state championships than any other Native American high school. Shiprock has also impacted girls basketball and being major rivals with Kirtland Central. Gallup girls basketball program has been one of the most power houses in New Mexico, playing at a fierce level among larger/competitive high schools in New Mexico. Santa Fe Indian girls program has produced some great talents in the recent years along with Navajo Prep and Navajo Pine both have risen to many achievements. The New Mexico high school state finals takes place at The Pit on the University of New Mexico campus, and has had major sell outs starting from the late 80's from games between Shiprock and Kirtland Central girls. Many Native American fans from Gallup, Shiprock, Kirtland Central, Laguna Acoma and Santa Fe Indian continue to fill The Pit every year. While the Native American basketball phenomenon is most pronounced in the Four Corners region, it is not limited to that area. For example, when the girls' team from the reservation high school of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians reached the final of the Class 3A state tournament in 2017 (which they won), about 5,000 fans traveled from the reservation to Jackson for the game. Native American Basketball Invitational (NABI) Co-founded in 2003 by Mark West/former Phoenix Suns player, the late Scott Podleski/Arizona Rattlers and GinaMarie Scarpa/former Executive Director AC Green Youth Foundation (named for AC Green/NBA Iron Man). Every year the NABI Foundation host the Native American Basketball Invitational (NABI) in Arizona, an all native tournament sponsored by Nike N7, Ak-Chin Indian Community, Seminole Tribe of Florida, Gila River Indian Community, Phoenix Suns and Phoenix Mercury. In its 17th year, it has become recognized as the premier all Native youth tournament in the world and made history in 2007 as the first all Native tournament sanctioned by the NCAA after NABI Foundation President & CEO GinaMarie Scarpa insisted the NCAA respect Tribal Sovereignty and exempt the tournament from abiding to their \\"same state rule\\". The tournament hosts 128+ teams from all over the U.S., Canada and New Zealand, and is instrumental in showcasing the talent of the players to college recruiters, most of whom would not travel to the remote reservation towns to recruit. www.nabifoundation.org High schools = Arizona = Cibecue High School, Cibecue, Arizona Shonto Preparatory Technology High School, Shonto, Arizona St. Michael High School, St. Michael's, Arizona Salt River High School, Scottsdale, Arizona Rough Rock High School, Rough Rock, Arizona Baboquivari High School, Sells, Arizona Red Mesa High School, Teec Nos Pos, Arizona San Carlos High School, San Carlos, Arizona Pi√±on High School, Pi√±on, Arizona Valley High School, Sanders, Arizona Greyhills Academy High School, Tuba City, Arizona Hopi Junior/Senior High School, Keams Canyon, Arizona Many Farms High School, Many Farms, Arizona Alchesay High School, Whiteriver, Arizona Ganado High School, Ganado, Arizona Holbrook High School, Holbrook, Arizona Winslow High School, Winslow, Arizona Window Rock High School, Fort Defiance, Arizona River Valley High School, Mojave Valley, Arizona Tuba City High School, Tuba City, Arizona Monument Valley High School, Kayenta, Arizona Chinle High School, Chinle, Arizona Page High School, Page, Arizona Rock Point High School, Rock Point, Arizona Fort Thomas High School, Fort Thomas, Arizona = New Mexico = Laguna-Acoma High School, Laguna, New Mexico Santa Fe Indian High School, Santa Fe, New Mexico Magdalena High School, Magdalena, New Mexico Ts√© Y√≠ Gai High School, Smith Lake, New Mexico Jemez Valley High School, Jemez Pueblo, New Mexico Pine Hill High School, Pinehill, New Mexico Navajo Pine High School, Navajo, New Mexico Navajo Prep High School.

Detail of a medieval chronicle Champion warfare refers to a type of battle, most commonly found in the epic poetry and myth of ancient history, in which the outcome of the conflict is determined by single combat, an individual duel between the best soldiers (\\"champions\\") from each opposing army. Champion warfare can also refer to a battle in which armies actually engage, but champions within the armies fight so effectively as to single-handedly carry the sway of battle, such as in the Iliad.  Champion warfare in literature  * Numerous instances of champion warfare can be observed in Homer's Iliad, most notably the climactic battle between Achilles and Hector, although there are many more. * Champion warfare has numerous examples in Ferdowsi's Shahnameh (Book of Kings). * Champion warfare is a common theme in the early books of Livy's history of Rome Ab Urbe Condita (\\"From the Founding of the City\\"), including the story of the famous triplets of the Horatii and Curiatii families and the great champion Horatius Cocles. * Every large-scale battle in the Chinese Water Margin begins with champion combat. * The Combat of the Thirty in 1351 between competing French lineages was held as a model of chivalric combat. * Champion warfare is a common occurrence in Indian epics such as the Mahabharata and the Ramayana. The latter's fate is decisively determined by Rama, and his nemesis Ravana * In the Bible, the battle between David and Goliath is an example of champion warfare. Group champion combat, where a certain number of champions from each side battle, also existed, as shown in the Battle of Gibeon, where General Abner, loyal to King Ish-bosheth, had twelve champions duel twelve warriors chosen from the ranks of King David's army by General Joab.

In a famous incident on 15 October 1940, the BBC's Broadcasting House took a direct hit from a delayed-action German bomb, which eventually exploded during the nine o'clock radio news read by Belfrage. Seven people were killed, and Belfrage, covered with plaster and soot, carried on reading the news as if nothing had happened. Listeners at home heard just a dull thud. He enlisted in the Royal Naval Reserve in 1942, and was demobilized with the rank of lieutenant-commander. Belfrage was an unsuccessful Liberal candidate for the South Buckinghamshire division at the 1950 General Election. Belfrage polled a creditable 16.5% but never contested another election.

The county is composed of Ganghwa Island, and the minor islands around it. History Ganghwa County contains some of the most important historical sites in Korea. These sites cover the prehistoric old and new stone ages, as well as the bronze and iron ages. Additionally there are numerous historic sites. An example of a dolmen on Ganghwa Ganghwa Island is rich in dolmen, and they have been designated a World Heritage Site.https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/977 There are about 150 dolmen on the island. Their distribution shows that these dolmen were closely related to fishing in the Bronze Age, although they are now separated from the sea. They are located on the slopes of mountains and are thus higher in elevation than their counterparts. It is believed, but not proved, that the Ganghwa dolmen are the earliest Korean ones made, because the designs of the dolmen in Bugeun-ri and Gocheon-ri are resemble those in Ganghwa. Dangun, the founder of Gojoseon, is said to have made an altar on top of Mani-san and offered sacrifices to his ancestors. In the 9th century, the Unified Silla established a garrison on the island to combat piracy. Their commander, Wang Geon, established his military reputation at the garrison, and later went on to found the Kingdom of Goryeo. In the 13th century, the court of Goryeo took refuge on the island as Mongol forces invaded in 1232. After Goryeo capitulated to the Mongols, the elite forces on the island rose up, beginning the Sambyeolcho Rebellion. In the early 19th century, Catholicism was introduced into Korea despite its official proscription by the Korean court. The Korean court clamped down on the illicit French missionaries, massacring French Catholic missionaries and Korean converts alike. In the first battle, the Korean infantry division lost heavily, and General Yang Heon-su concluded that only a large cavalry division could stand up to French firepower. An ambush, by Korean forces, of a French party attempting to occupy the strategically important Cheondeung Temple, on the island's south coast, resulted in the French retreating, and abandoning the island. In 1871, following the General Sherman Incident, the United States Navy launched an expedition against the soldiers at Ganghwa Island, resulting in the Battle of Ganghwa. In 1875, the Japanese ship, Unyo, made and incursion into the restricted coastal zone, under the guise of measuring the coastline. It fired a few shots at the fortress on the island. When the Unyo sent a boat to the island, the Korean garrison fired a few shots back. The Japanese argued that this was an aggressive act, and demanded concessions. Early in the following year, Japan sent a large Imperial Japanese Navy fleet to Korea, which forced the government to sign the unequal Treaty of Ganghwa. That agreement, concluded on Ganghwa Island, officially opened Korea to Japanese external trade for the first time during the 19th century. Ganghwa was raised to the status of a county in 1906, and incorporated into the Incheon Metropolitan City in 1995. Climate Speciality About 70% of Ganghwa's citizens are engaged in farming, mainly rice. Fishery and forestry are other occupations practiced. Hwamunseok is a well-known traditional fancy matting. Since the Goryeo dynasty (10th-14th centuries), hwamunseok has been produced and exported to China and Japan. The mats are produced in the home handicraft industry. Under an order given by the royal court of the Joseon dynasty over 100 years ago, craftsman Han Chunggyo from the white-mat producing village, Yango-ri, Haesongmyeon, Ganghwa-gun, achieved a successful product by the design of his own idea. Thereafter, various designs have been developed and manufacturing techniques have been improved.Official page of Ganghwa The Ganghwa turnip is a specialty of the area. It has been cultivated since the 5th century.

Plot Aspiring young actress Maggie Nelson (Anna Paquin), who lives in New York City with her father, an Interpol agent, gains chameleon-like powers one night after she gets unknowingly caught between a severe electrical storm and a magic rune her father had brought home to study after it was found at the scene of a murder at a New York City museum. Her powers are from a secret and ancient race known as the Chameliel, who are able to hide in plain sight due to their shape shifting abilities, and she is told all about the Chameliel after meeting a young Chameliel named Mosaic (Kirby Morrow). The murder victim at the museum was a Chameliel who was killed by another Chameliel named Maniken, who is stealing some of the many powerful Chameliel stones that are hidden around the world, intent on using them to gain the alchemical powers of his dead wife Facade, and ruling the world. After Maniken kidnaps her father, Maggie becomes determined to help Mosaic to fight Maniken.Stan Lee Presents: Mosaic - Movie Reviews, Trailers, Pictures - Rotten TomatoesMovie Review - Mosaic (2007) - eFilmCritic The two go from New York City, to the catacombs of Rome, to a large radio dish at the magnetic North Pole, trying to stop Maniken, as he plans to sacrifice Maggie's father as part of a ceremony to use the Chameliel stones to transfer to Maniken the powers of his wife from her body and rule Earth like a god. As Maniken prepares to begin the ceremony on the radio dish, Maggie uses her acting skills and shape-shifting abilities to fool Maniken into believing she is his dead wife come back to life, to distract him from noticing Mosaic is planting explosives that destroy everything on the radio dish and render the ceremony impossible, and getting her father to safety. During the battle against Maniken, it is revealed that Mosaic is Maniken and Facade's son who volunteered to the rest of the Chameliel to go after his father and stop him. Maniken is defeated when Mosaic willingly sends them both tumbling into an icy gorge, sacrificing himself to stop his father forever. Maggie then sneaks aboard the Interpol copter her father is taken onto, where she overhears him vowing to destroy all Chameliel. Upon returning home, she plans to continue acting and agrees to her father's request to continue her studies, but at the same time, acknowledging her powers as the piece of the rest of the Chameliel within her, she vows to search for the remaining Chameliel stones and use their power for good, and honor Mosaic and the rest of the Chameliel by becoming the new Mosaic.

Even though, officially, Peru's participation the Davis Cup had started in 1933; its presentations in the years of 1933, 1934, and 1950 were all walk-over losses. Peru's first victory would come in 1976, when the team defeats Uruguay at Montevideo, by a margin of 2-3. Players Miguel Maurt√∫a and Fernando Maynetto were an important part of this team. Peru's next rival was Brazil, and the result was a 5-0 loss for the Peruvians. The first great participation of Peru's Davis Cup history came up in 1989, by defeating Ecuador 5-0 and Brazil 3-2. Thus, the team made it into the World Group playoffs. Peru's rival was the Australia of Cahill and Masur. The game disputed in Lima resulted in a 3-2 win for Australia. Peruvian tennis players Jaime Yzaga, Pablo Arraya, and Carlos Di Laura were already beginning to show their skill. The early 90s proved disastrous for Peru, who got relegated to Group II of the Americas zone. Upon returning to Group I in 1994, the Yzaga-led team was able to beat Mexico, Chile, and Brazil by 3-2 margins each time, qualifying for the World Group playoffs again. This time the team lost to Denmark 4-1. The team was relegated to the Americas Zone Group 2 for the 1997 season, but returned to Group 1 in 2000. The following year they were relegated again but also returned in 2003.

The song however was sung in a high-pitched childlike style, a style described uncharitably as sounding like \\"strangling cat\\" by the writer Lu Xun. This early style would soon be replaced by more sophisticated performances from better-trained singers. The songs of the period often use the ABA or ABCA form, which were new to Chinese and are still used by modern composers. The melodies are easy to remember and some of them are still sung today, such as \\"Wishing You Happiness and Prosperity\\" (ÊÅ≠ÂñúÊÅ≠Âñú) performed by Yao Lee and Yao Min. History Shidaiqu music is rooted in both traditional Chinese folk music and the introduction of Western Jazz during the years when Shanghai was under the Shanghai International Settlement. In the 1920s the intellectual elite in Shanghai and Beijing embraced the influx of Western music and movies that entered through trade. The first jazz clubs in Shanghai initially targeted the Western elite, saw an influx of musicians, and acted as dance halls. Beginning in the 1920s, Shidaiqu entered into the mainstream of popular music. This song generally regarded as the first Chinese pop song is \\"The Drizzle\\" (\\"ÊØõÊØõÈõ®\\"), which was composed by Li Jinhui around 1927 and sung by his daughter Li Minghui (ÈªéÊòéÊöâ). The song exemplifies the early shidaiqu in its fusion of jazz and Chinese folk music ‚Äì the tune is in the style of a traditional pentatonic folk melody, but the instrumentation is similar to that of an American jazz orchestra. =Mainstream= Shidaiqu reached peak popularity during 1940s. Famous jazz musicians from both the US and China played to packed dance halls. Chinese women singers grew in celebrity. Additionally, nightclubs such as the Paramount Dance Hall became a meeting point for businessmen from Western countries and China would meet. The western jazz influences were shaped predominately by American jazz musician Buck Clayton. Nowadays, shidaiqu has inspired Gary Lucas for his album The Edge of Heaven and DJs such as Ian Widgery and his Shanghai Lounge Divas project. On the other hand, if cinema was the origin of many songs, Wong Kar-wai used them again for illustrating his movie \\"In the Mood for Love\\"; Rebecca Pan, one of the actresses in this film, was also one of those famous shidaiqu singers. =Decline= Throughout the decades leading up to the Great Leap Forward, the reputation of Shidaiqu outside of its target audience was degrading. Despite some of the songs intended to nation build, the government deemed Shidaiqu as \\"Yellow Music\\" and described it as \\"pornographic and commercial\\". In 1952 the Communists banned nightclubs and pop music production. During this time period, western style instruments were sought out and destroyed and Chinese jazz musicians were \\"rehabilitated\\". The tradition then moved to Hong Kong and reached its height from the 1950s to the late 1960s, when it was replaced by Taiwanese pop (sung in Mandarin) and later cantopop. While it is considered a prototype, music enthusiasts may see it as an early version of mandopop. Li Jinhui is the founder of shidaiqu, along with Chinese popular music. =Revival= While still popular abroad (especially in Taiwan and Hong Kong), Shidaiqu gained popularity in Mainland China once more during the 1980s. Shanghai opened up for the first time after WWII and interest in what used to be forbidden music peaked. Surviving musicians were invited to play once more in hotel lobbies and pop musicians began writing covers of famous songs such as Teresa Tang's 1978 cover of Li Xianglan's The Evening Primrose. In more recent years, a group called the Shanghai Restoration Project uses both the 1980s and 1940s pop songs to create electronic music. Political connotations Shanghai shidaiqu reflects feelings of 1930s Shanghainese citizens. Shanghai was divided into the International Concession and the French Concession in the 1930s and early 1940s. Owing to the protection of foreign nations (e.g., Britain and France), Shanghai was a prosperous and a rather politically stable city. Some songs reflected the extravagant lives of the bourgeoisie and rich merchants. At the same time, some leftist songs also showed the poverty of commoners in the city. Some shidaiqu songs are related to particular historical events (e.g., Second Sino-Japanese War). The lyrics are graceful and expressive. This is closely related to the composers' profound knowledge of literature. The euphemism of presenting love, which was always found in old Chinese novels, is kept in shidaiqu, thus making shidaiqu artistic. The recording methods of songs on 78rpm gramophone shellac records marked a new age in Chinese musical history. Usually the recording would be done in one take only. Therefore, sound engineers had to be extremely careful when making records. Steel stylus records (ÈãºÈáùÂî±Áâá), which were an important recording medium, have now been abandoned due to the development in digital recording. This is also accompanied by the disappearance of this precious sound recording technology. Shanghai shidaiqu songs are sung in Mandarin, regarded as a symbol of fashion and progressive culture. A large part of the audience would not be fluent in Mandarin. Shanghai dominated the Chinese movie industry in the 1930s. Song of the Fishermen, a famous movie in the 1930s, marked the beginning of song films or musicals (Ê≠åËàûÁâá). Pop singers (e.g., Zhou Xuan, Bai Guang, Gong Qiuxia) also participated in these films. Their beautiful voices guaranteed best-selling, hit records.

It's often not clear which names in the literature, which are generally tribal names and often correspond to dialects, refer to distinct languages. Indeed, they're close enough that some consider them all to be dialects of a single language, Kanamari (Fabre 2005). Campbell (2012) note that Adelaar \\"presents reasonably persuasive evidence that Har√°kmbut and Katukinan are genetically related.\\" Language contact Jolkesky (2016) notes that there are lexical similarities with the Jivaro, Maku, Mura-Matanawi, Puinave-Nadahup, Taruma, Tupi, Yanomami, and Arawak language families due to contact. This suggests that Katukinan and the language families with which it was in contact with had been earlier spoken within a central Amazon interaction sphere. Languages and dialects Many ethnic Katukina had shifted to other languages by the time of European contact. Examples are Panoan Katukina and unclassified Katukinaru. The common suffix dyapa, djapa means 'tribe' or 'clan', for which the varieties are named. Fabre (2005) lists Kanamar√≠, Txuhu√£-djap√°, Katuk√≠na do Juta√≠ (Katukina proper), and Katawixi as four attested languages. =Loukotka (1968)= A large number of Katukinan dialects have gone extinct. Loukotka (1968) illustrates data from Catuquina (Wiri-dyap√°, of the Juta√≠ River), Canamari, Parawa (Hon-dyapa), Bendiapa, and Catauxi (Catos√©, Hewadie, Katawishi, Quatausi). Canamari, Parawa, and Bendiapa (Be√±-Dyap√°) may constitute a single language, as may Tucundiapa (Mangeroma, Tucano Dyapa). He also notes a Tawari (Tauar√©, Kadekili-dyapa, Kayar√°ra), and a Buru√° (Burue, Buruhe), of which nothing has been recorded. All of them are classified as \\"Southern Catuquina\\" except for Catauxi, which is the only \\"Northern Catuquina\\" language. The locations of each variety given by Loukotka (1968) are: *Catuquina / Wiri- dyap√° - spoken on the Juta√≠ River *Canamari - Juru√° River *Parawa / Hon-dyap√° - Gr√©gorio River near Santo Amaro *Tucundiapa / Mangeroma - Itecoa√≠ River (Itaquai River) *Bendiapa - S√£o Jos√© River *Tawari / Kadekili-dyap√° / Kayar√°ra - spoken north of the Bendiapa tribe *Buru√° - spoken on the Bi√° River and Juta√≠ River *Catauxi - Madeira River and Purus River =Mason (1950)= Mason (1950) gives Pid√°-Dyap√° and Kuti√°-Dyap√° as dialects of Catukina, and Cadekili- Dyap√° and Wadyo-Parani√±-Dyap√° (Kairara) as dialects of Tawari, corresponding to Loukotka's names Kadekili-dyapa and Kayar√°ra. He adds Catukino and a \\"miscellaneous\\" list of Amena-Dyap√°, Cana-Dyap√°, Hon-Dyap√° (which Loukotka identifies with Parawa), Mar√∂-Dyap√°, Ururu-Dyap√°, and Wiri-Dyap√° (which Loukotka identifies with Catuquina).

There is a down slope of 1.75% up to about from the threshold of runway 06. There is a terminal building for passengers. There are daily flights between Pokhara Airport and Jomsom during daylight hours in good weather. Although the flying distance is short and flight time just 20 minutes, very high mountains between Pokhara and Jomsom, including Dhaulagiri (8,167 m or 26,795 ft) and Tukuche (6,920 m or 22,703 ft) on the west and Nilgiri Central (6,940 m or 22,769 ft) and Annapurna (8,091 m or 26,545 ft) on the east, require planes to fly through the Kali Gandaki River gorge. With Jomsom Airport located at the head of the gorge, high terrain surrounding the airport presents a hazard when a go-around is required and when, as is frequently necessary after mid-morning, a turn is required at Jomsom to land into southerly winds. Heat from the sun in the Mustang District causes strong southerly winds in the Kali Gandaki River gorge and at Jomsom after early morning. Cloud cover, changing visibility, and high winds, often mean flights are delayed or the airport closed. The airport is available throughout the year but visibility is not adequate for visual flight rules flight about 15% of the time. As wind speeds increase during and the day and high wind speeds often prevent airport operation after midday, airlines schedule flights to Jomsom for the early morning when wind speeds are low. Airlines operate a shuttle service between Jomsom and Pokhara and planes are turned around as rapidly as possible at each airport in order to complete as many flights as possible before wind speeds at Jomsom become too high or visibility forces the suspension of flights.

The game was translated into English by Seta U.S.A.. Musya was released in Japan on April 21, 1992 and in North America in December 1992. The title, which translates to \\"Warrior\\", is romanized in the Kunrei-shiki style (Musya) instead of the Hepburn romanization style (Musha), likely to avoid confusion with the unrelated Sega Genesis game MUSHA.  Gameplay  Imoto, bearing 16 units of health (Qi (Ê∞ó Ki, meaning \\"life energy\\")), dies when the health is depleted. He carries up to three lives (ÂëΩ Inochi). The game starts with three lives; once the life count is zero and Imoto dies, the game ends. When Imoto defeats a boss, the words \\"monster defeated\\" (ÊÄ®ÈúäË™ø‰ºè Onry≈ç Ch≈çfuku, \\"Vengeful Ghost Submitted\\") appear and the player gains a scroll containing a new spell.  Plot  Musya follows a pikeman (described as a spearman in the Japanese version) named Imoto (Jinrai (Á•ûÈõ∑) in the Japanese version), who must descend to the abyss to save Shizuka, a maiden. After Imoto survives a battle in which all other combatants perish, he travels to Tengumura Village, where he collapses. The mayor, Akagi (who is not named in the Japanese version), greets Imoto and tells him that Shizuka („Åó„Åö„Åã) needs to be rescued. Imoto heads into Tengumura Cavern (known in the Japanese version as Kih≈çsh≈çny≈´d≈ç (È¨ºÂÆùÈçæ‰π≥Ê¥û)).  Development  = Editing for the English-language edition = The game received several edits for the North American edition. For instance, the large testes of the tanuki character were removed for the North American edition. In addition, the manji (Âçç) shown to reveal the amount of spell scrolls held was edited away. The Japanese version of the game is one of the few games that uses Japanese numerals. The English version uses Arabic numerals. Japanese dialogue is replaced with English-language dialogue. In addition, Musya uses Japanese kanji characters in various parts of the game to represent modes and levels. For instance, in the Japanese version of the game, the English- language word \\"Pause\\" is not used; instead the word Ippuku (‰∏ÄÊúç, meaning \\"break\\" or \\"to take a break\\") appears from both ends of the screen.

He played for Scottish team Rangers and Bayer 05 Uerdingen in Germany, as well as Danish teams AGF and Br√∏ndby IF. He earned 32 caps and scored five goals for the Denmark national team and was in the Danish squad for the 1986 FIFA World Cup. Club career Bartram signed his first contract with Aarhus Gymnastik Forening (AGF) in 1982. He got his national breakthrough with AGF in the top-flight Danish 1st Division championship as a left-sided attacking midfielder, and helped the club win the 1986 1st Division championship. After the 1987 First Division season, he moved to play abroad. He signed for Scottish club Rangers, but his stay was a short one. He was assured by Rangers manager Graeme Souness that he would fit into his tactics, but found himself deployed as a strictly defensive full back. He gained some notoriety for having his thoughts on Souness published in an interview with Danish paper Ekstra Bladet, allegedly calling Souness a beast or hooligan. He and Souness denounced the interview together, but Bartram repeated some of the accusations in his 1998 autobiography. He left Rangers after six months, in the summer of 1988. He moved back to Denmark, and signed for defending Danish champions Br√∏ndby IF. He stayed there for less than half a year, playing a total 23 games for the club. Bartram was soon sold on to Bayer 05 Uerdingen in the German Bundesliga by Br√∏ndby CEO Per Bjerregaard, in a deal which yielded a DKK3.5 million surplus for Br√∏ndby. He made his Uerdingen debut in November 1988 and played 74 games in his three seasons at the club, playing alongside fellow Danish international and former Br√∏ndby player Brian Laudrup. Bartram did not take to the strict discipline of new coach Timo Konietzka and played his last Uerdingen game in March 1991, before he was fired for arriving late at a training session. He moved back to AGF in the Danish top-flight, now known as the Danish Superliga, and made his Superliga debut for AGF in April 1991. He played 14 Superliga games until June 1991, when he took a sabbatical year away from football, and travelled around the world. He returned to AGF's Superliga team in August 1992, and played a further 35 games for the club until April 1996. From May 1994 to June 1996 he was also AGF's sports director. International career Bartram made his international debuted for the Denmark national team in January 1985. Having played three internationals, he was included in the Danish team for the 1986 FIFA World Cup, though he did not play any games at the tournament. He was a mainstay in the national team during his many club changes. Following three games in the qualification campaign for Euro 1992, Bartram decided to quit the national team in November 1990 alongside Brian Laudrup and Michael Laudrup, but he returned to the team for a game in April 1991. He played his last national team game in May 1991, having participated in 32 national team games and scored five international goals.

It was recorded while Nesmith was still a member of the Monkees, and peaked at No. 144 on the Billboard Pop Albums charts. The album comprises instrumentals performed by a full orchestra. All but one of the songs were recorded by the Monkees. (A few of them weren't released until the Missing Link albums.) Background The album was made over a two-day session on November 18‚Äì19, 1967 at the RCA studios in Hollywood, and featured the best musicians in Hollywood (including many of the key members of \\"The Wrecking Crew\\"), including ten trumpets, ten trombones, ten saxophones, two drummers, five percussionists, four pianos, eight basses, seven guitars. Because it was the weekend, all musicians were paid double time and the session was catered by Chasens, the finest restaurant in Hollywood, and Nesmith provided an open bar, with the predictable result that most of the normally highly disciplined cadre of studio musicians were drunk by the time the session finished. It all cost $50,000. Nesmith explained to Hal Blaine that he was about to pay a similar sum in tax and he would rather spend it on the sessions and write it off than give it to the IRS.Sandoval, Andrew The Monkees: The day-by-day story of the 1960s TV pop sensation 2005 The recording is also notable for the famous incident that occurred at the end of the sessions - the lead sheet for the final track recorded (\\"Don't Call On Me\\") included an instruction that called for the players to improvise a cacophony of sound; as the track concluded, to the astonishment of his colleagues, renowned guitarist Tommy Tedesco took off his Fender guitar (which was still plugged into the amplifier), threw it high into the air, and the instrument crashed to the floor and smashed to pieces. According to a 2000 interview with Hal Blaine, Tedesco's wife later collected the pieces and had them framed.Hal Blaine interview, 2000 The album was initially released with the title Mike Nesmith Presents The Wichita Train Whistle Sings on both the sleeve and record label. The label credited the recording artist as \\"The Wichita Train Whistle\\". In 1977, Nesmith re-released The Wichita Train Whistle Sings through his multimedia company, Pacific Arts (PACB 7-113). Unlike the original Dot Records black background album cover, the Pacific Arts cover had a white background and was dominated with only the album title, which now did not include the Mike Nesmith Presents notation. However, although Nesmith's name did not appear on the front cover of the re-release, the artist credit on the actual record label now read \\"Michael Nesmith\\", and not \\"The Wichita Train Whistle\\". Subsequent re-issues also credit Nesmith as the artist. CD Release When Nesmith released \\"Wichita Train\\" on CD, he recorded the album onto digital from a phonograph. As he explained in the liner notes, the album was intended to be played on vinyl, and this, therefore, was an attempt to capture the album's true essence. (It is more likely that the master tapes could not be located. Hence the need to remix from the multitrack tapes for the later release.) Unfortunately, this means that it sounds as if the CD still has the vinyl's RIAA equalisation (low frequencies cut and high frequencies boosted) which makes the sound harsh and over-bright. In 2008, the album was remixed from the original multi-track tapes, re-sequenced (by Nesmith) and re-released alongside his Timerider movie soundtrack, on the Edsel label.[ The Wichita Train Whistle Sings and Timerider re-release review on Allmusic.] Track listing All songs by Michael Nesmith except where noted. # \\"Nine Times Blue\\" # \\"Carlisle Wheeling\\" # \\"Tapioca Tundra\\" # \\"Don't Call on Me\\" # \\"Don't Cry Now\\" # \\"While I Cried\\" # \\"Papa Gene's Blues\\" # \\"You Just May Be the One\\" # \\"Sweet Young Thing\\" (Nesmith, Gerry Goffin, Carole King) # \\"You Told Me\\" Personnel *Michael Nesmith ‚Äì guitar, bass, arranger *Don Randi ‚Äì piano *Red Rhodes ‚Äì pedal steel guitar *Larry Knechtel ‚Äì piano *Earl Palmer ‚Äì drums *Doug Dillard ‚Äì banjo *Chuck Berghofer ‚Äì bass *Hal Blaine ‚Äì drums *James Burton ‚Äì guitar *Tommy Tedesco ‚Äì guitar *Frank Capp - percussion *Nelson Stump - cowbell *Gary Coleman - percussion *Victor Feldman - percussion *Israel Baker (concertmaster), Robert Barene, Arnold Belnick, Jimmy Getzoff, Leonard Malarsky, Ralph Schaeffer, Sidney Sharp (concertmaster), Tibor Zelig - violins *Joe DiFiore, Harry Hyams, Alexander Neiman - violas *Jesse Ehrlich, Ray Kramer, Edgar Lustgarten - celli *Gene Cipriano, Justin Gordon, Jim Horn, Jules Jacob, John E.

Historical background After the campaigns of Philip II in 347‚Äì342 a significant part of Thrace was dependent to Macedon. After Philip's death in 336 BC, many of the Thracian tribes revolted against Philip's son Alexander the Great, who waged a campaign against and defeated the Getae and King Syrmus of the Triballi. All other Thracians sent troops to join Alexander's army. Life Seuthes revolted against Macedon in about 325 BC, after Alexander's governor Zopyrion was killed in battle against the Getae. After Alexander died in 323 BC he again took up arms in opposition to the new governor Lysimachus. They fought each other to a draw and each withdrew from battle. Ultimately Seuthes was compelled to acknowledge the authority of Lysimachus, by then one of Alexander's successor kings. In 320 BC, Seuthes III moved the Odrysian kingdom to central Thrace and built his capital city at Seuthopolis (Kazanlak, present day Bulgaria). In 313 BC he supported Antigonus I in the latter's war against Lysimachus, occupying the passes of Mount Haemus against his overlord but was again defeated and forced to submit. The gold oak laurel wreath of Thracian Odrysian King Seuthes III , found in his tomb Golyama Kosmatka Mound (Funeral Complex) Shipka, Kazanlak municipality, Stara Zagora district Tomb of Seuthes III The Tomb of the Thracian King Seuthes III is situated in Bulgaria in the Golyamata Kosmatka mound, at a distance of 1 km south from the town of Shipka north from the town of Kazanlak (Bulgaria).The Tomb of Seuthes III - Atlas Obscura It was discovered in 2004 by the Bulgarian archaeologist Georgi Kitov. The Tomb was built in the second half of the fifth century BC. Items found inside included the golden crown of the ruler, a golden kylix (shallow wine cup), knee pads and a helmet, and applications for horse tackle, all exhibited in the historical museum of the town of Kazanlak. Remarkable is the bronze head of the statue of Sevt III buried ritually in front of the fa√ßade, which is quite detailed. It is an important evidence of the Thracian Orphic rituals. The sword of the Thracian king Seuthes III, found in his tomb.The hilt of the sword is in the shape of an eagle, gold inlaid. 3rd century BC,kept in the Museum of History Iskra, Kazanlak, Bulgaria. The tomb temple consists of a corridor, an anteroom, a round chamber with high tholos cover, and a rectangular chamber, constructed as a sarcophagus from two monolith blocks, one weighing more than 60 tons. The three halls are built of rectangular stone blocks and are covered with slabs. A two-winged marble door closes the entrance to the round chamber. The upper plains of the wings are decorated with images of the god Dionysus, who in the east part embodies the sun and in the west the earth and night. Georgi Kitov discovers the head thought to represent King Sevt III (Seuthes III) at the entrance of the mausoleum near the village of Shipka, October, 2004. The ritual couch and the ritual chamber are placed in the rectangular chamber. They were covered with fabric made of a golden thread, after that a splendid funeral of the ruler was performed. Above the phial, the jug, and the helmet was inscribed the name of Seuthes, which proves that in the beginning of third century BC here was buried Seuthes III, the famous Thracian ruler of the Odrysian kingdom. The capital of his kingdom, called Seuthopolis, is situated at about ten kilometres south-west from the tomb, on the bottom of Koprinka dam. The head of the statue of Seuthes is buried in the tomb, and it was placed on a pedestal in the capital Seuthopolis. The personal belongings and the gifts, needed for the afterlife of the ruler are carefully placed in the chamber. After the burial the entrance of the round chamber and the anteroom were blocked, the horse of the ruler was sacrificed, and the corridor was ritually set on fire. The tomb is a part of the Valley of the Thracian Kings, which also includes the Kazanlak tomb (recognised as part of the UNESCO world heritage), as well as the tombs and the temples found in the mounds Goliama Arsenalka, Shushmanets, Helvetsia, Grifoni, Svetitsa, and Ostrusha.

Throughout his club career, he played for Juventus, the club with which he won a Scudetto, two Coppe Italia, one UEFA Champions League, and two UEFA Cups; he also played for his home-town club Bologna, on two separate occasions. At international level, he represented Italy at the 1990 FIFA World Cup, where they finished in third place on home soil.  Club career  After starting out in the Bologna youth system, Marocchi played for Bologna (1982‚Äì88, 1996‚Äì2000) and Juventus (1988‚Äì96) throughout his career. In 18 seasons as a professional he collected 500 appearances in league play with 33 goals; 287 with Bologna (18 goals) and 213 with Juventus (15 goals). In Serie A he racked up 329 appearances and 20 goals. In his first spell with Bologna, he won the Serie B title during the 1987‚Äì88 season, earning promotion to Serie A. Upon returning to the club, he won the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 1998 as the club's captain, after inheriting the armband from Roberto Baggio. He helped Bologna to finish the league season in 8th place, earning a spot in the 1998‚Äì99 UEFA Cup, where they reached the semi-finals, losing out to Olympique Marseille; during the match he was sent- off, receiving a four-match suspension. He also helped Bologna to reach the semi-finals of the 1998‚Äì99 Coppa Italia. With Juventus, Marocchi enjoyed a successful eight season spell, featuring as a starter under managers Zoff, Maifredi and Trapattoni, even wearing the number 10 shirt on occasion during the 1989‚Äì90 season, although he began to be deployed with less frequency under Trapattoni and Lippi in later years; with the club, he won a Coppa Italia and an UEFA Cup in 1990, another UEFA Cup in 1993, a Scudetto-Coppa Italia double in 1995, as well as the Supercoppa Italiana and the UEFA Champions League in his final season with the club, in 1996. He retired from professional football in 2000.  International career  Marocchi earned 11 caps for the Italy national football team from 1988 to 1991, and was included by manager Azeglio Vicini in the 1990 FIFA World Cup squad, a tournament in which Italy reached the semi-finals, finishing in third place on home soil. He failed to make an appearance in the tournament, however, due to the presence of Giuseppe Giannini, Nicola Berti, and Carlo Ancelotti in midfield. He made his debut in a 2‚Äì0 win over Scotland on 22 December 1988, and he played his final match for Italy on 13 February 1991, in a home 0‚Äì0 draw against Belgium, in Terni.  After retirement  After retiring from professional football, Marocchi worked for his former club Bologna as a sporting director, in addition to other managerial positions; he also worked as a scout, as a coach, and with the youth sector.

The book has been distinguished in Mark Galeotti's Paths of Wickedness and Crimes for its discussion of organized crime in medieval Europe, and it forms part of the basis of the IEA's overview course on Crime and Society.  Overview  In popular culture, The Medieval Underworld has been suggested as a source of primary material for role-playing game developers. In medieval times there existed an insistence on conformity which bordered on the obsessive. This colourful account explores those times from the viewpoint of the men and women who were seen to be on the margins of society - who either would not, or could not, conform to the conventions of their era. The activities of outlaws, brigands, homosexuals, heretics, witches, Jews, prostitutes, thieves, vagabonds and other 'transgressors' are detailed here, as are the punishments - often barbarously savage - which were meted out to them by State and Church. Full of fascinating and unusual characters and facts which greatly enhance our view of the Middle Ages, The Medieval Underworld will enthral anyone interested in medieval social history or the history of crime and punishment.

It is the only member of the genus Morphnus. Description This species is a large but slender eagle. It measures 71‚Äì89 cm (28‚Äì35 in) long and has a wingspan of 138‚Äì176 cm (55‚Äì70 in). A small handful of crested eagles have been weighed, entirely either males or unsexed birds, and have scaled from . Standard measurements have indicated females are about 14% larger on average than males.Hilty, Steven L. Birds of Venezuela. Princeton University Press, 2002. Dari√©n, Panama The crested eagle has a large head, an effect enhanced by the often extended feather crest of its name. It has bare legs, with a sizable tarsus length of . The tail is fairly long, measuring in length. The wings are quite short for the eagle's size but are broad and rounded. Forest-dwelling raptors often have a relatively small wingspan in order to enable movement within the dense, twisted forest environments. The wing chord measures . The plumage of the crested eagle is somewhat variable. The head, back and chest of most adults are light brownish-gray, with a white throat and a dark spot on the crest and a small dark mask across the eyes. There are also various dark morphs where the plumage is sooty-gray or just blackish in some cases. The distinctive juvenile crested eagle is white on the head and chest, with a marbled-gray coloration on the back and wings. They turn to a sandy-gray color in the second year of life. Dark morph juveniles are similar but are dark brownish-gray from an early age. In flight, crested eagles are all pale below except for the grayish coloration on the chest. This species often overlaps in range with the less scarce Harpy eagle, which is likely its close relative and is somewhat similar to appearance. There is evidence of an interesting interspecific relationship between and adult Crested eagle feeding a juvenile Harpy eagle in Panama, while the adult Harpy eagles were away. During these interactions, the Crested eagle brought new nesting material to the nest and in occasions brought food to the juvenile Harpy eagle. The Crested eagle is roughly half that species' bulk and is clearly more slender. Generally, Crested eagles are silent but do make a call occasionally that consists of a pair of high whistles, with the second whistle being higher pitched than the first. Distribution and habitat It is sparsely distributed throughout its extensive range from northern Guatemala through Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, the subtropical Andes of Colombia, northeastern Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, Brazil (where it has suffered greatly from habitat destruction, being now found practically only in the Amazonian basinUira√ßu-falso (in Portuguese). eln.gov.br), and east Andean Ecuador, southeastern Peru, Paraguay and eastern Bolivia to north Argentina. The crested eagle lives in humid lowland forests, mostly comprised by tropical rainforests. They can also range in gallery strips and forest ravines. Over most of the range, sightings of the species are from sea level to . However, in the Andean countries, they appear to be local residents in foothill forests up to elevation or even . Ecology The crested eagle may avoid direct competition with the harpy eagle by taking generally smaller prey. Birds may comprise a larger portion of the diet for crested than they do for harpys. Birds such as jays, trumpeters and guans have been observed to be predated at fruiting trees and male cocks-of-the-rock have been predated while conspicuously performing at their leks. However, the crested eagle is certainly a powerful avian predator in its own right and most studies have indicated they are primarily a predator of small mammals. Often reflected in the diet are small monkeys, such as capuchin monkeys,Uira√ßu-falso. Wikiaves.com.br (2012-06-29). Retrieved on 2012-08-23. tamarins, and woolly monkeys. Other mammalian prey may include numerous arboreal rodents as well as opossums and kinkajous. Various studies have also pointed to the abundance of snakes (both arboreal and terrestrial varieties) and other reptiles (principally lizards) in its prey base, but the relative frequency of different types of prey apparently varies greatly on the individual level.Cf. Gavi√£o-real-falso (Morphnus guianensis). avesderapinabrasil.com The crested eagle seems to be a still-hunter, as it has been observed perched for long periods of time while visual scanning the forest around them. The crested eagle is almost always observed singly or in pairs. The breeding season is from March‚ÄìApril (the borderline between the dry season and the wet season in the neotropics) onwards. The nest is often huge but has a shallow cup and is typically in the main fork of a large tree, often concealed near the canopy in greenery. No further details are known of the breeding or brooding behavior of the species. Status The crested eagle has always seemed to occur at low densities and may occasionally elude detection in areas where they do occur. Though they still have a large distribution, they are currently classified as Near Threatened by the IUCN. Due to their seemingly high dependence on sprawling forest, they are highly affected by habitat destruction. They are believed to no longer occur in several former breeding areas where extensive forest have been cleared. It is thought that they are occasionally hunted by local people and, in some cases, are shot on sight. If discovered while perched, they are relatively easy to shoot, since they usually perch for extended periods of time.

Akuhead Pupule or Aku, was the morning air personality in 1965 at KGMB, an AM station in Honolulu, Hawaii. Biography Lewis was born Herschel Laib Hohenstein in Brooklyn, New York.Chicago Tribune: \\"Hal Lewis, 77, Legend of Hawaii Radio\\" July 22, 1983 He later legally shortened his name to Hal Lewis. He became a personality in his own right when he moved to Hawaii in 1946 from San Francisco, where he had been an unemployed violinist. His cabaret act failed and he soon became a staff announcer at KGMB in Honolulu. According to his newspaper biography, he was so poor that he had to sleep on Waikiki Beach. Although he was terminated for insubordination within weeks of his arrival, Hal Lewis was able to get another job at KPOA. It was at KPOA that Lewis perfected his own style of presentation, which incorporated repetitious time checks, and it was this gimmick that caused him to get the name \\"aku-head\\" from a furious listener after he had given out the incorrect time on the radio. Lewis then dropped his own name for J. Akuhead Pupule or plain Aku. Another version of this story is that at his first station, the station sales manager and his team brainstormed the moniker to explain to the innocent audience of post-War Honolulu that this talkative Jewish personality looked like a crazy fish head. When the sales manager brought his young son (who would be the third generation of his family to spend his own life on Honolulu's airwaves: Harry B Soria), to the station, he was shocked the first time he saw Aku as he was definitely not the bald-headed aged grandfather figure that his radio voice had conjured in his imagination. Using the name J. Akuhead Pupule, he had his own short-lived recording label, Aku Records. It had a green label, with a cartoon of Hal Lewis with an exaggerated nose. He persuaded Alfred Apaka to record on his label, with Aku backing him on violin. Aku also recorded himself singing and playing violin on \\"My Little Buckaroo,\\" among other tunes. =Radio Luxembourg= Never one to stay still, Aku began jumping from station to station in Hawaii and in the process he built up a following. In 1955 he showed up in London, England at the offices of the Radio Luxembourg programme listings magazine called 208. Aku asked to speak to the station management and he made a proposal to buy the morning time slot from 6 AM to 9 AM in order to present his own breakfast show. Unfortunately the transmitter which was located in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg was only capable of reaching the British Isles in strength during the evening hours and his proposal was rejected. KORL 650AM, Honolulu (The old KPOA) Aku broadcast from the \\"Tree House\\" at the International Market Place at Waikiki in the early 1960s. KGU 760AM, Honolulu Aku's broadcast home for several years was the top of the Advertiser Newspaper building in downtown Honolulu until he moved back to KGMB. At one time, one of the twin towers on roof of the Advertiser building had the KGU call letters in four foot neon lights. Aku had this changed to AKU in neon lights for several months. KGMB, Honolulu In 1965 Aku eventually managed to return to KGMB in Honolulu where his career had begun and where it blossomed as their morning show presenter. When Mayor Frank Fasi forbid Star-Bulletin reporter Richard Borreca to attend his press conferences, the newspaper sued and the case was heard by federal judge Sam King who ruled that the mayor's action was unconstitutional. Paul Siegel, Communication Law in America (Boston: Bowman & Littlefield, 2008), 289. When King lost his race for governor, Fasi personally attacked him. Aku invited them to appear together on his popular morning radio program, where King attacked back. King later observed that he and Frank Fasi didn't bear each other any real enmity, but that Aku had gotten his show a ratings boost. Aku was thought to be charming and contrary at the same time.

This mini-documentary was narrated by Lowell Thomas and is in the public domain. The film was sponsored by Texaco (known at the time as The Texas Company). The film was mocked in a seventh-season episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Plot The Chicken of Tomorrow deals with poultry farming and egg farming in the mid-1940s. Filmed to educate the public about how poultry and eggs are farmed, it also deals with how advances in genetic engineering and technology produce larger chickens. Eggs are farmed and kept in industrial incubators, and an equal number of chickens are used for meat and other products. Altogether, this produces more food for less money and allows people to support local poultry farms without breaking the bank. This is relatively similar to today's practice of poultry farming despite some technological differences.

As of the 2010 census it had a population of 6,611. The town of Greenwich is one political and taxing body, but consists of several distinct sections or neighborhoods, such as Byram, Cos Cob, Glenville, Mianus, Old Greenwich, Riverside and Greenwich (sometimes referred to as central, or downtown, Greenwich). Of these neighborhoods, three (Cos Cob, Old Greenwich, and Riverside) have separate postal names and ZIP codes.  History  One of the founding settlers of Old Greenwich was Elizabeth Fones,Mead, Spencer P. Ye Historie of Ye Town of Greenwich (New York: Knickerbocker Press, 1911), pp 4-9 niece and daughter-in-law of John Winthrop, founder and Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. What is now called Greenwich Point was known for much of its early history as \\"Elizabeth Neck\\" in recognition of Elizabeth (Fones) Feake Hallet and her 1640 purchase of the Point and much of the area now known as Old Greenwich. The Old Greenwich Railroad Station, originally called the \\"Sound Beach Railroad Station\\", built in 1894 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989, serves commuters in the neighborhood. The town's largest beach is on a long, thin peninsula at the southwest end of the neighborhood. The town's local beach is called Tod's Point after a former resident. The beach is now public property, which belongs to the town of Greenwich. Residents can purchase a seasonal beach pass. Non- residents can purchase a one-day pass for $7 per person and $35 per vehicle. During \\"off season\\", Innis Arden, a local golf club, is a popular sledding destination for kids in Old Greenwich and neighboring Stamford. Old Greenwich was known as \\"Sound Beach\\" in the 19th century, and the main road through the small downtown business section is Sound Beach Avenue. Old Greenwich had an industrial presence back in the 1950s and 1960s when Electrolux had a vacuum manufacturing facility on Forest Avenue, opposite \\"ECCman Center\\" (now Greenwich Civic Center). The Civic Center also hosted a very fine swamp where local kids would pick cattails and search for frogs and turtles. The town of Greenwich has one political body (RTM ‚Äì Representative Town Meeting). It has several distinct sections each with its own mailing address and ZIP code, such as Byram, Cos Cob, Glenville, Mianus, and Riverside and Greenwich proper (downtown Greenwich). The original \\"well to do\\" population lived mainly in \\"The Back Country\\" (north of the Merritt Parkway) or in the exclusive Belle Haven area on the waterfront. The town was founded there in 1641.  Geography  According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Old Greenwich has a total area of 3.48 mi2 (9.01 km2), of which 2.00 mi2 (5.17 km2) is land and 1.48 mi2 (3.84 km2), or 0.78%, is water.  Wealth  Residents in Old Greenwich are wealthy, making it among the 15% highest income communities in America. in 2018, the median household income was $233,519 and the per capita income was $104,542. The average household income in 2018 was $336,692.

He studied art at the Cummings School of Art, Des Moines, Iowa, and then at the National Academy of Design, and Art Students League of New York between 1926-28. In 1923, he was a resident painter member of The Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation at Oyster Bay, Long Island, New York. He traveled throughout Europe to study art in 1930 and then returned to the University of Iowa, where he, along with African American sculptor/printmaker Elizabeth Catlett, was one of the first in the nation to receive a Master of Fine Arts degree in 1940. While he was working toward this degree he participated in several WPA projects, which included a statue honoring Chief Blackhawk in 1934 at Crescent Park, Blackhawk Lake, Lakeside, Iowa; a memorial to Lewis and Clark, in 1936, in Council Bluffs, Iowa; and sculptured walls in the Iowa Union Building of the University of Iowa in 1940, honoring the sons and daughters of Iowa who served their country in military service. A model of the statue of Chief Blackhawk was exhibited in a place of honor in the Iowa Building at the Chicago Century of Progress Exposition. While in Iowa he worked with artists Grant Wood and Jean Charlot. In 1941 he moved to New York City with his family of wife, Ruth Eby Stinson, and two daughters, Carolyn and Norma. He joined the faculty the Art Department at Hunter College of the City of New York. He joined the Clay Club in Greenwich Village to have a place to create his own works and the Clay Club later became the Sculpture Center on 69th Street in NYC. His sculptures evolved from wood and clay, to stone, to welded steel.

He was most frequently deployed as a sweeper throughout his career. Tricella played for Italian clubs Internazionale, Verona, Juventus, and Bologna, winning a Coppa Italia with Inter, a Serie A title with Verona, and a Coppa Italia-UEFA Cup double with Juventus. At international level, he represented the Italy national football team at the 1984 Summer Olympics, and at the 1986 FIFA World Cup. Club career Tricella was born at Cernusco sul Naviglio, near Milan. During his club career he played for Inter (1977‚Äì79), Hellas Verona (1979‚Äì87), Juventus (1987‚Äì90), and Bologna (1990‚Äì92). With Inter, he made his Serie A debut, also winning the 1977‚Äì78 Coppa Italia. He later moved to Serie B club Hellas Verona, and during the 1984‚Äì85 Serie A season, he notably captained Osvaldo Bagnoli's Verona to an historic Serie A victory, the only league victory in the club's history. He later transferred to Juventus in 1987, as an intended replacement for Gaetano Scirea, and during his final season with the club, he briefly served as the club's captain in 1989, and was able to capture a Coppa Italia and UEFA Cup double, under manager Dino Zoff. International career Tricella earned 11 caps for the Italy national football team from 1984 to 1987, and he was included in Italy's 1986 FIFA World Cup squad under Enzo Bearzot, although he did not play in the tournament, serving as Gaetano Scirea's backup in the libero role. Under Bearzot's successor, manager Azeglio Vicini, he also received little space due to the presence of Franco Baresi on the team. He also competed for Italy at the 1984 Summer Olympics, where the team finished in fourth place after a semi-final defeat. Style of play A tenacious but fair defender, Tricella was known for his ability to time his challenges, as well as his ability to defend opponents in one on one situations, due to his mobility. He was also capable of starting quick attacking plays after winning back possession courtesy of his tactical intelligence, range of passing, and elegance on the ball. Although he was also capable of playing as a centre-back, he was most frequently deployed as a sweeper throughout his career, and stood out for his more modern interpretation of the role, which saw him often advance with the ball and launch counter-attacks with long passes, rather than simply clearing the ball away in the mold of a more traditional sweeper.

He worked in the Colonial Service in Africa and served as Governor of the Gambia from 1949 to 1958.  Early life and mountaineering  Wyn-Harris was born in Acton, Middlesex on 24 August 1903 as Percy Wynne Harris (he formally changed his name to Percy Wyn-Harris in 1953). He was the son of a company director and was educated at Gresham's School, Holt, and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. As an undergraduate, he was a member of the University Mountaineering Club. In 1925, he made the first ascent without guides of the Brouillard Ridge on Mont Blanc. In 1929, he met mountaineer Eric Shipton and together they climbed the twin peaks of Mount Kenya, making the first ascent of Nelion, the secondary summit. A member of Hugh Ruttledge's 1933 Mount Everest expedition, Wyn-Harris reached Edward Norton's record height of 8,573 m (28,126 feet). At around 8,460 m (27,920 ft), he discovered an ice axe, which was almost certainly a remnant of Mallory and Irvine's ill-fated attempt at the first ascent in 1924. Wyn-Harris returned to Everest in 1936, in an expedition again led by Hugh Ruttledge.  Colonial Service  = Kenya = Wyn-Harris joined the Colonial Service in Kenya in 1926. Originally a district officer, in 1939 to 1940 he served as Settlement Officer for Kikuyu Land Claims. He was the District Commissioner of Nyeri from 1941 to 1943, Labour Liaison Officer from 1943 to 1944, and Labour Commissioner from 1944 to 1945. He became Provincial Commissioner of the Central Province in 1946, serving for a year. He became Chief Native Commissioner and Minister for African Affairs in 1947, and served in this role until 1949. Lewis claims that, in his time in Kenya, Wyn-Harris viewed it as \\"overpopulated and desperately needing urbanization, birth control, and secondary industries.\\" = The Gambia = Wyn-Harris was appointed as Governor of the Gambia in December 1949. His time in office coincided with a growth of nationalist sentiment in West Africa. It was his belief that the Gambia should not progress towards self-government; rather, it should maintain a permanent link with the United Kingdom and be administered locally: what he termed the 'Channel Islands option'. Wyn-Harris was also opposed to the development of political parties in the Gambia. His first constitution in 1951 increased the number of elected members of the Legislative Council from two to three. After the 1951 election, he also rose the number of unofficial members of the Executive Council and did so again with his 1953 constitution. Two of these were granted specific portfolios and termed Ministers. Despite these reforms, Wyn-Harris was not popular among the Bathurst populace, particularly after he dismissed P. S. N'Jie from the Executive Council in January 1956. However, he was more popular in the Protectorate, having undertaken a determined effort to improve conditions there. Wyn-Harris left the Gambia in April 1958, having so upset the Bathurst population that he did so by slipping across the border to Senegal rather than doing so in a public ceremony. After his time in the Gambia, he was a member of the Devlin Commission of Enquiry into the Nyasaland disturbances in 1959 and served as the Administrator of the North Cameroons from October 1960 to June 1961. The North Cameroons was a region of Nigeria that had been a League of Nations mandate but had become a United Nations Trust Territory overseen by the United Kingdom. A United Nations plebiscite on the region's future conducted during his tenure resulted in the region formally becoming part of Nigeria at the end of May 1961.Kirk-Greene, A. H. M., Harris, Sir Percy Wyn (1903‚Äì1979), in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography online (subscription required), also published in book form by Oxford University Press, 2004  Retirement and death  Between 1962 and 1969, Wyn-Harris circumnavigated the globe in his sloop Spurwing, a Gunning Grundel. He died in Petersfield, Hampshire, aged 75.

He made his professional debut with his hometown club Fiorentina at the age of 18, although, despite his talent, he struggled to find space in the club due to the presence of the team's star playmaker Giancarlo Antognoni, with whom Di Gennaro faced competition for a starting spot as the two did not play well alongside each other. As a result, he moved to Perugia during the 1980‚Äì81 season, in order to gain more playing time, although it proved to be a negative season, as Perugia were ultimately relegated to Serie B at the end of the campaign. Di Gennaro switched clubs once again the following season, joining Verona; whilst at the club, he became a key player, serving as the team's main playmaker in midfield.

Style of play Described as a \\"modern\\" footballer, Di Gennaro was a quick, agile, versatile and well-rounded player, with good dribbling skills, who was known for his ability to adapt to different playing situations on the pitch, and was therefore capable of playing in several midfield positions. He stood out throughout his career for his pace work-rate, stamina, defensive skills, and ball winning abilities, as well as his creativity and offensive capabilities in midfield; due to his wide range of skills, he was capable of playing both as a defensive midfielder, or in the centre as a deep-lying playmaker, courtesy of his vision, technique, range of passing and strong mentality, which enabled him to start attacking plays or distribute the ball quickly to his teammates after winning back possession. Although he was mainly a team-player, he also had an ability to get forward, and was a powerful and accurate striker of the ball, and could also function as an advanced playmaker. In addition to his footballing ability, he was known for his leadership and humorous personality. After retirement Following his retirement, Di Gennaro worked for a time as one of the directors of his former club, Fiorentina.

Born in Bucharest, he emigrated to the United States in 1938. In June 1950, he received a Master of Arts from Columbia University, where he studied under Andr√© Martinet. With funding from the Ford Foundation, he studied the Uralic and Altaic languages at the University of Helsinki from 1951 to 1953 and Nivkh and Hokkaido at the University of Tokyo from 1953 to 1954. Life He earned his doctorate from the Department of Uralic and Altaic languages at Columbia University in December 1955. Afterwards, he returned to Japan to study the languages Nivkh, Orok, and Ainu, this time with funding from both the Ford Foundation and the American Philosophical Society. He also conducted research in Finland, funded by the New York Botanical Garden. He became Assistant Professor of Linguistic and Uralic Studies at Columbia University in 1958 and Associate Professor from 1962 to 1965. Between 1960 and 1965, together with Uriel Weinreich, William Diver, and Andr√© Martinet, he was co-editor of the journal Word. In 1965, he became Professor of Linguistic and Uralic Studies at Columbia, where he served as President of the Department of Linguistics for the following three years. In 1961, with funding from a National Science Foundation grant to Michael Krauss, Austerlitz conducted approximately one month of field work with the Eyak language, resulting in a collection of at least eight recordings and approximately 600 pages of manuscript notes, now housed at the Alaska Native Language Archive.Krauss, Michael E. 2006.

In 1965, with funding from Indiana University, he researched the Hungarian language by invitation of the Institute for Cultural Relations, located in Budapest, Hungary. He was visiting professor at eight universities, including Yale, Helsinki, and the University of California at Berkeley. He was Councilor of the Interlingua Institute, which funded and promoted Interlingua, from 1975 until his death in 1994. In 1990, he became President of the Linguistic Society of America. In the summer of 1994, shortly before his death, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Helsinki. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1991. Publications His publications include the books Ob-Ugric metrics: The metrical structure of Ostyak and Vogul folk-poetry (1958) and Finnish reader and glossary (1963). He was co-editor of Readings in linguistics II (1966) with Eric P. Hamp and Fred W. Householder. This volume followed Readings in linguistics (1958), edited by Martin Joos.

Young measures have applications in the calculus of variations and the study of nonlinear partial differential equations, as well as in various optimization (or optimal control problems). They are named after Laurence Chisholm Young who invented them, however, in terms of linear functionals already in 1937 still before the measure theory has been developed. Definition We let \\\\\\\\{ f_k \\\\\\\\}_{k=1}^\\\\infty be a bounded sequence in L^\\\\infty (U,\\\\mathbb{R}^m), where U denotes an open bounded subset of \\\\mathbb{R}^n. Then there exists a subsequence \\\\\\\\{ f_{k_j} \\\\\\\\}_{j=1}^\\\\infty \\\\subset \\\\\\\\{ f_k \\\\\\\\}_{k=1}^\\\\infty and for almost every x \\\\in U a Borel probability measure u_x on \\\\mathbb{R}^m such that for each F \\\\in C(\\\\mathbb{R}^m) we have F \\\\circ f_{k_j} \\\\overset{\\\\ast}{\\\\rightharpoonup} \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^m} F(y)d u_\\\\cdot(y) in L^\\\\infty (U).

Herndon, 273 U.S. 536 (1927), was a United States Supreme Court decision which struck down a 1923 Texas law forbidding blacks from voting in the Texas Democratic Party primary.. Due to the limited amount of Republican Party activity in Texas at the time following the suppression of black voting through poll taxes, the Democratic Party primary was essentially the only competitive process and chance to choose candidates for the Senate, House of Representatives and state offices. This case was one of four supported by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) that challenged the Texas Democratic Party's all-white primary, which was finally prohibited in the Supreme Court ruling Smith v. Allwright in 1944. Facts In 1902 the Texas legislature passed a requirement for a poll tax, which resulted in the suppressed voting by black and Mexican Americans. As voter participation by these groups declined, the Democratic Party became more dominant.\\"Historical Barriers to Voting\\", in Texas Politics, University of Texas, accessed 4 November 2012. Quote: Dr. Lawrence A. Nixon, a black physician in El Paso, Texas and member of the Democratic Party, sought to vote in the Democratic Party primary of 1924 in El Paso.\\"Jim Crow Supreme Court Cases: Texas\\", accessed 21 March 2008 The defendants were magistrates in charge of elections who prevented him from doing so on the basis of the 1923 Statute of Texas which provided that \\"in no event shall a negro be eligible to participate in a Democratic party primary election held in the State of Texas\\". Nixon sought an injunction against the statute in the federal district court. The district court dismissed the suit, and Nixon appealed to the United States Supreme Court. Issue Nixon argued that the statute violated the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution. The defendants argued that the Court lacked jurisdiction over the issue, as it was a political question. Ruling The Court, speaking through Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, unanimously rejected the argument that the political question doctrine barred the Court from deciding the case. The argument, said the Court, was \\"little more than a play upon words\\". While the injury which the plaintiff alleged \\"involved political action\\", his suit \\"allege[d] and s[ought] to recover for private damage\\". The Court then turned to the merits of the suit. It said that it was unnecessary to discuss whether the statute violated the Fifteenth Amendment, \\"because it seems to us hard to imagine a more direct and obvious infringement of the Fourteenth\\". The Court continued: The Court reversed the district court's dismissal of the suit. Aftermath Texas promptly enacted a new provision to continue restrictions on black voter participation, granting authority to political parties to determine who should vote in their primaries. Within four months the Executive Committee of the Democratic Party passed a resolution that \\"all white Democrats ... and none other\\" be allowed to participate in the approaching primary of 1927.\\"Nixon v.

Condon, against the all-white primary. The Court again ruled against the State, which passed another variation in a continuing endeavor to maintain the white primary system. It was not until Smith v.

It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Vo≈ædovac.  Location  Kumodra≈æ is located in the central-eastern part of the municipality, in the lower section of the Kumodra≈æ field (Kumodra≈°ko polje), in the valley of the creek of Kumodra≈°ki potok. Eastern and southern borders of the neighborhood are marked by a series of hills: Torlak, Golo Brdo, Stra≈æarska Kosa, and the Kumodra≈æ area is a source of many other creeks apart from the one that gave its name to the neighborhood: Rakoviƒçki potok (flows through the neighborhoods of Selo Rakovica and Rakovica), Lipica (Jajinci), Zavojniƒçka reka (a tributary to the Boleƒçica river), Bubanj potok (flows through Bubanj Potok, also a tributary to the Boleƒçica), Kamena voda, etc. To the north, Kumodra≈æ is bordered by the neighborhood of Vo≈ædovac, to the north-west by Veliki Mokri Lug and to the east by Jajinci.

At some point it was joining the aqueduct from the Mokri Lug Hill, and then continued further to the Singidunum castrum. Both Mokri Lug and Kumodra≈æ are hills, so the natural inclination allowed for the water to flow downhill to Singidunum. During the pre-World War I period, Kumodra≈æ had its own municipality which stretched north to the eastern outskirts of Belgrade, comprising outer city suburbs, today neighborhoods, like Du≈°anovac. Kumodra≈æ used to be a small, agricultural village far from downtown Belgrade, but after the 1960s the population boosted as it was case in almost all Belgrade's suburbs at the time. In the 1970s Kumodra≈æ was administratively declared a local community (\\"mesna zajednica\\") within the municipality of Vo≈ædovac (part of the Belgrade City proper, u≈æa teritorija grada), rather than being a separate settlement. Today, Kumodra≈æ makes one continuous built up area, even though it is about 10 kilometers away from downtown. It is divided into several sub-neighborhoods: Kumodra≈æ, Kumodra≈æ I, Kumodra≈æ II and Torlak. One of the most important Serbian army leaders in modern history, vojvoda Stepa Stepanoviƒá, was born in Kumodra≈æ in 1856 and his birthplace is turned into memorial-house dedicated to him, and the nearby woods is named Stepin Lug (\\"Stepa's grove\\"). In addition, the main street in Kumodra≈æ is named Vojvode Stepe (though it begins much closer to downtown, at Autokomanda). There is a Church of the Holy Trinity in the neighborhood. Next to it is a small cemetery which hosts the memorial to the Serbian soldiers killed during the short Austro-Hungarian occupation of Belgrade in the late 1914, within the scopes of the World War I. A memorial was erected on the location of the 1914-1915 seat of the Belgrade Defense Headquarters. Old Meyhane in located in the central part of the former village. It was built in 1865 as the Ottoman watchpost along the Kragujevac Road. Serbian government later adapted it into the gendarmerie post while in World War I it was turned into the mayhane and then into the military hospital. Later it became kafana, grocery store and library of the \\"Vojvoda Stepa\\" elementary school. In time, the arcade porch was replaced with the architrave one and the roof shingles were replaced with the proper roof tiles. It was placed under the preliminary state protection, but became derelict in time.  Kumodra≈æ I  Central and western extension of the neighborhood, the core of the modern settlement of Kumodra≈æ. It extends into Kumodra≈æ II on the east, Kumodra≈æ II on the north and Torlak on the north-west. Connected to Belgrade by the bus lines 33 and 39.  Kumodra≈æ II  Northern extension of the neighborhood, which makes urban connection to the neighborhood of Vo≈ædovac is named Kumodra≈æ II. It is a modern sub-neighborhood, located in the area marked by the elbow turn of the Kumodra≈°ka street and the street of Vojvode Stepe. It makes a direct extension of the Vo≈ædovac's industrial zone along the Kumodra≈°ka street. Connected to Belgrade by the bus line 25.  Torlak  The entire western section of Kumodra≈æ is a sub-neighborhood of Torlak. It was named after the 308 meters-high hill of Torlak, which was very important in the military operations for the defense of Belgrade in World War I.

The Ultimate Motorcycle Book p. 41 Dorling-Kindersley Limited, 1993 Origin Arthur \\"Connie\\" Constantine, Assistant Chief Engineer at the Harley-Davidson Motor Company, drew up plans for a mid-sized V-Twin to compete against the Indian Scout. When he presented the unauthorized project to co-founder Walter Davidson, he was reprimanded for wasting the company's time.Pioneers of American Motorcycle Racing by Daniel K. Statnekov, Chapter 22 Constantine resigned his position at Harley-Davidson and offered his services and his project to Excelsior. Both were accepted, leading to the introduction of the Excelsior Super X in 1925. The design proved to be competitive in motorsports in its first year despite competing against motorcycles with engines of greater capacity. The Super X effectively replaced Excelsior's other mainstream model, a sixty-one cubic inch V-Twin, which was discontinued during the first year of Super X production. The smaller motorcycle was believed to be a more suitable companion product for their Henderson four-cylinder motorcycle. Construction The design of the Super X was a considerable departure from its predecessors at Excelsior. Where earlier Excelsiors had an enclosed primary chain transmitting power from the engine to a separate gearbox, the Super X had the engine and transmission together in a single crankcase, using a helical gear to power the transmission directly from the engine. The Super X also marked the return of leading-link forks on Excelsior motorcycles, which had earlier switched to trailing-link forks similar to those used by Indian but with coil springs instead of Indian's quarter-elliptic leaf springs. Competition in the market The Super X had originally been envisioned as a competitor to the Indian Scout which was, at the time, powered by a thirty-seven cubic inch V-twin engine.Wilson, H. The Encyclopedia of the Motorcycle p. 104-105 Dorling-Kindersley Limited, 1995 Indian's initial response to the Super X came in 1927, when they enlarged the Scout engine to forty-five cubic inches. This defensive move was followed a year later with a more decisive attack, the introduction of the 101 Scout. The new Scout proved to be a formidable competitor both on the racetrack and in the marketplace.Wilson, H. The Ultimate Motorcycle Book p. 36-37 Dorling- Kindersley Limited, 1993 In 1929, the Excelsior-Henderson concern restyled both its motorcycle offerings, the Excelsior Super X and the Henderson Four, for a more contemporary look. These \\"Streamline\\" models had tanks that hid the top tube of the frame and wide front fenders with holes for the forks to pass through. That year, Harley-Davidson released their forty-five cubic inch motorcycles, the D and the DL. The Super X competed with the 101 Scout, the D, and the DL, until 1931. During 1931, the Indian 101 Scout was replaced by a Scout model based on the heavier Chief frame, the sport solo DLD was added to the D and DL in the Harley-Davidson line, and the Excelsior-Henderson concern ceased production of motorcycles upon the order of its proprietor, Ignaz Schwinn. Legacy The Super X was America's first forty-five cubic inch motorcycle, and the racing class for forty-five cubic inch motorcycles was started in the United States one year after the Super X's introduction. The forty-five cubic inch class became the premier class in dirt-track racing, in which such motorcycles as the Indian Sport Scout and Harley-Davidson WR, KR, and XR would compete. Although the Super X came to an abrupt end, its competitors from Indian and Harley-Davidson would continue for at least a decade.Mitchel, D. \\"Harley-Davidson Chronicle - An American Original\\" p. 68-69 Publications International Limited, 1997 References Excelsior motorcycles Motorcycles introduced in the 1920s ","title":"Excelsior Super X"},{"id":"9659640","text":"Ray Sparenberg was a host of early horror movies from 1958 to 1963 as a character called Selwin, on WISH-TV in Indianapolis, Indiana.

Christ Church follows an Anglo-Catholic style of worship and has a strong focus on urban ministry. The parish began as an offshoot from New Haven's Trinity Church, the central Episcopal church on New Haven's town green. The church building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. History The church building, completed in 1898, was designed by architect Henry Vaughan. It is notable for its very fine Gothic architecture, and its central location near downtown New Haven makes it something of a landmark. Its stone tower is modeled on the tower of Magdalen College, Oxford. Vaughn personally chose the artists who created the beautiful interior. Bavarian-born Johannes Kirchmayer executed the intricate wood carving, notable in particular on the rood screen. The stained glass windows (including a large window at the back of the sanctuary above the baptismal font) were created by the noted firm of C.E. Kempe in London. The high altar also features monmunental stone figures and a carved Caen stone reredos inspired by examples in Winchester Cathedral and St. Alban's in England. The church's Solemn High Mass (11:00am Sundays) is locally notable for its fine choral music and beautiful liturgy.

The first one is a rebadged Land Rover Discovery sold in Japan between 1993 and 1998, while the other is a vehicle developed by Honda for the Japanese market that was introduced in 2007.  First generation (1993‚Äì1998)  Honda marketed the Crossroad in the Japanese market. Honda replaced the Crossroad with its CR-V. To date, the Crossroad is the only Honda to ever have a V8 engine. Even the flagship sedan and the sports car never had it. The Crossroad had been marketed in Japan from October, 1993 to 1998. Problems had emerged regarding the marketing of the Crossroad in Japan. For instance, Honda had threatened to end ties with Rover after the news that it was going to be sold to BMW. Not only were there marketing issues related to the vehicle, but mechanical ones as well. Since the Crossroad was a rebadged Land Rover Discovery, it also had Land Rover's reliability issues carried over. In 1997, a recall was issued by Honda on the advice of Ministry of Transportation due to a malfunction locking mechanism on the SUV's driver-side front door that could make the vehicle open while driving. Around 4,754 vehicles made from July 1995 to December 1996 were affected by the recall.  Second generation (2007‚Äì2010)  The Crossroad name was resurrected as a new crossover SUV for the Japanese market in February 2007. The vehicle combines the exterior design of an SUV with the convenient size of a compact car and the 3-row seating and 7-passenger capacity. The Crossroad is designed for people to enjoy their active new lifestyles, targeting young couples in their 20s and 30s with small children. Under the hood, the Crossroad sports one of two straight-4 engines of 1.8 L and 2.0 L in displacement. Both will be mated to the only available transmission: a 5-speed automatic. Honda's Real-Time AWD system has been thoroughly revised for the Crossroad. It now works in conjunction with stability and traction control as well as ABS brakes. For the first time in a Honda, the Crossroad will be equipped with Hill-Start Assist which temporarily maintains brake pressure after the brake pedal is released when starting on a hill. Under normal driving conditions, the Crossroad behaves as a FWD vehicle. According to AutoWeek, Honda said it won't import the Crossroad to North America, since their similarly-sized Element takes its place. Honda's crossover SUV lineup in the United States and Canada already has the Element, the mid-priced CR-V and the larger Pilot, as all three models are made in North America. It was reported that Honda did not export the Crossroad to Europe because of a voluntary commitment by the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association to reduce average CO2 emissions in its European fleet to 140 grams per kilometer by 2009. As a result, Honda was reluctant to offer larger vehicles without technological breakthrough. On August 25, 2010, Honda posted on its Japanese website that the Crossroad was discontinued.

She is best remembered for her legendary hospitality as owner and operator of Banka Banka Station, a cattle station and World War II supply camp. In fact, she was known as \\"The Missuss of Banka Banka.\\" Biography =Early life and career= Ward was the eldest of eight children of John McEntyre, an engineer from Victor Harbor, and his wife Margaret Anne. By 1904, the family had moved to the Western Australian goldfields, living first at Kalgoorlie and then Coolgardie. Mary began teaching at Tunneys State School in June 1915, and gained her junior cadet training certificate in September of the next year. From 1918 to 1924 she taught at Kalgoorlie, Boulder and Carlisle. She was promoted to head teacher in 1924, and moved to Parkfield, Pingrup, Cottesloe, Wyering, Keysbrook and Latham before transferring to Wyndham, Western Australia in 1932. =Married life= On 27 December 1932, Mary Alice married Philip \\"Ted\\" Ward, a stockman, at the office of the district registrar in Wyndham. For two years, the Wards lived at Jack Kilfoyle's Rosewood station, 120 miles southeast of Wyndham. With Mary's brother Stuart, they joined the gold rush at Tennant Creek, Northern Territory, in 1935. Prospecting at a mine site that they called Blue Moon, the family struck gold, reputedly worth about $150,000. In 1941, the Wards bought the cattle station Banka Banka, where Mary supervised the development of an extensive garden. =Able widow= After her husband's death in 1959, Mary ably ran Banka Banka and the family's other stations. She also owned a butcher shop at Tennant Creek, supplying it from a slaughterhouse on the property. One of her cattle managers recalled that she spent money on the welfare of her Aboriginal staff - many of whom she trained in domestic and station duties - while economizing on repairs and improvements, and eschewing new management methods. She was known to have dismissed white employees because of their ill treatment of Aborigines. She acquired five houses at Tennant Creek for her old retainers and, despite objections from the local town management board, arranged for construction in 1968 and 1969 of a large red-brick building to house former employees and their relatives. The \\"Mary Ward Hostel,\\" as it was known in addition to the \\"Pink Palace,\\" was later used for a range of community purposes. =Motherly figure= Having no children of her own, Ward cared for the babies of her Warumungu employees. In the 1950s, a native affairs branch inspector wrote that \\"youngsters on this station look the picture of health, and this is entirely due to the unremitting personal care and attention given by Mrs. Ward.\\" She did not agree with the policy of removing part-Aborigines from their mothers. They sent children to school at Alice Springs at their own expense until 1961, when due to her efforts a government school opened at Banka Banka. =Death and legacy= In 1970, suffering ill health, Mary Alice Ward sold Banka Banka and moved to Adelaide, back in her native South Australia. She died on 27 July 1972, at her North Adelaide home, and was buried with Catholic rites in Centennial Park Cemetery.

Under such conditions, the sample will emit the high harmonics of the generation beam (above the fifth harmonics). Due to the coherent nature of the process, high harmonics generation is a prerequisite of attophysics. Perturbative harmonic generation Perturbative harmonic generation is a process whereby laser light of frequency œâ and photon energy ƒßœâ can be used to generate new frequencies of light. The newly generated frequencies are integer multiples nœâ of the original light's frequency. This process was first discovered in 1961 by Franken et al.,P. A. Franken, A. E. Hill, C. W. Peters, and G. Weinreich, Phys. Rev. Lett. 7, 118 (1961). using a ruby laser, with crystalline quartz as the nonlinear medium. Harmonic generation in dielectric solids is well understood and extensively used in modern laser physics (see second-harmonic generation). In 1967 New et al. observed the first third harmonic generation in a gas. In monatomic gases it is only possible to produce odd numbered harmonics for reasons of symmetry. Harmonic generation in the perturbative (weak field) regime is characterised by rapidly decreasing efficiency with increasing harmonic order.J. Wildenauer, Journal of Applied Physics 62, 41 (1987). This behaviour can be understood by considering an atom absorbing n photons then emitting a single high energy photon. The probability of absorbing n photons decreases as n increases, explaining the rapid decrease in the initial harmonic intensities. Development The first high harmonic generation was observed in 1977 in interaction of intense CO2 laser pulses with plasma generated from solid targets. HHG in gases, far more widespread in application today, was first observed by McPherson and colleagues in 1987, and later by Ferray et al. in 1988, with surprising results: the high harmonics were found to decrease in intensity at low orders, as expected, but then were observed to form a plateau, with the intensity of the harmonics remaining approximately constant over many orders. Plateau harmonics spanning hundreds of eV have been measured which extend into the soft X-ray regime. This plateau ends abruptly at a position called the high harmonic cut-off. Properties High harmonics have a number of interesting properties. They are a tunable table-top source of XUV/soft X-rays, synchronised with the driving laser and produced with the same repetition rate. The harmonic cut-off varies linearly with increasing laser intensity up until the saturation intensity Isat where harmonic generation stops. The saturation intensity can be increased by changing the atomic species to lighter noble gases but these have a lower conversion efficiency so there is a balance to be found depending on the photon energies required. High harmonic generation strongly depends on the driving laser field and as a result the harmonics have similar temporal and spatial coherence properties. High harmonics are often generated with pulse durations shorter than that of the driving laser. Streaking of 43-attosecond soft-X-ray pulses generated by a passively CEP-stable mid-infrared, https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.25.027506 This is due to the nonlinearity of the generation process, phase matching and ionization. Often harmonics are only produced in a very small temporal window when the phase matching condition is met. Depletion of the generating media due to ionization also means that harmonic generation is mainly confined to the leading edge of the driving pulse. High harmonics are emitted co-linearly with the driving laser and can have a very tight angular confinement, sometimes with less divergence than that of the fundamental field and near Gaussian beam profiles. Semi- classical approach The maximum photon energy producible with high harmonic generation is given by the cut-off of the harmonic plateau. This can be calculated classically by examining the maximum energy the ionized electron can gain in the electric field of the laser. The cut-off energy is given by; : E_{max}=I_p+3.17U_p where Up is the ponderomotive energy from the laser field and Ip is the ionization potential. This derivation of the cut-off energy is derived from a semi-classical calculation. The electron is initially treated quantum mechanically as it tunnel ionizes from the parent atom, but then its subsequent dynamics are treated classically. The electron is assumed to be born into the vacuum with zero initial velocity, and to be subsequently accelerated by the laser beam's electric field. The three-step model Half an optical cycle after ionization, the electron will reverse direction as the electric field changes, and will accelerate back towards the parent nucleus. Upon returning to the parent nucleus it can then emit bremsstrahlung-like radiation during a recombination process with the atom as it returns to its ground state. This description has become known as the recollisional model of high harmonic generation. Electron return energy (full blue curve) and excursion time (blue dashed curve), as a function of the return time Since the frequency of the emitted radiation depends on both the kinetic energy and on the ionization potential, the different frequencies are emitted at different recombination time (i.e. the emitted pulse is chirped). What is more, for every frequency, there are two corresponding recombination times. We refer to these two trajectories as the short trajectory (which are emitted first), and the long trajectory. Some interesting limits on the HHG process which are explained by this model show that HHG will only occur if the driving laser field is linearly polarised. Ellipticity on the laser beam causes the returning electron to miss the parent nucleus. Quantum mechanically, the overlap of the returning electron wavepacket with the nuclear wavepacket is reduced. This has been observed experimentally, where the intensity of harmonics decreases rapidly with increasing ellipticity. Another effect which limits the intensity of the driving laser is the Lorentz force. At intensities above 1016 Wcm‚àí2 the magnetic component of the laser pulse, which is ignored in weak field optics, can become strong enough to deflect the returning electron. This will cause it to \\"miss\\" the parent nucleus and hence prevent HHG. Phase matching As in every nonlinear process, phase matching plays an important role in high harmonic generation in gas phase. The four causes of wave vector mismatch are: neutral dispersion, plasma dispersion, Gouy phase, and dipole phase. The neutral dispersion is caused by the atoms while the plasma dispersion is due to the ions, and the two have opposite signs. The Gouy phase is due to wavefront phase jump close to the focus, and varies along it. Finally the dipole phase arise from the atomic response in the HHG process.(need reference) When using a gas jet geometry, the optimal conditions for generating high harmonics emitted from short trajectories are obtained when the generating gas is located after the focus, while generation of high harmonics from long trajectory can be obtained off-axis when the generating gas is located before the focus. When using a gas jet geometry, focusing the laser into the Mach disk can increase the efficiency of harmonic generation.

After Emperor Taizu's death in 926, she served as empress dowager to her own death in 953. She was directly involved in two imperial successions and is credited with changing expectations of widows in Khitan society.  Background  Shul√º Ping was born in 879. Her great-great-grandfather Shul√º Nuosi (Ëø∞ÂæãÁ≥ØÊÄù) was said to be of Huigu extraction. Her father was named Shul√º Pogu (Ëø∞ÂæãÂ©ÜÂßë), who also had the name of Yuewan (ÊúàÁ¢ó), who served under the Khitan Yaonian Clan (ÈÅôËº¶). Her mother was said to be a daughter of \\"King Yundejia\\" (ÂãªÂæ∑ÊÅùÁéã) ‚Äî apparently the grandfather of her eventual husband Yel√º Abaoji, Yel√º Yundeshi (ËÄ∂ÂæãÂãªÂæ∑ÂØ¶) ‚Äî which would make her and Yel√º Abaoji cousins. Eventually, she married Yel√º Abaoji as his wife, but it is not known when that occurred.History of Liao, vol. 71. She bore Yel√º Abaoji three sons ‚Äî Yel√º Bei, Yel√º Deguang, and Yel√º Lihu.History of Liao, vol. 64.  During Emperor Taizu's reign  In 916, Yel√º Abaoji, having consolidated the power over the Khitan tribes into his hands, declared himself emperor of a new Khitan Empire (as Emperor Taizu), and created Lady Shul√º Ping empress. As empress, she was described as brave, resolute, and full of strategies, often participating in Emperor Taizu's military decisions. There was one time when Emperor Taizu were attacking the Dangxiang through the desert. He left Empress Shul√º in charge of the headquarters. Hearing that he was away, two Shiwei tribes, the Huangtou (ÈªÉÈ†≠) and the Choubo (Ëá≠Ê≥ä), decided to raid the Khitan headquarters. She heard of their plans, however, and put her army on an ambush posture, crushing them upon their arrival. Her reputation among the nomadic people thereafter became prominent. It was said that she refused to bow to her mother and her mother-in-law, but rather received their bows, stating, \\"I only bow to Heaven, not to people.\\" As, at that time, the Shatuo prince of Jin, Li Cunxu, was locked in a war against archrival Later Liang, he sought an alliance with the Khitan, and he honoured Emperor Taizu as an uncle and Empress Shul√º as an aunt.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 269. In 921, the general Lu Wenjin, who had defected from Jin to Khitan, urged Emperor Taizu to attack Jin. About the same time, two coups occurred within the domains of Jin allies Zhao and Yiwu Circuit (Áæ©Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei) ‚Äî as Zhao's prince Wang Rong was assassinated and his adoptive son Zhang Wenli seized control of the domain, and Yiwu's military governor Wang Chuzhi was overthrown by his adoptive son Wang Du. Zhang sought aid from Khitan. Wang Chuzhi's biological son Wang Yu (ÁéãÈÉÅ) fled to Khitan, also encouraging Emperor Taizu to aid Zhang and use the chance to take control of both domains. Emperor Taizu agreed, and launched his army south. Empress Shul√º opposed the operation. The Khitan army was subsequently defeated by the Jin army, and forced to withdraw.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 271. In 926, Emperor Taizu launched a major attack on Balhae, conquering it. He converted it to a kingdom named Dongdan, creating his and Empress Shul√º's oldest son Yel√º Bei its king, with the title of \\"Imperial King of Man\\" (‰∫∫ÁöáÁéã, Ren Huangwang) ‚Äî while their second son Yel√º Deguang was, at the same time, given the title of \\"Generalissimo Crown Prince\\".Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275. It was said that this campaign was conducted with Empress Shul√º's strategies. Soon after conquering Balhae, Emperor Taizu died. Empress Shul√º, at that time with Yel√º Bei at Dongan, apparently to destroy potential dissent, gathered the wives of many generals and officials that she considered difficult to control, and stated to them, \\"I am now a widow. You should be like I am.\\" Then, she gathered their husbands and, weeping, asked them, \\"Do you miss the deceased Emperor?\\" They responded, \\"The deceased Emperor has shown us much grace. Of course we miss him.\\" She responded, \\"If you miss him, then go see him.\\" She then slaughtered them. She then, leaving Emperor Taizu's younger brother Yel√º Anduan (ËÄ∂ÂæãÂÆâÁ´Ø) temporarily in charge at Dongdan, returned to the Khitan capital Linhuang (Ëá®ÊΩ¢, in modern Chifeng, Inner Mongolia) with Yel√º Bei, escorting Emperor Taizu's casket. Once then returned to Linhuang, she wanted to divert the succession away from Yel√º Bei, as she had favored Yel√º Deguang. However, formally, she called an assembly of the chieftains, along with Yel√º Bei and Yel√º Deguang, and stated to them, \\"I love both of my sons, and I do not know which one to make emperor. You can decide which one you wish to support by holding his rein.\\" The chieftains, knowing that she favoured Yel√º Deguang, rushed to him and held to his rein. She thereafter declared him emperor (as Emperor Taizong). Yel√º Bei, angry over this turn of events, took several hundred soldiers and wanted to flee to Later Tang (Jin's successor state), but was intercepted by Khitan border guards. Empress Shul√º did not punish him, but sent him to Dongdan.The History of Liao gave an account where it was Yel√º Bei who voluntarily yielded the throne to Emperor Taizong, but that would appear to be inconsistent with his subsequent actions. See History of Liao, vol. 72.  During Emperor Taizong's reign  Emperor Taizong honored Empress Shul√º as empress dowager, and it was said that she made the key decisions for the state. She also had him marry her niece (Xiao Wen) as empress. (The reason why Empress Xiao, and other members of her clan, were from this point referred to with the surname of Xiao rather than Shul√º, was that Emperor Taizu had the several clans that produced consorts for his line change their names to Xiao.) It was said that Emperor Taizong was filially pious, such that if she were unable to eat due to an illness, he would not eat either. She commissioned the ethnically Han Chinese official Han Yanhui as a chancellor. She also allowed the Later Tang emissary Yao Kun (ÂßöÂù§), whom Emperor Taizu had detained, to return to Later Tang, and sent an emissary herself to Later Tang to report Emperor Taizu's death. Meanwhile, Empress Dowager Shul√º continued to carry out killings of those she considered difficult to control. She would often tell such killing targets, \\"Deliver a message to the deceased Emperor for me!\\" After they arrived at Emperor Taizu's tomb, she would execute them. After several hundreds were killed in this way, she sent one Zhao Siwen (Ë∂ôÊÄùÊ∫´) to do so. Zhao refused. She stated to him, \\"You were a close attendant of the deceased Emperor. Why do you refuse to go?\\" He responded, \\"No one was closer than you, Empress. If you go, I, your subject, will go next.\\" Apparently impressed, she responded, \\"It is not that I am not willing to follow the deceased Emperor below ground. It is that the heir, my son, is young and weak. The state needs a leader, and therefore I cannot go.\\" However, she cut off one of her hands and ordered that it be buried at Emperor Taizu's tomb. After this event, Zhao was spared. (Another account had it that she wanted to die as well at Emperor Taizu's death, but was dissuaded by her relatives, so she then came up with the solution of cutting off one of her hands.) In 936, the Later Tang general Shi Jingtang, with military assistance from Emperor Taizong, overthrew then- Later Tang emperor Li Congke and established a new state of Later Jin, subservient to the Khitan. When one of the Later Tang generals that Emperor Taizong captured, Zhao Dejun the military governor of Lulong Circuit (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered in modern Beijing), was delivered to Empress Dowager Shul√º, she pointed out Zhao's hypocrisy in claiming to want to defend the Later Tang emperor while actually engaging in negotiations with Emperor Taizong to have his support for the throne instead. When Zhao offered his properties at Lulong's capital You Prefecture (ÂπΩÂ∑û) to her, she pointed out that Shi, as part of his agreement with Emperor Taizong to cede 16 prefectures to Khitan, had already been ceded to her, and therefore was no longer Zhao's, causing Zhao to be distressed and subsequently dying in Khitan captivity.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280. Shi Jingtang honoured Emperor Taizong and Empress Dowager Shul√º faithfully and often offered them gifts, and in fact referred to himself as \\"Son Emperor\\" and Emperor Taizong as \\"Father Emperor.\\"Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 281. However, after Shi Jingtang's death and succession by his nephew Shi Chonggui, Shi Chonggui took a confrontational stance against Khitan ‚Äî now known as Liao ‚Äî refusing to submit to Emperor Taizong as a subject, only referring to himself as \\"grandson.\\" He also had Liao merchants arrested, and their assets seized. As a result, war erupted between the states.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283. Empress Dowager Shul√º was not in favor of waging war against Later Jin. As a result, Emperor Taizong entered into some peace negotiations with Shi Conggui in 945 that, however, were ultimately fruitless.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 284. In 946, Shi Chonggui commissioned the Later Jin general Du Wei with an army to attack Liao, with the intent to recapture the territory Shi Jingtang previously ceded to Liao. Emperor Taizong, however, was able to have Du's army surrounded, and Du surrendered. He then attacked south toward Later Jin's capital Kaifeng. With the capital defenceless because the army had been given to Du, Shi Chonggui surrendered, ending Later Jin.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 285. Emperor Taizong initially claimed to be the emperor for the former Later Jin territory as well. To congratulate him for this great victory, Empress Dowager Shul√º sent wine, delicacies, and fruits from Khitan lands to Kaifeng. Whenever he drank the wine that she sent, he stood up and stated, \\"This was bestowed by the Empress Dowager. I do not dare to drink it sitting down.\\"Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 286. Soon, however, faced with many rebellions against Liao rule in the former Later Jin lands, Emperor Taizong decided to return north to Liao proper. However, he became ill on the way and died near Heng Prefecture (ÊÅÜÂ∑û, in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei). Upon receiving his casket, Empress Dowager Shul√º did not weep. Instead, she, apparently sensing that her power would be challenged, stated, \\"When all of the tribes are peaceful, I will then bury you.\\"  During Emperor Shizong's and Emperor Muzong's reigns  In fact, Empress Dowager Shul√º's will would soon be challenged. She had intended that Emperor Taizong be succeeded by Yel√º Lihu. However, the Khitan chieftains, remembering how she had slaughtered many upon Emperor Taizu's death, decided to support Yel√º Bei's son Yel√º Ruan the Prince of Yongkang instead, and Yel√º Ruan declared himself emperor at Heng Prefecture (as Emperor Shizong). He continued north, heading toward Linhuang. Empress Dowager Shul√º sent troops under her to resist Emperor Shizong's progress.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 287. Yel√º Lihu, in command of these troops, was however defeated by Emperor Shizong's forward commanders Yel√º Anduan and Yel√º Liuge (ËÄ∂ÂæãÁïôÂì•), and she then negotiated a peace agreement accepting Emperor Shizong as emperor.History of Liao, vol. 72. Emperor Shizong then put her under house arrest at Emperor Taizu's tomb at Zu Prefecture (Á•ñÂ∑û, in modern Chifeng). She died there in 953, during the reign of Emperor Muzong, a son of Emperor Taizong's. Both Shizong and Muzong resented her for supporting Lihu, so neither lifted her house arrest, nor honored her as grand empress dowager. She was buried with Emperor Taizu. Important Contributions While Empress Shul√º dominated the court in the first succession, she also made other contributions to Khitan culture. Most importantly regards the expectations of widows. In traditional Khitan society, women were expected to sacrifice themselves. Obviously, she did not do that, providing an example for other women, at least within the elite strata, of Khitan society. Differences from Chinese counterparts Chinese empress dowagers of the era were expected to wield their influence behind the scenes. However, Khitan women held a far higher status than their Chinese counterparts in the tenth century. Empress Shul√º openly wielded her influence in the court of her husband as well as that of her son as empress dowager.

It was produced by Frank Mancuso Jr., from a screenplay by Red and Norman Snider, who dramatized a story that Patricia Herskovic and Joyce Taylor had based on the horror novel Choice Cuts by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac. The film follows a psychologist who undergoes an experimental arm transplant surgery and begins having visions of murders.  Plot  Bill Chrushank is a psychologist working with convicted killers at a prison. While driving to work, Bill gets in a horrific car accident and loses an arm. At the hospital, Dr. Agatha Webb convinces Bill's wife to sign off on an experimental transplant surgery. Bill awakens from the surgery and begins to adjust to his new arm. After he is released from the hospital, he resumes his work and things seem to be back to normal. However, Bill starts seeing visions of horrible acts of murder (as if he is committing them) and occasionally loses control of his new arm. At the prison, a convict tells Bill that the tattoo on his new arm is only given to inmates on death row. Bill has a police friend scan his new fingerprints and is shocked to discover the arm came from convicted serial killer Charley Fletcher, who had murdered 20 people. Bill confronts Dr. Webb and finds the identities of two other patients: Mark Draper and Remo Lacey who received the killer's legs and other arm, respectively. Bill visits Remo, who was a struggling artist before the transplant but now is making a small fortune selling paintings he made with his new arm. Noting Remo's paintings depict the same visions he had, Bill tells him that he is painting what the killer saw. Remo, however, only cares about his newfound success and dismisses Bill's warnings. Bill meets Mark and tries to warn him but Mark is just happy to be able to walk again and advises Bill to be grateful and move on. Bill becomes increasingly agitated and violent. He demands that Dr. Webb remove his arm but she refuses, stating that the problems he is experiencing are insignificant compared to her experiment's success. Bill meets up with Remo and Mark at a bar. A drunk man recognizes Bill from news about the surgery, and demands to see his arm. Bill snaps and a bar fight breaks out where Bill single-handedly takes out several men and almost kills one before being stopped. As Mark returns home, his legs suddenly stop functioning. Scared, Mark calls Bill, who hears Mark yell and struggle with someone. Bill goes to Mark's apartment and finds him dead, with both legs missing. Bill calls the police and implores the lead detective to check on Remo. However, they are too late as Charley ‚Äî who is still alive, having his head transplanted onto a new body ‚Äî rips Remo's arm off and throws him out a window. As Bill and the detective stop at a traffic light, Charley pulls up in a car beside them and handcuffs his wrist to Bill's. Charley speeds away, and the detective desperately tries to keep up, lest Bill's arm gets ripped off. Bill uses the detective's gun to destroy the handcuff just before they hit a divider that splits the road in two. As the detective leaves the car and opens fire on Charley, Bill drives away to pursue the killer. Charley brings his old limbs back to Dr. Webb. Armed with a gun from the detective's car, Bill enters the hospital and finds Charley's torso and limbs in a glass case, wiggling as if having a mind of their own. Dr. Webb appears and says she is ready to take the arm back, and Charley knocks Bill unconscious. Bill wakes up strapped to an operating table. As Dr. Webb approaches him with a circular saw, he breaks his restraints, knocks her out and wrestles with Charley for his shotgun. Right before Charley can pull the trigger, Bill is able to snap his neck. He destroys the glass case and shoots at Charley's body parts. Charley, still alive, aims at Bill with the detective's gun, but accidentally kills Dr. Webb. Bill shoots Charley in the head, killing him for good. Bill sits with his wife in a park. In his journal, he notes that he hasn't had any other problems with the arm after Charley's death, and he is still thankful to both Dr. Webb and Charley for the new arm.  Cast  Production Principal photography of Body Parts was scheduled to begin on December 10, 1990 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, but was postponed until January 1991. Filming completed in late February.  Release  Body Parts was theatrically released August 2, 1991 in 1,300 theaters. Paramount pulled ads for the film in Milwaukee, Wisconsin after police found dismembered bodies in Jeffrey Dahmer's apartment. =Critical response= On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 38% based on 16 critics, with an average rating pf 4.47/10.

Interferons bind to interferon receptors. All type I IFNs bind to a specific cell surface receptor complex known as the IFN-Œ± receptor (IFNAR) that consists of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 chains. Type I IFNs are found in all mammals, and homologous (similar) molecules have been found in birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish species. Mammalian types The mammalian types are designated IFN-Œ± (alpha), IFN-Œ≤ (beta), IFN-Œ∫ (kappa), IFN-Œ¥ (delta), IFN-Œµ (epsilon), IFN-œÑ (tau), IFN-œâ (omega), and IFN-Œ∂ (zeta, also known as limitin). =IFN-Œ±= The IFN-Œ± proteins are produced mainly by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). They are mainly involved in innate immunity against viral infection. The genes responsible for their synthesis come in 13 subtypes that are called IFNA1, IFNA2, IFNA4, IFNA5, IFNA6, IFNA7, IFNA8, IFNA10, IFNA13, IFNA14, IFNA16, IFNA17, IFNA21. These genes are found together in a cluster on chromosome 9. IFN-Œ± is also made synthetically as medication in hairy cell leukemia. The International Nonproprietary Name (INN) for the product is interferon alfa. The recombinant type is interferon alfacon-1. The pegylated types are pegylated interferon alfa-2a and pegylated interferon alfa-2b. =IFN-Œ≤= The IFN-Œ≤ proteins are produced in large quantities by fibroblasts. They have antiviral activity that is involved mainly in innate immune response. Two types of IFN-Œ≤ have been described, IFN-Œ≤1 (IFNB1) and IFN-Œ≤3 (IFNB3) (a gene designated IFN-Œ≤2 is actually IL-6). IFN-Œ≤1 is used as a treatment for multiple sclerosis as it reduces the relapse rate. IFN-Œ≤1 is not an appropriate treatment for patients with progressive, non-relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis., which cites =IFN-Œµ, -Œ∫, -œÑ, -Œ¥ and -Œ∂= IFN-Œµ, -Œ∫, -œÑ, and -Œ∂ appear, at this time, to come in a single isoform in humans, IFNK. Only ruminants encode IFN-œÑ, a variant of IFN-œâ. So far, IFN-Œ∂ is only found in mice, while a structural homolog, IFN-Œ¥ is found in a diverse array of non-primate and non-rodent placental mammals. Most but not all placental mammals encode functional IFN-Œµ and IFN-Œ∫ genes. =IFN-œâ= IFN-œâ, although having only one functional form described to date (IFNW1), has several pseudogenes: , , , , , , and in humans. Many non-primate placental mammals express multiple IFN-œâ subtypes. =IFN-ŒΩ= This subtype of type I IFN was recently described as a pseudogene in human, but potentially functional in the domestic cat genome. In all other genomes of non-feline placental mammals, IFN-ŒΩ is a pseudogene; in some species, the pseudogene is well preserved, while in others, it is badly mutilated or is undetectable. Moreover, in the cat genome, the IFN-ŒΩ promoter is deleteriously mutated. It is likely that the IFN-ŒΩ gene family was rendered useless prior to mammalian diversification. Its presence on the edge of the type I IFN locus in mammals may have shielded it from obliteration, allowing its detection. Sources and functions IFN-Œ± and IFN-Œ≤ are secreted by many cell types including lymphocytes (NK cells, B-cells and T-cells), macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, osteoblasts and others. They stimulate both macrophages and NK cells to elicit an anti-viral response, involving IRF3/IRF7 antiviral pathways, and are also active against tumors. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells have been identified as being the most potent producers of type I IFNs in response to antigen, and have thus been coined natural IFN producing cells. IFN-œâ is released by leukocytes at the site of viral infection or tumors. IFN-Œ± acts as a pyrogenic factor by altering the activity of thermosensitive neurons in the hypothalamus thus causing fever. It does this by binding to opioid receptors and eliciting the release of prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2). A similar mechanism is used by IFN-Œ± to reduce pain; IFN-Œ± interacts with the Œº-opioid receptor to act as an analgesic. In mice, IFN-Œ≤ inhibits immune cell production of growth factors, thereby slowing tumor growth, and inhibits other cells from producing vessel producing growth factors, thereby blocking tumor angiogenesis and hindering the tumour from connecting into the blood vessel system. In both mice and human, negative regulation of type I interferon is known to be important. Few endogenous regulators have been found to elicit this important regulatory function, such as SOCS1 and Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Interacting Protein (AIP). Non-mammalian types Avian type I IFNs have been characterized and preliminarily assigned to subtypes (IFN I, IFN II, and IFN III), but their classification into subtypes should await a more extensive characterization of avian genomes. Functional lizard type I IFNs can be found in lizard genome databases. Turtle type I IFNs have been purified (references from 1970s needed). They resemble mammalian homologs. The existence of amphibian type I IFNs have been inferred by the discovery of the genes encoding their receptor chains. They have not yet been purified, or their genes cloned. Piscine (bony fish) type I IFN has been cloned first in zebrafish. and then in many other teleost species including salmon and mandarin fish. With few exceptions, and in stark contrast to avian and especially mammalian IFNs, they are present as single genes (multiple genes are however seen in polyploid fish genomes, possibly arising from whole-genome duplication). Unlike amniote IFN genes, piscine type I IFN genes contain introns, in similar positions as do their orthologs, certain interleukins. Despite this important difference, based on their 3-D structure these piscine IFNs have been assigned as Type I IFNs. While in mammalian species all Type I IFNs bind to a single receptor complex, the different groups of piscine type I IFNs bind to different receptor complexes.. Until now several type I IFNs (IFNa, b, c, d, e, f and h) has been identified in teleost fish with as low as only one subtype in green pufferfish and as many as six subtypes in salmon with an addition of recently identified novel subtype, IFNh in mandarin fish. .

Mature IFN-Œ≥ is an anti-parallel homodimer, which binds to the IFN-Œ≥ receptor (IFNGR) complex to elicit a signal within its target cell. IFNGR is made up of two subunits each of molecules designated IFNGR1 and IFNGR2. Interferon- Œ≥ is a cytokine that has an important role in adaptative and innate immunity. Thus, it helps fight against some bacteria and inhibit viral replication. Moreover, this cytokine stimulates and modulate immune system. It belongs to Type II interferon and it is the only one in this class. It is serologically different from interferon type 1 as well as binds to different receptors and is encoded by a separate chromosomal locus. Cells involved Interferon-Œ≥ is secreted by a huge number of cells as well as is involved in the regulation of others. As an immune response, this homodimer is released by natural killer T lymphocytes (NK). When the antigen-specific immunity complex develops, it is produced by CD4 Th1 and CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) effector T cell. Furthermore, non-cytotoxic innate lymphoid cells (ILC) as well as mucosal epithelial cells, macrophages and B cells secrete IFN-Œ≥. The presence of IFN-Œ≥ in T helper cells makes that undifferentiated CD4+ cells (Th0 cells) to differentiated into Th1 cells. Therefore, there is a positive feedback loop which suppress Th2 cell differentiation. The defense against an infection is led by NK cells when they secrete the interferon, whereas the adaptative immune response is directed by mainly T lymphocytes with interferon-gamma. Cytokine control =Positive control= APCs release a sort of cytokines that control the production of IFN-gamma. This cytokines are IL-12 and IL-18 which serve to connect the infection with IFN-gamma production in the innate immunity response. Once macrophages recognize pathogens, it causes the secretion of IL-12 and chemokines. These chemokines attract NK cells to the inflammation, and IL-12 bring about IFN-gamma synthesis in these cells. Apart from macrophages and NK cells, the production of the interferon- gamma by T cells is controlled by these two interleukin. =Negative control= Glucocorticoids, transforming growth factor-B, IL-4 and IL-10 are negative regulators for production of IFN-gamma. Properties of IFN-Œ≥ Once is IFN-Œ≥ is exposed, the main functions will be the activation of macrophages and the induction of Class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule expression. Nevertheless, IFN-Œ≥ is implicated in many function within immune system as immunoregulatory, antiviral and anti-tumor properties. What's more, it carries out the transcription of 30 genes which are related with cellular and physiological responses. Principal effects of this cytokine are: * Promotion of Natural Killer cell activity * Increase of antigen presentation and lysosome activity of macrophages * Activation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) * Induction of the production of IgG2a and IgG3 from activated plasma B cells * Cause normal cells to increase the expression of class I MHC molecules as well as II on antigen-presenting cells * Promotion of adhesion and binding of the expression intrinsic defense factors Sources and functions IFN-Œ≥ is involved in the regulation of the immune and inflammatory responses; in humans, there is only one type of interferon-gamma. It is produced in activated T-cells and natural killer cells. IFN-Œ≥ has some anti- viral and anti-tumor effects, but these are generally weak. However, this cytokine potentiates the effects of the type I IFNs. IFN-Œ≥ released by Th1 cells recruits leukocytes to a site of infection, resulting in increased inflammation. It also stimulates macrophages to kill bacteria that have been engulfed. IFN-Œ≥ released by Th1 cells is also important in regulating the Th2 response. As IFN-Œ≥ is vitally implicated in the regulation of immune response, its production can lead to autoimmune disorders. Homologs of interferon-gamma are found in birds, frogs, and teleost fish. Thus it is likely that all bony fish/tetrapods encode IFN-Œ≥. The gene structure of IFN-Œ≥ is identical to that of its structurally related cytokines, except that the intron between the third and fourth exons does not exist. Notably, many teleost fish encode two distinct IFN-Œ≥ species (called IFN-Œ≥1 and IFN-Œ≥2) that appear to bind genetically and physically distinct IFN-Œ≥R1 chains. In all investigated tetrapods, there is a single IFN-Œ≥ gene that binds a unique IFN-Œ≥R1 chain and (in amniotes) a unique IFN-Œ≥R2 chain. Frogs appear to encode two distinct IFN- Œ≥R2 genes whose intracellular domains differ significantly. IFN-gamma receptors IFN-gamma receptor (IFNGR) is formed by two ligand-binding IFNGR1 chains linked with two signal-transducing IFNGR2 chains and associated signaling machinery. Both chains belong to the class II cytokine receptor family. The IFNGR2 chain is generally the limiting factor in IFN-gamma responsiveness, whereas the IFNGR1 chain is usually in excess. =IFNGR2= IFNGR2 is an intracellular region which have a noncontiguous binding motif for recruitment of Jak2 kinase for signaling. This chain is not tyrosine phosphorylated during signal transduction. The expression of IFNGR2 chain depends on the state of cellular differentiation or activation. For instance, there are some CD4 Th1 cells that have low levels of IFNGR2 expression in their surface. This leads to a low expression or IFN-gamma receptor and consequently, to a functional blockade of IFN-gamma signaling. =IFNGR1= The intracellular domain contains binding motifs for Jak1 and the latent cytosolic factor, signal transducer and activator of transcription Stat1. Jak1 as well as Stat1 are required for receptor phosphorylation, signaling transduction and induction of biological response. Relation between colorectal cancer and IFN-gamma It is known, from different studies, that a scarcity of this homodimer or its receptor promotes colorectal cancer development. It was studied that synergistic activation mediator-derived (SAM) can cause a specified expression of interferon-gamma and, thus activates innate immunity and inhibits tumorgenesis. Several studies show that anti- proliferative activity of INF-gamma direct to the growth inhibition or cell death, and apoptosis through autophagy  See also  * Interferon gamma References  * External links Cytokines Antivirals ","title":"Interferon type II"},{"id":"9659931","text":"The type III interferon group is a group of anti-viral cytokines, that consists of four IFN-Œª (lambda) molecules called IFN-Œª1, IFN-Œª2, IFN-Œª3 (also known as IL29, IL28A and IL28B respectively), and IFN-Œª4. They were discovered in 2003. Their function is similar to that of type I interferons, but is less intense and serves mostly as a first-line defence against viruses in the epithelium.  Genomic location  Genes encoding this group of interferons are all located on the long arm of chromosome 19 in human, specifically in region between 19q13.12 and 19q13.13. IFNL1 gene, encoding IL-29, is located downstream of IFNL2, encoding IL-28A. IFNL3, encoding IL28B, is located downstream of IFNL4. In mice, the genes encoding for type III interferons are located on chromosome 7 and the family consist only of IFN-Œª2 and IFN-Œª3. Type III interferon (interferon lambda) genes on human chromosome 19  Structure  = Interferons = All interferon groups belong to class II cytokine family which have a conserved structure that comprises of six Œ±-helices. The proteins of type III interferon group are highly homologous and show high amino acid sequence similarity between. The similarity between IFN-Œª2 and IFN-Œª3 is approximately 96%, similarity of IFNŒª1 to IFNŒª 2/3 is around 81%. Lowest similarity is found between IFN-Œª4 and IFN-Œª3 - only around 30%. Unlike type I interferon group, which consist of only one exon, type III interferons consist of multiple exons. = Receptor = The receptors for these cytokines are also structurally conserved. The receptors have two type III fibronectin domains in their extracellular domain. The interface of these two domains forms the cytokine binding site. The receptor complex for type III interferons consists of two subunits - IL10RB (also called IL10R2 or CRF2-4) and IFNLR1 (formerly called IL28RA , CRF2-12). In contrast to the ubiquitous expression of receptors for type I interferons, IFNLR1 is largely restricted to tissues of epithelial origin. Despite high homology between type III interferons, the binding affinity to IFNLR1 differ, with IFN-Œª1 showing the highest binding affinity, and IFN-Œª3 showing the lowest binding affinity.  Signalling pathway  IFN-Œª production is induced by pathogen sensing through pattern recognition receptors (PRR), including TLR, Ku70 and RIG-1-like. The main producer of IFN-Œª are type 2 myeloid dendritic cells. IFN-Œª binds to IFNLR1 with a high affinity, which then recruits the low-affinity subunit of the receptor, IL10Rb. This interaction creates a signalling complex. Upon binding of the cytokine to the receptor, JAK-STAT signalling pathway gets activated, specifically JAK1 and TYK2 and phosphorylate and activate STAT-1 and STAT-2, which then induces downstream signalling that leads to induction of expression of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG), e.g.: NF-kB, IRF, ISRE, Mx1, OAS1. The signalling is modulated by supressor of cytokine signalling 1 (SOCS1) and ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18 (USP18).  Function  Function of type III interferons seems to be similar to that of type I interferons. Both of these cytokine groups modulate the immune response after a pathogen has been sensed in the organism, their functions are mostly are anti-viral and anti- proliferative. However, type III interferons tend to be less potent, less inflammatory and show a slower kinetics than type I. Also, because of the restricted expression of IFNLR1, the immunomodulatory effect of type III interferons is limited. Because the receptors for type I and type II interferons are expressed on almost all nucleated cells, their function is rather systematic, however type III interferon receptors are expressed on epithelial cells, therefore their antiviral effects are most prominent in barriers, in gastrointestinal, respiratory and reproductive tracts. Type III interferons usually act as the first line of defence against viruses at the barriers. In the gastrointestinal tract both type I and type III interferons are needed to effectively fight reovirus infection. Type III interferons restrict the initial replication of the virus and diminish the shedding of through feces, while type I interferons prevent the systematic infection. On the other hand, in the respiratory tract these two groups of interferons seem to be rather redundant, as documented by the susceptibility of double- deficient mice (in receptors for type I and type III interferons), but the resistance to respiratory virus in mice that are deficient in either type I or type III interferon receptors.

The show Somewhat less is known about this masque than others of the Jacobean era, since none of Jones's designs for the work has survived. The twelve gentleman masquers were styled \\"Sons of Phoebus,\\" and took the parts of great English poets of the past -- Geoffrey Chaucer, John Gower, Edmund Spenser, and others.E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, p. 390. The corresponding figures in the anti-masque were twelve \\"Evils,\\" ambition, pride, avarice, etc. The speeches were \\"presented\\" by the mythological figures standard in the masque form -- in this case, Pallas Athena and Astraea were the primaries. Pallas banishes the personified Iron Age, thus allowing the return of Astraea, goddess of Justice, and the restoration of the Golden Age. A major theme of Jonson's text was the reform of a corrupt court -- relevant at the time because the Stuart Court was suffering the aftermath of the scandal over the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury. King James's favorite, Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset, was still awaiting trial for his role in the murder when the masque was presented, and his successor as royal favorite, George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, was moving into prominence as Carr's replacement. The King was so pleased with the masque that he had a repeat performance scheduled for the evening of Twelfth Night, a few days after the initial presentation.Michael Leapman, Inigo: The Troubled Life of Inigo Jones, Architect of the English Renaissance. London, Headline Book Publishing, 2003; p. 166. Dating Scholars have disputed the order in which two of the Jonson-Jones masques were performed at Court. Traditionally, Mercury Vindicated from the Alchemists was assigned to the 1614-15 Christmas holiday season, and The Golden Age Restored to the following 1615-16 holiday season.Chambers, Vol. 3, pp. 389-91. C. H. Herford and Percy Simpson, in their edition of Jonson's works, argued that the two masques had been chronologically transposed, and that TGAR was the earlier work.Ben Jonson, Works, C. H. Herford and Percy Simpson, eds., 11 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1925-52; Vol. 10, pp. 545-6. Their argument received some general acceptance for a time, but was refuted by later researchers.John Orrell, \\"The London Stage in the Florentine Correspondence, 1604-1618,\\" Theatre Research International 3 (1977-78)Martin Butler and David Lindley, \\"Restoring Astraea: Jonson's masque for the fall of Somerset,\\" English Literary History 61 (1994). The masques in the 1616 folio appear to be arranged in a consistent chronological order; and The Golden Age Restored, as noted, is last. Its title page dates it to 1615 -- but the English began the New Year on March 25 prior to 1751. [See: Old Style and New Style dates.] If TGAR had been performed in the previous year, it should have been dated 1614. Recent scholarship tends to rely on the implications of the original text, and treats TGAR as the later work.Peter Holbrook, \\"Jacobean masques and the Jacobean peace,\\" in: David Bevington and Peter Holbrook, eds., The Politics of the Stuart Court Masque, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1998; p. 87.John Leeds Barroll, Anna of Denmark, Queen of England: A Cultural Biography, Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001; p. 211.

It was originally self-published under the title A Place For Us and eventually found a publisher as Patience and Sarah in 1971. Routsong's novel is based on a real-life painter named Mary Ann Willson who lived with her companion Miss Brundage as a \\"farmerette\\" in the early 19th century in Greene County, New York. Routsong said she came upon Willson's work in a folk art museum in Cooperstown and was inspired to write the story after reading the description of Willson and Brundage. It tells the story of two women in Connecticut in 1816 who fall in love and decide to leave their homes to buy a farm in another state or territory and live in a Boston marriage. The story addresses the limited opportunities and roles of women in early America, gender expression, and the interpretation of religion in everyday life. Sarah Waters, author of Tipping the Velvet and other historical novels with lesbian themes, has said that this book was an influence on her writing. She received the book from a girlfriend in 1988 at age 22 and was \\"struck by the lyricism and economy of it, by its gentle humour, and by its sexiness.\\" Plot summary The story is told in switching first-person narratives between Patience and Sarah. The first part is told by Patience White, a woman of considerable means compared to others in her town. Her father died and left her enough money that she would not have to marry to be cared for. She lives with her brother and his wife and children, in a room she has to herself, something her sister-in-law Martha considers an unnatural privilege. Patience paints Biblical scenes as a pastime, and helps Martha with the children sometimes. They do not get along well. Patience has known of Sarah Dowling for a while since Sarah is a scandalous character to some, wearing pants and doing men's work. Sarah has a family of sisters and her father trained her to do men's work since he had no sons. Intrigued one day when Sarah delivers firewood to the White household, and to flout Martha, Patience invites Sarah into her part of the house and socializes with her. Sarah divulges that she plans to set out by herself and go west and buy her own farm. Not having the heart to tell her that she will not have the opportunity to do it, Patience indulges Sarah and tells her she wants to come along. In the midst of planning the trip west, Sarah admits she feels for Patience, and although too aware of the danger, Patience also admits her attraction for Sarah. Sarah returns to her much poorer home, where she lives with her large family in a one-room cabin. She tells her sister Rachel that she's going west with Patience as her mate, and Rachel, upset by being replaced to go west by Patience, tells their father who beats Sarah, then drags her to Patience's home to demand to know the nature of their relationship. Faced with having to admit their acts in front of witnesses, Patience denies she feels anything for Sarah and that it was all a game. The narrative switches to Sarah's perspective as she cuts off all her hair, renames herself \\"Sam\\", takes an axe and walks west alone, healing from the beatings her father gave her (no harm meant, he says). After a few experiences that demonstrate the risks of freedom, Sam takes up with a traveling Parson who goes town to town selling books in a horse-drawn rig he sleeps in. He teaches Sam to defend himself against boys in towns, to cook, teaches him about the Bible and other cultures, but most importantly, teaches him to read. In time, Parson admits he's attracted to Sam and when he tries to seduce Sam, Sarah admits her true identity. Away about six months, Sarah heads home again as Parson heads towards New York, his home. Patience arrives the next day to casually invite her to Sunday dinner. Sarah accepts, and their relationship starts again after Patience admits she lost her courage. They carry on their relationship, Sarah visiting Patience on Sundays, sometimes bringing a sister or her mother, but when they are caught embracing with their bodices open by Martha, Patience's brother tells them it's time for them to go. They head to New York City with brother Edward's blessing. Thinking Sarah is lower-class, a man on the ship assaults her, but Patience rescues her and teaches her the necessary points of being a lady. They lodge with the captain and in their first locked room alone, consummate their relationship. They meet up with the Parson again and decide that upstate New York in Greene County will be their destination, where land is cheap and they can live in peace. They arrive in Greene County and they negotiate the purchase of a small farm, plant their crop and begin their life together. Distribution and sale of the book Routsong originally published 1,000 copies of the book using her own money, selling them on street corners in New York City and at meetings of the Daughters of Bilitis. She contacted Gene Damon (Barbara Grier) at The Ladder, who also promoted the book in the book review section of the magazine, calling it \\"a gem\\" and that, \\"it very much belongs with that small bookshelf full of basic classics of Lesbian literature.\\"Damon, Gene. \\"Lesbiana,\\" The Ladder 1969-1970 vol 14 issue 3/4: pp 22-27. Grier also had to assure their readership, who had to order the book directly from Routsong that she was an actual person, not a police agency. Routsong then resubmitted the novel to publishers under a pseudonym. Awards and nominations *The novel won the Stonewall Book Award for 1971; this was the first Stonewall Book Award. *Patience and Sarah was listed as #24 on The Publishing Triangle's list of 100 Best Lesbian and Gay Novels. Adaptations The novel was adapted into an opera by Paula M. Kimper, to a libretto by Wende Persons. It debuted at the Lincoln Center Festival in 1998, and has been revived several times since. Alma Routsong gave her approval to the project shortly before her death, but did not survive to hear more than a few songs from the score performed privately. The idea for the opera originated with Persons's crush on a soprano in 1981, when Persons wrote the music to impress her. When she was rejected, she kept the work until she met Kimper and they both revived its creation in 1989. Concerning the 1996 pre-premiere of the semi-staged final draft, with piano accompaniment, The New York Times claimed it had \\"an accessible, attractively lyrical score\\" and that, \\"Sarah has a gorgeous, Ravelian aria at the start of the second act.\\" The 1998 premiere of the completed work was also well reviewed: The Opera News claimed \\"the opera bubbles with glorious vocal writing\\" and the best parts were the duets between Patience and Sarah, but that Parson Peel's music actually stole the show. The novel was adapted into a screenplay titled \\"Greener Pastures\\" by Lindsay Gambini in 2009. The screenplay was awarded an Honorable Mention in the 2010 One in Ten Screenplay Contest and was a semi finalist in the Great Gay Screenplay contest sponsored by Pride Films and Plays. A reading of the screenplay was performed in New York City sponsored by the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences on June 15, 2009.

Relations with the Khitan thumb The Zubu began paying tribute to the Khitan Empire after a campaign in 924 when the Khitan subdued the Zubu and in the region of what is now Eastern and Central Mongolia and southeastern Russia. Liao emperor Shengzong led an expeditionary force against the Zubu in 983 after the Zubu killed their own khan and began to act in defiance of the Khitan. The Zubu khan was forced to submit to the Liao in 1003. On this occasion, the Liao divided the Zubu into several divisions, each under a Liao ruler. The Zubu once again rebelled against their Khitan masters in 1026, but suffered another defeat. On this occasion, they were forced to pay an annual tribute of horses, camels, and furs. In the 1090s, the Zubu once again defied the Khitan by invading the northeast borders of Liao territory. In 1100, the Zubu were once again defeated, and their khan was taken prisoner and taken to the Liao capital of Shangjing. Once in the Liao capital, he was hacked to pieces.

Kamranieh is known for its luxurious high-rise buildings, costly apartments and massive mansions. Centered on Kamranieh street, the neighborhood lies within Shemiranat County and district one of Tehran municipality. Along with Farmanieh, Niavaran, Zafaraniyeh and Elahieh, it is now home to the most expensive real estate in Tehran. It is also the home to many Iranian nobles and notables as well as embassies and foreign officials. The name of Kamranieh is based on the son of Naser-al-din Shah, Kamran Mirza Nayeb es-Saltaneh, who used to own much of the land in the area. Kamranieh was one of the first neighbourhoods in Tehran that was equipped with a telephone system. In addition, the first pet hospital of Iran, Tehran Pet hospital, was established in this neighbourhood in 2004.  History  Kamran Mirza Nayeb es-Saltaneh, the former owner of Kamranieh estates In the late 1800s, Kamran Mirza Nayeb es-Saltaneh, the eldest son of Naser al-Din Shah Qajar, grabbed the lands of Kamranieh from the locals who used to farm in the area. Afterwards, he ordered to build a fabulous garden instead of the farmlands and then named it Kamranieh which means the estate belongs to Kamran. Kamranieh garden featured a large variety of plants and a greenhouse to protect sensitive flowers inside it in winter. In audition, two Austrian gardeners were hired to protect the garden all the time. After Kamran Mirza's death in 1929, his children gradually sold the lands of Kamranieh garden to wealthy residents of Tehran. The new owners built themselves villas in order to use them as summer houses. Today however most of the gardens have been replaced by residential towers and newbuild apartments, few of them have actually escaped development.  Location  Kamranieh touches Niavaran on the north, Sadr Expressway on the south and Farmanieh on the east and west. Kamranieh has two segments named South Kamranieh and North Kamranieh. South Kamranieh is below Kamranieh junction and North Kamranieh is located upon the junction.

Malaysia is a federation of 13 states operating within a constitutional monarchy under the Westminster parliamentary system and is categorised as a representative democracy. The federal government of Malaysia adheres to and is created by the Federal Constitution of Malaysia, the supreme law of the land. The federal government adopts the principle of separation of powers under Article 127 of the Federal Constitution,Jeong Chun Hai @ Ibrahim, & Nor Fadzlina Nawi. (2012). Principles of Public Administration: Malaysian Perspectives. Kuala Lumpur: Pearson Publishers. and has three branches: executive, legislature and judiciary. The state governments in Malaysia also have their respective executive and legislative bodies. The judicial system in Malaysia is a federalised court system operating uniformly throughout the country. Federal government The federal or central government is the ultimate authority in Malaysia and located in Putrajaya. It is headed by the Prime Minister of Malaysia who is also known as the head of government. =Legislature= The bicameral parliament consists of the lower house, the House of Representatives or Dewan Rakyat (literally the \\"Chamber of the People\\") and the upper house, the Senate or Dewan Negara (literally the \\"Chamber of the Nation\\"). All seventy Senate members sit for three-year terms (to a maximum of two terms); twenty-six are elected by the thirteen state assemblies, and forty-four are appointed by the king based on the advice of the Prime Minister. The 222 members of the Dewan Rakyat are elected from single-member districts by universal adult suffrage. The parliament follows a multi-party system and the governing body is elected through a first-past-the-post system. Parliament has a maximum mandate of five years by law. The king may dissolve parliament at any time and usually does so upon the advice of the Prime Minister. =Executive= While the Monarch remains the Head of State real executive power is vested in the cabinet led by the prime minister as Head of Government; the Malaysian constitution stipulates that the prime minister must be a member of the Lower House of parliament who, in the opinion of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (YDPA), commands a majority in parliament. The cabinet is chosen from among members of both houses of Parliament and is responsible to that body. The Executive branch of the government consists of the Prime Minister as the head of the government, followed by the various ministers of the Cabinet. =Judiciary= The highest court in the judicial system is the Federal Court, followed by the Court of Appeal, and two High Courts, one for Peninsular Malaysia, and one for East Malaysia. The subordinate courts in each of these jurisdictions include Sessions Courts, Magistrates' Courts, and Courts for Children. Malaysia also has a Special Court to hear cases brought by or against all Royalty. Head of state Istana Negara, the residence and office of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong (, Jawi: ), also known as the Supreme Head or the King, is the constitutional monarch and head of state of Malaysia. The office was established in 1957, when the Federation of Malaya (now Malaysia) gained independence from the United Kingdom. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong is elected by the Conference of Rulers, comprising the nine rulers of the Malay states, with the office de facto rotated between them, making Malaysia one of the world's few elective monarchies. In accordance with Article 41 of the Constitution, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong is Commander-in-Chief of the Malaysian Armed Forces. As such, he is the highest-ranking officer in the military chain of command. Head of government Perdana Putra houses the office complex of the Prime Minister of Malaysia. The Prime Minister of Malaysia (Malay: Perdana Menteri Malaysia) is the indirectly elected head of government (executive) of Malaysia. He is officially appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the head of state, who in HM's judgment is likely to command the confidence of the majority of the members of that House of Representatives (Dewan Rakyat), the elected lower house of Parliament. He heads the Cabinet, whose members are appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong advice of the prime minister. The Prime Minister and his Cabinet shall be collectively responsible to Parliament. The Prime Minister's Department (sometimes referred to as the Prime Minister's Office) is the body and ministry in which the Prime Minister exercises its functions and powers. State governments Each state governments in Malaysia is created by the respective state constitutions. Each state has a unicameral state legislative chamber (Malay: Dewan Undangan Negeri) whose members are elected from single-member constituencies. State governments are led by Chief Ministers (Menteri Besar in Malay states or Ketua Menteri in states without hereditary rulers), who are state assembly members from the majority party in the Dewan Undangan Negeri. They advise their respective sultans or governors. In each of the states with a hereditary ruler, the Menteri Besar is required to be a Malay, appointed by the Sultan upon the recommendation of the Prime Minister. Meanwhile, for the states without hereditary ruler, the Ketua Menteri is required to be a Dayak, appointed by the Governors. Local governments The local government or local authority (Malay: kerajaan tempatan or pihak berkuasa tempatan (PBT)) is the lowest level in the system of government in Malaysia‚Äîafter federal and state. It has the power to collect taxes (in the form of assessment tax), to create laws and rules (in the form of by-laws) and to grant licenses and permits for any trade in its area of jurisdiction, in addition to providing basic amenities, collecting and managing waste and garbage as well as planning and developing the area under its jurisdiction. Local authorities in Malaysia are generally under the exclusive purview of the state governments and headed by a civil servant with the title Yang Di-Pertua (President). Local government areas and the boundaries is usually consistent with district boundaries but there are some places where the boundaries are not consistent and may overlap with adjoining districts especially in urbanised areas. Unlike the federal and state governments, the local governments in Malaysia are not elected but appointed by the state government after local council elections were suspended by the federal government in 1965. Military, police and other governmental bodies The Malaysian Armed Forces are the military body of Malaysia and the Royal Malaysian Police are in charge of law enforcement. Legal system The law of Malaysia is mainly based on the common law legal system. This was a direct result of the colonisation of Malaya, Sarawak, and North Borneo by Britain between the early 19th century to 1960s. The supreme law of the land‚Äîthe Constitution of Malaysia‚Äîsets out the legal framework and rights of Malaysian citizens. Federal laws enacted by the Parliament of Malaysia apply throughout the country. There are also state laws enacted by the State Legislative Assemblies which applies in the particular state. The constitution of Malaysia also provides for a unique dual justice system‚Äîthe secular laws (criminal and civil) and sharia laws. Articles 73 to 79 of the Federal Constitution specifies the subject in which the federal and state government may legislate. Parliament has the exclusive power to make laws over matters falling under the Federal List (such as citizenship, defence, internal security, civil and criminal law, finance, trade, commerce and industry, education, labour, and tourism) whereas each State, through its Legislative Assembly, has legislative power over matters under the State List (such as land, local government, Syariah law and Syariah courts, State holidays and State public works). Parliament and State legislatures share the power to make laws over matters under the Concurrent List (such as water supplies and housing) but Article 75 provides that in the event of conflict, Federal law will prevail over State law. Elections Elections in Malaysia exist at two levels: national level and state level. National level elections are those for membership in the Dewan Rakyat, the lower house of Parliament, while state level elections are for membership in the various State Legislative Assemblies. The head of the executive branch, the Prime Minister, is indirectly elected.

Hearne's original travelogue is now lost, and the narrative that became the famous story was published after Hearne's death with substantial editorializing. The narrative states that Chipewyan and \\"Copper Indian\\"Hearne, Samuel. (1745‚Äì1792) A Journey to the Northern Ocean: The Adventures of Samuel Hearne. Surrey, BC:TouchWood Editions. Dene men led by Hearne's guide and companion Matonabbee attacked a group of Copper Inuit camped by rapids approximately upstream from the mouth of the Coppermine River.  Genesis  Towards the end of May 1771, Samuel Hearne began to notice that the Chipewyan Indians accompanying him on his expedition had motives other than his planned survey of the Coppermine River. On the party's arrival at Peshew Lake, Matonabbee and a number of the men accompanying Hearne began to make arrangements for their wives and children to be left behind. When the party arrived at Clowey Lake, each of the Chipewyan men crafted shields from thin boards, wide and long. Hearne noted that his party was joined by a number of Indians who were solely interested in propagating a war against the Inuit. In the travel narrative describing his journey, he claimed that, as the group advanced north into Inuit territories, it became evident that his companions were gradually plotting an act of \\"savage\\", \\"shocking\\", and \\"brutish\\" violence. The Dene people of the area claim, however, that Hearne himself was not present at the event, while Hearne's contemporaries further questioned his claims. The oral history of the Inuit-Dene conflict also does not reflect the Bloody Falls story. Hearne began to remonstrate with his guides but failed in his attempt. He wrote of the events, \\"I endeavored as much as possible to persuade them from putting their inhuman design into execution; but so far were my intreaties from having the wished-for effect, that it was concluded that I was actuated by cowardice.\\" On 1 June 1771, the few remaining women and children were left behind by the party, as well as the dogs and the heavy luggage, and a group of about 60 men advanced north towards the Coppermine River. On 2 July 1771, the party came across a group of Copper Indians, who learned the purpose of the exploration party's journey and supplied them with canoes and other necessities. However, 17 men abandoned the exploration party in the coming days, claiming that the difficulty of the trek outweighed the pleasure that was to be derived from killing the Inuit. The remaining members of the exploration party arrived at the Coppermine River on 14 July 1771. Three scouts were sent to locate any Inuit who might have been camping near the river, as Hearne commenced his survey. The scouts returned on 16 July 1771 and reported that five Inuit tents had been found on the west side of the river. This news brought the survey work to a complete halt, and the men began to prepare for war.  Massacre  Just after midnight on 17 July, the Dene set upon the Inuit camp and killed approximately 20 men, women and children. Hearne was traumatized by the massacre, saying \\"I am confident that my features must have feelingly expressed how sincerely I was affected at the barbarous scene I then witnessed; even at this hour I cannot reflect on the transactions of that horrid day without shedding tears.\\"From: Samuel Hearne, A Journey from Prince of Wales's Fort in Hudson's Bay to the Northern Ocean, 1769, 1770, 1771, 1772 (London, Eng: Strahan and Cadell, 1795) at the University of Western Ontario He claims to have named the waterfall Bloody Falls.Samuel Hearne's Overland Expedition 1770‚Äì72 at the National Maritime Museum  Legacy  The site of the massacre, which was the traditional home of the Kogluktogmiut, is now located in Kugluk/Bloody Falls Territorial Park near Kugluktuk, Nunavut. It was designated a National Historic Site in 1978. In 1996, Dene and Inuit representatives participated in a healing ceremony to reconcile the centuries-old grievance. The incident is referred to in the John Newlove poem Samuel Hearne in Wintertime.

Aerial view of Downtown Oakland and Lake Merritt Lionel J. Wilson / Broadway Building Detail of the Romanesque Revival Tribune Tower. The building serves as a quintessential Oakland landmark, timepiece, and navigation aid, as its unique green roof and massive red neon sign and clock can be seen for miles. Downtown Oakland is the central business district of Oakland, California, United States; roughly bounded by both the Oakland Estuary and Interstate 880 on the southwest, Interstate 980 on the northwest, Grand Avenue on the northeast, and Lake Merritt on the east. The Downtown area is sometimes expanded to refer to the industrial and residential Jack London Square and Jack London warehouse district areas, the Lakeside Apartments District, which are a largely residential neighborhood on the west side of Lake Merritt, the Civic Center district, Chinatown, and the south end of Oakland's Broadway Auto Row, an area along Broadway which has historically been used by car dealers and other automotive service businesses. While many consider these areas outside of downtown proper, they are generally considered more geographically proximate to Downtown Oakland than to East Oakland, North Oakland or to West Oakland and are thus sometimes associated with Downtown Oakland. Culture =Black Cowboy Parade= Downtown Oakland hosts the only celebration of its kind in the nation in memory of the black cowboys who helped settle the American West. The annual parade typically begins on an early October weekend at DeFremery Park in West Oakland en route to Frank H. Ogawa Plaza where judging booths are set up. After an awards ceremony, the parade returns to DeFremery Park for a celebration. Downtown Oakland view from Lake Merritt Land use and points of interest Downtown Oakland is home to apartment and condominium dwellers, numerous retail businesses, tall modern office buildings, shorter mixed-use historic buildings, the hubs of AC Transit and BART, which has three underground stations, the city's official Entertainment District which includes the historic Paramount and Fox Theatres, nightclubs, and restaurants, the headquarters of Clorox, City Center, a portion of Old Oakland, and a portion of Chinatown. Downtown includes a portion of the oldest part of the city. The area from the Oakland Estuary inland to 14th Street between West Street and the Lake Merritt Channel was the original site of Oakland, and there are several 19th century houses scattered around the edges of downtown and in Chinatown. The Oakland Museum is located on Oak Street near the southeastern edge of Downtown. Education =Higher education= Laney College, with more than 12,000 students, is located on Fallon Street near the Lake Merritt BART station. Other educational institutions include Lincoln University, a small business school catering mainly to international students, and a downtown office of Cal State East Bay. Oaksterdam University, a business college which prepares students for medical cannabis work, is located on 15th Street in an area referred to as \\"Oaksterdam\\". The original campus of UC Berkeley was located between Franklin, Harrison, 12th and 14th streets; and the University of California system is currently headquartered in Downtown. =Public primary and secondary education= Lincoln Elementary School, one of the few public elementary schools in the downtown of a major US city, is on the edge of downtown, near the center of Chinatown. The Oakland School for the Arts, a charter school, is building a new facility surrounding the Fox Oakland Theatre in Oakland's Uptown Oakland. Transportation =Motor vehicle limitations= City Hall Plaza is a city park and a \\"pedestrian plaza\\" which includes what was once the terminus of San Pablo Avenue where it met Broadway at 14th Street. It also includes 15th Street, which once ran through what is now \\"Kahn's Alley,\\" past 250 Frank H. Ogawa Plaza building, across Clay Street, through what is now a glass windowed lobby of the California State office building, connecting with Jefferson Street on the building's west side entrance. Motor vehicle traffic has also been excluded from where former city streets, Washington street and 13th street, were once aligned through what is now the Oakland City Center development. Today the area features an outdoor retail mall with pedestrian streets laid out to replicate the original street grid. =BART= Three subway Bay Area Rapid Transit stations serve downtown: 12th Street/Oakland City Center and 19th Street are both located on the Broadway subway corridor, while Lake Merritt station is in the eastern area of Chinatown, at 8th and Oak Streets. Most BART trains travel through the Oakland Wye. A subway entrance to the 12th St Oakland City Center BART station =AC Transit= Several routes operated by AC Transit pass through or end in Downtown Oakland.http://www.actransit.org/ac-transit-bus-line-descriptions/ These include: Local Routes * 1: Downtown Oakland (11th + Clay) to San Leandro BART via International Boulevard * 6: Downtown Oakland (10th + Washington) to Downtown Berkeley (Oxford + Addison) via most of Telegraph Avenue * 12: Jack London Square Amtrak Station to Berkeley‚ÄìWestbrae (Gilman + Sixth) via parts of Grand Avenue, Martin Luther King Jr. Way (mostly in Berkeley), and Gilman Street (Berkeley) * 14: West Oakland BART to Fruitvale BART via 14th Street and parts of East 18th Street, East 21st Street, East 27th Street, School Street, and High Street * 18: Lake Merritt BART to Albany‚ÄìUC Village via parts of Martin Luther King Jr. Way, Shattuck Avenue (mostly Berkeley), and Solano Avenue (Berkeley and Albany) * 19: Downtown Oakland (11th + Jefferson) to Fruitvale BART via Buena Vista Avenue (Alameda) * 20: Downtown Oakland (11th + Jefferson) to the Dimond District (Fruitvale + MacArthur) via parts of Webster Street (in Alameda), Alameda South Shore Center, Park Street (Alameda), and Fruitvale Avenue * 29: Emeryville (Christie + 64th) to Trestle Glen (Lakeshore + Walavista) via Hollis Street (mostly Emeryville), Peralta Street, parts of 10th, 11th, and 12th Streets, and Lakeshore Avenue * 33: Piedmont (Inverleith Terrace) to Montclair (Moraga + La Salle) via Hampton Road (Piedmont), Oakland Avenue, Harrison Street, and eventually to Park Boulevard * 40: Downtown Oakland (11th + Jefferson) to Bay Fair BART via parts of Foothill Boulevard, Bancroft Avenue, and East 14th Street (San Leandro) * 51A: Rockridge BART to Fruitvale BART via Broadway and parts of Webster Street and Santa Clara Avenue (both Alameda) * 62: West Oakland BART to Fruitvale BART via parts of 7th and 8th Streets, 8th Avenue, and 23rd Avenue, passing in front of Highland Hospital.

The Uptown Transit Center features multiple bus shelters with seating, NextBus arrival prediction signs, and local and Rapid Bus service to Oakland's streetcar suburbs. These stations host local service, Rapid service, Transbay Express, and All Nighter service. (Some, but not all, other bus stops in downtown Oakland also include shelters and arrival signs.) A Clipper Add Value Machine is located at AC Transit headquarters at 1600 Franklin Street, as well as at all BART stations. Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) The platform of the upcoming 19th St AC Transit BRT station Bus line 1, which connects downtown to East Oakland and San Leandro via International Boulevard, runs through downtown along 11th and 12th Streets. A full-scale bus rapid transit corridor is currently under construction along the route of line 1, variously \\"International BRT\\" or \\"East Bay BRT\\", with some station canopies already complete. The most substantial planning alternative proposed for this system would feature articulated buses with five to six doors at boarding platform level, a separated bus-only lane, center median platforms in many areas with proof-of-payment ticket machines to speed boarding, and signalization priority to allow bus drivers to change traffic lights in passengers' favor. This project will go into service in March 2020. Platform at the 14th St AC Transit BRT station. = Gondola = The Oakland Athletics made a proposal to have a privately-financed gondola lift travel on Washington Street from 10th Street near City Center to Water Street in Jack London Square. It is proposed as a new mode of transportation to the team's future ballpark in Jack London Square. There would be approximately 12-14 gondola cabins, each of which would carry about 35 people, with a projection of 6,000 people transported per hour. This project is estimated to be completed in 2023.  Community Benefit Districts  Oakland City Center as seen in 2018. The Downtown Oakland http://www.downtownoakland.org and Lake Merritt/Uptown District Associationshttp://uptownoakland.localon.com are community benefit districts that were formed in February 2009. Property owners in both Downtown Oakland and the Lake Merritt/Uptown Districts voted by a margin of almost 8 to 1 to support a voluntary property tax to fund services that would improve the quality of life in their respective communities. The associations meet and function jointly. Services funded by these Districts include maintaining cleanliness and order in the public rights of way, improving district identity and advocating on behalf of the area's property owners, business owners and residents. In June 2013, the districts were recognized by the International Downtown Association (IDA) and named the IDA's June Downtown of the Month.https://www.ida-downtown.org/eweb/dynamicpage.aspx?webcode=DTOM_June The district boards have three organizational committees,http://lakemerritt- uptown.org/Committees including the DISI (District Identity and Street Improvement) Committee, the SOBO (Sidewalk Operations, Beautification & Order) Committee and the Joint ORG (Organization) Committee. The DISI Committee promotes the identity of the districts, encourages economic development and works to create a vibrant downtown through public relations, marketing, and special events. The SOBO Committee oversees cleanliness and order in the public rights of way and manages service providers in keeping with the expectations of our organization and the needs of the community. Through diligent planning and thoughtful allocation of resources, the SOBO committee executes projects that effectively beautify and enhance the safety of the districts for the long term, creating vibrant and celebrated public spaces. And lastly, the Joint Organization Committee oversees the general administration of the corporations, ensures the effective operationsof the board, acts as the coordinating framework through which the other committees function efficiently, and works to increase involvement and supportfor the organizations. The districts have helped fund several neighborhood beautification/improvement projects & initiatives including: The Latham Square pedestrian plaza, back of BART planter boxes, hanging flower baskets & bannershttp://www.bisnow.com/commercial-real-estate/san-francisco/oaklands-a- for-activity/ and median landscaping projects, to name a few. Historic districts The Downtown Oakland Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. The listing included 43 contributing buildings, one contributing site and one contributing object. and Other historic districts have been designated in Old Oakland: the Lakeside Apartments district, Preservation Park, and the Waterfront Warehouse district.

As a journalist he covered alpine skiing, cycling, and other sports for five major publications. In the mid-1960s, he envisioned a season-long series of ski races, which became the World Cup skiing circuit. He continued to guide the growth of the World Cup and the sport of ski racing over the next two decades. Biography =Early years= Jean-Jacques \\"Serge\\" Lang was born in June 1920 in Mulhouse, Alsace, in eastern France. He moved with his parents to Switzerland in 1921, where his father Albert became director of the French train station located in Basel. Lang learned to ski before the age of 7 in Markstein, in the Vosges Mountains with his father Albert and his mother, Friedl. He competed in ski races during his youth. During World War II, he remained in Switzerland and worked as a journalist in Basel, where he also founded a film festival named \\"le Bon Film\\" with his friend Peter Baechlin. After the war he covered the Nuremberg Trials in 1946 and, along with Ernst von Schenck, provided analytical commentary for the memoirs of Alfred Rosenberg, Nazi Germany's chief racial theoretician, who was executed in October of that year. As a correspondent for the leading French evening paper Le Soir, Lang also attended a variety of sporting events after reporting on the 1948 Winter Olympics at St. Moritz, especially alpine skiing and cycling. =The birth of the World Cup= In the mid-1960s, he had the idea for a season-long series of ski races with a points system to determine a champion after being requested by former Tour de France and sportspaper L'√âquipe director Jacques Goddet to \\"invent somethings which would help our readers to better understand ski racing alpine circuit\\". A few months earlier, Lang had attended the very successful 'Nations Team Event' at Vail, Colorado, where the three best teams of the 1964 Olympics at Innsbruck had been invited by former US Alpine Director Bob Beattie to enter a newly launched team competition. It was such an exciting event that Serge Lang was convinced afterwards it was time to greatly enlarge the horizon of alpine ski racing mostly limited to central Europe during the winter season. In December 1965, L'√âquipe launched the first (unofficial) European ski circuit named \\"Troph√©e de L'Equipe\\", which was won by France's Marielle Goitschel and Austria's Karl Schranz. Lang, after discussing it with some of his friends Bob Beattie, the US Alpine Director, and Honor√© Bonnet, Head Coach of the French Ski Team, during a downhill training session of the famous \\"Hahnenkamm\\" races at Kitzb√ºhel, Austria, in January 1966, decided that it should become a world tour. He choose to name it the \\"World Cup\\" after the football (soccer) world championships held in England in 1966, which were the first to be called World Cup. That same summer, the ski World Championships were held in August for the first time in Portillo, Chile, during the Southern Hemisphere winter. This provided an opportunity for all the major figures in ski racing to come together including as Bob Beattie, Alpine Director of the United States Ski Team, and Honor√© Bonnet, head of the French Alpine Ski Team, as well as Dr. Sepp Sulzberger from Austria, and hash out the details of the proposed competition with a few skiers such as Frenchmen Jean-Claude Killy and Guy P√©rillat or Austrian Karl Schranz. The President of the International Ski Federation (FIS), Marc Hodler from Switzerland, agreed to support the new event which he personally presented to the press in Chile. The first (still unofficial) World Cup season began next winter with the men's competitions at Berchtesgaden, Germany, on January 5, 1967. The first overall winners at the end of that season were Nancy Greene of Canada, and France's Jean-Claude Killy. The World Cup became an official event sanctioned by FIS next spring during its Congress at Beirut, Lebanon. Marc Hodler became the first president of the World Cup Committee until 1973. =Later years= The alpine skiing World Cup soon became a huge success with ski racing fans, racers, organizers and ski suppliers. Lang continued to guide its growth over the following decades, serving as president of the International Ski Federation's Alpine World Cup committee from 1973 to 1986. He also continued working as a sports journalist for Blick, La Suisse, 24 Heures, and L'√âquipe, and founded the Association of International Ski Journalists in 1961. Lang wrote several books about ski racing and the World Cup, including the annual Ski World Cup Guide (popularly known as the \\"Biorama\\") with World Cup statistics and racer biographies, and the retrospective 21 Years of World Cup Ski Racing published in 1986. Lang lived his later years in Riehen, Switzerland, and apparently died of a heart attack in Sternenberg, Haut-Rhin, France while writing his memoirs in November 1999. His son, Patrick, is also a journalist covering alpine ski racing. The Lang legacy continues with two of his grand children, Manu√®le (born 1974) and Philippe-Alexandre (born 1978) also working on the World Cup tour and cycling as reporters and cameraman. In 1991 three generations of the family worked at the Tour de France, certainly a unique performance: both Patrick Lang and his then 16-year-old daughter worked for ABC Sports while Serge Lang covered the race for some of his usual newspapers. =Wife= Serge Lang was married from 1944 to 1989 to German-born journalist Anneliese Lang, who strongly supported him at the beginning of his career. Anneliese Lang was a film critic and met Lang at Basel during the War while reporting on \\"Le Bon Film\\" festival for a German newspaper. After returning to Berlin, she flew out of Germany after finding out she was a suspect for the Gestapo. She returned to Basel after jumping from her train while approaching the station. She died from cancer in 1989.

It has clinical and histologic manifestations similar to those of osteoid osteoma; therefore, some consider the two tumors to be variants of the same disease, with osteoblastoma representing a giant osteoid osteoma. However, an aggressive type of osteoblastoma has been recognized, making the relationship less clear. Although similar to osteoid osteoma, it is larger (between 2 and 6 cm). Signs and symptoms Patients with osteoblastoma usually present with pain of several months' duration. In contrast to the pain associated with osteoid osteoma, the pain of osteoblastoma usually is less intense, usually not worse at night, and not relieved readily with salicylates (aspirin and related compounds). If the lesion is superficial, the patient may have localized swelling and tenderness. Spinal lesions can cause painful scoliosis, although this is less common with osteoblastoma than with osteoid osteoma. In addition, lesions may mechanically interfere with the spinal cord or nerve roots, producing neurologic deficits. Pain and general weakness are common complaints. Pathophysiology  The cause of osteoblastoma is unknown. Histologically, osteoblastomas are similar to osteoid osteomas, producing both osteoid and primitive woven bone amidst fibrovascular connective tissue, the difference being that osteoblastoma can grow larger than 2.0 cm in diameter while osteoid osteomas cannot. Although the tumor is usually considered benign, a controversial aggressive variant has been described in the literature, with histologic features similar to those of malignant tumors such as an osteosarcoma. Diagnosis When diagnosing osteoblastoma, the preliminary radiologic workup should consist of radiography of the site of the patient's pain. However, computed tomography (CT) is often necessary to support clinical and plain radiographic findings suggestive of osteoblastoma and to better define the margins of the lesion for potential surgery. CT scans are best used for the further characterization of the lesion with regard to the presence of a nidus and matrix mineralization. MRI aids in detection of nonspecific reactive marrow and soft tissue edema, and MRI best defines soft tissue extension, although this finding is not typical of osteoblastoma. Bone scintigraphy (bone scan) demonstrates abnormal radiotracer accumulation at the affected site, substantiating clinical suspicion, but this finding is not specific for osteoblastoma. In many patients, biopsy is necessary for confirmation.  Treatment  The first route of treatment in Osteoblastoma is via medical means. Although necessary, radiation therapy (or chemotherapy) is controversial in the treatment of osteoblastoma. Cases of postirradiation sarcoma have been reported after use of these modalities. However, it is possible that the original histologic diagnosis was incorrect and the initial lesion was an osteosarcoma, since histologic differentiation of these two entities can be very difficult. The alternative means of treatment consists of surgical therapy. The treatment goal is complete surgical excision of the lesion. The type of excision depends on the location of the tumor. * For stage 1 and 2 lesions, the recommended treatment is extensive intralesional excision, using a high-speed burr. Extensive intralesional resections ideally consist of removal of gross and microscopic tumor and a margin of normal tissue. * For stage 3 lesions, wide resection is recommended because of the need to remove all tumor-bearing tissue. Wide excision is defined here as the excision of tumor and a circumferential cuff of normal tissue around the entity. This type of complete excision is usually curative for osteoblastoma. In most patients, radiographic findings are not diagnostic of osteoblastoma; therefore, further imaging is warranted. CT examination performed with the intravenous administration of contrast agent poses a risk of an allergic reaction to contrast material. The lengthy duration of an MRI examination and a history of claustrophobia in some patients are limiting the use of MRI. Although osteoblastoma demonstrates increased radiotracer accumulation, its appearance is nonspecific, and differentiating these lesions from those due to other causes involving increased radiotracer accumulation in the bone is difficult. Therefore, bone scans are useful only in conjunction with other radiologic studies and are not best used alone.  Frequency  In the US, osteoblastomas account for only 0.5-2% of all primary bone tumors and only 14% of benign bone tumors making it a relatively rare form of bone tumor. In regards to morbidity and mortality, conventional osteoblastoma is a benign lesion with little associated morbidity. However, the tumor may be painful, and spinal lesions may be associated with scoliosis and neurologic manifestations. Metastases and even death have been reported with the controversial aggressive variant, which can behave in a fashion similar to that of osteosarcoma. This variant is also more likely to recur after surgery than is conventional osteoblastoma. Osteoblastoma affects more males than it does females, with a ratio of 2‚Äì3:1 respectively. Osteoblastoma can occur in persons of any age, although the tumors predominantly affect the younger population (around 80% of these tumors occurs in persons under the age of 30). No racial predilection is recognized. It usually presents in the vertebral column or long bones. Approximately 40% of all osteoblastomas are located in the spine. The tumors usually involve the posterior elements, and 17% of spinal osteoblastomas are found in the sacrum. The long tubular bones are another common site of involvement, with a lower extremity preponderance.

Sharp Island or Kiu Tsui Chau () is the largest island in the Kiu Tsui Country Park located at Port Shelter of Sai Kung, Hong Kong. The area is most known for fishing, swimming as well as diving. Sharp Island is under the administration of Sai Kung District. Geography The island has a maximum elevation of 136m and an area of 1 km¬≤. The two beaches, Half Moon Bay Beach (, also known as Hap Mun Bay), and Kiu Tsui Beach () are located on the island. Both are managed by the Hong Kong Leisure and Cultural Services Department. When the predicted tides at Ko Lau Wan is lower than or equal to +1.40 meters, visitors are able to visit Kiu Tsui (), an inshore islet, on foot. Different kind of volcanic rocks can be found on Sharp Island. The most frequent ones are rocks with a peculiar pattern on the surface. Other rocks have an unusual pineapple-shaped form. History =Origin of the different kinds or rocks= It is believed that about 140 million years ago a volcano was located in Sai Kung. Sharp Island was according to that on the margin of the caldera. This is probably the reason for the widely distributed different volcanic rocks from different geological periods around Sharp Island. =Formation of the tombolo= The sea currents near Sharp Island are pushing sand and gravel near the shore. After several years they formed a tombolo, a natural bridge made of different sized rocks and sand ‚Äì connecting Sharp Island and Kiu Tau (). At high tide the tombolo is submerged in water and thus can only be seen when the tide goes out. Biography There are over 70% of stony corals coverage around the island. An endangered flora Tetrathyrium subcordatum is found on the south of the island.

The Bickerton was a portable bicycle launched when folding bicycles tended to be step-through frames with a simple hinge, such as the folding variant of the Raleigh Twenty. The bicycle was made entirely of aluminium profiles, without any welds. In its weight (under 10 kg) and folded package size it broke new ground and it is cited by Andrew Ritchie as one of his inspirations in creating the highly successful Brompton bicycle. The bike was heavily promoted on TV with the slogan \\"Go bag a Bickerton\\", a reference to the dual-purpose bag, which could be used to hold the bike or as a pannier.

It was produced in conjunction with the College of Arts and Science at New York University (when the program started, the Washington Square and University College of Arts and Science). During June, July and August, the program was known as Summer Semester. It was one of the first examples of distance learning, telecourses, or MOOCs. Lecturers presented NYU credit courses in studio on a wide range of academic subjects, and these broadcast courses were offered for credit to anyone who paid the course fees. The program earned five Emmy Awards during its lifetime. The program was so named because it was broadcast in the early morning, in New York at 6:30 a.m. History and production Sunrise Semester was developed by Warren A. Kraetzer, director of the Office of Radio/Television at New York University, and Sam Cook Digges, general manager of WCBS-TV, and started on WCBS before becoming a syndicated program. Thomas Brophy, assistant director under Kraetzer, was the administrator of the program until his retirement in 1973, when he was succeeded by Mrs. Pat Myers. New York University planned the courses and provided faculty; beginning in 1963, CBS taped and distributed it to network affiliates. The first course was Comparative Literature 10: From Stendhal to Hemingway, taught by Floyd Zulli, Jr., an Assistant Professor of Romance Languages. Neil Postman taught a course in 1976. After a preview broadcast at 3:30 p.m. on Saturday, September 7, 1957, the program premiered on Monday, September 23, 1957 at 6:30 a.m. in New York and aired at varying early times between 5:30 and 7:30 a.m. elsewhere. It consisted of two courses per semester on alternating days from Monday through Saturday, each broadcast half an hour long (90‚Äì95 hours a year).Carlisle, p. 55. Initially these were broadcast live, requiring a 4:30 a.m. makeup call for the lecturer.Carlisle, p. 54. After adoption by the CBS network, the three lectures for each course were taped in a single weekly session, between 11:15 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. The setting was an unadorned lecture room, with a chalkboard and a projector. There was no editing and no provision for retakes; Myers said she advised professors who made \\"a horrendous goof\\" to \\"faint\\". Payments to the instructors were too low to permit rebroadcasting or the sale of tapes under union regulations: initially instructors received $25 per broadcast.Carlisle, pp. 53, 55. NYU students at first paid a $75 fee to receive undergraduate credit for one of the courses; by 1974 this had risen to $250. Other institutions were free to use the program for their own credit courses, without payment to NYU.Carlisle, pp. 55‚Äì56. Beginning in 1971, NYU also allowed high-school students to take the course for credit before enrolling in the university. A primary source of funding was a grant from the Sperry and Hutchinson Foundation.Carlisle, p. 56. During the summer, the program was titled Summer Semester and courses were non-credit; from 1962 Rutgers University produced summer courses. In a December 1958 article, John Crosby reported that most viewers of Sunrise Semester were women between 16 and 60. In the early years, NYU held a social event at which registered students could meet their instructor. There were plans in the early 1980s to improve the production values of the program, but CBS canceled it in 1982 to make way for early-morning news. At that time, according to the network, only 42 affiliates carried the program. Awards and reception Sunrise Semester won five Emmy Awards in its first two years.According to Carlisle, p. 56, four. Zulli's first course, viewable only in New York, had 74,000 viewers in the first week, 120,000 by the end of the semester. 150 students enrolled for credit, and bookstores sold out of Stendhals The Red and the Black.Carlisle, pp. 54‚Äì55. Jack Gould in The New York Times called it \\"a refreshing and civilized hit\\" and praised the instructor's \\"[lack of] condescension\\" and \\"carefully controlled ...theatrical[ity]\\".The New York Times, September 24, 1957, cited in , and in Carlisle, p. 54. In the mid-1970s, 85 CBS stations were carrying the broadcast, and NYU believed there were up to a million viewers.Carlisle, p. 57. Variety called Zulli's course \\"the first unquestioned hit show of the 1957 television season\\". CBS did not permit advertising during the program, but the slots before and after it were popular with advertisers. Sunrise Semester has been described as \\"a kind of primitive form of a ... MOOC\\"; in 1962 The New York Times ran a featured article on a housewife who had completed a bachelor's degree at NYU including 54 out of 128 credits from Sunrise Semester courses.

In 2004, a new edition of the book was released as City of Glass: The Graphic Novel, which featured an introduction by Spiegelman. In this introduction, Spiegelman called the graphic novel \\"a breakthrough work.\\" Since then, the book has been translated numerous times, with 20 foreign editions. Plot Mazzucchelli autographing a copy of the book at a June 28, 2012, signing at Midtown Comics in Manhattan. The story follows a man named Daniel Quinn. One night, he receives a call meant for a private detective (strangely enough named Paul Auster, the same name as the author of the story). Quinn is intrigued by the phone call, and takes the case. His employers end up being a man, named Peter Stillman, and his wife. Through the course of the narrative, Quinn discovers some surprising things about identity, language, and human nature. He also ends up meeting, not the unseen detective Paul Auster, but writer Paul Auster. In one section of Paul Auster's original novella, Peter Stillman delivers a long, somewhat disjointed speech about his life and the job that he has for Daniel Quinn. In the comic adaptation, the interplay between words and pictures is particularly interesting, with the word balloons coming less often from Stillman and more often from inkwells, storm drains, and even cave paintings. Spiegelman was particularly impressed with this section of the book, noting how well it translates Auster's description of Stillman's speech patterns.  Exhibitions  In March 2009, the City of Glass adaptation was given exhibition treatment, including Karasik's original layouts and Mazzucchelli's original art, as part of a Paul Auster celebration at the Dedica Literary Festival in Pordenone, Italy.\\"PAUL KARASIK AT SACI,\\" Studio Arts College International website (Mar. 6, 2009).

Blackouts are frequently described as having effects similar to that of anterograde amnesia, in which the subject cannot recall any events after the event that caused amnesia. Research on alcohol blackouts was done by E. M. Jellinek in the 1940s. Using data from a survey of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) members, he came to believe that blackouts would be a good determinant of alcoholism. However, there are conflicting views whether this is true. The negative psychological effects of an alcohol-related blackout are often worsened by those who suffer from anxiety disorders. Impairment of the liver will also allow more alcohol to reach the brain and hasten the individual's blackout. The term \\"blackout\\" can also refer to a complete loss of consciousness, or syncope. Alcohol and long-term memory Various studies have given rise to proof of links between general alcohol consumption and its effects on memory capacity. These studies have shown in particular, how the inebriated or intoxicated individual makes poorer associations between words and objects than does the sober individual. Later blackout-specific studies have indicated that alcohol specifically impairs the brain's ability to take short-term memories and experiences and transfer them to long-term memory. It is a common misconception that blackouts generally occur only in alcoholics; research suggests that individuals who engage in binge drinking, such as many college students, are often at risk as well. In a 2002 survey of college students by researchers at Duke University Medical Center, 40% of those surveyed who had consumed alcohol recently reported having experienced a blackout within the preceding year. In one study, a sample of individuals was gathered and divided into groups based on whether they had a fragmentary blackout within the last year or not. Groups were also divided based on those who had received alcohol and those who had not. In their beverage challenge, participants were given one drink per ten minutes until the target of 0.08% blood alcohol level was achieved. Drinks for the alcohol condition contained a 3:1 ratio of mixer to vodka. After 30 minutes, breathalyzer samples were recorded and recorded every 30 minutes thereafter. In the test for narrative recall, those who received alcohol and FB+ (those who admitted to having a fragmentary blackout within the last year) recalled fewer narrative details after a 30 minute delay but there were no significant interaction effects. The next day, participants were called and tested on their narrative recall and cued recall; the results were that those who consumed alcohol showed poorer 30 minute delay recall and next-day recall than those who did not consume alcohol, but there were no significant effects on cued recall of details. Their study also revealed that those who were FB+ and consumed alcohol also performed worse on contextual recall than the other participants. Alcohol impairs delayed and next-day narrative recall but not next-day cued recall, which suggests that information is available in memory but is temporarily inaccessible. Those with a history of fragmentary blackouts also performed worse on delayed recall than those with no prior blackouts. Neuroimaging shows that cued recall and free recall are associated with differential neural activation in distinct neural networks: sensory and conceptual. Together, these findings suggest that the differential effects of alcohol on free and cued recalls may be a result of substance altering neural activity in conceptual rather than sensory networks. Prior blackout experiences also appear to be related to impaired conceptual networks. Types of blackouts Blackouts can generally be divided into 2 categories, \\"en bloc\\" blackouts and \\"fragmentary\\" blackouts. En bloc blackouts are classified by the inability to later recall any memories from the intoxication period, even when prompted. These blackouts are characterized also by the ability to easily recall things that have occurred within the last 2 minutes, yet being unable to recall anything prior to this period. As such, a person experiencing an en bloc blackout may not appear to be doing so, as they can carry on conversations or even manage to accomplish difficult feats. It is difficult to determine the end of this type of blackout as sleep typically occurs before they end, although it is possible for an en bloc blackout to end if the sufferer has stopped drinking in the meantime. Fragmentary blackouts are characterized by a person having the ability to recall certain events from an intoxicated period, and yet being unaware that other memories are missing until reminded of the existence of those 'gaps' in memory. Research indicates that such fragmentary blackouts, also known as brownouts, are far more common than en bloc blackouts. Memory impairment during acute intoxication involves dysfunction of episodic memory, a type of memory encoded with spatial and social context. Recent studies have shown that there are multiple memory systems supported by discrete brain regions, and the acute effects of alcohol and learning and memory may result from alteration of the hippocampus and related structures on a cellular level. A rapid increase in blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is most consistently associated with the likelihood of a blackout. However, not all subjects experience blackouts which implies that genetic factors play a role in determining central nervous system (CNS) vulnerability to the effects of alcohol. The former may predispose an individual to alcoholism, as altered memory function during intoxication may affect an individual‚Äôs alcohol expectancy, one may perceive positive aspects of intoxication while unintentionally ignoring the negative aspects. Causes Blackouts are commonly associated with the consumption of large amounts of alcohol; however, surveys of drinkers experiencing blackouts have indicated that they are not directly related to the amount of alcohol consumed. Respondents reported they frequently recalled having \\"drunk as much or more without memory loss,\\" compared to instances of blacking out. Subsequent research has indicated that blackouts are most likely caused by a rapid increase in a person's blood-alcohol concentration. One study, in particular, resulted in subjects being stratified easily into two groups, those who consumed alcohol very quickly, and blacked out, and those who did not black out by drinking alcohol slowly, despite being extremely intoxicated by the end of the study. In another study hospital file data showed, that of 67 participants who abused alcohol, 39 had reported a blackout. The presence or absence of blackouts was cross-tabulated against various measures of alcohol problem severity. The presence of blackouts was associated to some degree with some indications of severity such as withdrawal and loss of control, but not with duration of problem drinking, physical complications or abnormal liver function. The presence of blackouts was related to some measures of severity of the problem ‚Äì withdrawal symptoms and loss of control. The hypotheses that blackouts either reflect a general vulnerability to the cerebral consequences of alcohol abuse or are associated with other forms of more enduring cognitive impairment did not receive any support. In another study which looked at subjective responses to alcohol as a prime for 21st birthday alcohol consumption, subjective responses to the initial drink were viewed as a prime for more alcohol consumption during 21st birthday celebrations. Current findings show that subjective responses to alcohol have direct effects on both the final BAC achieved and on the experiences of blackouts and hangover that are not explained by level of intoxication. Where a variety of social factors, such as peer pressure and 21st birthday traditions such as 21 shots may influence the amount of alcohol people consume, their subjective experiences with alcohol have clear influences on both consumption and the physiological consequences of drinking. These physiological responses to alcohol may have a biological vulnerability that extends beyond the dose-dependent effects of alcohol. Self reports from another study showed that 63% of patients in the study gulped their drinks rather than sipped. Five patients recollected vomiting during the drinking episode while 32 drank on an empty stomach and 41 drank more than originally planned. During the drinking episode 31% subjects described blackouts, 20% described brownouts, and 49% reported no amnesic episode. Neurophysiological and chemical mechanisms Memory disruptions by alcohol leading to blackout have been linked to inhibition of long-term potentiation, particularly in the hippocampus, by affecting gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) and N-methyl-D- aspartate neurotransmission. Alcohol induced blackouts are associated with the development of alcohol abuse and dependence, so it is important to consider potential neurobiological risk factors for experiencing this problem prior to onset of substance use. Results showed that prior to beginning substance use, blackout and youth showed greater activation during inhibitory processing than nondrinkers and blackout ‚Äì youth in frontal and cerebellar brain regions. Activation during correct inhibitory responses relative to go responses in the left and middle frontal gyri at baseline predicted future blackout experience, after controlling for follow-up externalizing behaviors and lifetime alcohol consumption. The conclusion of this study was that substance-na√Øve adolescents who later experience alcohol-induced blackouts show increased neural effort during inhibitory processing, as compared to adolescents who go on to drink at similar levels, but do not experience blackouts and healthy, nondrinking controls, suggesting a neurobiological vulnerability to alcohol-induced memory impairments. Other GABAA agonist drugs Alcohol acts as an agonist of the GABAA type receptor, leading to memory disruption (see Effects of alcohol on memory). Benzodiazepines (such as flunitrazepam, midazolam, and temazepam), barbiturates (such as phenobarbital), and other drugs which also act as GABAA agonists, are known to cause blackouts as a result of high dose use. Predisposition to blackouts Research indicates that some users of alcohol, particularly those with a history of blackouts, are predisposed to experience blackouts more frequently than others. One such study indicated a link between prenatal exposure to alcohol and vulnerability towards blackouts, in addition to the oft-cited link between this type of exposure and alcoholism. Alternatively, two studies have indicated that there appears to be a genetic predisposition towards blacking out, suggesting that some individuals are more susceptible to alcohol-related amnesia. From a neurobiological perspective, central serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) neurotransmission has been shown to modulate both alcohol consumption and impulsivity. Some variations in 5-HT neurotransmission may thus contribute to a risk of AD (alcohol dependence), especially the forms of AD associated with a high level of impulsivity. As the extracellular concentration of 5-HT is regulated by the activity of the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT), the gene SLC6A4 encoding this protein represents an important potential candidate gene for AD risk. Using a meta-analysis approach, Feinn et al. found evidence for an association of the short allele of the 5-HTTLPR (SLC6A4) with AD, but the overall effect size estimated by odd ratios was found weak. As expected in a complex condition like alcohol dependence, the disagreement in the association between AD and 5-HTTLPR likely reflects the impossibility for a single genetic determinant to explain the whole of the risk. Aside from chemical components which may cause a predisposition to alcohol dependence and blackouts, expectations of alcohol use may predispose drinkers toward alcoholism and blackouts. In a study of 123 college students significant correlations were found between students‚Äô alcohol expectancies, level of alcohol abuse, and blackout history. The students who experienced blackouts (38.6%) had much higher positive alcohol expectancies than those without blackouts. Positive and negative expectancies were positively correlated among the no-blackout group, but negatively correlated among the blackout group. Consequences Alcohol dependence is not prerequisite to blackouts (either en bloc or fragmentary). Students in one study who reported blackouts were demographically similar to other drinking students. Importantly, however, students reporting blackouts drank more, and had other symptoms of alcoholic drinking, even though they did not fall into the alcoholic range on the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST). Half of the students reported having had a blackout during their drinking careers, which closely followed other research findings. In another study 25% of healthy college students reported being familiar with alcoholic blackouts. 51% of the students reported that they had had at least one blackout. Blackouts were reported during activities such as spending money (27%), sexual conduct (24%), fighting (16%), vandalism (16%), unprotected intercourse (6%), and driving a car (3%). So a significant number of students were engaged in a range of possibly hazardous activities during blackouts. Of 545 individuals in another study, 161 (29.5%) reported driving drunk, 139 (25.5%) reported a regretted sexual situation, 67 (12.3%) reported unprotected sex, 60 (11%) reported having damaged property, 55 (10.1%) reported getting into a physical fight, and 29 (5.3%) reported injuring someone while under the influence of alcohol in the past 6 months.

ICANN also convinced several top-level domain registries who administer the .com, .net, .biz and .info namespaces, including VeriSign, NeuStar and Afilias to restrict pending-expiration Registerfly domains into a so-called ‚ÄúServer-Delete-Prohibited‚Äù status. ICANN stated, ‚ÄúThis will prevent them from being deleted from the registry and becoming available for re- registration by others.‚Äù = .be domains = In 2005...2006, RegisterFly was the main registrar of .be domains (Belgium). This is due to various promotional zero-dollar offers for .be domains by RegisterFly during 2005 and probably until late 2006. A significant part of the RegisterFly domain data base included .be domains. While the exact number can not be specified at this time, the number is supposed to be between 100 000 and 300 000 .be domains. When customers tried to renew such domains, the money was drawn from their credit card but domain renewal did not take place. So in their RegisterFly customer account, their domain was marked as renewed, while the Belgium ccTLD registry for these domains had already made them available for new domain registrants. The Belgian ccTLD registry equivalent refused to apply to these domains the status ‚ÄúServer-Delete-Prohibited‚Äù, as this function was not provided in the registries processes. This refusal was the answer for the corresponding request for various .be domains, for example for the domain notenverga.be (\\"rating...\\", related to the German site http://vox7.com = rating of election candidates.) - Source: infos7.com - So while ICANN coordinated some kind of protection, the registrants of .be domain had the risk to definitely lose their domains in case of some marketing value (high visitor frequence) to domain hunters. =Termination of ICANN accreditation= On March 16, 2007, ICANN informed Registerfly that it would cease operating as an ICANN-Accredited Registrar on March 31, 2007, and also ordered RegisterFly to immediately cease using the ICANN logo and trademarks on their website.Malaysia Sun, ICANN terminates RegisterFly.com accreditation, March 17, 2007 ‚ÄúTerminating accreditation is the strongest measure ICANN is able to take against RegisterFly under its powers.

Late in 2007 Chater was replaced by Stuart Leach. They have issued two studio albums, As a Film (15 October 2007) and Sail Becomes a Kite (17 July 2010). By late 2012 they had effectively disbanded.  History  The Bank Holidays were conceived by James (Jim) Crombie (bass guitar, vocals) and Wibekke (Bekk) Reczek (guitar, vocals) whilst holidaying in Norway (on Bekk's grandparents' farm), who several weeks later in London enlisted old school friend Nat Carson (guitar, piano, vocals) to form the band. On their return to Perth in 2003 they recruited drummer, Ian \\"Stafford\\" Chater. Late in 2007 Chater was replaced on drums by Stuart Leach. They played their first gig at The Swan Basement in Fremantle under the name Tunnelball, a suggestion from Darren Hanlon. They changed it to the Bank Holidays before their next gig at Perth's Hyde Park Hotel. In September 2004 the band released their debut recording, a five-track extended play, Good Looks to Camera on Lost & Lonesome Recording Co. Sabian Wilde described the band as \\"Firmly entrenched in the realm of '60s pop, without any of that caustic tongue-in- cheek bitterness that sometimes afflicts revivalists\\" and that the EP is \\"a gem of a debut... that is self-assured, breezy and very, very catchy. Despite being a little too indie for those of the rawk persuasion, consistent rotation should wear those boundaries down like a smile melting a bad mood.\\"\\"WAM Reviews\\" for West Australian Music Industry Awards:  Its lead track, \\"Tread Easy\\", won a WAMi Award in 2004 in the Indie Rock / Punk Category for Crombie and the group. In February 2005 the group co-headlined with the Panics on a national tour, with the Bank Holidays releasing their second five-track EP, Day for Night, later that year. Its second track, \\"Like a Piano\\", was nominated at the WAMi Awards in that year for the Love category for Crombie, Reczek and the group; and its final track, \\"Not so Long Ago\\", was nominated for the Rock category for Crombie and the group. The Bank Holidays have also played with fellow Australian bands the Lucksmiths, Little Birdy, Youth Group, the Panda Band and Augie March, and have supported international acts, Belle and Sebastian and Peter, Bjorn and John. At the 2007 WAMi Awards The Bank Holidays walked away with their first WAMington for 'Best Indie Pop Act'. The group completed recording of their debut album, As a Film, at the rural Victorian home studio of their producer, J Walker a.k.a. Machine Translations. It was released on 13 October 2007. Crombie and Reczek had married by 2010. On 17 July the Bank Holidays released their second album, Sail Becomes a Kite. Jennifer Peters of the AU Review opined, \\"A surprising left turn for the delightful quartet, whose previous output has been exemplified by a giddy exuberance and sense of joyousness, Sail Becomes a Kite is an extraordinarily reflective and weighty indie-pop release... the outfit is more than capable of crafting unabashedly graceful and poignant tracks, fleshing out the production canvas along with the ever-growing gusto of their entrancing three-part harmonies.\\" By 2012 the group's official website declared \\"The band is currently split between Perth and Melbourne, so a show is rare and exciting thing for us. Behold then, our appearance at Perth's This Is Nowhere festival!\\" They were scheduled to appear in October 2012. The Bank Holidays had effectively disbanded after that time.

At a factory, local inhabitants could interact with foreign merchants, often known as factors.Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language, Portland House, New York, 1983. First established in Europe, factories eventually spread to many other parts of the world. The factories established by European states in Africa, Asia and the Americas from the 15th century onward also tended to be official political dependencies of those states. These have been seen, in retrospect, as the precursors of colonial expansion. A factory could serve simultaneously as market, warehouse, customs, defense and support to navigation exploration, headquarters or de facto government of local communities. In North America, Europeans began to trade with the natives during the 16th century. Colonists created factories, known as trading posts, at which furs could be traded, in Native American territory. European medieval factories Main trading routes of the Hanseatic League. The Oostershuis, a Kontor in Antwerp Although European colonialism traces its roots from the classical era, when Phoenicians, Greeks and Romans established colonies of settlement around the Mediterranean - \\"factories\\" were a unique institution born in medieval Europe. Originally, factories were organizations of European merchants from a state, meeting in a foreign place. These organizations sought to defend their common interests, mainly economic (as well as organized insurance and protection), enabling the maintenance of diplomatic and trade relations within the foreign state where they were set. The factories were established from 1356 onwards in the main trading centers, usually ports or central hubs that have prospered under the influence of the Hanseatic League and its guilds and kontors. The Hanseatic cities had their own law system and furnished their own protection and mutual aid. The Hanseatic League maintained factories, among others, in England (Boston, King's Lynn), Norway (T√∏nsberg) and Finland (√Öbo). Later, cities like Bruges and Antwerp actively tried to take over the monopoly of trade from the Hansa, inviting foreign merchants to join in. Because foreigners were not allowed to buy land in these cities, merchants joined around factories, like the Portuguese in their Bruges factory: the factor(s) and his officers rented the housing and warehouses, arbitrated trade, and even managed insurance funds, working both as an association and an embassy, even administering justice within the merchant community.Diogo Ramada Curto, Francisco Bethencourt, \\"O tempo de Vasco da Gama\\", DIFEL, 1998, Portuguese feitorias (c. 1445) During the territorial and economic expansion of the Age of Discovery, the factory was adapted by the Portuguese and spread throughout from West Africa to Southeast Asia.Diffie 1977, pp. 314-315 The Portuguese feitorias were mostly fortified trading posts settled in coastal areas, built to centralize and thus dominate the local trade of products with the Portuguese kingdom (and thence to Europe). They served simultaneously as market, warehouse, support to the navigation and customs and were governed by a feitor (\\"factor\\") responsible for managing the trade, buying and trading products on behalf of the king and collecting taxes (usually 20%). Elmina Castle in modern-day Ghana, viewed from the sea in 1668 The first Portuguese feitoria overseas was established by Henry the Navigator in 1445 on the island of Arguin, off the coast of Mauritania. It was built to attract Muslim traders and monopolize the business in the routes traveled in North Africa. It served as a model for a chain of African feitorias, Elmina Castle being the most notorious. Between the 15th and 16th centuries, a chain of about 50 Portuguese forts either housed or protected feitorias along the coasts of West and East Africa, the Indian Ocean, China, Japan, and South America. The main Portuguese factories were in Goa, Malacca, Ormuz, Ternate, and Macau. They were mainly driven by the trade of gold and slaves on the coast of Guinea, spices in the Indian Ocean, and sugar cane in the New World. They were also used for local triangular trade between several territories, like Goa-Macau-Nagasaki, trading products such as sugar, pepper, coconut, timber, horses, grain, feathers from exotic Indonesian birds, precious stones, silks and porcelain from the East, among many other products. In the Indian Ocean, the trade in Portuguese factories was enforced and increased by a merchant ship licensing system: the cartazes.Diffie 1977, pp. 320-322 From the feitorias, the products went to the main outpost in Goa, then to Portugal where they were traded in the Casa da √çndia, which also managed exports to India.Diffie 1977, p. 316 There they were sold, or re-exported to the Royal Portuguese Factory in Antwerp, where they were distributed to the rest of Europe. Easily supplied and defended by sea, the factories worked as independent colonial bases. They provided safety, both for the Portuguese, and at times for the territories in which they were built, protecting against constant rivalries and piracy. They allowed Portugal to dominate trade in the Atlantic and Indian oceans, establishing a vast empire with scarce human and territorial resources. Over time, the feitorias were sometimes licensed to private entrepreneurs, giving rise to some conflict between abusive private interests and local populations, such as in the Maldives. Dutch factorij and other European factories (1600s) Dejima island in Nagasaki Bay, first Portuguese and then Dutch factory Canton \\"Thirteen Factories\\", c. 1820 Other European powers began to establish factories in the 17th century along the trade routes explored by Portugal and Spain, first the Dutch and then the English. They went on to establish in conquered Portuguese feitorias and further enclaves, as they explored the coasts of Africa, Arabia, India, and South East Asia in search of the source of the lucrative spice trade. Factories were then established by chartered companies such as the Dutch East India Company (VOC), founded in 1602, and the Dutch West India Company (WIC), founded in 1621. These factories provided for the exchange of products among European companies, local populations, and the colonies that often started as a factory with warehouses. Usually these factories had larger warehouses to fit the products resulting from the increasing agricultural development of colonies, which were boosted in the New World by the Atlantic slave trade. In these factories, the products were checked, weighed, and packaged to prepare for the long sea voyage. In particular, spices, cocoa, tea, tobacco, coffee, sugar, porcelain, and fur were well protected against the salty sea air and against deterioration. The factor was present as the representative of the trading partners in all matters, reporting to the headquarters and being responsible for the products‚Äô logistics (proper storage and shipping). Information took a long time to reach the company headquarters, and this was dependent on an absolute trust. Some Dutch factories were located in Cape Town in modern-day South Africa, Mocha in Yemen, Calicut and the Coromandel Coast in southern India, Colombo in Sri Lanka, Ambon in Indonesia, Fort Zeelandia in Taiwan, Canton in southern China, Dejima Island in Japan (the only legal point of trade between Japan and the outside world during the Edo Period), and Fort Orange in modern-day Upstate New York in the United States. North American factories (1697 to 1822) The American factories often played a strategic role as well, sometimes operating as forts, providing a degree of protection for colonists and their allies from hostile Indians and foreign colonists. York Factory, Manitoba, in 1853 Fort Clark on the left, which in turn was within a walled fort York Factory was founded by the chartered Hudson's Bay Company in 1697. It was headquarters of the company for a long time, and was once the de facto government in parts of North America such as Rupert's Land, before European-based colonies existed. It controlled the fur trade throughout much of British-controlled North America for several centuries, undertaking early exploration. Its traders and trappers forged early relationships with many groups of American Indians, and a network of trading posts formed the nucleus for later official authority in many areas of Western Canada and the United States. The early coastal factory model contrasted with the system of the French, who established an extensive system of inland posts and sent traders to live among the tribes of the region. When war broke out in the 1680s between France and England, the two nations regularly sent expeditions to raid and capture each other's fur trading posts. In March 1686, the French sent a raiding party under Chevalier des Troyes over to capture the company's posts along James Bay. In 1697, Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville, commander of the company's captured posts, defeated three ships of the Royal Navy in the Battle of the Bay on his way to capture York Factory by a ruse. York Factory changed hands several times in the next decade and was finally ceded permanently in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht. After the treaty, the Hudson Bay Company rebuilt York Factory as a brick star fort at the mouth of the nearby Hayes River, its present location. The United States government sanctioned a factory system from 1796 to 1822, with factories scattered through the mostly territorial portion of the country. The factories were officially intended to protect Indians from exploitation through a series of legislation called the Indian Intercourse Acts. However, in practice, numerous tribes conceded extensive territory in exchange for the trading posts, as happened in the Treaty of Fort Clark in which the Osage Nation ceded most of Missouri at Fort Clark. A blacksmith was usually assigned to the factory to repair utensils and build or maintain plows. The factories frequently also had some sort of milling operation associated with them. The factories marked the United States' attempt to continue a process originally pioneered by the French and then by the Spanish to officially license the fur trade in Upper Louisiana. Factories were frequently called \\"forts\\" and often had numerous unofficial names. Legislation was often passed calling for military garrisons at the fort but their de facto purpose was a trading post. =Examples= York Factory was founded by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1697.

The first ADC flying unit to arrive was the 325th Fighter-Interceptor Group, which arrived on 26 November 1948. The mission of the 325th FIG was to conduct ADC's All Weather Combat Crew Training School. Its operational component, the 317th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, initially flew Northrop P-61 Black Widows, almost immediately transitioning to the North American F-82 Twin Mustang. A second squadron, the 319th Fighter Interceptor Squadron arrived on 2 September 1949, being reassigned from McChord AFB. The 319th also flew the F-82 Twin Mustang.

In 1963, the 4170th was redesignated as the 462d Strategic Aerospace Wing with B-52E Stratofortress and KC-135A Stratotanker aircraft. =Civil use= With the closure of the Larson AFB in 1966, Colonel Owen retired from the Air Force and became the first director of the Port of Moses Lake, overseeing the transfer of the property from the U.S. Government to Grant County International Airport. Following the Air Force's departure in 1966, the airfield has continued to support operations from McChord's 62d Airlift Wing over the years, as the wing's Lockheed C-141 Starlifter, Lockheed C-130 Hercules, and currently Boeing C-17 Globemaster III aircraft have practiced approaches and both normal landings and tactical assault landings on a regular basis. The 92nd Air Refueling Wing at Fairchild Air Force Base in Spokane temporarily moved its KC-135 R/T fleet and operations to Moses Lake in 2011 while Fairchild's runway underwent reconstruction and other infrastructure improvements, to include an upgrade to the base's aviation fuel distribution system. For over four decades, Japan Air Lines trained its 747 crews at the facility, until 2009. =Previous names= * Moses Lake Army Air Base, 1942‚Äì1945 * Moses Lake Air Force Base, 1948‚Äì1950 * Larson Air Force Base, 1950‚Äì1966 =Major commands to which assigned= * Fourth Air Force, 1942‚Äì1943 * II Bomber Command, 1943‚Äì1945 * Air Defense Command, 1948‚Äì1952 * Tactical Air Command, 1952‚Äì1957 * Military Air Transport Service, 1957‚Äì1960 * Strategic Air Command, 1960‚Äì1966 =Major units assigned= * 482d Fighter Squadron, 1942‚Äì1943 * 396th Bombardment Group, 1943‚Äì1945 * 325th Fighter-Interceptor Group, 1948‚Äì1950 * 81st Fighter- Interceptor Wing, 1949‚Äì1951 * 62d Troop Carrier Wing, 1952‚Äì1960 * 71st Strategic Reconnaissance Wing, 1955‚Äì1957 * 4170th Strategic Wing, 1960 : Redesignated 462d Strategic Aerospace Wing, 1963‚Äì1966. =Air Defense Command units= Known ADC units and squadrons assigned to Larson were: * 82d Fighter Interceptor Squadron (6 February 1952 ‚Äì 1 April 1953) (F-94B Starfire) : Assigned to: 4702d Defense Wing : Reassigned from: Hamilton AFB, California : Reassigned to: MATS Iceland Air Defense Force at NAS Keflavik, Iceland * 31st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron (20 April 1953 ‚Äì 18 August 1955) (F-86D Sabre) : Activated at Larson to replace 82d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron : Assigned to: 4702d Air Defense Wing, 20 April 1953 : Reassigned to: 84th Fighter Group (Air Defense) at Wurtsmith AFB, Michigan * 322d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron (18 August 1955 ‚Äì 1 April 1959) (F-86D Sabre) : Activated at Larson to replace 31st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron : Assigned to: 9th Air Division, 18 August 1955 ‚Äì 1 December 1956 : Assigned to: 4721st Air Defense Group, 1 December 1956 ‚Äì 1 April 1959 : Reassigned to: Kingsley Field, Oregon upon SAC taking control of Larson AFB. * 323d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron (26 November 1952 ‚Äì 18 August 1955) (F-86D Sabre) : Assigned to: 4794th Air Defense Wing 26 November 1952 ‚Äì 19 January 1953 : Assigned to: 4702d Air Defense Wing, 19 January 1953 ‚Äì 8 October 1954 : Assigned to: 9th Air Division, 8 October 1954 ‚Äì 18 August 1955 : Activated at Larson AFB : Reassigned to: 84th Fighter Group (Air Defense) at Truax Field, Wisconsin *538th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron (18 August 1955 ‚Äì 1 July 1960) (F-86D/L Sabre, F-104A/B Starfighter (1958‚Äì1960)) : Activated at Larson to replace 323d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron : Assigned to: 9th Air Division, 18 August 1955 ‚Äì 1 December 1956 : Assigned to: 4721st Air Defense Group, 1 December 1956 : Assigned to: 4700th Air Defense Wing, 1 May 1959 : Assigned to: Spokane Air Defense Sector, 15 May ‚Äì 1 July 1960 : Discontinued upon SAC taking control of Larson AFB. =Intercontinental ballistic missile facilities= 568th Strategic Missile Squadron ‚Äì HGM-25A Titan I Missile Sites The 568th Strategic Missile Squadron Operated three HGM-25A Titan I ICBM sites: (1 Apr 1961 ‚Äì 25 Mar 1965) * 568-A, 8 miles N of Schrag, Washington * 568-B, 4 miles SSW of Warden, Washington * 568-C, 6 miles SE of Frenchman Hills, Washington The Titan I ICBM program at Larson was initiated in 1959 when the Walla Walla District of the Army Corps of Engineers set up an area office in October.

The group was active from the 1920s to the early 1930s and was first affiliated with the Labor Party. After World War II, many of its former members were leaders in Norwegian politics and cultural activities. History and profile It was established in 1921 under the initiative of Erling Falk (1887-1940), partly with origins in the debate forum in the Social Democratic Student Association (Den Socialdemokratiske Studenterforening) at the University of Oslo; partly from a Falk-led study circle which from 1919 involved Viggo Hansteen, Axel S√∏mme, and Arnold Hazeland. Members were strongly linked to Falk's personality and were subject to strict discipline. Falk aimed to develop a body of students and young workers committed to revolutionary socialism: according to George Lakey, the group \\"sought to replace middle-class individualism with a collective and disciplined spirit\\". The magazine Mot Dag was published by the group between 1921 and 1936. The first editor was future author and publishing consultant Sigurd Hoel (1890-1960). Mot Dag was a collective member of the Norwegian Labour Party from March 1922 until August 1924, initially aligning itself with the revolutionary faction led by Martin Tranm√¶l, but was excluded from the party after a series of disagreements. In 1927, Mot Dag was a part of the Norwegian Communist Party (NKP). From 1929, Mot Dag was an independent political organization. In the middle of the 1930s, Mot Dag made an unsuccessful attempt to establish a new labor party. After the charismatic leader Erling Falk fell sick, Trond Hegna (1898‚Äì1992), took over the actual leadership. Hegna would later serve a member of the Norwegian Parliament (Storting) and leader of the Storting's finance committee. In 1930, the publishing house Fram forlag was established in part to publish the workers' encyclopedia (Arbeidernes Leksikon. 1933). Both the magazine and organization dissolved in 1936. The organization had at most approximately 200 members and when it was dissolved in 1936 had about 100. Most of the members followed the internal orders to register in the Labor Party. After World War II, many former members Mot Dag were leaders in Norwegian politics and culture. Norway's first three post-war Prime Ministers Einar Gerhardsen, Oscar Torp, and John Lyng were all at one point in time part of Mot Dag. In addition were Gro Harlem Brundtland's father, Secretary of Defense Gudmund Harlem; the Labor Party's longstanding secretary Haakon Lie, Oslo's longstanding mayor Brynjulf Bull, and future West German chancellor Willy Brandt. Many well-known authors, intellectuals, and future leading politicians and officials were also members. Of note were filmmaker Olav Dalgard; the authors Helge Krog, Odd Eidem, Sigurd Hoel, Arnulf √òverland, Nic Waal and Inger Hagerup‚Äîthe latter two of the few women who were connected to Mot Dag; future director of Norway's military intelligence Vilhelm Evang and future director of the Norwegian Directorate for Health, Karl Evang. Economist and future university professor Johan Vogt, who together with Falk, was behind the first translation of Das Kapital into Norwegian.

He is primarily known as a successful owner and manager of land across Australia, most notably his father's Rosewood station. Early life Jack was the only child of Thomas Kilfoyle, a farmer from Ireland, and his native-born wife Catherine. In 1882 and 1883, Tom had led an overlanding party with his relatives, the Duracks and the Byrnes, and established Rosewood station, which extended from the eastern Kimberley region of Western Australia into the present Northern Territory. Jack was educated in the early 1900s at Christian Brothers' College in Perth. Although he had lost the sight in one eye as the result of an insect bite that became infected, he proved an excellent athlete. On his father's death in 1908, he inherited a share in Rosewood. Jack worked on the property from 1915 and took over its management in March 1922. Land owner During the next 25 years, Kilfoyle built a reputation as a successful owner-manager on a medium-sized property of on what was known as a \\"big man's frontier,\\" increasingly dominated by companies and absentee proprietors. Having improved his beef Shorthorns with a strain of \\"milk\\" bulls acquired from Nestl√© & Anglo Swiss Condensed Milk Co. (Australasia) Ltd., he put his profits into improving the property by fencing, paddocking and providing watering-places. A federal board of inquiry into land policy in 1937 praised Kilfoyle's thorough management and close supervision of Rosewood. Legal troubles In 1932, Kilfoyle was charged with the theft of some part-Devon bulls from the Wyndham Freezing, Canning & Meat Works. He was sentenced to two years imprisonment in a Wyndham jail. At a retrial, the sentence was commuted to a fine. In 1938, he was sued for breach of promise by May Dorothy Hayes, daughter of his father's former partner. She sought damages of more than $15,000 and received about $1,300. Kilfoyle's only comment was reportedly, \\"Oh dear...these women are expensive.\\" Rich married man On 23 February 1939, Kilfoyle married Thelma Ada Hope Ryan at St. Mary's Catholic Cathedral in Perth. His fortunes prospered during World War II and in 1947 he sold Rosewood, fully stocked, for well over $100,000. He established a trust of some $15,000 for the Aborigines on his property, then moved with his wife to Sydney and then Melbourne. His collection of Australian stamps was to be valued at $60,000 in 1961. The Kilfoyles moved to Berkeley Square, London, in 1952 but returned to Perth in 1961. Kilfoyle died of emphysema and bronchitis on 26 May 1962 in Perth and was buried in a cemetery in Karrakatta, Western Australia.

On 17 October 1865 he was married to Jane Hercus and two days later was ordained to the Christian ministry. It had been decided that he should go to the South Pacific island of Rarotonga in the Cook Islands, although he had hoped to work in Africa. Rarotonga On 4 January 1866 Chalmers sailed in the missionary ship John Williams to Australia, where he arrived in May. After a stay of three months, he left for the New Hebrides (now Vanuatu). The ship ran onto an uncharted rock and had to go back to Sydney to be repaired. It sailed again and was wrecked in January, though all on board were saved. He arrived at Rarotonga on 20 May 1867. Chalmers was initially disappointed to find the island partially Christianized, but soon found there was much work to be done in fighting drunkenness and in directing the natives' energies into wiser practices. He learned the language, did much teaching, and became personally popular. His Raratongan name was Tamate. Chalmers also produced a monthly newspaper. He gained much experience which was to be used in his later work, but he felt a strong urge to devote his life to less-tutored men. New Guinea In 1877, Chalmers had his desire for pioneering work fulfilled and was sent to New Guinea, then an almost-unknown land. He and his wife arrived at Port Moresby on 22 October 1877. During the next nine years he explored much of southern New Guinea in dangerous conditions, and was everywhere the peacemaker. In 1885, Work and Adventure in New Guinea 1877 to 1885, which he wrote in collaboration with W. Wyatt Gill, was published in London. Next appeared Adventures in New Guinea (1886) and Pioneering in New Guinea (1887) solely by Chalmers. A year's leave in Great Britain (1886-7) generated much interest in his work. After Chalmers' return to New Guinea, he did a great deal of exploring and gained a detailed knowledge of much of the country and its inhabitants. When British New Guinea was made a colony in 1888, Chalmers and his fellow missionary, the Rev. William G. Lawes, explained to the chiefs the meaning of the functions that were held. It had been decided that the colony should be governed in the best interests of the natives. It was no doubt largely the influence of the missionaries that made it illegal both to deport natives and to introduce intoxicants, fire-arms, and explosives. In 1893, Chalmers explored part of the Fly River in a steam launch, but found the natives extremely hostile. He had another furlough in 1894-5 and did much speaking in Great Britain. He also published Pioneer Life and Work in New Guinea 1877-1894 (1895), which contained a considerable amount of material from earlier books. Back at his work in 1896, Chalmers was anxious to further explore the Fly River and established himself for some time at Saguane off the Fly River delta. His last station was Daru. In April 1900 he was joined by a young missionary, Oliver Fellows Tomkins (son of Daniel Tomkins of Great Yarmouth - a plaque is situated in the United Reformed Church, Princes St, Norwich to Tomkins's memory). A year later, he was on a vessel with Tomkins near Goaribari Island, and was visited by natives who appeared to be in a dangerous mood. Chalmers resolved to go ashore and Tomkins insisted on going with him. Both men were murdered and eaten by the natives on 8 April 1901. There is a stained glass window to their memory in the college chapel at Vatorato. Chalmers is also included on a stained glass window in the Eltham College chapel in Mottingham, England. Chalmers' first wife died on 20 February 1879. In 1888 he married Sarah Elizabeth Harrison, a widow from East Retford who had been a childhood friend of his first wife. Chalmers preached his last sermon in Britain at the Retford Congregational Church (a site now occupied by the Aldi supermarket). 'Lizzie' died in 1900. There were no children by either marriage.

The Promaster was designed to replace the aging Bushmaster 2000 model, which had been Indian Creek Design's flagship marker between 2000 and 2004. History The original Promaster was a mechanical blowback paintball marker manufactured by a company called Line SI, which was then partially owned by Jerry Dobbins, the now-current owner of Indian Creek Designs. It was one of the first stacked-tube semiautomatic designs in paintball in the late '80s to early '90s. When ICD set out to redesign the Bushmaster (itself named after Line SI's famous pump) in 2005, the ProMaster name was resurrected to help promote the new model. Other than its name, the current Promaster shares nothing in common with the original. Specifications A stock black Promaster The Promaster has a significantly smaller profile than its Bushmaster predecessor. It is an electronic solenoid- actuated computer controlled marker. The major components of the marker are machined from solid, aircraft-grade aluminum, and then hard anodized. The stock board can operate in Semi-Automatic mode, Ramp Automatic, Ramp, and Ramp burst. All modes can be capped at 15bit/s (balls per second) or completely uncapped. Modes are selected by changing switches on the circuit board under the markers grip. The Promaster comes stock with a 12\\" ported barrel with Autococker/Intimidator threads. The stock marker also comes with a four-way adjustable aluminum double trigger, electronic break-beam eye, delrin bolt, and quick pull pins for field stripping. Designed to operate on low-pressure, The main operating pressure is 250‚Äì300 PSI, which can be monitored via the gauge on the primary (input) regulator. The secondary pressure is factory preset and regulated to 85‚Äì95 PSI. Gas usage is controlled through these 2 internal regulators. C02 is not a recommended propellant for the Promaster or any electropneumatic marker, as the cold liquid can destroy a solenoid valve. Instead, regulated High Pressure Air or Nitrogen systems are recommended although may be used if an Anti-siphon tube has been installed inside the bottle. Since the Promaster is able to reach firing rates of over 15 bit/s (30 bit/s is claimed by Indian Creek), it will operate best when used with a force-fed hopper such as Vlocity/Vlocity Jr, Halo, Empire B, Pulse, Fasta, and or a Dye Rotor. However a force-fed hopper is not absolutely necessary and an agitated, or other electronic hopper, may be used with the Promaster at lower rates of fire (i.e. Viewloader Evolution 2 or 3, Revolutions, Halo TSA Frontman and Backman, Ricochet Apache, etc.) Upgrades There are many upgrades available for the ProMaster. One upgrade that must be bought immediately is a bottom line setup, the most popular of these being an on/off valve style ASA (Air Source Adaptor) with a macroline hose. Any 45 style grips will fit it and all Autococker/Intimidator barrels will work as well. The feedneck is threaded into the body and can be replaced with any Bushmaster- style feed neck, such as the feednecks manufactured by AKALMP, CCM and ICDU. Another very popular upgrade among ProMaster users is the Indian Creek Designs Underground Cylinder Assembly. It consists of a new cylinder and ram unit as well as a Quick Exhaust Valve, or QEV and hose barb. The low pressure regulator pressure can be dropped significantly after this upgrade. This increases the ProMaster's air efficiency and cycle speed as well as reducing the amount of recoil felt when firing. Another advantage to adding the ICDU cylinder is the hammer can be removed out of the back of the gun, resulting in an easier maintenance process for the user. Other popular upgrades are replacement high pressure regulators, low pressure regulators and valves that offer higher air flow and consistency, resulting in higher paintball velocities at lower air pressures, thus increasing the ProMaster's efficiency. Aftermarket Micro-processor circuit boards are available from NOX, Kila Products and Vaporworks. The ProMaster shares the same circuit board type as the newer ICD Freestyles. Yet another popular upgrade is widely available on www.ebay.com. It is a delrin bolt link pin, which links the bolt to the ram hammer. It is very popular because it is light in weight, prevents scratching of the body and, is very inexpensive compared to most other upgrades available for the ProMaster. Delrin bolts are also available, however the stock bolt has proven to be a strong point of the gun because it is also made of delrin and no evidence of performance gains has been shown with the use of an upgraded bolt. New high flow solenoid valves are also available from ICDU website as well as Airsoldier.com Drawbacks One of the main drawbacks for buying a Promaster is that it does not come stock with an ASA, which means that the owner will have to add one before he or she uses the marker. Many users have reported a \\"break-in\\" period before the marker performs consistently, as is common in most markers. The Promaster does not come stock with a clamping feedneck, a device that locks onto a hopper and keeps it more secure than a standard feedneck. This is not a major problem, however; many users upgrade to a clamping feedneck. Unfortunately ICD products are generally not as readily available as products from more popular paintball companies such as Smart Parts, or Tippmann, etc. This means that replacement or upgrade parts can sometimes be hard to find, particularly for players living outside of the U.S.A. Lasoya Promaster Stock Lasoya Promaster with evil asa Indian Creek Designs also made a variant of this marker known as the Lasoya Promaster. The Lasoya version has slightly different milling which is more simplistic and comes in a dust finish two tone fade colour. The aggressive \\"tail\\" has been removed, perhaps to decrease the weight of the marker. The high pressure regulator is different from the standard ProMaster. It is a clone of the well- known Air America Vigilante regulator. Instead of the standard ProMaster blade trigger, a new trigger with two finger groves has been added. The bolt is also different as it is made of teflon, instead of delrin and has a small \\"ramp\\" on the top to reduce ball breakage. It also comes with a low pressure regulator gauge so the user can see exactly what the LPR is set at. Another change from the regular ProMaster is the feed neck. While it is still not a clamping feed neck, it has a lower profile, resulting in less hopper hits. The board in the Lasoya Promaster was made by Kila products for ICD and is a less adjustable version of their ProMaster Drive board. Hence it has been nicknamed the \\"Kila Lite\\" board. It features more firing modes than the original ProMaster board and an adjustable \\"debounce\\" setting. Like the original, the Lasoya Promaster does not come with an ASA. The Lasoya finish comes in black/gold, black/blue, black/grey, and black/red. The Lasoya ProMaster is available in limited quantity because shortly after they went into production, the contract between Pat Maroch and NPS was severed, causing the production of more Lasoya ProMasters to come to an end. Other models GS Promaster, courtesy of Greg Schutte Prototypes for a GS Promaster and an ND Promaster were designed but not released. The GS Promaster was designed by ICD tech Greg Schutte. It has the ICD aftermarket cylinder assembly, BlueFork modified stock ICD LPR, HPR, new ICD clamping feedneck, stock grips, Humphrey high-flow solenoid (same solenoid used in the Freestyle pro) and full predator coding v. 5.0. The GS Promaster looks much like the regular Promaster with a different \\"tail\\" design. It was going to be produced as a Private Label, but ICD decided not to proceed with the project. Greg Schutte owns the only existing GS Promaster. The Naughty Dogs Promaster was made for and tested by the Naughty Dogs. Only a couple of these models were made, and the model was not put into production.

Football career From Collingwood Tech, Fothergill was a gifted sportsman who made his VFL debut aged 16, for the Collingwood Football Club in 1937. Fothergill was a small midfielder/half- forward who seemed too small at the start, at 172 cm and 73 kg, but his brilliance as a footballer was something that over-shadowed his liabilities. Fothergill made an impact straight away as he played brilliant football, winning a Copeland Trophy as Collingwood's best and fairest in his debut season, and kicking 56 goals being the club's leading goalkicker. In 1938, Fothergill was once again a dominant member of the side, winning his second consecutive Copeland Trophy at the age of 18, and two years later, in 1940, Fothergill won win his third Copeland Trophy. Also in 1940, Fothergill and South Melbourne player Herbie Matthews tied for first place in Brownlow Medal voting as best and fairest in the VFL, with a then-record 32 votes; at the time, neither player won the Brownlow Medal itself, as their records could not be separated on countback and there was no provision for a shared medal, but both men were awarded Brownlow Medals in 1989 when the VFL decided to retrospectively eliminate the countback from the award. =Switch to Williamstown and war service= In 1941, Fothergill went to Victorian Football Association (VFA) club Williamstown without receiving a clearance from the VFL, as many other high-profile League players had done during the VFA's throw-pass era. In his sole season with Williamstown, he won the Recorder Cup and VFA Medal as best and fairest in the VFA, polling a record 62 votes and winning by a huge margin of 29 votes. He had signed with Williamstown until the end of 1944, but when VFA competition was suspended from 1942 until 1944 due to World War II, his career at Williamstown came to an end. He joined the army in 1942, and was forced to move on after a knee injury when in Darwin, Northern Territory. =Return to Collingwood= In 1945, Fothergill returned to the VFL ‚Äì back at Collingwood, having never formally been cleared from the club. He dominated at half-forward for the club again, despite being slower and having injury problems. He kicked 62 goals in 45 games after the war, and he was the VFL's leading goalkicker in the 1946 home-and-home season, although he ultimately finished second for the League's Leading Goalkicker Medal after his total was passed in the finals by Essendon's Bill Brittingham. He was forced to retire in 1947 due to a leg injury. Fothergill was named in the Collingwood Team of the Century, and was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 2000. The award for the best young player in the modern Victorian Football League (which is the successor to the former VFA) is named the Fothergill-Round Medal in honour of Fothergill and Barry Round. Cricket career Fothergill was also an accomplished cricketer, playing cricket in the summer throughout his football career. He played 27 first-class cricket matches for Victoria, making 1404 runs at 39.00 with one century. He made his hundred against South Australia in 1947 and once made 99 against the Australian Services XI. He played district cricket for Northcote, appearing in 149 matches between 1935‚Äì36 and 1952‚Äì53 with strong all-round performances, averaging 41.05 with the bat and taking 122 wickets at 27.35 with the ball. After retiring from football, Fothergill moved to England and played for the Enfield Cricket Club in the Lancashire League in 1949 and 1950.

Haliburton received his education at St Salvator's College, St Andrews, obtaining a Master of Arts on 12 June 1652, and a Doctorate in Divinity in 1673. Between his two degrees, he was made minister of Coupar Angus in 1659, and was Archdeacon of Dunkeld by the summer of 1663. After obtaining his doctorate, he served as moderator of the Presbytery of Meigle from 1678 until he became Bishop of Brechin, receiving consecration as bishop on 13 June 1678. The latter encompassed the roles of provost and minister of Brechin, but nevertheless George remained minister of Coupar Angus. On 22 June 1682, Haliburton was selected to move to the larger diocese of Aberdeen, and was translated as Bishop of Aberdeen on 5 July 1682. Unlike most members of the Church of Scotland, Haliburton supported episcopacy, and was an active persecutor of the Quakers. In 1688, after the Glorious Revolution, episcopacy was defeated in Scotland and all Church of Scotland bishops were deprived of their sees, including Haliburton. Haliburton was formally deprived of his bishopric on 22 July 1689. Haliburton moved to Newtyle parish in Angus, assisting the work of an episcopal minister there until the Church of Scotland forcibly took over control of it in 1698. He then retired to his own residence at nearby Halton, and received a pension in the following year. Haliburton became increasingly sympathetic towards Jacobitism and ordained clergy, working closely with re-established episcopalian bishops and archbishops, though the latter often did not inform him about the secret consecrations of new bishops which were taking place. He moved to Denhead in 1710. He died at Halton on 29 September 1715. Twenty days earlier he had attended the raising of the standard of the Old Pretender at Fetteresso, the act which initiated the First Jacobite rising.

In addition to the hydrogen bond criteria used by the more common DSSP algorithm, the STRIDE assignment criteria also include dihedral angle potentials. As such, its criteria for defining individual secondary structures are more complex than those of DSSP. The STRIDE energy function contains a hydrogen-bond term containing a Lennard- Jones-like 8-6 distance-dependent potential and two angular dependence factors reflecting the planarity of the optimized hydrogen bond geometry. The criteria for individual secondary structural elements, which are divided into the same groups as those reported by DSSP, also contain statistical probability factors derived from empirical examinations of solved structures with visually assigned secondary structure elements extracted from the Protein Data Bank. Although DSSP is the older method and continues to be the most commonly used, the original STRIDE definition reported it to give a more satisfactory structural assignment in at least 70% of cases. In particular, STRIDE was observed to correct for the propensity of DSSP to assign shorter secondary structures than would be assigned by an expert crystallographer, usually due to the minor local variations in structure that are most common near the termini of secondary structure elements.Frishman D, Argos P. (1995). Knowledge-based protein secondary structure assignment. Proteins 23(4):566-79.

He forged the important alliance with the Kievan Rus against the Mongols but was ultimately defeated by them at the Kalka River. After the Mongol victory in 1238, K√∂ten led 40,000 \\"huts\\" to Hungary, where he became an ally of the Hungarian king and accepted Catholicism, but was nonetheless assassinated by the Hungarian nobility. Name K√∂ten, known as K√∂t√∂ny in Hungarian and Kotjan (or Kotyan) in Russian, had his name spelt variously as Kutan (in Arabic), Kuthen, Kuthens, Koteny and Kuethan. In the Russian annals, his name is rendered (Kotyan Sutoevich, Kotjan Sutoeviƒç). In a charter of B√©la IV, a Cuman chieftain Zayhan or Seyhan is mentioned, assumed to have been K√∂ten.[(Hungarian) Krist√≥, Gyula; Makk, Ferenc (1996). Az √Årp√°d-h√°z uralkod√≥i [Rulers of the House of √Årp√°d]. I.P.C. K√∂nyvek. ], p. 268 Life An Arabic source calls his people Kipchaks; Kutan is mentioned as belonging to the Durut tribe of the Kipchaks. According to Pritsak, \\"Durut\\" was the Terter tribe of the Cumans. According to Timothy May, K√∂ten was one of the khans of the Kipchaks. Istv√°n V√°s√°ry identified him as Cuman. In either case, the two peoples were part of the Cuman‚ÄìKipchak confederation, known as Cumania in Latin, Desht-i Qipchaq in Islamic sources (from Turkic), and Polovtsy in East Slavic. K√∂ten forged an alliance with the Kievan Rus against the Mongols (also called Tatars) after a defeat in 1222. The Cuman‚ÄìKipchak confederation under K√∂ten and a Rus army of 80,000 men under his son-in-law Mstislav the Bold fought a battle at the Kalka River (Kalchik, near Mariupol) against a Mongol contingent commanded by Jebe and S√ºb√∂t√§i. The Rus-Cuman army was routed and had to retreat on 31 May 1223. K√∂ten was deposed from power in that year, but he remained leader of the Terteroba clan. In the early spring of 1237, the Mongols attacked the Cuman-Kipchaks. Some of the Cuman-Kipchaks surrendered; it was this element that was later to form the ethnic and geographic basis of the Mongol khanate known to the former lords of the country as the \\"Kipchak khanate\\". Known also as the Golden Horde, the Kipchak khanate belonged to one of the branches of Jochi's house -Genghis Khan's eldest son. The Kipchak leader Baƒçman was captured in 1236‚Äì37 on the Volga banks by M√∂ngke, and then executed. According to Rashid-al-Din Hamadani, Berke led a third campaign in 1238 which inflicted final defeat on the Cumans- Kipchaks. Ukrainian sources claim that it was Batu Khan that defeated K√∂ten on the Astrakhan steppes. Afterwards, K√∂ten led 40,000 \\"huts\\" (families, around 70-80,000 people) to Hungary fleeing the Mongols. In Hungary, K√∂ten allied himself with Bela IV of Hungary, who gave the Cuman‚ÄìKipchak refugees asylum. K√∂ten converted to Roman Catholicism, being baptised in 1239 as Jonas, while his daughter Elizabeth married Bela's son, the future Stephen V. The Hungarian nobles, however, distrusted the Cuman-Kipchaks (possibly believing they were Mongol spies) and just prior to the disastrous Mongol invasion which led to the rout of Mohi, they had K√∂ten assassinated in Pest.The murder of K√∂ten is described in the novel ‚ÄúBatu‚Äù by Vasily Yan, in the chapter ‚ÄúThe End of Khan Kotyan‚Äù. The Cumans then left Hungary, pillaging along the way and emigrated to the Second Bulgarian Empire. Some of the Cumans were later called back to Hungary. Terter dynasty The enraged Cuman-Kipchak masses began to plunder the countryside, and moved southwards in the country. They crossed the Danube and reached Syrmia (called Marchia by Rogerius). After causing much destruction and havoc in Hungary, they left the country for Bulgaria. There is a hypothesis that the Terter dynasty, which eventually ruled Bulgaria, descended from K√∂ten's clan.

Early life and migration Challis was born in England, the son of John Henry Challis, sergeant in the 9th Regiment, and his first wife. He was educated at several schools and trained as a clerk. He then migrated to Sydney, New South Wales, arriving on the Pyramis on 9 May 1829 as a steerage passenger. He was employed by Marsden and Flower, merchants. In 1842 the firm was reorganized under the name of Flower, Salting and Company, when Challis was admitted as a junior partner. The business dealt in wool, whale oil other commodities and became very prosperous. He acquired several properties, including a large holding at Potts Point, pastoral licenses of over 12,000 sq. miles (31,080 km¬≤) in southern New South Wales, more than 3,500 cattle and 11,000 sheep. In 1855 he sold his business interests and returned to England. Returning to Europe, Challis spent much of his time travelling. Sydney University bequest In 1856 Challis subscribed for stained glass windows in the Great Hall of the University of Sydney; in 1859 he re-visited Sydney and gave for the 'Royal Window'. Challis died in France on 28 February 1880 and was buried at Folkestone, England. Under his will the whole of his residuary estate was left to the University of Sydney, subject to a tenure until death or remarriage of his widow Henrietta, and a provision that the estate should accumulate for five years after such death or remarriage. Henrietta died on 19 September 1884 and because Challis had been residing in England, the English Inland Revenue Commission claimed legacy duties. The University of Sydney's chancellor, Sir William Montagu Manning, strenuously argued against the Commission's claims which were subsequently abandoned. In 1890 a sum of about was handed to the University Senate, which 50 years later, partly by increases in value of land and the falling off of annuities, had increased to . The income from the fund has provided for seven professorships (in anatomy, zoology, engineering, history, law, modern literature, and logic and mental philosophy) and several lectureships. The bequest, however, meant more than that. When it was made public it created much interest in the University, the Senate adopted an extended scheme of teaching, and the government increased the amount of the annual grant by . The University also developed a property in Martin Place, subsequently named Challis House. Completed in 1907 and remodelled in the Art Deco style in 1936 and again refurbished in 1973, the commercial premises provides income to sustain Challis' legacy. A portrait of Challis is in the Great Hall of the University, and there is also a marble statue of him by Achille Simonetti. References =Bibliography= * *David S.

Thomas Penn was born in Bristol, England after his father returned there in 1701 because of financial difficulties. Thomas Penn's mother was his father's second wife, Hannah Callowhill Penn (1671‚Äì1726), daughter of Thomas Callowhill. Life Penn inherited the position of Proprietor of the Colony of Pennsylvania for the British Crown in 1718 along with his brothers John and Richard on the death of their father William Penn, until 1746 when John died. Thomas continued as the Proprietor with Richard's son, John, and his own son John Penn until 1775. He tried to bring his family out of the debt that had plagued his father. He asserted his independence from the Quakers, and tried to assert his control of the colony almost as a feudal lord. On May 12, 1732 Thomas with his brothers John and Richard, as the proprietors of Pennsylvania, signed an order to create a commission. This order was directed to Governor Gordon, Isaac Norris, Samuel Preston, James Logan, and Andrew Hamilton, Esquires, and to the gentlemen James Steel and Robert Charles. The commission, which was to be made up of at least three or more of these individuals, was given full power on behalf of the proprietors for the ‚Äúrunning, marking, and laying out‚Äù of any boundary between Pennsylvania and Maryland. This was in accordance to the agreement signed between the Penn brothers and Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore on May 10, 1732. Penn arrived in Pennsylvania in August, 1732, and organized the purchase of some of the lands at the outskirts of the Pennsylvania colony. He met with some of the local Indian chiefs and tried to keep the peace as immigrants poured into the countryside north and west of Philadelphia on the Susquehanna, Schuylkill, and Delaware Rivers. Many of the Indians did not want to sell their land, and had not heard of William Penn's 1686 treaty. Finally in 1737 Acting Governor James Logan convinced several Indian Chiefs to confirm the 1686 deed, which gave the Penns the land west of the Delaware River to the extent that a man could walk in a day and a half. Logan hired several men to walk the measure, but they walked west at a very fast pace and the Indians felt cheated. Logan and the Penn sons including Thomas were later criticized by some for this \\"Walking Purchase\\" and their questionable treatment of the Indians. Part of the difficulty lay in the conflict with the French who laid claim on the back country west of Pennsylvania and the ensuing hostilities of King George's War (1744‚Äì1748) and the French and Indian War (1754‚Äì1763). Penn lobbied against Quaker efforts to make peace with the Iroquois and Algonquian tribes some of whom were allied with the French. The proprietor Penn brothers sold much of their western lands to European settlers, who did not know of the controversy and as a result, may have become resentful of the proprietors. Penn tried to stop the introduction of Roman Catholicism in the colony. In 1733 a Catholic chapel was built in Philadelphia, and in 1734 Penn attempted to suppress the movement, but the Quaker-led legislative assembly protected the rights of Catholics to worship and build churches. Penn visited the countryside of Pennsylvania to look for sites to establish towns and county seats. He appointed surveyors for the colony and for the \\"Lower Counties\\" which became Delaware, including Joshua Fisher, a prominent merchant in Lewes at the mouth of Delaware Bay. On one occasion in 1739, Penn visited the future site of Reading, Pennsylvania, where he found only one cabin. As Proprietor he realized the site would be good for the layout of a county seat because it sat in the Schuylkill River valley with hills nearby. Although he never returned to the site, the knowledge he gained on this visit was helpful later when he drew up the plan for Reading. He planned the street map and the water system, and helped surveyors and land agents with suggestions about the sale of lots, from which he stood to profit. Penn took the name from Reading, Berkshire, England and established the town in 1748, and on creation of Berks County in 1752, Reading became county seat. Arthur Devis, 1752) Penn returned to England and in 1751 joined the Church of England and married Lady Juliana Fermor, the daughter of Thomas Fermor, 1st Earl of Pomfret and Henrietta Louisa Jeffreys.Person Page 3610. Thepeerage.com (2008-12-02). Retrieved on 2013-07-15. He did not hold many of the beliefs of the Quakers who had come to Pennsylvania, and lived the life of an aristocrat who had taken from the poor, identifiably different from his Quaker father who had tried to purchase land fairly from the Indians and live a life of peace. The politics of the colony were complex, with the Quaker population declining and the legislature increasingly at odds with its proprietor. In 1756, Penn attempted to remove the Quakers from power in the colony by having a petition granted by Parliament that would require an oath of loyalty in all colonial legislative assemblies. Because the Quakers never took oaths, they would be banned from power. The attempt failed and the colonial Quakers remained free of any oaths to Parliament. Penn sent his nephew John Penn to govern the colony in 1763. The new governor faced many problems: Pontiac's Rebellion, disputes over the Penn family lands and taxation, and efforts of Pennsylvanians led by Benjamin Franklin to have the Penn proprietary government replaced with a royal government. Thomas Penn died in England on March 21, 1775, soon before the American Revolution brought an end to the Penn family's control of Pennsylvania.

The water tanks, built between 1912 and 1918, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places because they represent the historical period of community planning, public works, and engineering that supported the development of the Cuyuna Range. Their construction was made possible by a favorable property tax arrangement on the iron mines that brought significant revenues to the towns of Crosby, Cuyuna, Deerwood, Ironton, and Trommald. The communities began around 1910, when iron mining started on the Range. The peak of mining employment was around 1920, and it started to decline around 1930. By the 1950s, iron mining was well in decline on the Cuyuna Range. State historian Theodore C. Blegen wrote, > A singular aspect of range-town life was the blossoming of schools, > community buildings, parks, splendid streets, and other public improvements > built generously, not to say lavishly. They set standards far beyond those > of most Minnesota cities at the time.

Even the smaller communities were able to install complete water systems. After the end of iron mining, as the communities lost population, many of the publicly funded improvements such as schools have disappeared, and many of the houses have either been torn down or were left abandoned and dilapidated. Within Trommald and Cuyuna, the water towers are the most visible remains of the mining boom years.

He was educated at Aldenham school, Hertfordshire and at Jesus College, Cambridge where he graduated B.A. in 1881. He was also a keen cricketer. Career Migrating to Australia (arriving on the Potosi on 19 February 1882) Carter was made assistant mathematics master at Sydney Grammar School, later becoming senior mathematics master. In 1902 he became principal of Ascham girls' school until 1914. During World War I, Carter became a founding member of the executive committee of the Australian branch of the British Red Cross Society. Carter became interested in the study of the Coleoptera (beetles and weevils), he joined the Linnean Society of New South Wales and was a member of its council from 1920‚Äì1939, and its president in 1925-6. He was joint editor of The Australian Encyclopaedia which was published in 1925-6. He was able to obtain the help of the leading scientists of Australia and their articles formed a large and valuable part of this publication. In his own work Carter gave much attention to matters of synonymy, and published a number of check-lists of the families. He died suddenly at his home at Wahroonga, Sydney on 16 April 1940. Legacy Around fifty of his papers are listed in Musgrave's Bibliography of Australian Entomology 1775-1930, and Carter continued working almost up to the day of his death. He married Antoinette Charlotte Moore in 1882, who pre-deceased him, and was survived by two sons and two daughters. Carter was much esteemed by his scientific colleagues. Many of them are mentioned in his Gulliver in the Bush (1933), a record of his collecting trips in Australia. He was honorary entomologist to the Australian Museum, Sydney, for some years. He disposed of one collection of Coleoptera to the National Museum, Melbourne, and a later collection was given to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research at Canberra.

However, as in the other parts of the Sahaydri Hills, denudation of the forest cover and unregulated government- assisted development are gradually ruining a once-pristine environment. Historically, Amboli village came into being as one of the staging posts along the road from Vengurla port to the city of Belgaum, which was extensively used by the British to supply their garrisons in south and central India. The source of the Hiranyakeshi river lies in the hills around Amboli village, and an ancient Shiva temple (called Hiranyakeshwar) sits at the cave where the water emerges. The main attraction for tourists is the incredibly-high rainfall (7 m average, per year) and the numerous waterfalls and mist during the monsoons. Legend has it that there are 108 Shiva temples in and around Amboli, of which only a dozen have been uncovered, one as recently as 2005. Transport Amboli is well connected by road to the surrounding cities of Kolhapur (), Belgaum , and Panjim () by road, and the nearest airport is at Belgaum Airport.

She is a member of the Pritzker family of Chicago, a wealthy and influential business family. Donald Pritzker was one of the co-founders of Hyatt Hotels. He moved the family to Atherton, California, where business for the Hyatt Hotels began to grow. Penny has two younger brothers, Tony ( 1961) and J. B. Pritzker ( 1965). Young Penny would accompany her father to the hotels and check the cleanliness of the ladies restrooms. In 1972, Don died suddenly of a heart attack when Penny was 13years old. Following Don's death, Sue began battling depression, requiring Penny to at times care for her mother and her younger brothers. At age 16, Penny wrote a letter to her grandfather, and head of the family business empire, A.N. Pritzker, in which she asked why he talked business with the men in the family and not with her. Finally realizing Penny's interest in business, A.N. provided her with a summer course in accounting. Penny attended Castilleja School until 1977. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in economics from Harvard College in 1981. The following year, Penny's mother died after falling out of the passenger side of a tow truck. Penny returned to school, earning both a Juris Doctor and a Masters of Business Administration from Stanford University in 1985.  Pritzker family businesses  = Early ventures = After she earned her degrees, Pritzker joined the Pritzker organization encouraged by her cousin Nick Pritzker. In 1987, she founded Classic Residence by Hyatt, later renamed Vi, upscale housing for seniors as an alternative to nursing homes. The project struggled at first, losing $40million in the first 18months, but turned around after changes in marketing and management. In 1991, Jay Pritzker, Penny's uncle and head of the Pritzker family businesses, named Penny as the director of the Pritzkers' non-hotel landholdings. With that appointment, Penny created the Pritzker Realty Group, which developed apartment buildings, shopping centers, and the Baldwin Park neighborhood in Orlando, Florida. Superior Bank From 1991 to 1994, Penny Pritzker was chairperson of the Hinsdale, Illinois-based Superior Bank of Chicago, in which Jay Pritzker had purchased a 50% stake from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, who had taken over the bank when it failed. In 1993 the bank \\"embarked on a business strategy of significant growth into subprime home mortgages\\", according to a report by the United States Treasury Department. In 2000 it became clear the bank was faltering. In the months leading up to 2001, the Pritzkers tried to work out a recapitalization plan. In July 2001, the FDIC seized the bank after the recapitalization could not be resolved. Subsequently, the Pritzker family reached an agreement with regulators to pay $460million.David Mobert, Breaking the Bank , In These Times November 8, 2002John W. Courtney et al. v. Neal T. Halleren et al. (485 F.3d 942) . Bulk.resource.org. Retrieved on December 4, 2011. According to the FDIC, by 2011 the uninsured depositors of Superior had each received 81% of their uninsured monies, in addition to the $100,000 each previously received of their insured amount. Industry experts have criticized the Pritzkers in regard to Superior. Consumer advocates and government investigators asserted Superior \\"engaged in unsound financial activities and predatory lending practices\\". Responding to the Wall Street Journal, Pritzker noted she had no ownership in the bank, either direct or indirect, and that the bank's reasons for failure \\"were complex, including changes in accounting practices, auditing failures, reversals in regulatory positions and general economic conditions\\". She said the bank complied with \\"fair lending laws\\" and ethical business practices. A 2001 Business Week article described the bank's other owner, Alvin Dworman, as the more dominant partner in its operation as a result of agreements made by Jay Pritzker. Quoted in the New York Times, a Pritzker family friend observed Pritzker was trapped in a deal of her uncle's making: \\"Penny got sucked into this‚Ä¶this was really the legacy of Jay.\\" = Leadership and dissolution = In 1995, Penny was named as one of three successors to the retiring Jay Pritzker besides his son Tom and his cousin Nick. Tom was named the official head of the businesses, Nick and Penny each named vice-chairman. Together, the three were to oversee the Pritzker family assets. Jay intended to keep the family business together, devising a system of trusts that would allow individual family members to receive money from the trusts to meet their needs; however, the family's wealth was to be primarily maintained in the trusts to grow the businesses and fund philanthropic endeavors. The Pritzker business empire contained over 200 businesses and was valued at $15billion. After Jay Pritzker's death in 1999, other Pritzker family members challenged Tom, Nick, and Penny's control of the businesses in multiple lawsuits.The Economist: \\"Jay Pritzker, pioneer of the modern hotel chain, died on January 23rd, aged 76\\" January 28, 1999. Penny's brothers joined in one of the lawsuits. In 2001 Tom, Nick, and Penny decided to sell family assets to allow eleven cousins to receive a share, dissolving the family's business ties. Disentangling the family's business interests took nearly a decade. The family sold its controlling stake in the Marmon Group to Berkshire Hathaway for $4.5billion in 2008. The Pritzker Realty Group sold Parking Spot, an airport parking management business Penny co-founded in 1998, to Green Courte Partners LLC for $360million in 2011. Starting in 2005, she served as non-executive chairman of TransUnion.Prospectus . Sec.gov. Retrieved on August 12, 2013. In 2009, she co-founded Artemis Real Estate Partners LLC, a real estate investment management company, with Deborah Harmon. In 2011, she founded an investment office, PSP Capital Partners. Altogether, Pritzker started five companies before joining the federal government.  Government and political involvement  Pritzker's friendship with Barack Obama and his family dates back to the 1990s when he was a professor at the University of Chicago. Pritzker met Obama at a Chicago YMCA where her son participated in a basketball program coached by Obama's brother-in-law Craig Robinson. Obama and his family were frequent guests at Pritzker's Lake Michigan vacation home. Pritzker was an early supporter of Obama's political career, helping to finance his 2004 Senate campaign. Early in the Democratic presidential primary, Pritzker's financing helped Obama's candidacy survive when Obama was trailing Hillary Clinton in the polls. Pritzker remained a major fundraiser for Obama during the 2008 Democratic primary and raised millions overall for his White House bid. She served as the national finance chair of Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. Under her direction, the campaign reached out to small donors. Pritzker also hosted more lavish fundraisers as part of her effort to raise money. Following Obama's victory in the 2008 presidential election, CNN reported that Pritzker was president-elect Obama's top choice for Commerce Secretary. However, Pritzker took herself out of the running. According to the Chicago Tribune, she withdrew her name from consideration \\"due to obligations to her family, for whom she was still overseeing billions in assets, and the financial crisis, which was putting some of those assets at risk\\". As a result of her public support for President Obama, Pritzker found herself the target of labor groups for Hyatt Hotels' practices. The president of Unite Here cited her connection to Obama as a reason why the group expected her to use better labor practices as the group staged demonstrations against Pritzker. Pritzker was a member of the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. She also served on the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board. Although she was less active in the 2012 Obama campaign than she had been four years prior, she served as national co-chair of Obama for America 2012. She was also on the board of directors of the Council on Foreign Relations, a nonpartisan think tank focused on world affairs and U.S. foreign policy. =Secretary of Commerce= Pritzker with President Barack Obama and Mike Froman in the Oval Office, May 2,2013 Secretary Pritzker addresses international media in Tokyo, October 21,2014 Pritzker was nominated as United States Secretary of Commerce by President Barack Obama on May 2, 2013.Sweet, Lynn (May 2, 2013) \\"Obama nominates Chicago exec Penny Pritzker as commerce secretary\\" , Chicago Sun- Times. Retrieved May 2, 2013. To avoid conflicts of interest, Pritzker agreed to sell her interest in at least 221 companies and resign from 158 entities, including the Hyatt Board of Directors and the Chicago Board of Education. Later that month, on May 23, the Senate held its confirmation hearing, which covered a variety of topics. Although Pritzker's family business dealings had been a target of Republican criticism when Obama announced her nomination, only three questions at the hearing related to her family. Pritzker was confirmed by the full Senate on June 25, by a vote of 97 to 1.Penny Pritzker confirmed as Commerce secretary ‚Äì Dan Berman . Politico (June 26, 2013). Retrieved on August 12, 2013. Pritzker was sworn in as Secretary on June 26, 2013. Among Pritzker's priorities was the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a proposed trade agreement that would have been the \\"largest regional trade agreement in history\\". Pritzker supported the TPP as a way to provide market access to U.S. businesses and as a way for the U.S. to set the standards for trade. Leading up the 2016 presidential election, in which both major party candidates openly opposed the TPP, Pritzker and other Obama officials continued to push for the TPP's passage in Congress. Ultimately, Congress failed to pass the TPP bill. Pritzker named a Digital Economy Board of Advisors, which included tech industry CEOs and academics, to advise on policy. Pritzker also expanded the IP attache program, which helps the tech industry protect their intellectual property abroad. As secretary, Pritzker also created the Commerce Data Advisory Council to identify priorities for the Department of Commerce, a prolific publisher of data intended to allow businesses to plan and innovate. Pritzker served as the lead negotiator for the United States in the E.U.‚ÄìU.S. Privacy Shield, an agreement governing how companies transfer digital data from Europe to the United States. Following President Obama's announcement that the United States would move towards normalizing relations with Cuba, Pritzker traveled to Cuba. Although Obama's change in policy did not end the U.S. trade embargo, since ending the embargo required an act of Congress, Pritzker met with Cuban trade ministers and other officials to discuss the changing relationship between the two countries and to lay the groundwork for more economic involvement. Following her tenure as Secretary, Pritzker returned to PSP and the private sector.  Civic and philanthropic activities  Pritzker is involved in public education. She was a member of the Chicago Board of Education and is past chair of the Chicago Public Education Fund. Pritzker was elected to a six-year term on the Harvard Board of Overseers in 2002. In 2018, she was elected to the President and Fellows of Harvard College, which oversees Harvard University. Pritzker was Advisory Board Chair of Skills for America's Future (SAF), a policy initiative of the Aspen Institute. Pritzker is a former chair of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago. Pritzker and her husband, Bryan Traubert, have their own foundation called the Pritzker Traubert Family Foundation. The foundation focuses on physical activity for young people and increasing economic opportunity in Chicago. Among their initiatives were a $5million donation to converting grass soccer fields to easier-to-maintain turf and a $1million donation to repair tennis courts around Chicago. The Pritzkers also established ChicagoRun, a program that prepares Chicago-area children to run their first 5k race. In 2012 Chicago magazine named her one of the 100 most powerful Chicagoans. On March 26, 2014, Elle honored Pritzker, with others, at the Italian Embassy in the United States during its annual \\"Women in Washington Power List\\". In February 2018, Pritzker was elected to succeed Harvey V. Fineberg as chairperson of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, taking effect May 2018. In March 2020, Pritzer set up the Illinois COVID-19 Response Fund, to assist non-profit organizations during the COVID-19 pandemic, after receiving a call from her brother, Illinois Governor J. B. Pritzker. The siblings announced the creation of the fund with $23 million in start up money on March 24, 2020, six days after Governor Pritzker's request. Pritzker and her husband contributed $1.5 million of the initial sum.  Personal life  In the 1980s, Pritzker completed her first Ironman Triathlon in Hawaii. Pritzker trained for six months and ultimately finished the race in 12hours. In addition to competing in triathlons, Pritzker has also run marathons. Pritzker is married to ophthalmologist Bryan Traubert, with whom she has two children. Although her relationship with her brothers became strained following the family business restructuring, they eventually reconciled, and Penny expressed support for the idea of younger brother J.B. running for office in 2017.

Early life Don Munday was born and educated in Portage la Prairie, Manitoba and moved to Vancouver, British Columbia with his family in 1909. In World War I, he served in France with the 47th Battalion. Marriage Don met Phyllis in 1918. While on a mountaineering trip an incident occurred which, in Don's words, \\"lends itself readily to being given a romantic aspect.\\"Munday p 1 Don lost his footing on a glacial moraine, and was in danger of slipping into a crevasse. Phyllis jumped to help him restore his balance, and in so doing lost hers. Don managed to grab and steady her until she could regain her feet. They married in February 1920, spending their honeymoon in a cabin on Dam Mountain near Vancouver. Their daughter, Edith was born in 1921, and at 11 weeks she was carried to the top of Crown Mountain. From 1923 to 1926 the Mundays lived in a tent, and then a cabin on Grouse Mountain where Don worked cutting a trail from Lonsdale Avenue in North Vancouver to the summit, while Phyllis ran the Alpine Lodge, serving hot drinks and meals to hikers. Discovery of the Waddington Range In 1925, while on a trip to Mount Arrowsmith, Vancouver Island, Don and Phyllis Munday spotted what they believed to be a peak taller than Mount Robson, the then accepted tallest peak entirely within British Columbia.

A western spoof directed by Norman Taurog, this was the next-to-last of the 16 musical comedy film collaborations between Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis before their breakup. The cast also included Agnes Moorehead, Lori Nelson and Jackie Loughery. Plot Masked raiders led by Sam Hollis attack the \\"K\\" Ranch, where owner Wade Kingsley and partner Slim Mosley bravely defend their property after Matilda Kingsley and infant son Wade Jr. safely return east to New York, her hometown. Wade and Slim (played by Martin and Lewis) are murdered, but vow before they die that their sons someday will avenge them. Many years later, the wealthy Matilda receives a visit from her niece Carol and cowboy Slim Mosley, Jr. (Dean Martin again), who has come to New York City to compete in a rodeo. They intend to use Slim's earnings to buy a prized bull called Cuddles and take him back west to replenish the K Ranch's stock. Sweet but inept Wade, Jr. (Jerry Lewis again) has always wanted to be a cowboy. He goes to the rodeo, where his bungling interference costs Slim first prize. To make amends, Wade buys the bull for Slim and accompanies them back west by train. After a while, Slim warms to Wade and agrees to become partners, like their dads. Out west, to keep townsfolk from mocking the tenderfoot, Slim decides to introduce Wade to one and all as \\"Killer Jones,\\" a tough hombre. Due to his heroic actions in stopping a runaway stagecoach, with Slim performing the actual heroics, Wade ends up being elected sheriff, impressing dance hall girl Dolly Riley. Ranch hand Pete Rio is secretly working with banker Dan Hollis, who is every bit as corrupt as his father was. Dan's got his eyes on the K Ranch so he can sell the land to the government, which wants to build a dam. Dan tries proposing marriage to Carol, but she rejects him, so he announces that the bank will begin foreclosure proceedings against the ranch. In disguise, Wade infiltrates the gang of masked raiders. He is caught and bound to a chair, strapped to sticks of dynamite, and when Slim comes to his rescue, Dan Hollis knocks him cold. All seems lost until the boys manage a last-second escape. Dan is dealt with accordingly, after which the pardners and their romantic partners celebrate their success.

It is loosely based on a Bing Crosby film, Rhythm on the Range (1936), which was also directed by Norman Taurog, and it was filmed under the working title of Where Men are Men. During production, Lewis filmed a documentary in 16mm. Four songs by Sammy Cahn and Jimmy van Heusen are featured in the film, including Martin and Lewis performing the title number together. During the weeks Pardners was being filmed, rumors abounded about the impending demise of the Martin and Lewis partnership. So when \\"The End\\" title appears on the screen, Dean and Jerry address the audience and exclaim: \\"We're not ready for 'The End' yet!\\" Then they shoot the letters off the screen with their six-guns. The stars continue to address the audience, addressing one another as \\"Dean\\" and \\"Jer,\\" insisting how much they enjoy making pictures for everybody. Release The same day that this film was released to theaters, Martin and Lewis made their last appearance together as a team, at New York's Copacabana. This film was re-released in 1965 on a double bill with another Martin and Lewis film, Living It Up.

It was the first reference book in Norwegian to have a pronounced class bias, and the first encyclopedia outside of the Soviet Union to be directed specifically at the working class. The publication had a connection with the Norwegian labor movement's goal to spread knowledge among the working and lower class, and in doing so could break the monopoly the middle class had on the dissemination of information in society. They thought that the existing encyclopedias had a middle class bias. The idea of such an encyclopedia came within the group that produced the laborers' magazine Arbeidermagasinet. This magazine was produced from 1927 by members of the Communist Party of Norway (founded 1923). Communist Party member Jakob Friis was hired as chief editor of the encyclopedia in 1930. (description of research project) The work was published by the Arbeidermagasinet's publishing company in six volumes from 1932 to 1936. In addition to Jakob Friis, Trond Hegna worked as editor; from the third volume on, Dagfin Juel worked as a co-editor. The Communist Party was reluctant to the whole project, and the Norwegian Labour Party was negative as well. In April 1933, Arbeidernes Leksikon received a grant from the group Mot Dag, which had formerly been affiliated with the Communist and Labour parties, but now was independent.

Written by Steven T. Seagle, with art by Teddy Kristiansen, it is an autobiographical book that chronicles Seagle's thoughts as he tries to work out a new approach in one of the world's most popular characters, Superman while dealing with the \\"family secret\\" which has come back to the forefront. Plot In a flashback, five year old Steven and his little brother, Dave, are in a hospital where their grandmother soon passes away. Adult Steven narrates how he always thinks about that time, what was said about his grandmother, and about what was muttered concerning the \\"family secret\\" between his parents and the doctors. He also mentions how puzzled he was when he saw the Superman logo as one of the letters on a doctor's examination sheet. This was when he first read a Superman comic to his little brother; this would set up his path into being a comic book writer, but needless to say, he is not a fan of the Man of Steel. In the present, as Steven finishes his current comic book project, his agent calls offering him a job to write Superman. Steven refuses, because he doesn't get the character, but his agent asks him to think about it. Steven narrates one thing he doesn't get about Superman, starting with the costume: he doesn't get why would anyone would wear that, and it makes him think of a kid from his school who wore to escape his outcast life for Halloween, only to wear it in the days after and get bullied for it. He meets with his girlfriend, Lisa, who mentions his mother called her looking for him fearfully. He doesn't tell her the details after he calls her, because he is afraid to talk about the \\"family secret\\" that claimed his grandmother: Huntington's disease. It's also what has made him afraid of having children, despite being told his father doesn't have it, so he and his brother won't. Steven discusses the idea of the outsider, someone in his words people would still notice if he or she were absent in people's everyday lives. Steven meets with his mother to which she reveals his father is missing. These recent events lead back to Steven breaking down Superman: from how flawed the concept of his invulnerability is compared to Achilles, or even the Titanic were until they weren't; which in turn leads to the concept of the fictional Kryptonite, and then back to the real life Huntington's. Steven gets his friend Raphael to take him to his Aunt Sarah's house to search for his missing father, but the house turns out to be abandoned. Afterwards, Steven meets with then-Superman writer Joe Allen, where Joe talks to the cynical Steven the grand design of what makes Superman special, only for Steven to suddenly snap and punch him in the face. With the issue with Huntington's, his father, and hating Superman when he feels he's a fascist, a troubled Steven turns down the job to his editor. But his editor helps clear his head and gives him an extension. Steven thinks of a dream where Superman is naked and locks himself from his home, it happens again the next day but Superman is in full costume while everyone else is naked, but its much worse by comparison because his hidden self is exposed. Steven's issues affect his relationship with Lisa, and when he tries to find courage to talk to her, even imagining himself as Superman, he ends up breaking down and they take a break, leaving Steven alone. Staying in bed for days, he becomes weak until Dave finds him, when he learns of their father's disappearance. They both go out to find him, and using his credit card transactions, they find their father has been at a hospital where their Aunt Sarah is a patient. Steven already knows why before he heads to her room, and sees the grim reality of someone suffering from Huntington's. He is confronted by his angry father who then starts a fight with his own son. It is then that Steven reveals what was said back when his grandmother died: if his father and mother knew about Huntington's in their family, they weren't have had their children in the first place. And that is why Steven's father is angry, because he is ashamed that because it didn't actually skip his generation, he might've passed it onto his sons just by having them. His father stops and breaks down, to which they along with Dave hug, gaining hope that they'll have the strength to confront any obstacle. At long last, because of this, Steven finally gets Superman, and the hope the character brings to his readers and fans. Some time later, Steven has accepted and has been writing Superman. He and Lisa are back together, and things seem to be happy. The last scene is of Steven seeing two kids wondering what's in the sky, a bird or plane. He joins them and says \\"it's Superman\\". Overview Steve T. Seagle was the writer of the Superman title from issue #190 (April 2003) to #200 (February 2004), including Superman 10-Cent Adventure #1 from (March 2003). According to Seagle, he was basically a fill-in writer until Jim Lee came over to do what became Superman: For Tomorrow. Not favoring his work on his run, was when the writer came up with It's a Birdhttps://web.archive.org/web/20061213203134/http://www.ugo.com/channels/comics/features/itsabird/default.asp The book primarily deals with the presence of Huntington's disease in Seagle's family, and the implications of this disease on family dynamics. It also depicts how someone with a mysterious disease in their family might respond to changes in their health or the health of their loved ones. Following that are the discussions on the apparent contradictions in the character of Superman, with one example being Superman's relationship with those he protects. Seagle makes mention of Superman's role as protector of the people, but he sees this more as an example of imposing a lifestyle on people against their will, something more akin to fascism. Other meditations on Superman include his approach to power, justice, alienation, and escape. This ultimately leads to the parallels between the \\"alien\\" nature of Huntington's and Superman's alien origins and impact on earth. But Seagle also depicts the need to accept something, regardless of whether we understand it or not. In the end, the book, while discussing the changing understanding of Superman and his implications in the modern world, also begins to re-imagine these implications. It advances a fresh understanding of what being \\"super\\" really means. Teddy Kristiansen won an Eisner Award for his work on It's a Bird in 2005, in the category of Best Painter/Multimedia Artist (Interior).

It is used by hunters and target shooters, mainly in the United States. The shotgun is commonly referred to simply as the Xtrema2. The shotgun is found in several variants, depending on barrel length, barrel type, and factory-installed camouflage exterior. Overview The Xtrema was released in mid-2004, to answer the call from hunters and target shooters for a complete do-all shotgun. Beretta's goal was to produce a shotgun that could reliably fire 2¬æ‚Äù loaded with light target loads all the way through the 3¬Ω‚Äù super magnum round without any modification or settings to be dealt with. They decided to take the AL391-Xtrema, and update it to fit their needs. They also wanted to add as many recoil reduction features as possible to the shotgun to increase follow-up shot accuracy while target shooting and hunting. Technical advantages The Xtrema2 had several features that were designed to increase accuracy and reliability. For one, Beretta decided to strip away as many o-rings and springs as possible for less chance of wear, and also to make easier for the weapon to be field stripped without the accidental loss of parts. They chose to go with a gas-operated action instead of inertia-driven action. Another advantage is in the over- bored barrel design, which reduces muzzle jump and also improves shot- patterns. Beretta also redesigned their stock choke system by increasing the length of the choke inside the barrel for a more gradual constriction, without having to add to the length of the barrel like after-market choke tubes do. They then also chose to take the time-proven technology of hydraulic shock absorption from car-manufactures and put it in the gun's stock for up to 44% felt recoil reduction at the shoulder. Beretta also saw the need for the gun to be protected from the elements so as to protect the gun in harsh hunting conditions such as water-fowl hunting, where salt spray can damage a gun within hours. Beretta's answer to this need was to coat the gun's working parts in a micro-thin membrane which completely protects the metal (which are not made from stainless steel, chromium, or aluminum) from corrosion while out in the field. Other improvements include an extra long barrel tang (the part of the barrel that fits into the receiver, and is actually behind the chamber) to more accurately fix the barrel to the receiver in order to increase accuracy when using slugs with a scope fixed to the receiver. Stock spacers are also available to change the length of pull without major modification. Synthetic stock equipped with the KO (kick-off) recoil reduction module adds about 1‚Äù to the overall length of pull (LOP). LOP for synthetic stock with KO is 14 ¬º‚Äù which cannot be shortened.

It was the first isolated member of the transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor proteins that in turn are a sub-family of the transient receptor potential protein group. This protein is a member of the TRPV group of transient receptor potential family of ion channels. The function of TRPV1 is detection and regulation of body temperature. In addition, TRPV1 provides a sensation of scalding heat and pain (nociception). In primary afferent sensory neurons, it cooperates with TRPA1 (a chemical irritant receptor) to mediate the detection of noxious environmental stimuli  Function  TRPV1 is a nonselective cation channel that may be activated by a wide variety of exogenous and endogenous physical and chemical stimuli. The best-known activators of TRPV1 are: temperature greater than ; acidic conditions; capsaicin (the irritating compound in hot chili peppers); and allyl isothiocyanate, the pungent compound in mustard and wasabi. The activation of TRPV1 leads to a painful, burning sensation. Its endogenous activators include: low pH (acidic conditions), the endocannabinoid anandamide, N-oleyl-dopamine, and N-arachidonoyl-dopamine. TRPV1 receptors are found mainly in the nociceptive neurons of the peripheral nervous system, but they have also been described in many other tissues, including the central nervous system. TRPV1 is involved in the transmission and modulation of pain (nociception), as well as the integration of diverse painful stimuli. = Sensitization = The sensitivity of TRPV1 to noxious stimuli, such as high temperatures, is not static. Upon tissue damage and the consequent inflammation, a number of inflammatory mediators, such as various prostaglandins and bradykinin, are released. These agents increase the sensitivity of nociceptors to noxious stimuli. This manifests as an increased sensitivity to painful stimuli (hyperalgesia) or pain sensation in response to non-painful stimuli (allodynia). Most sensitizing pro-inflammatory agents activate the phospholipase C pathway. Phosphorylation of TRPV1 by protein kinase C have been shown to play a role in sensitization of TRPV1. The cleavage of PIP2 by PLC-beta can result in disinhibition of TRPV1 and, as a consequence, contribute to the sensitivity of TRPV1 to noxious stimuli. = Desensitization = Upon prolonged exposure to capsaicin, TRPV1 activity decreases, a phenomenon called desensitization. Extracellular calcium ions are required for this phenomenon, thus influx of calcium and the consequential increase of intracellular calcium mediate this effect. Various signaling pathways such as calmodulin and calcineurin, and the decrease of PIP2, have been implicated in desensitization of TRPV1. Desensitization of TRPV1 is thought to underlie the paradoxical analgesic effect of capsaicin.  Clinical significance  = Peripheral nervous system = As a result of its involvement in nociception, TRPV1 has been a target for the development of pain reducers (analgesics). Three major strategies have been used: = TRPV1 Use = The TRPV1 receptor is useful to be able to measure how an organism can sense temperature change. In the lab the receptor may be removed from mice giving them the inability to detect differences in ambient temperature. In the pharmaceutical field this allows for the blocking of heat receptors giving patients with inflammatory disorders or severe burning pains a chance to heal without the pain. The lack of the TRPV1 receptor gives a glimpse into the developing brain as heat can kill most organisms in large enough doses, so this removal process shows researchers how the inability to sense heat may be detrimental to the survivability of an organism and then translate this to human heat disorders. = Antagonists = Antagonists block TRPV1 activity, thus reducing pain. Identified antagonists include the competitive antagonist capsazepine and the non-competitive antagonist ruthenium red. These agents could be useful when applied systemically. Numerous TRPV1 antagonists have been developed by pharmaceutical companies. TRPV1 antagonists have shown efficacy in reducing nociception from inflammatory and neuropathic pain models in rats. This provides evidence that TRPV1 is capsaicin's sole receptor In humans, drugs acting at TRPV1 receptors could be used to treat neuropathic pain associated with multiple sclerosis, chemotherapy, or amputation, as well as pain associated with the inflammatory response of damaged tissue, such as in osteoarthritis. These drugs can affect body temperature (hyperthermia) which is a challenge to therapeutic application. For example, a transient temperature gain (~1 ¬∞C for a duration of approximately 40 minutes, reverting to baseline by 40 minutes) was measured in rats with the application of TRPV1 antagonist AMG9810. The role of TRPV1 in the regulation of body temperature has emerged in the last few years. Based on a number of TRPV-selective antagonists' causing a mild increase in body temperature (hyperthermia), it was proposed that TRPV1 is tonically active in vivo and regulates body temperature by telling the body to \\"cool itself down\\". Without these signals, the body overheats. Likewise, this explains the propensity of capsaicin (a TRPV1 agonist) to cause sweating (i.e.: a signal to reduce body temperature). In a recent report, it was found that tonically active TRPV1 channels are present in the viscera and keep an ongoing suppressive effect on body temperature. Recently, it was proposed that predominant function of TRPV1 is body temperature maintenance. Experiments have shown that TRPV1 blockade increases body temperature in multiple species, including rodents and humans, suggesting that TRPV1 is involved in body temperature maintenance. In 2008, AMG 517, a highly selective TRPV1 antagonist was dropped out of clinical trials due to the causation of hyperthermia (~38.3 ¬∞C mean increase which was most intense on day 1 but was attenuated on days 2-7. A second molecule, SB-705498, was also evaluated in the clinic but its effect on body temperature was not reported. As we increase understanding of modality specific agonism of TRPV1 it seems that next generation therapeutics targeting TRPV1 have the potential to side-step hyperthermia. Moreover, for at least two indications or approaches this may be a secondary issue. Where the therapeutic approach (e.g., in analgesia) is agonist-mediated desensitization then the hyperthermic effects of effects of antagonists may not be relevant. Secondarily in applications such as TRPV1 antagonism for the treatment of severe conditions such as heart failure, then there may be an acceptable trade-off with mild hyperthermia, although no hyperthermia was observed in rodent models of heart failure treated with BCTC, SB366791 or AMG9810. Post translational modification of TRPV1 protein by its phosphorylation is critical for its functionality. Rent reports published from NIH suggest that Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of TRPV1 is required for its ligand-induced channel opening. = Agonists = TRPV1 is activated by numerous agonists from natural sources.Boonen, Brett; Startek, Justyna B.; Talavera, Karel (2016-01-01). Chemical Activation of Sensory TRP Channels. Topics in Medicinal Chemistry. Springer Berlin Heidelberg. pp. 1‚Äì41. doi:10.1007/7355_2015_98. Agonists such as capsaicin and resiniferatoxin activate TRPV1 and, upon prolonged application, cause TRPV1 activity to decrease (desensitization), leading to alleviation of pain via the subsequent decrease in the TRPV1 mediated release of inflammatory molecules following exposures to noxious stimuli. Agonists can be applied locally to the painful area in various forms, generally as a patch or an ointment. Numerous capsaicin-containing creams are available over the counter, containing low concentrations of capsaicin (0.025 - 0.075%). It is debated whether these preparations actually lead to TRPV1 desensitization; it is possible that they act via counter-irritation. Novel preparations containing higher capsaicin concentration (up to 10%) are under clinical trials. Eight percent capsaicin patches have recently become available for clinical use, with supporting evidence demonstrating that a 30-minute treatment can provide up to 3 months analgesia by causing regression of TRPV1-containing neurons in the skin. Currently, these treatments must be re- administered on a regular (albeit infrequent) schedule in order to maintain their analgesic effects.  Fatty acid metabolites  Certain metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids have been shown to stimulate cells in a TRPV1-dependent fashion. The metabolites of linoleic acid, including 13(S)-hydroxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid (13(S)-HODE), 13(R)-hydroxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid (13(R)-HODE, 9(S)-hydroxy-10(E),12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid (9(S)-HODE), 9(R)-hydroxy-10(E),12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid (9(R)-HODE), and their respective keto analogs, 13-oxoODE and 9-oxoODE (see 13-HODE and 9-HODE sections on Direct actions), activate peripheral and central mouse pain sensing neurons. Reports disagree on the potencies of these metabolites with, for example, the most potent one, 9(S)-HODE, requiring at least 10 micromoles/liter. or a more physiological concentration of 10 nanomoles/liter to activate TRPV1 in rodent neurons. The TRPV1-dependency of these metabolites' activities appears to reflect their direct interaction with TPRV1. Although relatively weak agonists of TRPV1 in comparison to anandamide, these linoleate metabolites have been proposed to act through TRPV1 in mediating pain perception in rodents and to cause injury to airway epithelial cells and thereby to contribute to asthma disease in mice and therefore possibly humans. Certain arachidonic acid metabolites, including 20-hydroxy-5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid (see 20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid) and 12(S)-hydroperoxy-5Z,8Z,10E,12S,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid (12(S)-HpETE), 12(S)-hydroxy-5Z,8Z,10E,12S,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid (12(S)-HETE (see 12-HETE), hepoxilin A3 (i.e. 8R/S-hydroxy-11,12-oxido-5Z,9E,14Z-eicosatrienoic acid) and HxB3 (i.e. 10R/S-hydroxy-11,12-oxido-5Z,8Z,14Z-eicosatrienoic acid) likewise activate TRPV1 and may thereby contribute to tactile hyperalgesia and allodynia (see Hepoxilin#Pain perception). Studies with mice, guinea pig, and human tissues and in guinea pigs indicate that another arachidonic acid metabolite, Prostaglandin E2, operates through its prostaglandin EP3 G protein coupled receptor to trigger cough responses. Its mechanism of action involves activation and/or sensitization of TRPV1 (as well as TRPA1) receptors, presumably by an indirect mechanism. Genetic polymorphism in the EP3 receptor (rs11209716), has been associated with ACE inhibitor-induced cough in humans. Resolvin E1 (RvE1), RvD2 (see resolvins), neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1), and maresin 1 (Mar1) are metabolites of the omega 3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (for RvE1) or docosahexaenoic acid (for RvD2, NPD1, and Mar1). These metabolites are members of the specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs) class of metabolites that function to resolve diverse inflammatory reactions and diseases in animal models and, it is proposed, humans. These SPMs also dampen pain perception arising from various inflammation-based causes in animal models. The mechanism behind their pain-dampening effects involves the inhibition of TRPV1, probably (in at least certain cases) by an indirect effect wherein they activate other receptors located on the neurons or nearby microglia or astrocytes. CMKLR1, GPR32, FPR2, and NMDA receptors have been proposed to be the receptors through which these SPMs operate to down-regulate TRPV1 and thereby pain perception.  Fatty acid conjugates  N-Arachidonoyl dopamine, an endocannabinoid found in the human CNS, structurally similar to capsaicin, activates the TRPV1 channel with an EC50 of approximately of 50 nM. N-Oleyl-dopamine, another endogenous agonist, binds to human VR1 with an Ki of 36 Nm. Another endocannabinoid anandamide has also been shown to act on TRPV1 receptors. AM404‚Äîan active metabolite of paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen) ‚Äîthat serves as an anandamide reuptake inhibitor and COX inhibitor also serves as a potent TRPV1 agonist. The plant-biosynthesized cannabinoid cannabidiol also shows \\"either direct or indirect activation\\" of TRPV1 receptors. TRPV1 colocalizes with CB1 receptors and CB2 receptors in sensory and brain neurons respectively, and other plant- cannabinoids like CBN, CBG, CBC, THCV, and CBDV are also agonists of this ion channel. There is also evidence that non cannabinoid components of the Cannabis secondary metabolome such as Myrcene activate TRPV1. = Central nervous system = TRPV1 is also expressed at high levels in the central nervous system and has been proposed as a target for treatment not only of pain but also for other conditions such as anxiety. Furthermore, TRPV1 appears to mediate long-term synaptic depression (LTD) in the hippocampus. LTD has been linked to a decrease in the ability to make new memories, unlike its opposite long-term potentiation (LTP), which aids in memory formation. A dynamic pattern of LTD and LTP occurring at many synapses provides a code for memory formation. Long-term depression and subsequent pruning of synapses with reduced activity is an important aspect of memory formation. In rat brain slices, activation of TRPV1 with heat or capsaicin induced LTD while capsazepine blocked capsaicin's ability to induce LTD. In the brainstem (solitary tract nucleus), TRPV1 controls the asynchronous and spontaneous release of glutamate from unmyelinated cranial visceral afferents - release processes that are active at normal temperatures and hence quite distinct from TRPV1 responses in painful heat. Hence, there may be therapeutic potential in modulating TRPV1 in the central nervous system, perhaps as a treatment for epilepsy (TRPV1 is already a target in the peripheral nervous system for pain relief).  Interactions  TRPV1 has been shown to interact with: * CALM1, * SNAPAP, and * SYT9. * CBD * AEA *NPR1 *PKG  Discovery  The dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons of mammals were known to express a heat-sensitive ion channel that could be activated by capsaicin. The research group of David Julius, therefore, created a cDNA library of genes expressed in dorsal root ganglion neurons, expressed the clones in HEK 293 cells, and looked for cells that respond to capsaicin with calcium influx (which HEK-293 normally not do). After several rounds of screening and dividing the library, a single clone encoding the TRPV1 channel was finally identified in 1997. It was the first TRPV channel to be identified.

It was first performed on 1 December 1902 for the Danish Concert Association, with Nielsen himself conducting. As indicated in the subtitle, each of its four movements is a musical sketch of a humor of the four temperaments: choleric, phlegmatic, melancholic, and sanguine. Despite its apparent concept of program music, the work is a fully integrated symphony in traditional symphonic structure. Background Nielsen began on the Second Symphony while the work on his first opera, Saul and David was still in progress. The first movement was finished on 28 December 1901 but after this the composition made slow progress. The composer only finished his work at the last moment. The fourth movement is dated 22 November 1902, just a week before the first performance. Nielsen himself describes the background to the symphony in a programme note for a performance at the Konsertf√∂reningen (Concert Society) in Stockholm shortly before he died in 1931. > I had the idea for ‚ÄòThe Four Temperaments‚Äô many years ago at a country inn > in Zealand. On the wall of the room where I was drinking a glass of beer > with my wife and some friends hung an extremely comical coloured picture, > divided into four sections in which ‚Äòthe Temperaments‚Äô were represented and > furnished with titles: ‚ÄòThe Choleric‚Äô, ‚ÄòThe Sanguine‚Äô, ‚ÄòThe Melancholic‚Äô and > ‚ÄòThe Phlegmatic‚Äô. The Choleric was on horseback. He had a long sword in his > hand, which he was wielding fiercely in thin air; his eyes were bulging out > of his head, his hair streamed wildly around his face, which was so > distorted by rage and diabolical hate that I could not help bursting out > laughing. The other three pictures were in the same style, and my friends > and I were heartily amused by the naivety of the pictures, their exaggerated > expression and their comic earnestness. But how strangely things can > sometimes turn out! I, who had laughed aloud and mockingly at these > pictures, returned constantly to them in my thoughts, and one fine day I > realized that these shoddy pictures still contained a kind of core or idea > and ‚Äì just think! ‚Äì even a musical undercurrent! Some time later, then, I > began to work out the first movement of a symphony, but I had to be careful > that it did not fence in the empty air, and I hoped of course that my > listeners would not laugh so that the irony of fate would smite my > soul.Programme for the concert at Konsertf√∂reningen in Stockholm, 7 October > 1931 Music Its movements and their respective temperament illustrated are as followed: # Allegro collerico (Choleric) # Allegro comodo e flemmatico (Phlegmatic) # Andante malincolico (Melancholic) # Allegro sanguineo ‚Äî Marziale (Sanguine) The composer's inspiration for the symphony came from a four-part comical picture of the temperaments in a village pub in Zealand during a visit with his wife and friends. In his account of the symphony (quoted in full in ), Nielsen gave a detailed outline of his vision for each temperament in each of the four movements. For example, in the phlegmatic temperament of the second movement, the composer visualized a young teenager who is loved by all: > His real inclination was to lie where the birds sing, where the fish glide > noiselessly through the water, where the sun warms and the wind strokes > mildly round one's curls. He was fair; his expression was rather happy, but > not self-complacent, rather with a hint of quiet melancholy, so that one > felt impelled to be good to him... I have never seen him dance; he wasn't > active enough for that, though he might easily have got the idea to swing > himself in a gentle slow waltz rhythm, so I have used that for the movement, > Allegro comodo e flemmatico, and tried to stick to one mood, as far away as > possible from energy, emotionalism, and such things. Whereas the finale symbolizes a cheerful man: > I have tried to sketch a man who storms thoughtlessly forward in the belief > that the whole world belongs to him, that fried pigeons will fly into his > mouth without work or bother. There is, though, a moment in which something > scares him, and he gasps all at once for breath in rough syncopations: but > this is soon forgotten, and even if the music turns to minor, his cheery, > rather superficial nature still asserts itself. Progressive tonality is demonstrated in the symphony; the first three movements are in descending thirds: B minor, G major, and E-flat minor, and the final movement springs out the D major chord. The second symphony, as in the first, still belongs to the tradition of Brahms and Dvo≈ô√°k, but more compact and concentrated with a simple but powerful finishing by an A major march. Reception Nielsen himself conducted the first performance of The Four Temperaments in a concert at the Dansk Koncertforening on 1 December 1902, just three days after he had conducted the premiere of Saul and David at the Royal Theatre. The symphony was well received by the audience, and the press was generally positive. But not all the reviews were good. Writing in the Danish newspaper Dannebrog, composer and music critic Leopold Rosenfeld commented: \\"Carl Nielsen‚Äôs new work should, I suppose, rather be called a suite of moods for orchestra than designated as what we understand by a symphony. But aside from the name, this new work by the highly f√™ted composer again bears favourable testimony to its author‚Äôs uncommon ability to give expression to characteristic sound painting through a considerable orchestral technique. Whether one really dares call these constructed orchestral sounds music is another question again. What is especially captivating about these musical illustrations is the composer‚Äôs ability to mix colours, which neglects no opportunity to exercise the listening ear. Sometimes, though, the colours are very brutal and in their crudeness easily cross the aesthetic line.\\", citing Dannebrog, 2 December 1902. In January 1903 Carl Nielsen and his friend the pianist Henrik Knudsen were travelling in Germany to stir up interest in the new symphony and in Saul and David. When in Berlin, they showed the symphony to Ferruccio Busoni whom Nielsen had known since 1891. Busoni took an interest in the work and promised to put it on the programme in the series of concerts of new and rarely heard music that he was giving at this time with the Berlin Philharmonic. It was probably out of gratitude for this that Nielsen dedicated the work to Busoni. On 5 November 1903 the symphony was performed in Berlin, with Nielsen conducting. As Busoni had warned, the work was not very well received. The symphony did however gain increasing popularity, quickly becoming one of Nielsen‚Äôs best loved orchestral works. By 1928, the composer had conducted at least 13 performances in Denmark, Norway (Christiania and Bergen), Sweden (Gothenburg) and Germany (Berlin). In 1921, it was also performed in London under Sir Henry Wood and, in 1927, by the Pasdeloup Orchestra in Paris conducted by Frederik Schnedler-Petersen.

He was active in the Norwegian Students' Society, the Norwegian Labour Party and the Communist Party, but is best known as a leading figure in the group Mot Dag, who issued a periodical of the same name. He also translated Das Kapital. Early life and career He was born in Hemnesberget as a son of Jonas Cornelius Falk (1844‚Äì1915) and Anna Margrethe Middelthon (1857‚Äì1924). Falk attended school in Trondheim (1901), Mosj√∏en (1903) and high school in Stavanger (1905) before he moved to Duluth, Minnesota in 1907. In the United States he undertook varying forms of work and short-lived studies, including working as a land surveyor in Montana and as an accountant for Industrial Workers of the World in Chicago. Mot Dag In 1918 he moved back to Norway, and enrolled at the Royal Frederick University. From 1921 he edited a new periodical called Mot Dag, which he published together with people he met in a study circle led by Edvard Bull. In addition to Falk, prominent figures in the early Mot Dag were Viggo Hansteen, Trond Hegna, Aake Anker Ording and Arne Ording. Sigurd Hoel soon joined the group as editor of Mot Dag. In 1922 a parallel association, also named Mot Dag, was established. Falk had joined Kristiania Arbeidersamfund and the Norwegian Students' Society after moving to Norway, and was also a member of the Norwegian Labour Party. Together with Martin Tranm√¶l Falk was instrumental in writing the Kristiania Proposal in early 1923, which stated that the Labour Party should strive for independency from the Comintern. The Comintern did not take lightly to this, and Falk was present to discuss the issue at the 3rd Enlarged Plenum of Executive Committee of the Communist International in June 1923. The Labour Party resigned from Comintern at its extraordinary national convention in November 1923. At that convention, Falk tried to challenge Tranm√¶l as editor- in-chief of the party newspaper Arbeiderbladet, but received few votes in his favor. Falk remained with the Labour Party for some time, but was excluded from the party in 1925. At the same time, the Labour Party disassociated itself with the entire Mot Dag group. Falk then formed the group Arbeideropposisjonen, but it too was excluded, and became short-lived. In 1926 Mot Dag and Falk joined the Communist Party. Falk was a member of the party's central board, and had influence in the newspaper Norges Kommunistblad. He also influenced the founding of the short-lived party Arbeiderklassens Samlingsparti. In 1928 he was a part of the 6th World Congress of the Comintern in Moscow, but Falk and Mot Dag left the Communist Party in 1928. Around the same time Falk also lost influence in the Norwegian Students' Society, due to having embezzled money from a construction fund reserve.Nordby, 1989: pp. 33‚Äì35 Money was among others needed to run the publishing house Fram Forlag. After the Great Depression in 1929, Falk translated Karl Marx's Das Kapital to Norwegian, and wrote the book Hvad er marxisme? (What is Marxism?) in 1937. From 1933 he participated in creating the workers' encyclopedia Arbeidernes Leksikon. However, by the mid-1930s he needed a lighter workload due to declining health. His activity in Mot Dag declined from the autumn of 1935, which in part led to the dissolution of Mot Dag in June 1936. In contrast to most of the other members he did not rejoin the Labour Party, as the party chose to uphold his exclusion. One day before the German invasion of Norway in April 1940, Falk left the country for Stockholm to undergo brain surgery. He had two surgeries, but died on 31 July 1940. He was buried at Vestre gravlund in Norway.

As a Bear he is best remembered for his role kicking 8 goals in the Bears final game at Carrara Stadium vs Sydney Swans in Round 23, 1992 as well as for wearing a helmet during games for much of his playing career. He also kicked 8 goals against Geelong Football Club in round 7, 1992 to win the Brisbane Bears goalkicking award in 1992. Despite that, he was delisted before the 1993 season. Hutton moved to play for Sydney in 1993, but after only kicking 9 goals from five matches he was delisted at the end of the 1993 season. In 1994, Hutton's career was revived when he was selected by the Fremantle Football Club's inaugural squad as part of the zoning rule to play in their debut 1995 season. He managed to equal his best haul of 8 goals in Round 6, 1995 vs Sydney Swans, but overall failed to impress. Playing for only one season, Hutton was delisted at the end of 1995.

Ron Hubbard, written by Kyle Jarrow from a concept by Alex Timbers, the show's original director. Jarrow based the story of the one-act, one-hour musical on Hubbard's writings and Church of Scientology literature. The musical follows the life of Hubbard as he develops Dianetics and then Scientology. Though the musical pokes fun at Hubbard's science fiction writing and personal beliefs, it has been called a \\"deadpan presentation\\" of his life story. Topics explored in the piece include Dianetics, the E-meter, Thetans, and the story of Xenu. The show was originally presented in 2003 in New York City by Les Freres Corbusier, an experimental theater troupe, enjoying sold-out Off-Off-Broadway and Off- Broadway productions. Later productions have included Los Angeles, New York, Boston, Atlanta, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. Early in the production of the musical, the president of the Church of Scientology in New York sent a letter to the producer pointing out the Church's history of litigation. This led Timbers and Jarrow to insert the word \\"Unauthorized\\" into the title, upon the advice of legal counsel. During the Los Angeles production, representatives of the Church of Scientology visited the production staff in the midst of rehearsals and handed out documentation of successful litigation against critics of Scientology. Parents of some of the Los Angeles cast members also received phone calls from Scientologists in the entertainment industry, asking them not to allow their children to perform in the musical. A Very Merry Unauthorized Children's Scientology Pageant has been well received. The 2003 New York production received an Obie Award, and director Alex Timbers received a Garland Award for the 2004 Los Angeles production. The musical also received positive reviews in the press. The New York Times characterized it as a \\"cult-hit\\", and The Village Voice, the Los Angeles Times and The Guardian all gave it favorable reviews. Variety and The Boston Globe had kind words for the updated 2006 edition. A 2004 cast recording released by Sh-K-Boom Records received four out of five stars from Allmusic and plaudits from The Los Angeles Daily News. Background Alex Timbers developed the concept and directed the play, while Kyle Jarrow wrote the accompanying book, music, and lyrics. Timbers and Jarrow were classmates together at Yale University. The script for the play is published by Samuel French, Inc. Jarrow was motivated to write the script by what he saw as a shift in religious teachings ‚Äì from an old model involving hell and retribution, to a new system of thought promising money or peace. Jarrow commented on Timbers' idea of using children to tell a story about Scientology: \\"I did a lot of work on cults in college, and what I learned is that they sort of turn you into a child by appealing to that part of you that wants to be taken care of and given answers. And so it all began to make sense to me.\\" He said Scientology would be \\"an especially interesting topic for a theater piece\\" because of its criticism of psychiatry, relative newness compared to Buddhism, Islam, Judaism, and Christianity, and practice of requiring \\"that the follower take courses which cost significant amounts of money.\\" Jarrow's script was \\"almost entirely based on Hubbard's own writings and the church's literature\\", though Jarrow was also influenced by critical journalistic accounts. He also drew on the \\"awkward woodenness of Christmas pageants ‚Äî the fact that children are often made to say large words that don't sound natural coming out of their mouths.\\" Timbers said they chose to stick to Church of Scientology primary source material for background on the script because \\"We thought that the best way to satirize the Church of Scientology was to let the Church speak for itself.\\" During production, the creative team worked with cast members to educate them about the play's background. \\"Kids shouldn't just be saying things that they don't understand. That's what we're criticizing...people who just parrot behavior and language. We wanted to have an honest conversation with them,\\" Jarrow said. The published version of the script says that the musical should not be performed by adults; Jarrow said adults are \\"too jaded\\", and would not be able to portray the \\"unwinking satire\\" of the piece. Xenu scene, 2007 Philadelphia production The producers wanted the musical to appear like a \\"corny and low-rent production\\". The ensemble includes 10 actors from ages eight to twelve. Though professionals, the child actors perform with a \\"realistic lack of polish\\", as they are playing non-professional children of Scientologists, performing in a holiday pageant. The chorus portrays Thetans, and the reactive and analytical portions of the mind are depicted by two children who share a conjoined right brain costume. During the Xenu story, the narrator is outfitted in a cardboard robot suit, and the actor portraying Xenu wears a \\"tacky headdress\\". Staging, costumes and set design are all made to appear to be the \\"earnest work of schoolteachers and supportive parents trying to provide a colorful and cheery atmosphere on a small budget.\\" The stage design includes a \\"colorful, crayon- colored backdrop of space age-like, semi-circular set pieces.\\" Costumes include white robes, rainbow-striped socks and tinsel halos. Props used to denote locations include \\"a waving cardboard palm frond for Hawaii, a street sign and cell phones for New York.\\" The musical ends with a tableau vivant, where the audience sees the cast standing at the back of the theater holding candles and singing cheerfully as a door closes and they are blocked from view. Early in the production of the play, John Carmichael, president of the Church of Scientology in New York, found out that a theatrical production involving Scientology was in the works. After showing up unannounced to a rehearsal, Carmichael sent a letter to the play's New York producer, Aaron Lemon-Strauss, citing his concerns at the possibility of being ridiculed. In the letter, Carmichael also pointed out the church's many past lawsuits. Alex Timbers was quoted as saying: \\"We've been told that the letter is a precursor to a lawsuit.\\" Carmichael visited the artistic staff a total of three times to voice his concerns before the play's debut. After this occurrence, Jarrow and Timbers' attorneys advised them to insert the word \\"Unauthorized\\" into the title of the play. This was done to avoid potential litigation from the Church of Scientology. In an interview with The New York Times, Carmichael later stated: \\"These folks have a right to write whatever play they want... but they've sunk to clich√©s.\\" Plot summary The characters gather on a cold winter night to rejoice in telling the story of L. Ron Hubbard. \\"Hey! It's a Happy Day!\\" A narrator notes: \\"Today we relate the life of L. Ron Hubbard: Teacher, author, explorer, atomic physicist, nautical engineer, choreographer, horticulturist, and father of Scientology!\\" Hubbard is born in a nativity scene, surrounded by parents and barnyard animals, as an angel proclaims, \\"Billions of years of evolution had climaxed with his birth.\\" He begins to question the nature of his existence. He is adrift on a boat in the Pacific Ocean during his service in World War II, when he begins to think about starting a religion. Hubbard tells his followers about what he has learned through his travels in \\"Science of the Mind\\", singing about \\"the key to being free, the way to be happy\\". He tells his followers that during the War \\"I saw how emotion can make you blind\\", and he begins to teach his followers about the reactive mind. The E-meter, as described in a puppet show, 2007 Philadelphia production Hubbard thanks the analytical mind (portrayed by two characters) for helping him to find the answers he was searching for, and proclaims: \\"Thinking rationally is the way to be happy and the key to learning more.\\" He announces to his followers, \\"You'll operate with your analytical mind only.... There won't be any emotions to stand in the way of your success.\\" As Hubbard tells his followers about his new ideas, they each proclaim to him: \\"You're right!\\" Hubbard answers: \\"Of course I'm right!\\" Hubbard's followers thank him for teaching them his new ideas: \\"Now the sun will shine / And the world is fine / We have got the science of the mind.\\" A Church of Scientology Auditor explains some technical Scientology jargon to new recruits, and the E-meter is described in a puppet show. Finale, 2007 Philadelphia production As Hubbard's followers progress in their Scientology teachings, they learn of the story of evil alien prince Xenu. Celebrity actor characters describe their relationships with Scientology: John Travolta explains how Scientology \\"fueled his cool\\"; Kirstie Alley says that it helped her conquer drug addiction \\"enabling me to star in the fine television series Fat Actress and to promote the quality products of weight loss expert Jenny Craig\\"; and Tom Cruise interacts with sock-puppet incarnations of his new wife and daughter. The Internal Revenue Service brings a case against Hubbard, but he is able to defeat the tax charges by brainwashing his accuser. Celebrities Cruise, Alley and Travolta testify on Hubbard's behalf during the trial. Skeptics question Hubbard about the Church of Scientology's finances and methods of recruiting and retaining members. One young boy, left alone on the stage, sings about profound alienation. The entire company finally comes together to sing the \\"chilling finale\\", which includes the refrain: \\"Just don't ask questions / And everything is clear.\\" Musical analysis Jarrow incorporated musical themes from The Road to Freedom, a 1986 pop album with lyrics by Hubbard and performances by John Travolta, Leif Garrett, Frank Stallone, Chick Corea, and Karen Black. Jarrow also incorporated musical themes from 1980s pop, saying \\"the liturgical music of Scientology is 1980s pop, which seems strangely appropriate because of the science fiction books. So that's what we did [in the show]. It's a pastiche of synth-pop and pageant choir music.\\" Jarrow said he tried \\"to capture the feel of kiddie rock\\" such as Free to Be‚Ä¶ You and Me and Kids Incorporated. The song, \\"Hey! It's a Happy Day!\\" quotes Hubbard's Scientology: A New Slant On Life. Songs are set to \\"cheesy synth-keyboard backing\\" and feature \\"sublimely clunky dance breaks\\". An electronic score emphasizes the musical's \\"loony conviction\\", while sleigh bells give the play a feeling of a \\"jazzed-up saint's play\\". The songs incorporate video game music, and \\"beats from a child's keyboard synthesizer.\\" The music in the show has been compared with the symphonic band Polyphonic Spree, and with the educational short films of Schoolhouse Rock. Productions =2003‚Äì2004= A Very Merry Unauthorized Children's Scientology Pageant debuted in November 2003, and had sold-out Off-Off- Broadway and Off-Broadway runs that winter, both directed by Alex Timbers. The musical was initially shown at The Tank theatre on 42nd Street where it ran for three weeks, and later moved to The John Houseman Theatre, where it was performed for an additional three weeks. The show opened in Los Angeles at the Powerhouse Theatre, in October 2004, again directed by Timbers. The run was initially scheduled for October 15 through November 21, 2004, but was extended through December 21, 2004. Timbers said that he was excited to take the production to Los Angeles, commenting: \\"Since the whole goal of the show is to imagine how the Scientologists might stage a nativity pageant, there's no better place to try than in their Jerusalem.\\" When the production company first arrived in Los Angeles, the cast and crew were \\"intimidated\\" by Scientologists. Scientology officials had previously visited the New York City production in the midst of rehearsals and handed out \\"documentation of court cases where the Church of Scientology had successfully prosecuted those seeking to disparage the Church's methods.\\" Director/creator Alex Timbers characterized these events as \\"terrifically wonderful and intimidating\\". Editors from the Los Angeles Times received phone calls from Scientologists urging them not to write about the play. In addition, the parents of one of the children from the cast received phone calls from members of the entertainment industry who were Scientologists. The parents of these cast members were told that if their children performed in the play, \\"it might be bad for their future career.\\" The parents politely informed these callers \\"We read the script, and we don't think it is mean-spirited ... We understand your concerns, but we don't share your concerns.\\" When asked by Variety magazine for the Church's official take on the play, a Los Angeles Church of Scientology spokeswoman was quoted as saying: \\"This is not litigation material. This is nothing.\\" In a 2007 interview, Jarrow commented on the Church of Scientology's history of responses to productions of the play: \\"It's clear the Church doesn't like the show‚Äîbut in my opinion that kind of controversy is evidence that the show's hitting a nerve and dealing with pertinent issues. So I take a certain pride in that.\\" =2006‚Äìpresent= Poster for 2007 Philadelphia production In late 2006, the musical was performed at New York Theatre Workshop's 4th Street Theatre in New York City, with Alex Timbers reprising his role as director and Gabriel Kahane as musical director. That same year, the show was also presented at the Boston Center for the Arts in Boston by Boston Theatre Works, and at Dad's Garage Theatre in Atlanta. The Boston production was directed by Jason Southerland. When contacted by The Boston Globe for a statement on the Boston production, Boston Church of Scientology president Gerard Renna stated that the musical: \\"is not something we're addressing\\" and that they were instead focused on antidrug education. Dad's Garage Theatre presented the musical again in 2007, from November 30 to December 23, 2007. The entire cast from the 2006 production returned, and director Mary Claire Dunn emphasized that she educated the cast about Scientology on the first day of rehearsal. Theatre company Brat Productions in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania also put on a 2007 production, with performances from December 13 through December 30, 2007 at St. Stephen's Theater. The production was directed by Lee Ann Etzold. Landless Theatre Company in Washington, D.C. also presented the musical from December 20, 2007 through January 13, 2008 at the District of Columbia Arts Center in Adams Morgan. Andrew Lloyd Baughman was the director and music director. Rarely Done Productions in Syracuse, New York put on a production of the play, which ran from October 3 to October 18, 2008. Circle Theatre in Fort Worth, Texas has announced a 2008 production, which ran November 20 to December 20, 2008. Know Theatre of Cincinnati, Ohio planned a 2008 production December 6 through January, 2008. Ron May, artistic director of Stray Cat Theatre in Phoenix, Arizona, also planned a production of the play for the 2008 season, and A Red Orchid Theatre in Chicago, Illinois planned a production to run from November 17 to December 28, 2008. Representatives for the Church of Scientology did not respond to repeated requests for comment from the Chicago Tribune about the 2008 Chicago production. The 2008 Chicago production was well received, and A Red Orchid Theatre again put on a production of the play in its 2009‚Äì2010 season. The Chicago production was directed by Steve Wilson, and ran from November 12, 2009 through January 3, 2010. The play's artistic director, Kirsten Fitzgerald spoke positively of rehearsals for the Chicago production: \\"The energy that explodes into the theatre with the start of each rehearsal is palpable and impossible to deny, even from the office next door. I am ecstatic and so very grateful to bring last year's smash-hit to audiences old and new. The heart of last year's joyous and hilarious Chicago Premiere returns with plenty of surprises and new fun up our sleeves.\\" Crain's Chicago Business ranked the production as one of the top ten things to do for the weekend in the city. Another Illinois production ran from December 7, 2009 to January 3, 2010, by Next Theatre in Evanston. On December 2, 2009, performers sang songs from the play in a production called The Songs of Kyle Jarrow at the 92YTribeca in Manhattan, New York. Performers included Jeb Brown, Tony Award- nominee Alison Fraser, Susan Goodwillie, Caesar Samayoa, Libby Winters, and Lauren Worsham. A 2010 production was planned in Clearwater, Florida, for showings December 2 through December 22. The play in Clearwater is produced by American Stage for the After Hours series. A representative for the theater, Andy Orrell, told the St. Petersburg Times, \\"The After Hours series does shows that are more avant garde, more risque, shows that we couldn't really do on the main stage. In a lot of ways, this show fits perfectly into that criteria.\\" Clearwater is a spiritual headquarters for the Scientology organization; when contacted for a statement by St. Petersburg Times, Kyle Jarrow responded, \\"Wow! - I had no idea they were doing the show down there. Clearwater is almost ground zero for Scientology. That's sure to be extra controversial.\\" The American Stage Theatre Company performs out of the Raymond James Theatre in St. Petersburg, Florida. The Actors Guild of Lexington in Lexington, Kentucky planned a production to run from April 7‚Äì17, 2011, directed by the group's artistic director Eric Seale. In 2017, a concert version was staged at Feinstein's/54 Below directed/designed by Sean Pollock with music direction by Luke McGinnis featuring cut material from the original score. This was the first time that the score had been heard in New York since the last revival in 2006. The concert was produced Unattended Baggage with Broadway Records' founder Van Dean starring children from Broadway shows such as Kinky Boots (musical), Fun Home (musical), 1984 (play), Falsettos and The King and I. A restaging of the concert was held at Greenroom 42 in September 2018, featuring new cast members from School of Rock (musical), The Lion King (musical) and Pippin (musical) with James Healy as musical director. Reception =Awards= A Very Merry Unauthorized Children's Scientology Pageant received a 2004 Obie Award for its 2003 production in New York City. Kyle Jarrow and Alex Timbers were given \\"Special Citations\\" from The Village Voice for developing the piece. Timbers and Jarrow were honored with the award at the May 17, 2004 Obie Award presentation, at New York's Webster Hall. Alex Timbers also received a Back Stage West Garland Award for best director, for the 2004 Los Angeles production of the play. =Reviews= A Very Merry Unauthorized Children's Scientology Pageant received positive reviews from the press. A review in The New York Times described the musical as having a \\"crude, faux-na√Øf sensibility\\", and stated that it \\"provides a cult-hit blueprint for a young generation that prefers its irony delivered with not a wink but a blank stare.\\" A 2003 review in New York City's The Village Voice compared the show to The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui, stating: \\"Just as Ui doesn't explain the complex phenomenon of the Third Reich, Scientology Pageant doesn't probe the psychology of cults; instead, both demystify subjects whose appeal stems in no small part from the mystique their acolytes have attributed to them.\\" Though most of the media reception of the musical was positive, New York Church of Scientology President John Carmichael did not have kind words for the production. Carmichael asserted that L. Ron Hubbard was portrayed in the play as \\"an authoritarian demagogue whose methods create emotionless followers.\\" Other critics complained that the young members of the cast were portraying characters and depicting content that they could not understand. The Los Angeles Times review in 2004 stated that: \\"The show found a New York audience willing to move from the tongue-in-cheek children's pageant concept to something that became startlingly adult.\\" In a 2004 review in The Guardian, the article cited notable quotes from other reviews, including The New York Times, The Village Voice, and The New York Observer. The review stated that audiences \\"have a chance to witness a wide-eyed, straight-faced, scrappy and touching telling of the story of L Ron set to a cheesy electro-pop score. See the great man, clad in a white Plyphonic Spree-style gown, wander from inquisitive soul to wounded war veteran to writer of pulp science fiction to leader of world religion. Sort of.\\" Of the updated 2006 version, Variety stated that \\"..the breezy one-hour show is equal parts adorable and creepy, hilarious and unsettling, making it way more compelling than your average holiday entertainment.\\" The Boston Globe also reviewed the 2006 edition of the play, and its review spent more time giving background on some of the cast and crew, particularly writer Kyle Jarrow, stating that \\"..Jarrow has created a musical about L. Ron Hubbard that is, in its own sardonic way, much more funny and touching than any of Cruise's diatribes against Ritalin.\\" The New York Sun described the production as an: \\"ingenious musical account of L. Ron Hubbard's life and times\\", and compared the discomfort produced by watching the piece to that produced by the 2006 documentary Jesus Camp. The 2007 Philadelphia production also received favorable reviews, and critic Wendy Rosenfield of The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote \\"..somehow the production emerges triumphant, retaining its innocent sense of inquiry and buoyant good humor while making some pretty serious philosophical points.\\" A review in The Washington Post of the 2007 Washington, D.C. production was more critical. Peter Marks wrote that \\"..aside from a weird sci-fi back story involving Prince Xenu, a figure from Scientology lore, the incidents the playwright relates that shape Hubbard's belief system unfold choppily and dryly.\\" The production received a positive review in by Bob Anthony in AllArtsReview4U, who wrote \\"This is so charming that it rates a \\"must see\\" status. The show should be extended at another venue.\\" Manya Brachear reviewed the 2008 Chicago production for the Chicago Tribune, and highlighted the play's \\"trilling tunes\\", including \\"Hey! It's a Happy Day!\\" and \\"The Science of the Mind\\". The two Chicago productions in 2009 also received favorable reviews in the Chicago Tribune; the reviewer noted, \\"this show manages to simultaneously skewer Scientology and showcase the young performers in an upbeat, fun way.\\" Cast recording A cast recording of the musical was released by Kurt Deutsch's Sh-K-Boom Records, on November 2, 2004. \\"Hey! It's a Happy Day!\\", \\"Science of the Mind\\", \\"Rain\\", and \\"Finale\\" are tracks from the original 2004 production. The other songs on the album were written by Jarrow \\".. to further explore the subjects and themes of the stage production.\\" The first track on the album is entitled \\"Disclaimer\\", and is a general announcement to the audience. The Los Angeles Daily News surmised that this disclaimer served to \\"keep the creators of this acidic little send-up from getting hauled into court\\": The CD release received four out of five stars from Allmusic, where it was described as \\"Funny, weird and wonderful\\", and \\"the offbeat theater offering of the year\\". Specific tracks highlighted by Allmusic included \\"L. Ron Hubbard\\", in which the chorus centers on the question: \\"What does the 'L.' stand for?\\", and \\"The Way It Began\\", which begins with the preface statement: \\"The following is completely secret and absolutely serious. It is the story of the universe as described in the most sacred literature of the Church of Scientology.\\" In the song \\"Mister Auditor\\", the children actually sing some of the typical questions asked in Scientology auditing, and in the song \\"Something Special\\", allegations that the Church of Scientology \\"preys on the weak and confused\\" are discussed, but the narrator states that none of these allegations are true. ;2004 Cast recording # \\"Disclaimer\\" ‚Äì 0:18 # \\"Hey!

However, the title of Don Thompson's book, The $12 Million Stuffed Shark: The Curious Economics of Contemporary Art, suggests a higher figure. Owing to deterioration of the original tiger shark, it was replaced with a new specimen in 2006. It was on loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City from 2007 to 2010.

It gives the innately demonic urge to live a > demonic, deathlike form. Decay and replacement Because the shark was initially preserved poorly, it began to deteriorate, and the surrounding liquid grew murky. Hirst attributed some of the decay to the fact that the Saatchi Gallery had added bleach to the fluid. In 1993, the gallery gutted the shark and stretched its skin over a fiberglass mould. Hirst commented, \\"It didn't look as frightening ... You could tell it wasn't real. It had no weight.\\" When Hirst learned of Saatchi's impending sale of the work to Cohen, he offered to replace the shark, an operation which Cohen funded, calling the expense \\"inconsequential\\" (the formaldehyde process alone cost around $100,000). Another shark (a female aged about 25-30 years, equivalent to middle age) was caught off the Queensland coast and shipped to Hirst in a 2-month journey. In 2006, Oliver Crimmen, a scientist and fish curator at London's Natural History Museum, assisted with the preservation of the new specimen. This involved injecting formaldehyde into the body, as well as soaking it for two weeks in a bath of 7% formalin solution. The original 1991 vitrine was then used to house it. Hirst acknowledged that there was a philosophical question as to whether replacing the shark meant that the result could still be considered the same artwork. He observed: > It's a big dilemma. Artists and conservators have different opinions about > what's important: the original artwork or the original intention. I come > from a conceptual art background, so I think it should be the intention. > It's the same piece. But the jury will be out for a long time to come.

Life He was born in Haddington, East Lothian, a cousin of the painter John Scougal,Brydall, Robert, Art in Scotland, Edinburgh & London, 1889: 92 in 1624 he graduated from the University of Edinburgh as Master of Arts. In 1636, he became a minister of Dairsie parish, Fife, moving on to Leuchars in 1645 and then to Saltoun, near Edinburgh, in 1659. He refused an offer to become Professor of Divinity at Edinburgh University in 1662. In this period, Scougal showed himself to be an extremely religious ideologue, preaching against papists and playing a leading role in the national witchhunt of the 1660s. However, his views on episcopacy became clear when in early 1664 he was offered and accepted the post of Bishop of Aberdeen. Perhaps because of his known and well-established religious fervour, hostility to Scougal's newly shown pro-episcopacy sentiments was comparatively muted. In the same year, Scougal became Chancellor of King's College, Aberdeen. Scougal took an active role in the suppression of Quakerism and was part of a prosecution of James Gordon, the parson of Banchory-Devenick, who had written the Catholic-leaning theological tract called The Reformed Bishop (1679). Scougal was also charitable, and undertook many charitable deeds, including raising money for two Polish Protestant students. When he died (aged seventy-three) of asthma on 16 February 1682, he left much of his wealth to the hospital of Old Aberdeen, King's College Library and Aberdeen Cathedral. Bishop Scougall was interred in St. Machar's Cathedral in Old Aberdeen. His monument, a large 3-dimensional tomb in the south-west corner of the nave, is a notable example of 17th century Scottish neo-classical design, including a 'portrait' of Scougal (see above), and a rich array of symbolic ornament, including Scougal and his wife naked, united ny \\"king death\\".

Established in 1953, the Faculty is today divided into Civil Law and Common Law sections, the two formally recognized legal traditions in Canada. It is regarded as one of the most prestigious institutions of legal education in Canada. The law school has produced a diverse array of successful alumni. These include the current Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, Chief Justice of the Federal Court of Appeal of Canada, Chief Justice of the Ontario Court of Justice, Chairman of White & Case LLP, Managing Partner of Norton Rose Fulbright Canada, and deans of several law schools including the University of Hawaii School of Law, and the Civil Law Section at the University of Ottawa. The Faculty of Law is home to several world-renowned centres. The Centre of Health Law, Policy and Ethics which it offers an unparalleled breadth of faculty expertise and Canada‚Äôs largest course offering in health law, including courses in both English and French, and common and civil law. And The Centre for Law, Technology and Society as Canada‚Äôs leading research hub for law, ethics and policy surrounding technology. The Centre is also the home of the Samuelson-Glushko Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic, a unique legal clinic ‚Äì first and only Canadian public interest technology law clinic ‚Äì that has been defending the digital rights and freedom of expression since 2003. The faculty is very highly rated and maintains close links with the legal communities in Quebec, Ontario, and abroad. The Faculty of Law is also home to two elite bilingual law journals, one produced by the civil law section (Revue g√©n√©rale de droit) and the other produced by the common law section (Ottawa Law Review''), which have significantly contributed to the development of law by the Supreme Court of Canada. As the largest law school in Canada, uOttawa Law often touts the advantages of its wide range of program offerings, courses, and opportunities, including proximity to federal agencies and courts, such as the Supreme Court of Canada and the Parliament of Canada.  History  alt=Fauteux Hall at the University of Ottawa The law school was established in 1953 on the initiative of Gerald Fauteux, former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. It began as an exclusively civil law faculty, designed to train lawyers who would enter the Quebec legal system, particularly in order to practice in the Outaouais region just across the Ottawa River. In 1957, the faculty began training students in the common law as well; the two sections were then divided, each with its own programs, faculties, and deans. Graduate programs were introduced that same year by the civil law section; the common law section followed suit in 1981. Although the school has, since 1970, had a system in which students enrolled in either the common or civil law section could receive accreditation in the other legal system, it was not until 1994 that this system was formalized into the National Program. In doing so, the faculty became one of the first in Canada to offer bi-juridical training in both the common law and civil law.https://commonlaw.uottawa.ca/sites/commonlaw.uottawa.ca/files/cguindon_uofo_common_law_eng_web.pdf The Norton Rose Classroom The Faculty of Law's current building, Fauteux Hall, was named in honour of Gerald Fauteux and was constructed in 1973. During the 2006 fall semester, then University of Ottawa president Gilles Patry announced that Fauteux Hall would undergo extensive renovations in 2009. Due to funding cutbacks, a new law building expansion was cancelled; instead, interior renovations were completed in 2012, including substantial changes to the entrance atrium and the Brian Dickson Law Library, and the construction of the state-of-the-art Norton Rose Fulbright classroom. Construction of the Ian G. Scott Courtroom, a fully functional courtroom where sitting judges hear regular cases, was also completed in the Brooks Building, which is across the street from the main Faculty of Law building and houses extra classrooms, offices, and spaces for the Faculty of Law's various centres.  Admissions  = Common law section = Third floor, Fauteux Hall In the Common Law Section, applicants are expected to have completed a three- to four-year undergraduate degree. Acceptance to the common law program is highly competitive. Successful applicants generally have an A- (3.70) undergraduate grade point average and a competitive LSAT score. The program also requires a personal statement and two reference letters, and claims to use a holistic admissions approach, taking into account a variety of factors including work experience, prior education, and other exceptional circumstances. According to the Faculty of Law LSAC page, the English-language common law program received 2637 applications in 2019, of which 320 were admitted; an admission rate of 12%. The French-language common law program, including the Programme de droit canadien, received 185 applications in 2019, of which 80 were admitted.http://www.oxfordseminars.ca/LSAT/lsat_profiles.php#universityofottawa = Civil law section = Tsampalieros Atrium, Fauteux Hall In the Civil Law Section, which teaches the legal tradition practised in Quebec, applicants need only have obtained a Diploma of Collegial Studies (DEC) before applying. The Civil Law Section's requirements are generally considered to be less stringent than those of the Common Law Section, since applicants are normally assessed only based on the previous post-secondary grades they received in college or university. Nevertheless, a minimum A- (80%) average is now required for admission from university; students applying directly from CEGEP, however, face stricter requirements. = Language requirements = The language of instruction depends on the program; while the civil law program is instructed entirely in French, the common law program is available in either English or French, with students permitted to take classes in both languages if they wish. In compliance with university policy, all written work may be submitted in either language, with the exception of the French common law program, in which all written and oral work must be submitted in French.  Academics  Graduates of the common law section receive the Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree, while civil law graduates receive the Licentiate in Law (LL.L.) degree. On May 3, 2010, the Senate of the University approved a motion to change the designation of the common law degree from LL.B. (Bachelor of Laws) to J.D. (Juris Doctor) . The Faculty of Law equally offers Master of Laws (LL.M.) and Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) degrees in both sections. = Joint programs = The following is a list of several joint programs offered by the University of Ottawa Faculty of Law: * The bilingual Programme de droit canadien (PDC) allows only 18 to 20 students a year to simultaneously earn a J.D. and a LL.L. degree in three years. * The National Program allows students in either common law or civil law to separately complete a degree in the other legal system in four years. * The Dual J.D. program is a combined Canadian- American legal program offered in conjunction with either the Michigan State University College of Law or the Washington College of Law at American University; students obtain two degrees in four years. * The J.D./MBA program is a combined law‚Äìbusiness program enabling students to receive concurrent common law and business degrees in four years. * The LL.L./MBA program enables students to receive concurrent civil law and business degrees in four years. * The J.D./MA is a combined law‚Äìpolitical science degree which enables students to receive a master's degree from Carleton University's Norman Paterson School of International Affairs, which they attend full-time for a year between their first and second years of legal education. * The LL.L./DVM program allows students enrolled in the civil law section to receive a specialized degree in international development and globalization. * The J.D./Sciences Politiques program allows students to enroll in common law from high school. It is a six- year program, with the first two years and the final year spent in Political Science and years three to five in Common Law.  Tuition fees  Tuition at the University of Ottawa's Law School varies according to the program being studied. Students enrolled in the civil law program pay the lowest fees, with the tuition rates 2012‚Äì2013 set at $8,833.46; this stands in contrast to the common law program, where annual tuition rates for 2014‚Äì2015 are $16,772.40. Students in the National Program pay $10,077.70 for their extra year of study. Students enrolled in the Dual J.D. program with an American law school pay what the University of Ottawa has termed \\"regular Canadian law student rates during the entire program,\\" meaning the regular common law tuition fees at the school.  Reputation  The Faculty of Law is well known for its successful mooting program and track record of international successes. The moot team has won the Vis Moot, the Oxford Intellectual Property Moot, and various other competitions, outperforming rival schools like Harvard Law School in many cases. Offerings in areas of practice including environmental law, health law, criminal law, tax law, and technology law have become highly developed, with diverse practical and academic offerings being made available to students in those areas. The school is also known for its strong focus on public-interest law. More recently, there have been efforts to bolster offerings in business and corporate law with the creation of the new Business Law Clinic. Maclean's magazine last released its annual law school ranking on September 19, 2013 and has not released any rankings for law schools since then. In that evaluation, Ottawa's common law program was ranked 10th overall in Canada, scoring particularly well (3rd overall) in the category for Supreme Court clerkships.http://oncampus.macleans.ca/education/2013/09/19/2013-law-school- rankings/ The civil law section was ranked 3rd in Canada among other civil law schools (the majority being in the province of Qu√©bec).http://oncampus.macleans.ca/education/2013/09/19/2013-law-school- rankings/ In 2019, the law school was ranked 5th in Canada according to University Magazine. It was recently ranked in Times Higher Education 2020 ranking as the 92nd best law school in the world.https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university- rankings/2020/subject-ranking/law#survey-answer  Notable Faculty  *Constance Backhouse, Canadian legal scholar and historian, President of the American Society of Legal History *Donald Malcolm McRae, legal scholar *David Paciocco, legal scholar, justice of the Court of Appeal for Ontario *Beno√Æt Pelletier CM OQ, constitutional legal scholar and former cabinet minister in the Quebec government *Amir Attaran, Canadian-American-Iranian law and medicine professor, health advocate *Colleen M.

Plot summary Allan (Hugh Grant) is an engineer working in 1930s Calcutta. He is invited to stay with the family of his boss, Narendra Sen (Soumitra Chatterjee) which includes his wife, Indira (Shabana Azmi) and daughter Gayatri (Supriya Pathak). Gayatri and Allan become romantically involved leading to tragedy. Cast * John Hurt as Lucien Metz * Hugh Grant as Allan * Soumitra Chatterjee as Narendra Sen * Shabana Azmi as Indira * Supriya Pathak as Gayatri Production history Production of the film occurred about a decade after Maitreyi Devi (the inspiration for the character Gayatri) published her version of the story Na Hanyate, (originally published in Bengali). She also extracted a promise from Eliade that his version would never be published in English as long as she is alive. According to Ginu Kamani in \\"A Terrible Hurt:The Untold Story behind the Publishing of Maitreyi Devi,\\" Maitreyi witnessed the making of the film \\"The Bengali Night,\\" which was shot in Calcutta from 1987-88 (Eliade had died that year). Her protests culminated \\"in court cases against the film for insulting Hinduism and for being pornographic.\\" The film was only shown once in India at a film festival in 1989 to mixed reviews and was never released in theaters in the U.S. Kamani also notes: :Devi was bitter about the whole affair. She wrote in 1988: \\"Christinel [Eliade's widow] has hurt me very badly. She gave permission to a French Co. to film La Nuit Bengali. They came to Calcutta for shooting and gave huge publicity pointing at me as the heroine.\\" It was a close enough breach of Eliade's promise that his book would not come out in English during her lifetime. But it is not known whether Mrs. Eliade was following her husband's wishes or her own. The film was partly shot at village Dhanyakuria.

Sustainable development * The Sustainable Development Index (SDI) measures the ecological efficiency of human development. Its impetus was a reaction to the UN's Human Development Index (HDI) which measures various indicators of development, but does not assess the sustainability of those underlying indicators. Countries with high human development and low ecological impact rise to the top of the SDI. Countries with low human development, and countries with high human development but high ecological impact, fall to the bottom of the SDI. The latest iteration of the index (2020) uses data from 2015, the most recent year for which data is available. In this ranking of 163 nations, Thailand ranked 44. Other ASEAN nations were ranked: Philippines, 26; Indonesia, 30; Vietnam, 42; Laos, 66; Cambodia, 77; Myanmar, 79; Malaysia, 109; Brunei, 139; and Singapore, lowest of all nations at 163.

James Hay of Virginia, Chairman of the House Committee on Military Affairs. The National Defense Act of 1916, , was a United States federal law that updated the Militia Act of 1903, which related to the organization of the military, particularly the National Guard. The 1916 act included an expansion of the Army and the National Guard, the creation of an Officers' and an Enlisted Reserve Corps, and the creation of a Reserve Officers' Training Corps. The President was also given expanded authority to federalize the National Guard, with changes to the duration and the circumstances under which he could call it up. The Army began the creation of an Aviation arm, and the federal government took steps to ensure the immediate availability of wartime weapons and equipment by contracting in advance for production of gunpowder and other material. Background Rep. Julius Kahn of California The act was passed amidst the \\"preparedness controversy\\", after Pancho Villa's cross- border raid on Columbus, New Mexico and prior to U.S. entry into World War I. Its chief proponent was James Hay of Virginia, the Chairman of the House Committee on Military Affairs.Meriden Daily Journal, Wilson Hurries Defense Sessions Prior to Wedding, October 26, 1915 Sponsored by the committee's ranking member, Julius Kahn of California and drafted by Hay, the 1916 law authorized an expanded Army of 175,000, and an enlarged National Guard of 450,000.U.S. Government Printing Office, Politics of Our Military National Defense: History of the Action of Political Forces Within the United States which Has Shaped Our Military National Defense Policies from 1783 to 1940 Together with the Defense Acts of 1916 and 1920 as Case Studies.

The 1916 Act also authorized the National Guard to use federal funds to pay for 48 days of drill a year, as well as 15 days of annual training, an improvement over the previous authorization of five days of summer camp, with no federal funds for drills.The Day (New London, Connecticut), Regular Pay for National Guard, January 11, 1916 The new law also made the Army's Division of Militia Affairs the expanded and reorganized Militia Bureau, which oversaw federal funding and other requirements for the National Guard in each state.Harrison Summers Kerrick, Military and Naval America, 1916, page 174 The 1916 Act also authorized the President to mobilize the National Guard in case of war or other national emergency, and for the duration of the event. The National Guard had previously been limited to service within each state, or federal activation within the United States for up to nine months. Under the 1916 Act, members of the National Guard could be discharged from the militia and drafted into the United States Army for overseas service (to comply with a 1912 decision by the Judge Advocate General of the Army that used a constitutional argument to restrict the overseas use of the National Guard), and could be called up for an unlimited duration.New York Times, Empowers Guard to Invade: Hay resolution in House Gives Wilson Right to Draft Militia, June 23, 1916 In addition, the Army was prevented from recruiting volunteer units to expand the organization in time of war until after the National Guard had been called up.Anne Cipriano Venzon, Paul L.

Following Indian independence, Mohan Singh later served in public life as a Member of Parliament in the Rajya Sabha (Upper House) of the Indian Parliament.  Early life  He was born the only son of Tara Singh and Hukam Kaur, a couple of Ugoke village, near Sialkot (now in Pakistan). His father died two months before his birth and his mother shifted to her parents' home in Badiana in the same district, where Mohan Singh was born and brought up.  Military career  Mohan Singh passed secondary school and enlisted the 14th Punjab Regiment of the British Indian Army in 1927. After the completion of his recruit training at Hrozpur, Mohan Singh was posted to the 2nd Battalion of the Regiment, then serving in the North-West Frontier Province. He was selected as a potential officer in 1931, and after six months' training in Kitchener College, Nowgong (Madhya Pradesh), and another two and a half years in the Indian Military Academy, Dehra Dun, he received his commission 1 February 1935 and was posted for a year to a British Army unit, the 2nd battalion Border Regiment. He was them posted to 1st Battalion, 14th Punjab Regiment on 24 February 1936, which at that time happened to be stationed at Jhelum.April 1936 Indian Army List Mohan Singh had been promoted temporary captain when his battalion was earmarked for operational service in the Far East.July 1941 Indian Army List The battalion was still carrying out intensive training at Secunderabad when he married, in December 1940, Jasvant Kaur, sister of a brother officer. He left for Malaya with his unit on 4 March 1941.  Second World War  Japan entered the War with her surprise attack on the American air base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 7 December 1941 and overran the entire South East Asia within a few weeks. The Japanese Imperial General Headquarters in October set up the Fujiwara Kikan, or the F-kikan, in Bangkok, Headed by the Major Fujiwara Iwaichi, chief of intelligence of the 15th army. Tasked with intelligence gathering and contacting the Indian independence movement, the overseas Chinese, and the Malayan Sultan with the aim of encouraging friendship and cooperation with Japan, Fujiwara's staff included five commissioned officers and two Hindi-speaking interpreters. His initial contact was with Giani Pritam Singh. Pritam Singh was a leader of such an organisation. He and Major Fujihara, a Japanese officer, requested Mohan Singh to form an Indian Army comprising the captured Indian soldiers. Mohan Singh hesitated but ultimately agreed. Fujihara handed over about 40,000 Indian soldiers, who had surrendered to him, to Mohan Singh. This was the initial step towards the formation of the first Indian National Army (INA). = Action in Malaya = The British force in the northern part of the Malaya Peninsula, including Mohan Singh's battalion, 1/14 Punjab Regiment, was fleeing towards the South. Mohan Singh's own forces had been outgunned and destroyed by superior Japanese forces at Jitra. Captured by Japanese troops after several days in the jungle, Singh was taken to Alor Star to Fujiwara and Pritam Singh at a joint office of the F-Kikan and the IIL. Fujiwara, later self-described as \\"Lawrence of the Indian National Army\\" (after Lawrence of Arabia) is said to have been a man committed to the values which his office was supposed to convey to the expatriate nationalist leaders, and found acceptance among them. = Indian National Army = Although Pritam Singh was involved to a large extent, it was Fujiwara who, with his sincerity of purpose and belief, convinced Mohan Singh to betray his oath to the Crown by uniting with the Japanese mission for the greater motive of Indian independence. This included the promise that he would be treated as an ally and a friend, and not a prisoner of war. Singh initially helped Fujiwara take control of the situation of looting and arson that had developed in Alor Star; in December 1941, after meeting with the Japanese commanding general, Singh was convinced of the feasibility of raising an armed Indian unit. Between himself, Pritam Singh and Fujiwara, Mohan Singh set about contacting Indians in the British Indian Army in Southeast Asia, and also began recruiting from amongst those captured by the Japanese in Malaya. All Indian prisoners of war and stragglers were placed under his charge and he was asked to restore order in the town of Alor Star. Thus the nucleus of what came to be the Indian National Army was born. Kuala Lumpur fell on 11 January 1942 with 3,500 Indian prisoners of war, and Singapore on 15 February with 85,000 British troops, of whom 45,000 were Indians. Mohan Singh asked for volunteers who would form the Azad Hind Fauj (Free India Army) to fight for Indian independence from the British rule. A large number of men came forward to join what came to be termed as the Azad Hind Fauj (National Army of independent India). The new set-up came into being on 1 September 1942 by which time the strength of volunteers had reached 40,000. Mohan Singh, now designated a General, was to command it. Already in a conference held at Bangkok during 15‚Äì23 June 1942, the Indian Independence League under the leadership of Rash Behari Bose, an Indian revolutionary who had escaped to Japan in June 1915 and who had been living there ever since, had been inaugurated. Through one of the 35 resolutions passed by the conference, Mohan Singh was appointed commander-in-chief of the \\"Army of Liberation for India,\\" i.e. the Indian National Army. = Disagreements with Japan = Though Mohan Singh had kept a good relationship with the members of Fujiwara Kikan, he was soon disenchanted with the headquarters of the Japanese Army and doubted their intentions based on their orders. It appeared that they wanted to use the Indian National Army only as a part of the Japanese army and were deliberately withholding recognition and public proclamation about its existence as an independent army. Some supreme commanders of the Japanese army had disagreements with him. On 29 December 1942, Mohan Singh was removed from his command and taken into custody by the Japanese military police. It was only after the arrival of another Indian leader of great political standing, Subhas Chandra Bose, from Germany to the Far-Eastern front in June 1943 that the Indian National Army was revived in the form of Azad Hind Fauj. However, Mohan Singh could not be reinstated to the revived army. Upon Japan's defeat, Mohan Singh was taken into custody by the British and repatriated to India to face trials. However, due to public pressure, roused by the INA Red Fort trials, Mohan Singh was only cashiered from the Army. He subsequently served in the Indian Parliament as a member of the Rajya Sabha (Upper House).  Post 1947  Singh entered politics and joined the Indian National Congress in February 1947. His dream of independence was realized with India's Independence on 15 August 1947, but this was accompanied by the partition of the country into India and Pakistan. He had to leave his hearth and home in what then became Pakistan and came to India a homeless refugee. He was allotted some land in the village of Jugiana, near Ludhiana, where he settled permanently. After a stint as a legislator in the Punjab, he was elected to Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Indian Parliament, for two terms. In and out of Parliament he strove for the recognition of the members of his Azad Hind Fauj as \\"freedom fighters\\" in the cause of the nation's independence.

Individuals who were determined to be competent were issued fee patents on their land. The lands of Indian allotees determined to be non-competent were leased by the Federal Government, often to non-tribal members. While a fee patent gives power to the allottee to decide whether to keep or sell the land, provided the harsh economic reality of the time, lack of access to credit and markets, liquidation of Indian lands was almost inevitable. It was known by the department of interior that virtually 95% of fee patented land would eventually be sold to whites (Robertson, 2002).

He was the youngest son of Emperor Yang. Life Yang Gao was born in 607, after Emperor Yang had already become emperor. His mother was Consort Xiao, of whom little is known, and she might have been a sister or a relative of Emperor Yang's wife Empress Xiao. In 613, he was created the Prince of Zhao. Yang Gao was said to be intelligent and handsome in his childhood, as well as filially pious‚Äîsuch that when Emperor Yang was ill and unable to eat, Yang Gao would refuse to eat as well, and when Empress Xiao was ill and considered moxibustion, he volunteered to undertake it first. Emperor Yang, when he was under siege by the Eastern Turk leader Shibi Khan in 615 at the seat of Yanmen Commandery in present-day Daixian, Shanxi,. was recorded as so desperate that he was not doing anything except holding Yang Gao and crying. In 618, while Emperor Yang was at Jiangdu (Ê±üÈÉΩ, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), forces participating in a coup led by the general Yuwen Huaji entered the palace and surrounded him. Yang Gao was by his side, and started crying bitterly. Perhaps in irritation or perhaps to show Emperor Yang that the coup leaders were serious, Pei Qiantong (Ë£¥ËôîÈÄö) seized Yang Gao and killed him with a sword in Emperor Yang's presence, with Yang Gao's blood spilling onto Emperor Yang's clothes. Emperor Yang then offered to commit suicide, but was strangled to death instead. Empress Xiao and her ladies in waiting had to take decorative wooden boards within the palace to make makeshift caskets for Emperor Yang and Yang Gao.

The civil war in Somalia greatly increased the size of the Somali diaspora, as many Somalis moved from Greater Somalia primarily to the Arabian peninsula, Europe, North America, Southern Africa and Australia. There are also small Somali populations in other pockets of Europe and Asia. The UN estimates that in 2015, approximately 2 million people from Somalia were living outside of the country's borders. Global distribution The distribution of Somalis abroad is uncertain, primarily due to confusion between the number of ethnic Somalis and the number of Somalia nationals. Whereas most recent Somali migrants in the diaspora emigrated as refugees and asylum seekers, many have since obtained either permanent residence or citizenship. A 2008 publication estimated the ethnic Somali international migrant population as 1,010,000, including around 300,000 in East and South Africa, 250,000 in the United States and Canada, 250,000 in Europe, 200,000 in the Middle East, and 10,000 in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. By the start of the Yemeni Civil War, the number of Somalis in Yemen was estimated to be 500,000. UN migration estimates of the international migrant stock 2015 suggest that 1,998,764 people from Somalia were living abroad. , the number of refugees from Somalia registered with the UNHCR was 763,933. This is down from a peak of almost 990,000 in June 2013. The majority of these individuals were registered in Kenya (256,408), Yemen (253,755) and Ethiopia (198,670). According to USAID, many of the displaced persons in these adjacent territories are Bantus and other minorities. Africa Somali high school student in Cairo, Egypt. About two thirds of all Somalis who live outside Somalia live in neighbouring countries Kenya, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Yemen. Kenya hosted more than 313 000 in April 2017. About 255 000 were registered as refugees in Ethiopia. Besides their traditional areas of inhabitation in Greater Somalia (the former Italian Somaliland, British Somaliland, French Somaliland, the Ogaden, and the Northern Frontier District), a Somali community mainly consisting of businesspeople, academics and students also exists in Egypt.Somalia's Missing Million: The Somali Diaspora and its Role in DevelopmentSomalia: How is the fate of the Somalis in Egypt? In addition, there is an historical Somali community in the general Sudan area. Primarily concentrated in the north and Khartoum, the expatriate community mainly consists of students as well as some businesspeople.The History of Somali Communities in the Sudan since the First World War More recently, Somali entrepreneurs have also established themselves in South Africa, where they provide most of the retail trade in informal settlements around the Western Cape province.Local xenophobes still plague foreigners Europe While the distribution of Somalis per country in Europe is difficult to measure since the Somali expatriate community on the continent has grown so quickly in recent years, there are significant Somali communities in the United Kingdom: 108,000 (2018); Sweden: 66,369 (2016); Norway: 43,196 (2016); the Netherlands: 39,465 (2016); Germany: 38,675 (2016); Denmark: 21,050 (2016); and Finland: 20,007 (2017). = Denmark = Most Somalis in Denmark emigrated from Somalia following the start of the Somali Civil War (1986-), in the period between 1995 and 2000. According to Statistics Denmark, as of 2017, there are a total 21,204 persons of Somali origin living in Denmark. Of those individuals, 11,832 are Somalia-born immigrants and 9,372 are descendants of Somalia-born persons. 8,852 individuals are citizens of Somalia (4,730 men, 4,122 women). By December 2018, nearly 1000 Somalis in Denmark lost their residence permits after the Danish Immigration Service started a review of the permits in 2017. The permits were revoked as parts of Somalia are safe enough for refugees to return. In 2018, analysis showed about 44% of Somalis in Denmark live in a parallel society. In 2018, nearly 50% were in long-term unemployment (4 years or more). =Finland= Somalis are one of the largest ethnic minorities in Finland, and the largest group of people of non-European origin. In 2009, there were 5,570 Somali citizens, but an equal number may have received Finnish citizenship. In 2014 there were 16,721 Somali speakers in Finland.Statistics Finland - Statistical databases According to the Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, the number of Somali-speaking people in Finland in 2010 rose by nearly 10% in a year.Helsingin Sanomat =Germany= =Netherlands= From 1989 to 1998, the Netherlands was the second-most common European destination for Somali immigrants, only slightly behind the United Kingdom and more than double the total of the next-most common destination, Denmark. Between 2000 and 2005, there was a significant exodus of Somalis from the Netherlands to the United Kingdom, unofficially estimated to be as large as 20,000 people. The exodus was partly the result of anti-Muslim sentiments in the Netherlands in the wake of the rise of and assassination of right-wing politician Pim Fortuyn. According to the Somali European Forum, the exodus started earlier due to the Somalis not wanting to adapt to the assimilation process Dutch authorities imposed on them which they felt tried to change their culture. In 2012, unemployment was particularly high among Somali immigrants at 37%, while unemployment for all non-Western population was at 16%. According to official statistics on immigrants, Somalis had higher unemployment and dependance on social welfare while the crime rate of young male Somalis was high.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimate of 2018 indicates that 108,000 Somalis live in the UK. There has also been some secondary migration of Somalis from mainland European countries to the United Kingdom. According to the 2011 UK Census, 71.5% of Somalia-born residents in England and Wales hold a UK passport. Established Somali communities are found in London, Birmingham, Liverpool, Cardiff and Bristol, and newer ones have formed in Manchester, Sheffield and Leicester.

They were primarily seamen and New York City was their destination. In the late 1970s, more Somali immigrants followed. Not until the 1990s when the civil war broke out in Somalia did the majority of Somalis come to the US. The heaviest concentrations are in the Twin Cities (Minneapolis and St. Paul), followed by Columbus, Ohio; Atlanta, Georgia; Washington, D.C.; New York City; Buffalo, New York; Seattle; Kansas City; Chicago; Lewiston, Maine; San Diego; San Francisco; Sacramento, California; Shelbyville, Tennessee; and especially Omaha, Nebraska Metro areas. =Canada= Canada hosts one of the largest Somali populations in the Western world, with the 2011 National Household Survey reporting 44,995 people claiming Somali descent, though an unofficial estimate placed the figure as high as 150,000 residents.; *N.B. 44,995 individuals reported Somali ethnicity in 2011 National Household Survey - c.f.

Relations between the modern-day territories of Somalia and Yemen stretch back to antiquity. A number of Somali clans trace descent to the latter region. During the colonial period, disgruntled Yemenis from the Hadhrami wars sought and received asylum in various Somali towns. Yemen in turn unconditionally opened its borders to Somali nationals following the outbreak of the civil war in Somalia in the early 1990s. In 2015, after the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen, many returning Somali expatriates as well as various foreign nationals began emigrating from Yemen to northern Somalia.

Along with her twin sister Miriam, Kor was subjected to human experimentation under the direction of SS Doctor Josef Mengele at the Auschwitz concentration camp in German-occupied Poland during World War II. Her parents and two older sisters were killed in the gas chambers at Birkenau; only she and Miriam survived. Kor founded the organization CANDLES (an acronym for \\"Children of Auschwitz Nazi Deadly Lab Experiments Survivors\\") in 1984 and through this program located 122 other survivors of Mengele. In 1984, Kor founded the CANDLES Holocaust Museum and Education Center to educate the public about eugenics, the Holocaust, and the power of forgiveness. After meeting Hans M√ºnch, Kor received international attention when she publicly forgave the Nazis for what had been done to her. This story was later explored in the 2006 documentary Forgiving Dr. Mengele. She authored or co-authored six books, and took part in numerous memorial services and projects. Early life On the location of the Moses family house in Por≈£, RomaniaEva Mozes was born in 1934 in Por≈£, Kingdom of Romania, to Alexander and Jaffa Mozes, farmers who were the only Jewish residents in the area. She had three siblings named Edit, Aliz, and her twin sister Miriam. In 1940, when Eva and Miriam were five, a Hungarian armed guard occupied their village. In the spring of 1944, the family was transported to the regional ghetto at Cehei in ≈ûimleu Silvaniei. During their time at the ghetto, the family had no housing but had to make tents out of sheets. A few weeks later they were transported to the Auschwitz concentration camp. The Holocaust Eva Mozes Kor, her twin sister Miriam, two older sisters and parents were deported from the Cehei ghetto to Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in May 1944. After a two-day journey in cattle cars, they arrived at Auschwitz II-Birkenau. An SS guard approached Eva‚Äôs mother during the selection of new arrivals (those to work and those to go straight to the gas chambers) demanding to know if Eva and Miriam were twins. When she said yes, the twins were immediately taken away despite her mother's protests. Kor said that was the last time she ever saw her mother, her arms were stretched out in despair as she was pulled away. \\"I never even got to say goodbye to her. But I didn't really understand that this would be the last time we would see her\\", she said. The twins spent the next 10 months in this camp until their liberation being subject to experimentation led by SS Doctor Josef Mengele . In her documentary Forgiving Dr. Mengele, Kor mentions that her weekly ordeal would be twofold. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays the Nazi doctors would put her and her twin, and many other twins, naked in a room for six to eight hours and then measure every part of their bodies. Data would compare the two twins and then against previous measurements. On Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, SS doctors would take Eva to a blood lab and tie both of her arms to restrict blood flow, then a large amount of blood would be taken from the left arm while a minimum of five injections with unknown substances would be given in the right arm. After some injections, Eva became very ill with a very high fever while her legs and arms became swollen and painful; she was trembling as the August sun burned her skin and she had huge red spots covering her body. She was taken to Dr. Mengele, who checked her fever instead of taking her measurements. She remembers him saying that she was going to die within two weeks. Kor was taken to the hospital barracks. During that time, she only has one clear memory of the two weeks she spent there: crawling across the floor (because she was no longer able to walk) to reach a faucet with water. As she crawled, she faded in and out of consciousness, telling herself, \\"I must survive, I must survive\\". After two weeks, her fever broke and she was reunited with her sister three weeks later. On January 27, 1945, the Red Army liberated Auschwitz. Kor and her sister were among approximately 180 children, most of whom were twins, to survive the camp. First they were sent to a convent in Katowice, Poland, which was being used as an orphanage. By searching a nearby displaced person's camp, Eva and Miriam located Rosalita Csengeri, a friend of their mother who also had twin daughters used by Mengele. Csengeri took responsibility for Eva and Miriam, helping them return to Romania. Later life After the war, Eva and Miriam lived in Cluj, Romania, with their Aunt Irena (also a survivor) where they went to school and attempted to recover from their experiences at Auschwitz and adjust to life under Communist rule. In 1950, at age 16, they both received permission to leave Romania and immigrated to Israel, arriving in the port city of Haifa. They both served in the Israeli army. Both Eva and Miriam attended an agricultural school as they adjusted to life after the Holocaust. Eva became a draftsman and attained the rank of Sergeant Major in the Israeli Army Engineering Corps. In 1960, Eva married Michael Kor, an American citizen and a fellow Holocaust survivor, and she joined him in the United States. In 1965, Eva Kor became a US citizen. In 1978, after NBC's miniseries The Holocaust aired, she and Miriam, who was still living in Israel, began locating other survivors of the experiments. In 1984, Eva founded CANDLES. Into adulthood, Eva suffered numerous health problems that she believed were a result of her treatment and experiments at Auschwitz. Because Miriam had kidney problems after her last pregnancy, Eva donated one of her kidneys to Miriam, saying: \\"I have one sister and two kidneys, so it was an easy choice\\". Miriam died in 1993 of kidney cancer.https://sfi.usc.edu/sites/default/files/a70...bios/Miriam%20Mozes%20Zeiger.pdf Activism Eva was highly active through the time of her death, traveling around the world lecturing and presenting, and also gave guided tours of Auschwitz. She returned to Auschwitz on numerous occasions, often accompanied by friends and members of the community. This pilgrimage took place each summer. In 2007, Kor worked with Indiana state legislators Clyde Kersey and Tim Skinner to gain passage of a law requiring Holocaust education in secondary schools. She was featured in the January 2015 CNN documentary \\"Voices of Auschwitz\\" and CNN's \\"Incredible survivors\\". in 2016. In April 2015, she traveled to Germany to testify in the trial of former Nazi Oskar Gr√∂ning. During this trial, Kor and Gr√∂ning shared an embrace and a kiss, with Kor thanking Gr√∂ning for his willingness, at age 93, to testify as to what happened more than 70 years ago. On January 23, 2016, Kor became the focus of a new documentary out of Britain by Channel 4 titled The Girl Who Forgave the Nazis. This explores the meeting between Kor and Groening. In 2016, Kor traveled to Los Angeles, California, to be one of 13 Holocaust survivors immortalized using the latest technology in the University of Southern California's New Dimensions in Testimony Project. The project is a collaborative effort between the USC Institute for Creative Technologies, USC Shoah Foundation and Conscience Display. Kor was the subject of a documentary by Ted Green Films and WFYI Indianapolis, entitled Eva that premiered on April 5, 2018, at Butler University. Kor came to the realization as an adult that in order for her to heal, she must forgive those people who did horrible things to her in the camps. She spent months writing letters to those who hurt her. She even wrote one to \\"The Angel of Death\\". These were very hard for her to write but through this she felt she became a happier and healthier person. Not everyone has agreed with her decision to forgive but she felt it was best for her and the right thing to do. Death On July 4, 2019, Kor died while in Krak√≥w, Poland, accompanying a CANDLES group on an educational trip to Auschwitz. She was 85 years old. She made the trip annually to share her childhood experiences and give tours from her perspective as a survivor. On 12 July, Kor was featured in the BBC Radio 4 obituary programme Last Word. Awards and honours Kor has been recognised by four Indiana governors: twice with the Sagamore of the Wabash Award, once with Indiana's Distinguished Hoosier Award, and once in 2017 with the Sachem Award, the highest honour of the state of Indiana. In April 2017, Kor was also named the Grand Marshal of the Indianapolis 500 Festival Parade. In May 2015, she received an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Butler University in Indianapolis, Indiana. She also received the 2015 Wabash Valley Women of Influence Award, sponsored by the United Way of the Wabash Valley, the 2015 Anne Frank Change the World Award from the Wassmuth Center for Human Rights in Boise, Idaho, and the 2015 Mike Vogel Humanitarian Award, in Indianapolis, Indiana.

Early life Burn was born in Scotland, the son of David Burn and his wife, Jacobina, n√©e Hunter (1763‚Äì1851). David Burn senior died c.1820 and Jacobina emigrated to Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania) and became the first woman there to have land granted to her. David junior had a brief career in the navy joined his mother in Van Diemen's Land in 1826. He failed to qualify for a land grant returned to Edinburgh in 1829, divorcing his wife there. Career On 8 and 10 September 1829 Burn's play, The Bushrangers, was acted at the Caledonian Theatre, Edinburgh, with success. Early in January 1830 his farce, Manias and Maniacs (afterwards renamed Our First Lieutenant) was played at the same theatre for several successive nights. In 1830 Burn returned to Van Diemen's Land and revisited England with his mother in 1836. He remained until 1840; the dedication of his pamphlet Vindication of Van Diemen's Land is dated 18 February 1840, and in 1841 he brought out another pamphlet, The Chivalry of the Mercantile Marine, published at Plymouth. He contributed a serial in the Colonial Magazine of 1840-1841, Van Diemen's Land, which has been reprinted in book form in 1973 as A Picture of Van Diemen's Land. Burn published a pamphlet Vindication of Van Diemen's Land in A Cursory Glance at Her Colonists as They Are, Not as They Have Been Represented To Be (London, 1840). Burn returned to Van Diemen's Land and published his Plays and Fugitive Pieces in Verse in 1841; the dedication to Lady Franklin is dated November 1842. This book, in two well-printed volumes bound in one, was the first volume of plays published in Australia. In 1842 he visited Port Arthur penal colony and its cemetery, Isle of the Dead. Around this time he probably wrote his An Excursion to Port Arthur in 1842, of which an edition was published at the Examiner office, Launceston, some 60 years later. Burn accompanied Sir John and Lady Jane Franklin on their expedition to the west coast of Tasmania in 1842 which was described in his Narrative of the Overland Journey ‚Ä¶ From Hobart Town to Macquarie Harbour, 1842 (published in Sydney 1955 with notes by G. Mackaness). Burn was editing the South Britain or Tasmanian Literary Journal in 1843, and afterwards went to Sydney and Auckland, where he lived for many years. He was connected with the New Zealand press, at first on the New Zealander and later as a partner in the New Zealand Herald. Death and legacy Burn died in prosperous circumstances at Auckland on 14 June 1875, he had two children and was married twice. He was a prodigious writer and many of his manuscripts are preserved at the Mitchell library, Sydney, including his reminiscences and diaries. He was also author of Van Diemen's Land, Moral, Physical and Political, and Strictures on the Navy. References *D. H.

In some countries it is primarily for students who are considered at risk of not graduating at the normal pace. The requirements to graduate are the same, but the scheduling is more flexible to allow students to earn their credits at a slower pace. Denmark The Danish continuation schools (Danish: Efterskole) cover 8th to 10th forms and comprise a broad range of school types. The schools specialize in different educational themes or specific youth-groups. Typical examples are sports, outdoor activities and various creative arts productions. Many continuation schools in Denmark are boarding schools and a stay is normally privately funded by school-fees. The majority of attending pupils have chosen a continuation school after having finished their elementary school programs at the 9th form. The admission to continuation schools has increased in the 2000s and the association of Danish Industry has criticized this new development as too costly for society, and a waste of a full year during a labor shortage. A few continuation schools in Denmark deal specifically with young people with a troubled or criminal history. Disciplinary precautions are somewhat limited, with restraints and physical interactions not allowed. In some cases this has resulted in up to between 25 and 33 percent of the youth being expelled during a year at some schools.Center-validering: Efterskole Information A single incident (January 2000) led one school to expel 23 percent of its students at once. revised 21 November 2006 by Erling Andersen Most of these continuation schools incorporate therapy and are similar to therapeutic boarding schools, but this concept is not known in Denmark. Lately, some families who have immigrated to Denmark and have little understanding for the highly developed Danish youth culture are seeking strict orthodox Christian continuation schools for their children.Gudl√∏shed skr√¶mmer mere end tro, by Jeppe Bangsgaard og Bodil Jessen og Christian N√∏rr, Berlingske Tidende, January 26, 2009 The number of teenagers placed at these schools seemed to have been increasing since the Danish government took action against re-educational stays in the originally homeland. For a number of years Efterskoleforeningen (the association of Continuation Schools) have tried to target this parent-group with an offer to detain their children and keep them \\"safe\\" from the challenging parts of the regular youth culture.Efterskolen kan give unge indvandrere k√∏rekort til livet, by Maria Bendix Olsen, Kristeligt Dagblad, May 1, 2007 In 2010 the Danish government announced, that they would reduce the grants for students so the parents would have to pay a larger percentage of the cost for having a child attending the schools. A massive press campaign launched by Efterskoleforeningen inspired the government to adjust the grant-cuts slightly.Besparelser p√• efterskoler rammer f√¶rre, Danmarks Radio, November 6, 2010 USA = California = In October 2008, there were 525 continuation high schools in California with an estimated enrollment of 70,937.http://www.cde.ca.gov/sp/eo/ce/cefcontinuationed.asp  California qualifying process for continuation high school  Counselors, site administration, and/or district administration can determine candidates for continuation high school; most candidates are recommended by on-site school counselors. Baseline qualifications for continuation high school vary district to district but all qualified candidates must undergo an academic review process. Schools that receive additional counselor funding under California AB 1802 state legislation are required to follow the bill stipulations for students who are at risk. First, the stipulations include using an academic review process for all students and thus identifying students who are at risk of not graduating on time. Qualifications for being classified as at risk include, but are not limited to, credit deficiencies, poor attendance, drug users, and/or behavior issues. Second, stipulations require counselors to develop a list of coursework for continuing his or her education if he or she fails to meet graduation requirements. As a result, in many cases continuation high school fits the needs of those students who were identified as at risk.http://www.hatchingresults.com  Features of continuation high schools in California  Continuation high schools in California were created with the objective of meeting the needs of high school students. For such purpose, students from sixteen to eighteen years of age attend these schools. In order to graduate, students must complete the requirements set by the Department of Education in California. Continuation high schools require students to take the California High School Exit Exam (CAHSEE), which measures student growth in mathematics, reading, and writing. However, students still receive a high school diploma once they have completed the required credits. Continuation high schools are required, by law, to provide classes for students for a minimum of fifteen hours per week or 180 minutes per day. However, some schools choose to run the school day for a longer period of time. A unique feature of continuation high schools in California is the variety of programs offered to students. Such programs include career orientation and counseling, work study assistance, job placement, etc. See also *Therapeutic boarding school *Behavior modification facility External links *Model Continuation High School candidates in California for the year 2004 *California Continuation Education Association Notes School types ","title":"Continuation high school"},{"id":"9662500","text":"The Ss.

A second wine is produced under the label L'H√©ritage de Chasse-Spleen and another titled l'Oratoire de Chasse-Spleen. History Long viewed as the leading cru of Moulis, the estate's viticultural history is documented back to 1560, and possibly before. Initially an estate named Grand-Poujeaux, it was owned by the seigneurs Grenier, which may have evolved into Gressier. The estate was divided in 1822 due to inheritance complications, with half the property becoming Ch√¢teau Gressier-Grand-Poujeaux, and the remainder being passed to the Castaing family. Further divisions in the 1860s resulted in what would become Chasse-Spleen, and the ch√¢teaux Maucaillou and Poujeaux. One account explaining the estate's name comes from a visit by Lord Byron in 1821, when he became so enthralled by the vines that he said, \\"Quel remede pour chasser le spleen\\", or alternately attributed to the poem Spleen whose author Charles Baudelaire once visited the property. After the death of the last Castaing, from 1909 to 1914 Chasse-Spleen was owned by the Segnitz family, north-German wine merchants who contributed to the quality and reputation of the estate, but after the outbreak of World War I the estate was confiscated as \\"enemy property\\", and eventually bought by auction in 1922 by the Lahary family. After maintaining the reputation of the wine for several decades, Chasse- Spleen was sold in 1976 to a consortium controlled by the Merlaut family, eventual owners of ch√¢teaux including Gruaud-Larose, Ferri√®re, Citran and Haut-Bages-Lib√©ral. After changing career from teacher to winemaker, Jacques Merlaut's daughter Bernadette Villars and her husband took control of the estate and with the collaboration of Professor √âmile Peynaud, great improvements to the facilities and quality of wine followed. She became a figure of renown before she and her husband died in a mountaineering accident in the Pyrenees in 1992. Currently, the estate is run by her daughter C√©line Villars-Foubet. Her sister, Claire Vilars Lurton, took over the management of Ch√¢teaux FERRIERE, Haut-Bages Liberal and La Gurgue Production The vineyard area extends 80 hectares, with the grape varieties of 73% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot and 7% Petit Verdot. On average 28,000 cases are produced annually of the Grand vin, and of the two second wines L'H√©ritage de Chasse-Spleen and l'Oratoire de Chasse-Spleen, there is produced approximately 14,000 cases.

The concept was agreed upon in 1998 at the Ministerial Conference of the Greater Mekong Subregion, organized in Manila, the Philippines. This corridor became operational on December 12, 2006. The economic corridor is created based on a road of 1,450 km with the west end at port city of Mawlamyine (Myanmar), crossing Kayin Division, Thai provinces of Tak, Sukhothai, Phitsanulok, Phetchabun, Khon Kaen, Kalasin and Mukdahan, the Laotian province of Savannakhet, and the Vietnamese provinces of Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã, Th·ª´a Thi√™n‚ÄìHu·∫ø Province and ƒê√† N·∫µng city as the east end. From Myanmar it is further connected to India via India‚ÄìMyanmar‚ÄìThailand Trilateral Highway which is being upgraded, with most part already completed and remaining upgrade will be completed by 2020. By using the East‚ÄìWest Economic Corridor, the travel time between Bangkok and Yangon is three days, compared with the two to three weeks needed for conventional marine transportation via the Straits of Malacca.

He is always in contact with the Iraqi refugees that seek services at his center. A community of about 15,000 Iraqis that migrated from Saudi Arabia and the surrounding countries has improved rapidly over the short period of time as residents. Since the fall of the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein the Iraqis at home have been given a chance to go back to their homeland and visit their families.

He ruled every giudicato on the island of Sardinia at one point or another save Arborea. By a pact signed November 1218 with Marianus II of Torres, his father secured his marriage to Adelasia, Marianus' eldest child. The marriage was celebrated in 1219. Pope Honorius III, enemy of the Pisans, immediately sent his chaplain Bartolomeo to annul the marriage, but he failed and the pact between Pisa and Logudoro stood. Ubaldo inherited the Giudicato of Gallura in 1225. In 1230, when his uncle, Ubaldo I Visconti, died, he invaded the giudicato of Cagliari to assure the continued influence of his Pisan family there. He subsequently exercised the regency for Benedetta until 1232. Marianus died in 1232 and, by his will, was succeeded by his son Barisone III. Upon Barisone's death (1236) without heirs, also as stipulated by Marianus' will, the Logudorese magnates elected one of his daughters, Adelasia or Benedetta, to inherit. They unanimously acclaimed Adelasia, whose husband could well uphold her right. So they in turn elected him judge as well. In 1237, Pope Gregory IX sent his chaplain Alexander to Torres to receive recognition from Adelasia of papal suzerainty. At the palace of Ardara, in the presence of the Camaldolese abbot and monks of S. Trinit√† di Saccargia, she made the oath of vassalage and Ubaldo affirmed it, giving over the castle of Monte Acuto to the bishop of Ampurias as a guarantee of his good faith. Ubaldo did not, however, recognise any authority over Gallura other than the ancient authority of the Pisan archdiocese. Ubaldo drew up a will in January 1237 at Silki. His nephew John was nominated to succeed him, but his widow's second husband, Enzo, took control of both Gallura and Logudoro and was granted the title King of Sardinia by his father, the Emperor Frederick II.
