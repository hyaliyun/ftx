He is a son of the author Sloan Wilson and co-founder of the Evolution Institute. Academic career Wilson graduated with a B.A. with high honors in 1971 from the University of Rochester. He then completed his Ph.D. in 1975 at Michigan State University. He then worked as a Research Fellow in the Biological Laboratories at Harvard University from 1974-1975. He then held a dual position as a Research Associate in Zoology at the University of the Witwatersrand and the University of Washington from 1975 to 1976. After this he was a Senior Research Officer at the South African National Research Institute for the Mathematical Sciences from 1976 to 1977. Wilson moved back to the United States and held an Assistant Professorship in the Division of Environmental Studies at the University of California, Davis, from 1977 to 1980. He then served as an Assistant and then Associate Professor at the Kellogg Biological Station and Department of Zoology of Michigan State University from 1980 to 1988. Wilson was then promoted to full Professor of Biological Sciences at the State University of New York, Binghamton, in 1988. He was then given a joint appointment as Professor of Anthropology in 2001. Wilson started the Evolutionary Studies (EvoS) program at Binghamton University to provide a program that unifies diverse disciplines under the theory of evolution. Students in the program take evolution-themed courses in a variety of disciplines including biology, anthropology, psychology, bioengineering, philosophy, religion and the psychology of religion. There is also a required course called \\"Current Topics in Evolutionary Studies\\", where students attend weekly seminars with a discussion followed afterward. SUNY New Paltz has started a similar program. Research Wilson is a prominent proponent of the concept of group selection (also known as multi-level selection) in evolution. He and Elliott Sober proposed a framework called multilevel selection theory, which incorporates the more orthodox approach of gene-level selection and individual selection, in their book Unto Others. This framework argues that while genes serve as the means by which organisms' designs are transmitted across generations, individuals and groups are vehicles for those genes and both are arenas for genes to act on. Indeed, genes themselves can be affected by selection, not just because of their effects on the design of their vehicle (the organism) but also because of their effect on the functioning of the DNA on which they reside. Hence the notion of multilevel selection. Wilson has also coined the concept of a trait- group, a group of organisms linked not permanently as a group but having a shared fate due to interactions that they have. Wilson has described himself as an \\"enthusiastic proponent\\" of the extended evolutionary synthesis.\\"David Sloan Wilson Interview\\". Retrieved July 1, 2018.

Loro Parque (Spanish for \\"parrot park\\") or 'Loro Park' is a zoo on the outskirts of Puerto de la Cruz on Tenerife, Spain where it houses an extensive and diverse reserve of animal and plant species. The park was conceived as a paradise for parrots and has developed over the years into one of the biggest attractions of the Canary Islands, with over 40 million visitors. The park keeps orcas, which has attracted criticism from some organisations. History Since 1972 when the park was founded by Wolfgang Kiessling and opened on with 150 parrots, it has grown to and is home to some 4000 parrots representing 350 species and sub-species, as well as many other animals. This parrot collection is the largest in the world and makes the park one of the main references in the study and conservation of these animals worldwide. Other records the park has set include Europe's largest dolphin show pool, the world's largest indoor penguin exhibition, the longest shark tunnel in Europe, and the largest Thai village outside Thailand, and the park is only the second place in Europe to house orcas. The owners of Loro Parque have constructed another park in the south of the island called Siam Park, which opened in 2008 and claims to be the biggest water park in Europe. Birds There are parrots, black swans, golden pheasants, great curassows, laughing kookaburra, flamingos and pelicans in the park. Here is the list of some parrot species, including parakeets, macaws, cockatoos and amazons living at Loro Parque: Other animals In addition to dolphins and penguins, some of the other creatures on display in the park are common chimpanzees, western gorillas, marmosets, California sea lions, Oriental small-clawed otter, jaguars, tigers, iguanas, American alligator, giant Gal√°pagos tortoises, exotic fish, red- bellied piranhas, seahorses, and various sharks. =Orcas= In February 2006, Loro Parque received four young orcas: two males, Keto (born in 1995) and Tekoa (2000), and two females, Kohana (2002) and Skyla (2004) on loan from SeaWorld. SeaWorld sent its own professionals, including trainers, curators and veterinarians, to supplement the staff at Loro Parque to assist with the orcas move. In 2004 and 2005, before the orcas were brought to Loro Parque, eight animal trainers from the park were sent to SeaWorld parks in Texas and Florida for training. On 13 October 2010, Kohana, an eight-year-old female orca, gave birth to a male calf in the park's \\"Orca Ocean\\" exhibit after a four-hour labor. The calf weighed in at about and was two meters () long. Kohana rejected her calf, forcing trainers to take the first steps in hand rearing him. Kohana's calf was named Ad√†n, meaning \\"first man\\" in Spanish. Ad√†n has been introduced to his dad Keto, his uncle Tekoa, his mom Kohana, his aunt Skyla, his friend Morgan and Victoria, his deceased little sister. In November 2011, Loro Parque received its sixth orca, Morgan, who was rescued in the Netherlands on 23 June 2010. After spending a year and a half in a small tank in the Netherlands, under much controversy, Morgan was moved to Loro Parque. Claims were made that Morgan was unable to be released due to the lack of skills she would need to survive in the wild and that she was only approximately 2 or 3 at the time of her rescue. In 2012 scientists confirmed that Morgan suffers a hearing loss that could be very severe and even absolute. On 3 August 2012, Kohana, then ten years old, gave birth to a female calf named Vicky after a two-hour labor. The calf weighed in at and measured long. This calf has also been rejected by her mother, resulting in another hand-reared orca. Vicky died unexpectedly on 16 June 2013. Her cause of death was later revealed to be intestinal problems. In summer of 2018, SeaWorld relinquished ownership of the orcas giving full ownership to Loro Parque. As of 2020, there 7 orcas in Loro Parque : Keto (M-25 years old), Tekoa (M-19 years old), Kohana (F-18 years old), Skyla (F-16 years old), Morgan (F-13 years old), Ad√†n (M-10 years old) and Ula (F-2 years old). =Dolphins= Loro Parque also presents 10 bottlenose dolphins, including 3 caught in the 1980s off Florida and 7 born in captivity : Paco (M), Ruffles (F), Pacina (F), Ulisse (M), Luna (F), Clara (F), Cesar (M), Achille (M), Ilse (F) and Robin (M). Plants For visitors interested in plants, there is a large orchid garden with very rare plants. Shows Shows in the park include sea lions (5 times a day), dolphins (4 times), parrots (The Loro Show - 6 times), nature vision (an indoor cinema playing a 20 minute long film - 9 times) and the orca show (3 times). Other attractions include the children's playground \\"Kinderlandia,\\" Gambian Market, a parrot baby station, a huge parrot museum and many restaurants. The pre-title sequence (narrated by Stephen Fry) of the 2005 movie The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was filmed at Loro Parque. Loro Parque's Dolphin Show Loro Parque's Orca Show Foundation In 1994 Loro Parque founded the Loro Parque Fundaci√≥n, an international foundation member of IUCN set up to highlight the need for conservation of nature and the environment. The foundation has carried out 82 conservation projects in 28 countries throughout the world, of which 31 keep being active with approximately 150 persons working daily for the conservation of nature. Since its creation they have spent more than $10,000,000 in such projects. The foundation is particularly active in conserving the most endangered parrot species in the world, both with captive breeding such as with the critically endangered Spix's macaw, and field projects such as with the equally critically endangered indigo-winged parrot). Between 2017 and 2019 the foundation assisted in releasing fourteen captive-bred macaws of the critically endangered Ara ambiguus ssp. guayaquilensis into the private Ayampe Reserve in Esmeraldas Province, Ecuador. Incidents In 1996, Tony Silva, Loro Parque's Curator of Birds from 1989 to 1992, was convicted of conspiracy to smuggle rare birds valued at more than US$1.3 million into the United States. Silva began smuggling birds in 1986 and the conspiracy continued while he was curator at Loro Parque.Did birdman smuggle endangered species?A Defender of Rare Birds Is Guilty of Smuggling ThemSmuggler Of Birds Sentenced In October 2007, apprentice trainer Claudia Vollhardt was attacked by Tekoa (an orca) and hospitalised.http://www.abc.es/20101101/comunidad- canarias/responsables-orcas-reconoce-agresion-20101101.html After this attack, the trainers ceased to do waterwork for more than six months, and never again with Tekoa. A few months later, on Christmas Eve of 2009, 29-year-old Alexis Mart√≠nez was killed by Keto. After spending two and a half minutes at the bottom of the 12-meter deep main pool, his body was retrieved but could not be revived. He went into cardiac arrest in the ambulance on the way to BelleVue Medical Center in Puerto de la Cruz, and was pronounced dead. His funeral was held the following day, and his ashes were spread at Playa El Socorro at sunset. Since then, the trainers do not enter the water with any of the orcas. The park initially characterized the death as an accident. However, the autopsy report stated that Mart√≠nez died due to grave injuries caused by an orca attack, including multiple compression fractures, tears to vital organs, and bite marks. During the investigation into the death of Alex Martinez, it came to light that the park had also mischaracterised to the public the 2007 incident with Tekoa, and claimed it was also an accident rather than an attack. It was also revealed that only half of the original trainers are currently employed in Orca Ocean, Loro Parque's facility for the orcas, and none of the subsequent employees hired have been sent to Sea World parks for training. However, they did pass several training courses under the supervision of the other trained members. Criticism Loro Parque has been criticised by a number of organizations, mostly for its use of orcas. The Free Morgan Foundation campaigns for the release of Morgan, an orca held at Loro Parque, saying that she has been \\"bullied and attacked by the other orca on a regular basis\\" and that Tekoa, another orca held at the park, \\"is the most bitten orca in all the orca held in captivity around the world\\". Whale and Dolphin Conservation (WDC) also criticizes Loro Parque's handling of Morgan. Specifically, they stated that \\"the permit under which Morgan was shipped to Loro Parque\\" states that \\"she should be used for scientific research\\" and that in reality, \\"Morgan makes daily appearances in the shows doing tricks for the paying public\\". PETA also criticizes Loro Parque, stating that \\"experts have identified health problems and psychological distress in the orcas at Loro Parque\\". These problems include missing teeth, rake marks and mucus dripping from their eyes. They also mention the abnormal behaviour of \\"floating on the surface of the water\\" which they say is \\"unheard of among wild orcas\\". On 29 July 2018 Thomas Cook announced that it would stop selling tickets to Loro Parque over \\"animal welfare concerns\\". Awards In 2018 Loro Parque was recognised for the second time as the best zoo in the world by TripAdvisor by winning the 'Travellers Choice' award. On 27 September 2000, Loro Parque was awarded the most prestigious prize that the Canary Islands Government gives in the field of tourism, the award \\"Importante del Turismo 2000\\" (Important Tourism). Rom√°n Rodr√≠guez, president of the Government of the Canaries at the time, handed this prize over to Kiessling. This prize gives Loro Parque the gold medal for its contribution to make the Canary Islands a quality tourist destination. Kiessling was also awarded the \\"Galardones Amables del Turismo y Convivencia Ciudadana 1999\\" (Award for Friendly Tourism and Citizen Coexistence) by the Centre of Enterprises and Tourism (CIT) of Santa Cruz, Tenerife, at the same time.

In partnership with Mathias Locke during the mid-18th century in London, they produced many furniture designs in the Rococo Furniture Style. However both men worked for Thomas Chippendale the elder and many of their designs appear, without acknowledgement, in his book of designs, The Gentleman and Cabinet Makers Director, published two years later. However a study of the original drawings suggests that they may have actively collaborated with Chippendale on his book. Copeland appears to have been the first manufacturing cabinetmaker who published designs for furniture. A New Book of Ornaments appeared in 1746, but it is not clear whether the engravings with this title formed part of a book, or were issued only in separate plates; a few of the latter are all that are known to exist. Between 1752 and 1769 several collections of designs were produced by Copeland in conjunction with Matthias Lock; in one of them Copeland is described as of Cheapside. Some of the original drawings are in the National Art Library at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Copeland was probably the originator of a peculiar type of chair back, popular for a few years in the middle of the 18th century, consisting of a series of interlaced circles. Much of his work has been attributed to Thomas Chippendale, and it is certain that one derived many ideas from the other, but which was the originator and which the copyist is by no means clear. He died in 1754, when, on 8 October, his apprentice was handed over to his widow Elizabeth, who continued his business in his name.

History The Campion School was founded in 1970 in Athens, Greece, by American banker and philhellene Thomas Shortell, his wife Betsy Shortell, and American businessman and later diplomat Burke O'Connor, as an independent, non-profit Anglo-American school governed by a board of trustees. The academic programme is based on the National Curriculum (England and Wales) adapted to make full use of the location and culture of Greece. Courses lead to IGCSE and the International Baccalaureate Diploma. Class sizes are generally small, and children's progress is carefully monitored by a system of class teachers, advisers and Year Tutors. The school's IGCSE and IB results are consistently well above the UK and IB averages and the school has had three students complete the IB Diploma with a score of 45, the highest grade possible. Although most students aim at university education in the United Kingdom, preparation and guidance is also given to students wishing to apply to universities in the USA, Europe and Greece. The performing arts are well represented both inside and outside the curriculum, and dramatic performances take place in each school at least once a term. Choral and instrumental groups meet on a regular basis, and individual tuition is provided in a variety of musical instruments. There is a wide range of competitive sports on offer, and students are encouraged to take part. Soccer, volleyball and basketball teams regularly play against opponents from Greece and abroad. Other activities include tennis, athletics, cross-country running, trampolining and modern dance. The School is now located in purpose-built premises in the suburb of Pallini, 16km east of the city centre, where a full range of academic, sporting and artistic facilities has been constructed. A new sports facility which includes a professional soccer pitch, running track and changing pavilion was inaugurated in May 2012. Classrooms are equipped with interactive whiteboards and Wi-Fi. The school organizes a bus service covering many suburbs in the Athens area. Each bus has an adult supervisor in addition to the driver.

The closest international airport is Istanbul Sabiha G√∂k√ßen International Airport, from Geyve. It is the third largest town of Sakarya Province in terms of area. Geyve is located at the foot of Geyve Gorge, which is set between two mountain ranges and lies along the Sakarya River. Geyve region has an impressive green landscape and productive nature. Geyve is relatively close to many important cities in Turkey; to Istanbul, 30 km to Adapazarƒ±, to Izmit, 139 km to Bursa, to Eski≈üehir, to Bolu according to Google Maps. Geography Geyve is located at the coordinates 40¬∞ 30‚Ä≤ 0‚Ä≥ N, 30¬∞ 18‚Ä≤ 0‚Ä≥ E. The highest point of Geyve is Cine Tasi Hill at and the town center elevation is . The third longest river in Turkey, Sakarya River runs through Geyve and it is perceived as an important inspiration of the town. Geyve is lying down on the North Anatolian Fault System. According to historical records, many devastating earthquakes have occurred in the last two millennia along the surrounding area. A detailed study is provided at Segment Structure of the Southern Strand of the North Anatolian Fault System and Paleoseismic Behaviour of the Gemlik Fault, NW Anatolia In recent history, on 22 July 1967, a strong, 7.2 Richter magnitude scale earthquake hit Geyve and had given considerable damage to the town. On 17 August 1999, Geyve, despite the proximity to epicenter of earthquake, was not destroyed as the neighboring Adapazarƒ± and G√∂lc√ºk. Unfortunately, Turkish earthquake scientists had made several worrying reports that the next expected Marmara earthquake could impact Geyve and Akyazƒ± region as there had been an additional fault under Geyve, which had not broken in the last 300 years. Some of the Turkish media reports regarding the statements can be found at the following links; , Sakarya River is passing through Geyve, and is one of the important water sources for the land/agriculture. Geyve Kara√ßay Creek is also passing through the town center. On June 6, 2014, Geyve has experienced a significant flooding caused by Kara√ßay Creek after heavy rain, resulting in tremendous destruction and one fatality. Economy Geyve's economy is centered in agriculture as it has a productive agricultural land. It has a mild transitional climate, carrying mixed characteristics of Mediterranean, Black Sea and Inland Anatolian climates. Geyve's climate, the Sakarya River, and its productive land allow the varieties of fruits, vegetables and grains to be produced in Geyve. Sakarya River is the main vessel of town's agriculture. Especially, the quince, cherry, apple, peach and grape of Geyve are quite well known in local and Istanbul markets. Since the end of the 1990s, Geyve has been a popular trekking destination, presenting different routes especially with its proximity to Istanbul. Alifuatpasa Train Station was serving Geyve for over 100 years until February 2012 when Ankara-Istanbul railway was closed for Ankara-Istanbul high-speed railway construction. Ankara-Istanbul high-speed railway, which is expected to be finished by 2014, will run through Geyve. Even though it is not certain, the high-speed train is expected to stop at the neighboring towns, Pamukova and Arifiye. History There is not enough scientific evidence available regarding the first settlers of Geyve. The ruins around the region do not survive, but it is almost certain that Geyve is an historical settlement dating back thousands of years. There are different claims that its origin goes to 4000 BC, and even some sources to 10000 BC.http://www.geyve.com/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=1513&Itemid;=55 Geyve region has been inhabited by Phrygians, Hitites, Lydians, Romans, Armenians, Byzantines, Turks and many other civilizations since prehistoric times. Many historical evidence from Byzantine and Roman Empire era have been discovered in Geyve.http://www.geyveyoresi.com/wp- content/uploads/2013/05/Geyveliler-Y.K.D-Geyve-Tarihine- Sahip-%C3%87%C4%B1k%C4%B1yor-Roma-ve-Bizans8.jpg Geyve was known to be one of the early Ottoman conquests. It was conquered by Osman Gazi (reigned c. 1299‚Äì1323/4), first Ottoman Sultan, in the 14th century from Byzantine Empire. The demography of the town has been significantly impacted by the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923. According to the Ottoman General Census of 1881/82-1893, the kaza of Geyve had a total population of 32.607, consisting of 22.133 Muslims, 5.873 Armenians, 4.520 Greeks, 79 Protestants, 1 Jew and 1 foreign citizen.Kemal Karpat (1985), Ottoman Population, 1830-1914, Demographic and Social Characteristics, The University of Wisconsin Press, p. 128-129. Several old photographs and evidence have been collected by a local researcher-collector in the following link.http://www.geyveyoresi.com/?s=Fehmi+B%C3%B6l%C3%BCkba%C5%9F The origin of Geyve's name is controversial. Evliya Celebi, famous Turkish-Ottoman traveller, in his Seyahatname states that Geyve's name comes from the Byzantine princess named Gekve. Geyve has also been important as it was on the historical Silk Road or Silk Route. Geyve‚ÄìTarakli road can still be accessed, even though the road lost its importance. Geyve was one of the symbolic towns in the Turkish War of Independence (1919‚Äì1923). Geyve Gorge had a strategic importance during the War of Independence. Alifuatpa≈üa, Geyve is one of the first resistance fronts of the war, commanded and led by Ali Fuat Cebesoy against British Army heading to Anatolia. The founder of the Turkish Republic, Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, visited Geyve two times in 1920 and 1922 during the War of Independence. Landmarks The most significant landmark of the town, the old bridge over Sakarya River in Alifuatpasa, was constructed in the era of Sultan Bayezid II of Ottoman Empire (reigned 1481‚Äì1512). The bridge was kept well by Ottoman Sultans as the bridge is strategically located on the Silk Road. One of the oldest photographs of the bridge (from around 1888) by a Swedish photographer, Guillaume Berggren, is depicted in the National Gallery of Canada. Another significant landmark is Elvanbey Imarethanesi,(Public Kitchen), which was constructed in 1451 by Elvanbey. It was told to be serving to the traveling dervishes of Anatolia. The building was used as Geyve Public Library between 1969 and 2013. In 2013, the building was converted to a museum. The neighboring town of Taraklƒ± presents the examples of Ottoman houses that presents examples of Ottoman style wooden houses. The well known Lake Sapanca is 32 km from Geyve. The Doƒüan√ßay Waterfall is a natural monument located in Maksudiye village of Geyve. Notable people One of the most prominent generals of Turkish War of Independence, Ali Fuat Cebesoy was buried in Alifuatpasa, Geyve, when he died at the age of 86 in 1968. In accordance with his will, he was buried to the backyard of a mosque near Geyve train station, where the first shots of the Turkish War of Independence were fired. The former coach of Fenerbahce S.K., Aykut Kocaman and the former Fenerbahce S.K. president Tahsin Kaya was born in Geyve. Roses of Geyve (Geyve'nin G√ºlleri) was cited in the famous poem of Sezai Karako√ß's Mona Roza.

Blackwell contacted local songwriter Dorothy LaBostrie to revise the lyrics, with Little Richard still playing in his characteristic style. According to Blackwell, LaBostrie \\"didn't understand melody\\" but she was definitely a \\"prolific writer\\".Brackett, David. The Pop, Rock, and Soul Reader: Histories and Debates.

Some sources considered this a pseudonym used by Specialty label owner Art Rupe to claim royalties on some of his label's songs, but others refer to songwriter Joe Lubin.[ allmusic ((( Joe Lubin > Overview )))] As possible evidence that the \\"sexual song\\" theory was created later, songwriter LaBostrie was quoted as saying, \\"Little Richard didn't write none of 'Tutti Frutti'. I'll tell you exactly how I came to write that. I used to live on Galvez Street and my girlfriend and I liked to go down to the drug store and buy ice cream. One day we went in and saw this new flavor, Tutti Frutti. Right away I thought, 'Boy, that's a great idea for a song'. So I kept it in the back of my mind until I got to the studio that day. I also wrote the flip side of 'Tutti Frutti', 'I'm Just A Lonely Guy', and a spiritual, 'Blessed Mother', all in the same day.\\" LaBostrie was still receiving royalty checks on the average of $5,000 every three to six months from the song in the 1980s. Blackwell said time constraints prevented the development of a new arrangement, so Little Richard recorded the revised song in three takes, taking about 15 minutes, with the original piano part. The song was recorded on September 14, 1955. Released on Specialty 561, the record entered the Billboard Rhythm and Blues chart at the end of December 1955 and rose to No. 2 early in February 1956. It also reached No. 21 on the Billboard pop chart. In the UK, it only scraped into the top 30 in 1957, as the B-side of \\"Long Tall Sally\\". The song, with its twelve-bar blues chord progression, provided the foundation of Little Richard's career. It was seen as a very aggressive song that contained more features of African American vernacular music than any other past recordings in this style. Richard's contract with Peacock had been purchased by Specialty Records owner Art Rupe, who also owned the publishing company that bought Richard's songs. Specialty's deal with Richard was typical of most record companies's dealings with their artists.The Life and Times of Little Richard: The Quasar of Rock. Charles White. Contributor Paul McCartney.

The beat has its roots in boogie-woogie, but Richard departed from its shuffle rhythm and introduced a new distinctive rock beat. He reinforced the new rock rhythm with a two- handed approach, playing patterns with his right hand, with the rhythm typically popping out in the piano's high register. The song's new rhythm became the basis for the standard rock beat, which was later consolidated by Chuck Berry.

Presley's version uses \\"A-wop-bop-a-loo-bop-a-lop-bam- boom!\\" for every verse, finishing the phrase with \\"bam-boom\\" instead of \\"bom- bom\\". Elvis' cut of \\"Tutti Frutti\\" was also released as part of a four track EP (RCA EPA-747) and as the b-side of \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\" (RCA 47-6636) which reached #20 on the Billboard chart. The Beatles versions According to author Mark Lewisohn in The Complete Beatles Chronicles (p. 365) The Beatles performed \\"Tutti Frutti\\" live from at least 1960 through 1962 (in Hamburg, Liverpool and elsewhere). Reportedly the lead vocal was always by Paul McCartney, but it is unknown whether their version was actually based on the one by Elvis or that of Little Richard. No recorded version is known to survive. However, according to author Allen J. Weiner in The Beatles ‚Äì The Ultimate Recording Guide (p. 225) during the massive Get Back sessions a version of \\"Tutti Frutti\\" was recorded. A few months later George Harrison played on a live version which was recorded in Copenhagen with Delaney and Bonnie and Eric Clapton which came out on an unauthorized release, though a legitimate version was also recorded in concert in England (and released in 1970). In 1972 Ringo Starr drummed on, and produced a brief version with Elton John on piano and T. Rex singer Marc Bolan on lead vocal. Lastly, in the 1990s Paul McCartney did a (professionally recorded) soundcheck singing \\"Tutti Frutti\\" but not like Elvis or Little Richard but instead like an extremely laid-back Pat Boone of 1956 (Boone's real version was more lively). The McCartney version came out on an unauthorized release, Soundcheck Songs Vol. 1) Later recordings Little Richard re-recorded the song in 1964 for Vee Jay Records' Little Richard's Greatest Hits and again in 1976 for a K-tel compilation titled Little Richard Live. Queen often played the song live, and it appears on their live recording Live at Wembley '86. Appearances in other media \\"Tutti Frutti\\" provided the title for one of the earliest books about the development of rock and roll and pop music from the 1950s, Nik Cohn's \\"Awopbopaloobop Alopbamboom\\" (1969). In the film Grease, released in the 1970s but set in the 1950s, the protagonists sing the refrain of the song together. The opening scene of the animated feature film The Brave Little Toaster played the song. In a scene in the film It Takes Two when a food fight breaks out.

The crux of this theory is that hierarchical structure in natural language maps universally onto a particular surface linearization, namely specifier-head-complement branching order. The theory derives a version of X-bar theory. Kayne hypothesizes that all phrases whose surface order is not specifier-head- complement have undergone movements that disrupt this underlying order. Subsequently, there have also been attempts at deriving specifier-complement- head as the basic word order. Antisymmetry as a principle of word order is reliant on assumptions that many theories of syntax dispute, e.g. constituency structure (as opposed to dependency structure), X-bar notions such as specifier and complement, and the existence of ordering altering mechanisms such as movement and/or copying. Asymmetric c-command The theory is based on a notion of asymmetric c-command, c-command being a relation between nodes in a tree originally defined by Tanya Reinhart (1976). Kayne uses a simple definition of c-command based on the \\"first node up\\". However, the definition is complicated by his use of a \\"segment/category distinction\\". A category is a kind of extended node; if two directly connected nodes in a tree have the same label, these two nodes are both segments of a single category. C-command is defined in terms of categories using the notion of \\"exclusion\\". A category excludes all categories not dominated by both its segments. A c-commands B if every category that dominates A also dominates B, and A excludes B. The following tree illustrates these concepts: center AP1 and AP2 are both segments of a single category. AP does not c-command BP because it does not exclude BP. CP does not c-command BP because both segments of AP do not dominate BP (so it is not the case that every category that dominates CP dominates BP). BP c-commands CP and A. A c-commands C. The definitions above may perhaps be thought to allow BP to c-command AP, but a c-command relation is not usually assumed to hold between two such categories, and for the purposes of antisymmetry, the question of whether BP c-commands AP is in fact moot. (The above is not an exhaustive list of c-command relations in the tree, but covers all of those that are significant in the following exposition.) Asymmetric c-command is the relation that holds between two categories, A and B, if A c-commands B but B does not c-command A. This relationship is a primitive in Kayne's theory of linearization, the process that converts a tree structure into a flat (structureless) string of terminal nodes. Precedence and asymmetric c-command Informally, Kayne's theory states that if a nonterminal category A asymmetrically c-commands another nonterminal category B, all the terminal nodes dominated by A must precede all of the terminal nodes dominated by B (this statement is commonly referred to as the \\"Linear Correspondence Axiom\\" or LCA). Moreover, this principle must suffice to establish a complete and consistent ordering of all terminal nodes -- if it cannot consistently order all of the terminal nodes in a tree, the tree is illicit. Consider the following tree: center (S and S' may either be simplex structures like BP, or complex structures with specifiers and complements like CP.) In this tree, the set of pairs of nonterminal categories such that the first member of the pair asymmetrically c-commands the second member is as follows: {, , }. This gives rise to the total ordering: . As a result, there is no right adjunction, and hence in practice no rightward movement either.Since any rightward movement must also be downward movement if there are no rightward specifiers or right adjunction, and downward movement is generally assumed to be illicit. Furthermore, the underlying order must be specifier-head-complement. Derivation of X-bar theory The example tree in the first section of this article is in accordance with X-bar theory (with the exception that [Spec,CP] is treated as an adjunct). It can be seen that removing any of the structure in the tree (e.g. deleting the C dominating the 'c' terminal, so that the complement of A is [CP c]) will destroy the asymmetric c-command relations necessary for linearly ordering the terminals of the tree. The universal order Kayne notes that his theory permits either a universal specifier-head-complement order or a universal complement- head-specifier order, depending on whether asymmetric c-command establishes precedence or subsequence (S-H-C results from precedence). He argues that there are good empirical grounds for preferring S-H-C as the universal underlying order, since the typologically most widely attested order is for specifiers to precede heads and complements (though the order of heads and complements themselves is relatively free). He further argues that a movement approach to deriving non S-H-C orders is appropriate, since it derives asymmetries in typology (such as the fact that \\"verb second\\" languages such as German are not mirrored by any known \\"verb second-from-last\\" languages). Derived orders: the case of Japanese wh-questions Perhaps the biggest challenge for antisymmetry is to explain the wide variety of different surface orders across languages. Any deviation from Spec-Head-Comp order (which implies overall Subject-Verb-Object order, if objects are complements) must be explained by movement. Kayne argues that in some cases, the need for extra movements (previously unnecessary because different underlying orders were assumed for different languages) can actually explain some mysterious typological generalizations. His explanation for the lack of wh-movement in Japanese is the most striking example of this. From the mid-1980s onwards, the standard analysis of wh-movement involved the wh-phrase moving leftward to a position on the left edge of the clause called [Spec,CP] (i.e., the specifier of the CP phrase). Thus, a derivation of the English question What did John buy? would proceed roughly as follows: :[CP {Spec,CP position} John did buy what] ::wh-movement ‚Üí :[CP What did John buy] The Japanese equivalent of this sentence is as follows (See p. 461 for the Japanese example.) (note the lack of wh-movement): { border=\\"0\\" cellspacing=\\"7\\" -----  John-wa  nani-o  kaimashita  ka -----  John-topic_marker  what-accusative  bought  question_particle } Japanese has an overt \\"question particle\\" (ka), which appears at the end of the sentence in questions. It is generally assumed that languages such as English have a \\"covert\\" (i.e. phonologically null) equivalent of this particle in the 'C' position of the clause -- the position just to the right of [Spec,CP]. This particle is overtly realised in English by movement of an auxiliary to C (in the case of the example above, by movement of did to C). Why is it that this particle is on the left edge of the clause in English, but on the right edge in Japanese? Kayne suggests that in Japanese, the whole of the clause (apart from the question particle in C) has moved to the [Spec,CP] position. So, the structure for the Japanese example above is something like the following: :[CP [John-wa nani-o kaimashita] C ka Now it is clear why Japanese does not have wh-movement -- the [Spec,CP] position is already filled, so no wh-phrase can move to it. We therefore predict a seemingly obscure relationship between surface word order and the possibility of wh-movement. A possible alternative to the antisymmetric explanation could be based on the difficulty of parsing languages with rightward movement.Neeleman, Ad & Peter Ackema (2002). \\"Effects of Short-Term Storage in Processing Rightward Movement\\" In S. Nooteboom et al. (eds.) Storage and Computation in the Language Faculty. Dordrecht: Kluwer. Pages 219-256. Dynamic antisymmetry A weak version of the theory of antisymmetry (Dynamic antisymmetry) has been proposed by Andrea Moro, which allows the generation of non-LCA compatible structures (points of symmetry) before the hierarchical structure is linearized at Phonetic Form. The unwanted structures are then rescued by movement: deleting the phonetic content of the moved element would neutralize the linearization problem.Moro, A. 2000 Dynamic Antisymmetry, Linguistic Inquiry Monograph Series 38, MIT press, Cambridge, Massachusetts. From this perspective, Dynamic Antisymmetry aims at unifying movement and phrase structure, which otherwise would be two independent properties that characterize all human language grammars. Antisymmetry and ternary branching In a recent manuscript, Kayne (2010) has proposed recasting the antisymmetry of natural language as a condition on \\"Merge\\", the operation which combines two linguistic elements into one complex linguistic element. Kayne proposes that merging a head H and its complement C yields an ordered pair \\\\langle H,C \\\\rangle (rather than the standard symmetric set {H,C}). \\\\langle H,C \\\\rangle involves immediate temporal precedence (or immediate linear precedence), so that H immediately precedes (i-precedes) C. Kayne proposes furthermore that when a specifier S merges, it forms an ordered pair with the head directly, \\\\langle S,H \\\\rangle, or S i-precedes H. Invoking i-precedence prevents more than two elements from merging with H; only one element can i-precede H (the specifier), and H can i-precede only one element (the complement). Kayne (2010) notes that \\\\langle S,H \\\\rangle,\\\\langle H,C \\\\rangle is not mappable to a tree structure, since H would have two mothers, and that it has the consequence that \\\\langle S,H \\\\rangle and \\\\langle H,C \\\\rangle would seem to be constituents. He suggests that \\\\langle S,H \\\\rangle,\\\\langle H,C \\\\rangle is replaced by \\\\langle S,H,C \\\\rangle, \\"with an ordered triple replacing the two ordered pairs and then being mappable to a ternary-branching tree\\" (pp. 17). Kayne goes on to say, \\"This would lead to seeing my [(1981)]Kayne, Richard S. (1981) \\"Unambiguous Paths,\\" in Robert May and Jan Koster (eds.) Levels of Syntactic Representation. Dordrecht: Kluwer. Pages 143-183 arguments for binary branching to have two subcomponents, the first being the claim that syntax is n-ary branching with n having a single value, the second being that that value is 2. Mapping [\\\\langle S,H \\\\rangle,\\\\langle H,C \\\\rangle to \\\\langle S,H,C \\\\rangle] would retain the first subcomponent and replace 2 by 3 in the second, arguably with no loss in restrictiveness.\\" Theoretical arguments According to Kayne's Antisymmetry theory, there is no head-directionality parameter as such: it is claimed that at an underlying level, all languages are head-initial. In fact, it is argued that all languages have the underlying order Specifier-Head-Complement. Deviations from this order are accounted for by different syntactic movements applied by languages. Kayne argues that a theory that allows both directionalities would imply an absence of asymmetries between languages, whereas in fact languages are found not to be symmetrical in many respects. Some examples of linguistic asymmetries which may be cited in support of the theory (although they do not concern head direction) are listed below. * Hanging topics appear at the start of sentences, as in \\"Henry ‚Äì I've known that guy for a long time\\".Nolda, Andreas (2004). Topics Detached to the Left: On ‚ÄòLeft Dislocation‚Äô, ‚ÄòHanging Topic‚Äô, and Related Constructions in German. Berlin: ZAS Papers in Linguistics. pp. 423‚Äì448. They are not attested at the end of sentences. * Number agreement is stronger when the noun phrase precedes the verb (Greenberg's Universal 33). Examples of this are found in English sentences such as There's books on the table, where the verb frequently fails to agree with the following plural noun, and in French and Italian compound tenses, where the past participle may agree with a preceding direct object but not with a following one. * Relative clauses which precede the noun (as in Chinese and Japanese) tend to differ from those that follow the noun: they more often lack complementizers (akin to English that) or relative pronouns, and are more likely to be non-finite (this can be found, for example, in Quechuan languages.Courtney, Ellen H. (2011). \\"Learning to produce Quechua relative clauses\\". Acquisition of Relative Clauses : Processing, typology and function. John Benjamins Publishing Company. p. 150.) * Other areas in which asymmetries are found, according to Kayne, include clitics and clitic dislocation, serial verb constructions, coordination, and forward and backward pronominalization. X-bar syntactic tree showing movement of the specifier (S) relative to the head (H) and complement (C) In arguing for a universal underlying Head-Complement order, Kayne uses the concept of a probe-goal search (based on the Minimalist program). The idea of probes and goals in syntax is that a head acts as a probe and looks for a goal, namely its complement. Kayne proposes that the direction of the probe-goal search must share the direction of language parsing and production. Parsing and production proceed in a left-to-right direction: the beginning of sentence is heard or spoken first, and the end of the sentence is heard or spoken last. This implies (according to the theory) an ordering whereby probe comes before goal, i.e. head precedes complement. Kayne's theory also addresses the position of the specifier of a phrase. He represents the relevant scheme as follows: :S H [c... ~~S~~...] The specifier, at first internal to the complement, is moved to the unoccupied position to the left of the head. In terms of merged pairs, this structure can also be represented as: : This process can be mapped onto X-bar syntactic trees as shown in the adjacent diagram. Antisymmetry, then, leads to a universal Specifier-Head-Complement order. The many cases of different ordering found in various languages would have to be explained by syntactic movement away from this underlying base order. It has been pointed out, though, that in predominantly head-final languages such as Japanese and Basque, this would involve complex and massive leftward movement, which is not in accordance with the ideal of grammatical simplicity.Elordieta, Arantzazu (2014). Biberauer, T.; Sheehan, M., eds. \\"On the relevance of the Head Parameter in a mixed OV language\\". Theoretical Approaches to Disharmonic Word Order (Oxford Scholarship Online), p. 5. An example of the type of movement scheme that would need to be envisaged is provided by Tokizaki:Tokizaki, Hisao (2011). \\"The nature of linear information in the morphosyntax-PF interface\\". English Linguistics 28 (2), p. 238. # [CP C [IP ... [VP V [PP P [NP N [Genitive Affix Stem # [CP C [IP ... [VP V [PP P [NP N [Genitive Stem Affix # [CP C [IP ...

[VP [PP [NP [Genitive Stem Affix] N] P] V C] Here, at each phrasal level in turn, the head of the phrase moves from left to right position relative to its complement. The eventual result reflects the ordering of complex nested phrases found in a language like Japanese. An attempt to provide evidence for Kayne's scheme is made by Lin,Lin, Tzong-Hong J. (2006), \\"Complement-to-specifier movement in Mandarin Chinese\\". Ms., National Tsing Hua University. who considered Standard Chinese sentences with the sentence-final particle le. This particle is taken to convey perfect aspectual meaning, and thus to be the head of an aspect phrase, having the verb phrase as its complement. If phrases are always to be underlyingly head-initial, then a case like this must entail movement, since the particle comes after the verb phrase. It is proposed that here the complement moves into specifier position, which precedes the head. As evidence for this, Lin considers (among others) wh-adverbials such as zenmeyang (\\"how?\\"). Based on prior work by James Huang,Huang, C.-T. J. (1982). \\"Logical relations in Chinese and the theory of grammar\\". PhD dissertation, MIT. it is postulated that (a) adverbials of this type are subject to movement at logical form (LF) level (even though, in Chinese, they do not display wh-movement at surface level); and (b) movement is not possible from within a non-complement (Huang's Condition on Extraction Domain or CED). This would imply that zenmeyang could not appear in a verb phrase with sentence-final le, assuming the above analysis, since that verb phrase has moved into a non-complement (specifier) position, and thus further movement (such as that which zenmeyang is required to undergo at LF level) is not possible. Such a restriction on the occurrence of zenmeyang is indeed found: (a) Zhangsan zenmeyang xiu che? Zhangsan how repair car \\"How does Zhangsan repair the car?\\" (b) *Zhangsan zenmeyang xiu che le? Zhangsan how repair car PF (\\"How has Zhangsan repaired the car?\\") Sentence (b), in which zenmeyang co-occurs with sentence-final le, is found to be ungrammatical. Lin cites this and other related findings as evidence that the above analysis is correct, supporting the view that Chinese aspect phrases are deeply head-initial. = Surface true approach= According to the \\"surface true\\" viewpoint, analysis of head direction must take place at the level of surface derivations, or even the Phonetic Form (PF), i.e. the order in which sentences are pronounced in natural speech. This rejects the idea of an underlying ordering which is then subject to movement, as posited in the Antisymmetry theory and in certain other approaches. In a 2008 article, the linguist Marc Richards argued that a head parameter must only reside at PF, as it is unmaintainable in its original form as a structural parameter.Richards, Marc D. (2008). \\"Desymmetrization: Parametric variation at the PF-Interface\\". The Canadian Journal of Linguistics 53 (2-3), p. 283. In this approach the relative positions of head and complement that are actually attested at this surface level, which are found to show variation both between and within languages (see above), must be treated as the \\"true\\" orderings. =Existence of true head-final languages= Takita (2009) argues against the conclusion of Kayne's Antisymmetry Theory which states that all languages are head-initial at an underlying level. He claims that a language such as Japanese is truly head-final, since the mass movement which would be required to take an underlying head-initial structure to the head-final ones actually found in such languages would violate other constraints. It is implied that such languages are likely following a head-final parameter value, as originally conceived. (For a head-initial/Antisymmetry analysis of Japanese, see Kayne 2003.Kayne, Richard S. (2003). \\"Antisymmetry and Japanese\\". English Linguistics 20: 1‚Äì40.) Takita's argument is based on the analysis provided by Lin concerning Chinese (see above). Since surface head-final structures are derived from underlying head-initial structures from the act of moving the complements, further extraction from within the moved complement violates CED. One of the examples of movement which Takita looks at is that of VP-fronting in Japanese. Grammatically, there is not a significant difference between the sentence without VP-fronting (a) and the sentence where the VP moves to the matrix clause (b). a. [CP1 Taro-ga [CP2[IP2 Hanako-ga [VP2 hon-o sute]-sae shita to] omotteiru] Taro-NOM Hanako-NOM book-ACC discard-even did C think 'Taro thinks [that Hanako [even discarded his books ' (Takita 2009 57: (33a) b. [CP1[VP2 Hon-o sute]-saei Taro-ga [CP2[IP2 Hanako-ga shita] to] omotteiru book-ACC discard-even Taro-NOM Hanako-NOM did C think '[Even discarded his books], Taro thinks [that Hanako did ti]' (Takita 2009 57: (33b) In (b), the fronted VP precedes the matrix subject, confirming that the VP is located in the matrix clause. If Japanese were underlyingly head-initial, (b) should not be grammatical because it allows for extraction of an element (VP2) from the moved complement (CP2). Thus Takita shows that surface head-final structures in Japanese do not block movement, as they do in Chinese. He concludes that, because Japanese does not block movement as shown in previous sections, it is a genuinely head-final language, and not derived from an underlying, head- initial structure. These results imply that Universal Grammar is equipped with the binary head-directionality, and is not antisymmetric. Takita briefly applies the same tests to Turkish, another seemingly head-final language, and finds similar results.

The propellant can be divided into three groups of components: the fuel, the oxidizer, and the additive(s). In the past, sucrose was most commonly used as fuel. Modern formulations most commonly use sorbitol for its ease of production. The most common oxidizer is potassium nitrate (KNO3). Potassium nitrate is most commonly found in household stump remover. Additives can be many different substances, and either act as catalysts or enhance the aesthetics of the liftoff or flight. A traditional sugar propellant formulation is typically prepared in a 65:35 (13:7) oxidizer to fuel ratio. There are many different methods for preparation of a sugar-based rocket propellant. Dry compression does not require heating, only the grinding of the components and then packing into the motor. However, this method is not recommended for serious experimenting.Jacob's Rocketry Dry heating does not actually melt the KNO3, but it melts the sugar and then the KNO3 grains become suspended in the sugar. The specific impulse, total impulse, and thrust are generally lower for the same amount of fuel than other composite model rocket fuels, but rocket candy is significantly cheaper. In the United States, rocket candy motors are legal to make, but illegal to transport without a low explosives users permit. Since they count as amateur motors, they are typically launched at sanctioned Tripoli Rocketry Association research launches which require users to hold a Tripoli Rocketry Association high power level 2 certification. Users may also launch using these motors by applying for an FAA flight waiver. Similar laws apply in Canada, the UK, and Australia. Components Rocket candy can be broken down into three major groups of components: fuels, oxidizers, and additives. The fuel is the substance that burns, releasing rapidly expanding gases that provide thrust as they exit the nozzle. The oxidizer provides oxygen, which is required for the burning process. The additives can be catalysts, to speed up or make the burning more efficient. However, some additives are more aesthetic, and can add sparks and flames to liftoff, or add smoke for ease of following the rocket in the air. =Fuels= Many different sugars can be used as the fuel for rocket candy, including glucose, fructose, and sucrose; however, sucrose is the most common. Sorbitol, a sugar alcohol commonly used as a sweetener in food, produces a less brittle propellant with a slower burn rate. This reduces the risk of cracking propellant grains.Richard Nakka's Rocketry Site Sugars with a double bonded oxygen, such as fructose and glucose, are less thermally stable and tend to caramelize when overheated,The Jolley Rocket Site but have a lower melting point for ease of preparation. Sugars that only have alcohol groups, like sorbitol, are much less prone to this decomposition. Some other commonly used sugars include erythritol, xylitol, lactitol, maltitol, or mannitol. =Oxidizers= The oxidizer most often used in the preparation of sugar motors is potassium nitrate (KNO3). Other oxidizers can be used as well, such as sodium and calcium nitrates as well as mixtures of sodium and potassium nitrate.Serge's Rocket Workshop KNO3 can be acquired through purchasing a granular \\"stump remover\\" from stores that carry garden supplies. Other rarely used oxidizers are ammonium and potassium perchlorate. Two main issues need to be addressed with respect to the oxidizer if one is using potassium nitrate. The most important issue is the purity of the material. If a purchased material does not perform satisfactorily it may be necessary to recrystallize the KNO3. The second important issue with respect to the oxidizer portion of a propellant is its particle size. Most propellant makers prefer their KNO3 ground to a small particle size, such as 100 mesh (about 150 Œºm) or smaller. This can be done using a coffee grinder. Rock-tumblers can also be used to mill into a fine grained well mixed powder. =Additives= Left is the sample of the basic mixture, right contains 1% of red iron oxide addedAdditives are often added to rocket propellants to modify their burn properties. Such additives may be used to increase or decrease the burn rate of the propellant. Some are used to alter the color of the flame or smoke produced. They can also be used to modify a certain physical property of the propellant itself, such as plasticizers or surfactants to facilitate the casting of the formulation. There are many types of experimental additives; the ones listed here are only the most commonly used. Metal oxides have been found to increase the burn rate of sugar propellants. Such additives have been found to function best at levels from 1 to 5 percent. Most often used are iron oxides. Red iron oxide is used most often as it is somewhat easier to obtain than the yellow, brown, or black versions. Brown iron oxide exhibits unusual burn rate acceleration properties under pressure. Carbon in the form of charcoal, carbon black, graphite, etc., can be and sometimes is used as a fuel in sugar formulations. Most often, however, a small amount of carbon is used as an opacifier, making a visible smoke trail. The carbon acts as a heat sink, keeping a portion of the heat of combustion located in the propellant rather than having it transferred quickly to the motor casing. If metallic fuels such as aluminum or magnesium are used in a sugar formulation, a danger exists if traces of acids are found in the oxidizer. Acidic materials can react readily with the metal, producing hydrogen and heat, a dangerous combination. The addition of weak bases helps to neutralize these acidic materials, greatly reducing their danger. Titanium metal flake or sponge (about 20 mesh in size) is often added to sugar formulations at levels from 5 to 10% in order to produce a sparking flame and smoke on lift off. Surfactants are used to reduce the melting viscosity of sugar propellants. For example, propylene glycol helps reduce the melt viscosity of sucrose based propellants. =Formulations= A typical sugar propellant formulation is typically prepared in a 13:7 oxidizer to fuel ratio (weight ratio). However, this formulation is slightly fuel rich., and can be varied by up to 10%. There are many different possible formulations that will allow for flight in amateur rocketry. Preparation There are a number of different methods for preparing a sugar-based rocket propellant. These methods include dry compression, dry heating, and dissolving and heating. The latter two methods involve heating the propellant. In dry compression, the sugar and potassium nitrate are individually ground as finely as possible, and then mixed in a ball mill or tumbler to ensure uniform mixing of the components. This mixture is then compressed into the motor tube, similar to the method for packing black powder into a muzzle loading rifle. However, this method is rarely used for serious experiments, and careful safety considerations should be made before deciding to employ this method. There is a significant chance for self-ignition while mixing, which could lead to serious injury. Another, more common, and safer method of preparing a sugar-based rocket propellant is dry heating. First, the potassium nitrate is ground or milled to a fine powder, and then thoroughly mixed with powdered sugar which is then heated. This method does not actually melt the potassium nitrate, as the melting temperature of KNO3 is , but it melts the sugar and coats the grains of KNO3 with the melted sugar. The melting process must be performed using a heat spreader, so as to avoid creating autoignition hot- spots. James Yawn advocates for the dissolving and heating method.James Yawn Rocketry Dissolving and heating the propellant actually dissolves both elements of the propellant and combines them. First, the KNO3 and sugar are placed in a pot or saucepan. Then, just enough water is added to be able to completely dissolve the KNO3 and the sugar. The mixture is then heated and brought to a boil until the water evaporates. The mixture will go through several stages: first boiling, then bubbling and spitting, then it will turn to a smooth creamy consistency. There are several advantages to dissolving the sugar and KNO3 in water before heating. One advantage is that the KNO3 and the sugar do not have to be finely powdered, because they both end up completely dissolved. This method of preparation also causes the resultant propellant to resist caramelization in the pot, giving more time to pack it into the motors. Performance Sugar based rocket propellants have an average Isp(specific impulse) of between 115 and 130 seconds. Compare that to the average Isp of an APCP (Ammonium perchlorate composite propellant), which is 180 to 260 seconds. Sorbitol and KNO3 based propellants with a typical 35:65 ratio are capable of an Isp of between 110 and 125 seconds. However, sorbitol and KNO3 rockets with additives have been recorded as having specific impulses of up to 128 seconds. Xylitol and KNO3 based rocket propellants are capable of a specific impulse of ~100 seconds. These have an unconfined burn rate of about 1.3 mm/s. Overall, sugar rockets can compete fairly well. Dextrose and KNO3 based fuels are capable of an Isp of 137 seconds. Applications BATES grain of basic sorbitol mixtureRocket candy is also occasionally known as \\"caramel candy\\", a term that was popularized by Bertrand R. Brinley, in his pioneering book on amateur rocketry, Rocket Manual for Amateurs, published in 1960. This propellant was used in some of the amateur rockets described by Homer Hickam in his best-selling memoir Rocket Boys. Rocket candy was also employed in a small amateur rocket described by Lt. Col. Charles M. Parkin in a lengthy Electronics Illustrated article that continued over several issues, beginning in July 1958. Parkin described how to prepare the propellant mixture by using an electric frying pan as a heat source for the melting operation. This article was reprinted in Parkin's book, The Rocket Handbook for Amateurs, which was published in 1959. Parkin's article contributed to the increasing popularity of the rocket candy propellant among amateur rocket groups beginning in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The Sugar Shot to Space program was formed with the goal \\"to loft a rocket powered by a 'sugar propellant' into space\\"Sugar Shot to Space Project equivalent to in altitude.

Named as such downstream of the small town of Oronoz-Mugairi (municipality of Baztan) in the province of Navarra, the river actually results from the merger of several streams near the village Erratzu, with the stream Baztan that rises at the north-eastern side of the mount Autza (1,306 m) being considered the source of the Bidasoa. It joins the Cantabrian Sea (Bay of Biscay) between the towns of Hendaye and Hondarribia. airport, Txingudi, the SNCF facilities in Hendaye, Irun in the distance and the Santiago Bridge spanning the borderline The river is best known for establishing the borderline at its lower tract. This stretch is crossed not only by aircraft at low height but by important European communication axes, namely AP8 E5 E80 - E70 A63 (motorway, connection at the Biriatu toll), main roads N1 - N10 (connection at the roundabout of Saizar by the river) and major French and Spanish railway networks,--RENFE and SNCF. Besides these major lines, other regional ones cross it too, e.g. regional railway EuskoTren (terminus in Hendaye) and another double bridge (pedestrians/vehicles) joining the towns on the border, i.e. the historical Santiago Bridge (Way of St. James). At this stage of the river, urban landscape prevails (built-up area). Before pouring its waters into the ocean, it forms a bay called Txingudi located between these towns and Irun, the site being designated Wetland of International Importance in 2002, with a total area of 1.28 km2. The banks of Hondarribia hold the minor San Sebastian Airport serving domestic flights and currently mired in controversy over its lengthening and upgrading scheme. Pronunciation and etymology The river comprises an area of linguistic contact, so it is pronounced differently depending on the language, namely in Basque, in Spanish, and in French. Linguistic and historic research point to the name stemming from Latin phrase \\"Via ad Oiassonem\\" (later corrupting into Basque Bidasoa) on account of the road that linked at Roman times Basque town Pompaelo with Oiasso, which may have run along the river. Course of the river and tributaries Elizondo The Bidasoa flows through much of its 66 km length over Navarrese territory, except for the last 10 km, where it establishes the borderline between France and Spain, as well as the boundary between the Basque provinces of Gipuzkoa and Labourd. In line with the distribution of the river's length, the bulk of its watershed's area lies on Navarre (684 km2). The basin holds 105 permanent streams and rivers that number 497 km, the region being drenched in rains regularly. The Navarrese side of the basin (rural landscape) is inhabited by 22,000 inhabitants. 70% of its population have the sewage treated before spilling to the river. But for the first 15-odd kilometres, the river clings to the north to south disposition of other neighbouring rivers of Gipuzkoa joining the Bay of Biscay, e.g. Urumea, Oria, etc. Strengthened by the waters harvested from the sides of the pass of Belate, downstream of Doneztebe the river heads north and crosses the town of Bera at the north end of Navarre before entering Gipuzkoa at Endarlatsa. From the town of Doneztebe on, the main road N-121 runs along till the roundabout across the river from the toll of Biriatu by the AP-8 (motorway). Next comes the quarter Behobia and the major towns on the shores of the estuary. The main tributaries of the Bidasoa are the minor rivers Zeberia (length 10,80 km), Ezkurra (20,90 km), Latsa (11,10 km) and Endara (9,90 km). Additionally, further small rivers and streams feed the Bidasoa all along. Fishing and environmental challenges Aerial view of the Bidasoa's mouth and Txingudi Cohaya on the Bidassoa (in Spain) by Edward Hawke Locker in 1824, published in the work Views in Spain Bidassoa confluence in Fontarrabie, in 1843 by Eug√®ne de Malbos The Navarrese tract of the river is a preferred destination for fishing enthusiasts, the river being home to several native fish species, namely eel (Anguilla anguilla), salmon (Salmo palar), trout (Salmo trutta), bullhead (Cottus gobio), Barbatula barbatula, Phoxinus phoxinus, gudgeon (Gobio lozanoi), sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), allis shad (Alosa alosa), flounder (Platichthys flesus) and grey mullet (Chelon labrosus), some of them declared endangered species and highly interesting (especially bullhead and salmon). Moreover, a species of the Ebro, Chondrostoma miegii, has been introduced in the last 30‚Äì40 years on the lower tract of the Bidasoa, thereafter extending gradually upstream. As a result, overfishing has become a major problem for the river's fauna, with special pressure put on salmon migrating upstream to spawn. They do not make it to their goal and die before spawning, either falling prey to fishers' bait or an inability to overcome hydroelectric power stations (128 over all the course) and the 114 related dams, since 63% of them prevent migratory fish from achieving their purpose. Schemes by the Regional Government of Navarre are underway with a view to handling the issue.

He is best known for having founded one of the independent schools in Britain: Worth, in West Sussex.  Anglican background  Henry Palmer Chapman was born in Ashfield, Suffolk, the son of an Anglican canon of Ely Cathedral. Because of delicate health, Henry was, at first, educated privately at home, and then later at Christ Church, Oxford (1883‚Äì1886), where he received a first-class degree in Classical Greats. He stayed for a subsequent year at Oxford studying theology, in which he took a third (cf. the \\"gentleman's C\\" in the U.S.). It was an important year for him, however, because in this time he decided to be ordained in the Church of England.Roger Hudleston, \\"A Memoir of Abbot Chapman\\" in The Spiritual Letters of Dom John Chapman OSB, London: Sheed and Ward, 1938, p. 3. Having trained at Cuddesdon near Oxford, Chapman was ordained as a deacon in the Church of England in 1889 and began a curacy in the parish of St Pancras, London. He found himself increasingly troubled during this time about the position of the Church of England and left the parish soon after Trinity Sunday.  Conversion to Catholicism  In December 1890 Chapman was conditionally baptized in the Catholic Church at the Brompton Oratory. In April 1891 he entered the Jesuit novitiate at Manresa House, Roehampton (now Parkstead House), but after eight months had determined that his vocation was not to the Society of Jesus. He subsequently entered the Benedictine Maredsous Abbey in Belgium, where he had been preceded by a friend from Cuddesdon, Bede Camm. Chapman was given the religious name of \\"John\\", and professed simple vows on 25 March 1893. He made his solemn vows on Whitsuntide 1895. After his priestly ordination in 1895, he went to Erdington Abbey, near Birmingham, where he stayed until 1912, serving the community as novice master and later as prior,Rees, Daniel. \\"Chapman, John (1865-1933)\\", Encyclopedia of Monasticism, (William M. Johnston, ed.), Routledge, 2013, but also frequently visiting the library of St Mary's College in nearby Oscott. Having spent nine months at Maredsous, in February 1913 Chapman was made temporary superior of the Caldey island community (now based at Prinknash Abbey), when it was received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1913-14. On the outbreak of World War I (1914‚Äì1918), Chapman first became a Professor of Theology at Downside Abbey, joining the many monks who had fled Maredsous to England. In early 1915, when these monks moved to Ireland, he became army chaplain to the British forces. After initial training, his brigade arrived in France in July 1915. He lived in the trenches in autumn 1915, until a persistent knee injury led to him being hospitalized in November 1915. After leaving the hospital, he first was stationed at Boyton Camp, Wiltshire, for several months, and then returned to France. At the end of 1917, he was transferred to Switzerland, where multilingual chaplains were needed for the POW camps. He remained there until the Armistice. =4th Abbot of Downside= In 1919 Chapman transferred his monastic stability to Downside Abbey. He spent most of 1919 to 1922 in Rome, though, working on a commission on the revision of the Vulgate translation of the Bible. He returned to Downside in 1922, where in 1929 the community elected him as abbot. As 4th Abbot of Downside, during his short term of four years, cut short by his death on 7 November 1933, he carried on the work of abbots Cuthbert Butler and Leander Ramsay. He completed the transformation of Downside into a modern abbey in the mainstream of the Benedictine tradition and in 1933 became the founder of Worth Priory (which became independent of Downside in 1957 and Worth Abbey in 1965) when he bought the property, then called \\"Paddockhurst\\", from Viscount Cowdray. =New Testament and patristics scholar= John Chapman was thought by competent critics to be the greatest patristics scholar of his time. Reputedly he had read all 378 volumes of Migne. He not only read both Greek and Latin with facility, but also read and wrote French, Italian and German with ease. Many of his contributions to biblical scholarship and patristics have proved of lasting value, especially his work on Cyprian, John the Presbyter, and on the priority of the Gospel according to Matthew that, so Chapman argued in support of the early Church tradition, was the first Gospel account to have been written (see also Synoptic Problem). Among the novices that Chapman clothed in the monastic habit was in 1932 John Bernard Orchard, who soon felt drawn to follow his Abbot into researching the priority of the Gospel according to Matthew in the light of the patristic evidence, and eventually, after also constructing a synopsis of the four Gospel accounts in Greek and English for the easier study of the compositional sequence Matthew- Luke-Mark-John that is supported by certain early Christian writers, produced what by hindsight may be considered a synthesis of his and his mentor's insights. =Spiritual director= In his day Chapman was a much sought-after spiritual director and authority on prayer, the spiritual life and mystical theology. His writings remain of perennial value, especially his Spiritual Letters. An oft quoted advice of his was: \\"Pray as you can, not as you cannot!\\". =Man of many talents= According to his contemporaries, Chapman had a brilliant mind and was a fascinating conversationalist. He was also a talented pianist and a Christian humanist in the finest tradition.

He became a prolific journalist. Life He was born in the Rocks area of Failsworth, Lancashire, the son of James Brierley (born 1795), hand-loom weaver, and his wife, Esther Whitehead (died 1854). He started life in a textile factory, educating himself in his spare time. At about the age of thirty he began to contribute articles to local papers, and the republication of some of his sketches of Lancashire character in A Summer Day in Daisy Nook (1859) attracted attention. In 1863 he definitely took to journalism and literature, publishing in the same year his Chronicles of Waverlow, and in 1864 a long story called The Layrock of Langley Side (afterwards dramatised), followed by others. In April 1869 Brierley began the publication of Ben Brierley's Journal, first as a monthly and afterwards as a weekly magazine. The fifth number sold 13,000 copies. He continued to edit this until December 1891, when it ceased to appear. In 1875, Brierley was elected a member of Manchester City Council and served six years. In 1880, he paid a short visit to America and in 1884 a longer one, and embodied his impressions in his Ab-o'th'-Yate in America. He gave public readings from his own writings, and his various Ab-o'th'-Yate sketches (about America, London, etc.), and his pictures of Lancashire common life, were very popular, and were collected after his death. Having lost his savings through the failure of a building society in 1884, on 16 March 1885 he was presented with ¬£650. A few years afterwards, when his health failed, a grant of ¬£150 from the royal bounty fund was obtained for him. A further testimonial and the sum of ¬£356 were presented to him on 29 October 1892. He died on 18 January 1896. Ben Brierley's grave is in Manchester General (Harpurhey) Cemetery, Rochdale Road. On 30 April 1898, a statue in John Cassidy's honour, raised by public subscription, was unveiled at Queen's Park, Harpurhey, by George Milner, President of the Manchester Literary Club.John Cassidy.org - Images of Ben Brierley Statue. Today, Brierley is remembered in a 2006 bronze statue by Denise Dutton outside the public library, near his birthplace in the Rocks area of Failsworth. A local pub, the Ben Brierley at Moston, was named after him, but has long since closed. The building now houses the Ben Brierley Legal Advice Resource Centre.

Its themes are, like those of many of Eliot's poems, overlapping and fragmentary, but it is recognized to be concerned most with post‚ÄìWorld War I Europe under the Treaty of Versailles (which Eliot despised: compare \\"Gerontion\\"), the difficulty of hope and religious conversion, and, as some critics argue, Eliot's own failed marriage (Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot might have been having an affair with Bertrand Russell).See, for instance, the biographically-oriented work of one of Eliot's editors and major critics, Ronald Schuchard. The poem is divided into five parts and consists of 98 lines of which the last four are \\"probably the most quoted lines of any 20th-century poet writing in English\\".  Journey of the character  Eliot's characters often undergo a journey ‚Äì either physical or spiritual or both. The Hollow Men seems to follow the otherworldly journey of the spiritually dead. These \\"hollow men\\" have the realization, humility and acknowledgement of their guilt and their status as broken, lost souls. The \\"hollow men\\" fail to transform their motions into actions, conception to creation, desire to fulfillment. This awareness of the split between thought and action coupled with their awareness of \\"death's various kingdoms\\" and acute diagnosis of their hollowness, makes it hard for them to go forward and break through their spiritual sterility. And as the poem and their journey ends, they see \\"the horror, the horror\\" that Kurtz sees in the Heart of Darkness. There is a complete breakdown of language, prayer and the spirit as \\"the world ends/ Not with a bang but a whimper\\".  Theme and context  Eliot wrote that he produced the title \\"The Hollow Men\\" by combining the titles of the romance \\"The Hollow Land\\" by William Morris with the poem \\"The Broken Men\\" by Rudyard Kipling:Eliot, T. S. Inventions of the March Hare: Poems 1909‚Äì1917 (Harcourt, 1997) pp.395 Christopher Ricks, the editor, cited a letter dated 10 January 1935 to the Times Literary Supplement. but it is possible that this is one of Eliot's many constructed allusions, and that the title originates more transparently from Shakespeare's Julius Caesar or from the character Kurtz in Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness who is referred to as a \\"hollow sham\\" and \\"hollow at the core\\". The two epigraphs to the poem, \\"Mistah Kurtz ‚Äì he dead\\" and \\"A penny for the Old Guy\\", are allusions to Conrad's character and to Guy Fawkes, attempted arsonist of the English house of Parliament, and his straw- man effigy that is burned each year in the United Kingdom on Guy Fawkes Night, 5 November. Eliot's title, \\"The Hollow Men\\", obliquely acknowledges the bonfires which accompany the celebration of All Hallows' Eve, falling on 31 October, which particularly in the United States were conflated with Guy Fawkes' celebrations over the course of the 19th century. Some critics read the poem as told from three perspectives, each representing a phase of the passing of a soul into one of death's kingdoms (\\"death's dream kingdom\\", \\"death's twilight kingdom\\", and \\"death's other kingdom\\"). Eliot describes how we, the living, wish to be seen by \\"Those who have crossed/With direct eyes ... not as lost/Violent souls, but only/As the hollow men/The stuffed men.\\" The image of eyes figures prominently in the poem, notably in one of Eliot's most famous lines \\"Eyes I dare not meet in dreams\\". Such eyes are also generally accepted to be in reference to Dante's Beatrice (see below). The poet depicts figures \\"Gathered on this beach of the tumid river\\" ‚Äì drawing considerable influence from Dante's third and fourth cantos of the Inferno which describes Limbo, the first circle of Hell ‚Äì showing man in his inability to cross into Hell itself or to even beg redemption, unable to speak with God. Dancing \\"round the prickly pear,\\" the figures worship false gods, recalling children and reflecting Eliot's interpretation of Western culture after World War I. The final stanza may be the most quoted of all of Eliot's poetry: When asked in 1958 if he would write these lines again, Eliot responded with a 'no': > One reason is that while the association of the H-bomb is irrelevant to it, > it would today come to everyone's mind. Another is that he is not sure the > world will end with either. People whose houses were bombed have told him > they don't remember hearing anything.'T. S. Eliot at Seventy, and an > Interview with Eliot' in Saturday Review. Henry Hewes. 13 September 1958 in > Grant p. 705. Other significant references include the Lord's Prayer, Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, and Conrad's An Outcast of the Islands (\\"Life is very long\\"). Publication information The poem was first published as now known on 23 November 1925, in Eliot's Poems: 1909‚Äì1925. Eliot was known to collect poems and fragments of poems to produce new works. This is clear to see in his poems The Hollow Men and \\"Ash-Wednesday\\" where he incorporated previously published poems to become sections of a larger work. In the case of The Hollow Men four of the five sections of the poem were previously published: * \\"Po√®me\\", published in the Winter 1924 edition of Commerce (with a French translation), became Part I of The Hollow Men. * Doris's Dream Songs in the November 1924 issue of Chapbook had the three poems: \\"Eyes that last I saw in tears\\", \\"The wind sprang up at four o'clock\\", and \\"This is the dead land.\\" The third poem became Part III of The Hollow Men. * Three Eliot poems appeared in the January 1925 issue of his Criterion magazine: \\"Eyes I dare not meet in dreams\\", \\"Eyes that I last saw in tears\\", and \\"The eyes are not here\\". The first poem became Part II of The Hollow Men and the third became Part IV. * Additionally, the March 1925 of Dial published The Hollow Men, I-III which was finally transformed to The Hollow Men Parts I, II, and IV in Poems: 1909‚Äì1925. (Publication information from Gallup)Gallup, Donald. T. S. Eliot: A Bibliography (A Revised and Extended Edition) pp. 33, 210‚Äì11 (Harcourt Brace & World 1969).  Influence in culture  The Hollow Men has had a profound effect on the Anglo-American cultural lexicon‚Äîand by a relatively recent extension, world culture‚Äîsince it was published in 1925. One source states that the last four lines of the poem are \\"probably the most quoted lines of any 20th-century poet writing in English.\\" The sheer variety of references moves some of the questions concerning the poem's significance outside the traditional domain of literary criticism and into the much broader category of cultural studies. Examples of such influences include: =Film= * Eliot's poem was a strong influence on Francis Ford Coppola and the movie Apocalypse Now (1979), in which antagonist Colonel Kurtz (played by Marlon Brando) is depicted reading parts of the poem aloud to his followers. Furthermore, the Complete Dossier DVD release of the film includes a 17-minute special feature of Kurtz reciting the poem in its entirety. The poem's epigraph, \\"Mistah Kurtz ‚Äì he dead\\", is a quotation from Conrad's Heart of Darkness (1899), upon which the film is loosely based. * The final stanza is printed one line at a time at the beginning of the television production of Stephen King's The Stand (1994). The poem is also referenced in part by the character who feels responsible for the deadly \\"Captain Trips\\" virus being unleashed. * The trailer for the film Southland Tales (2006), directed by Richard Kelly, plays on the poem, stating: \\"This is the way the world ends, not with a whimper but with a bang.\\" The film also quotes the line a number of times, mostly in voice-overs. * Beverly Weston discusses the line \\"Life is very long\\" at the beginning of August: Osage County. * In George Cukor's classic remake of A Star Is Born (1954), Jack Carson's film studio PR man Matt Libby refers to the death of James Mason's character Norman Maine dismissively, quoting: \\"This is the way the world ends: not with a bang - with a whimper.\\" * In Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, the character Harold Oxley (John Hurt) paraphrases a line from Eliot's 1925 poem \\"Eyes that I last saw in tears,\\" when he says, \\"Through eyes that last I saw in tears, here in death's dream kingdom, the golden vision reappears.\\" This poem was part of a series of poems published by Eliot in 1924 and 1925, which referenced either \\"death's dream kingdom,\\" \\"death's other kingdom,\\" or \\"death's twilight kingdom,\\" of which several would later be published as Parts I-IV of \\"The Hollow Men.\\" \\"Eyes that I last saw in tears,\\" though ultimately not included by Eliot in his published version of \\"The Hollow Men,\\" may nevertheless be read alongside the published poem, as a sort of apocryphal text, to provide context regarding the development of the composition of \\"The Hollow Men.\\" Furthermore, the poem fits neatly within the series of poems which were ultimately collected and published as \\"The Hollow Men,\\" due to its imagery of \\"eyes\\" being encountered by the author in relation to \\"death's dream kingdom\\" and \\"death's other kingdom,\\" as in Parts I, II, and IV of \\"The Hollow Men.\\" =Literature= * Stephen King's The Dark Tower series contains multiple references to \\"The Hollow Men\\" (as well as The Waste Land, most prominently The Dark Tower III: The Waste Lands (1991)). * King also makes reference to \\"The Hollow Men\\" in Pet Sematary (1983) with: \\"Or maybe someone who had escaped from Eliot's poem about the hollow men. I should have been a pair of ragged claws\\", the latter sentence of which is taken from Eliot's poem \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\" (1915). There is also a reference in \\"Under the Dome\\" (2009), made by the journalist Julia Shumway. * Theodore Dalrymple's book, Not With a Bang But A Whimper (2009), takes its title from the last part of the poem.Not With a Bang But a Whimper: The Politics and Culture of Decline (US edition) (2008) * Nevil Shute's novel, On the Beach (1957), takes its name from the second stanza of Part IV of the poem and extracts from the poem, including the passage in which the novel's title appears, have been printed in the front papers of some editions of the book including the 1957 first US edition. * Kami Garcia's novel Beautiful Creatures contains this quote. * Karen Marie Moning's Fever series novel, Shadowfever, contains quotes from this poem. * Tracy Letts's play August: Osage County ends with Johanna quoting, \\"This is how the world ends, not with a bang but with a whimper\\" repeatedly. * The prologue of N.K. Jemisin's novel The Fifth Season references the last four lines of this poem. * V. E. Schwab's Monsters of Verity duology (2016, 2017) quotes the line \\"not with a bang but with a whimper\\" throughout the novels. =Multimedia= * Chris Marker created a 19-minute multimedia piece for the Museum of Modern Art in New York City titled Owls At Noon Prelude: The Hollow Men (2005), which was influenced by Eliot's poem. =Video games= * In the video game Shadow Man, the final boss, Legion, quotes \\"this is the way the world ends, Michael, not with a bang but with a whimper\\" just before giving the final blow to the protagonist in the bad ending. * The full poem is included in one of the flashbacks in Super Columbine Massacre RPG! * In the video game Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, the AI Colonel in the final speech quotes \\"And this is the way the world ends. Not with a bang, but a whimper\\". =Music= * Denis ApIvor wrote a work called The Hollow Men for baritone, male chorus and orchestra around 1939. It had only one performance, in 1950, under the conductor Constant Lambert, and produced by the BBC through the influence of Edward Clark.David Wright, Denis ApIvor * The American new wave band Devo partially lifted from the poem for the chorus to the song \\"The Shadow\\" on their seventh album Total Devo (1988) * Australian rock band TISM spoofed the poem's first epigraph for their 1986 song \\"Mistah Eilot - He Wanker\\" which mocked Eilot and the concept of Modernism. * The song \\"Hollow Man\\" appears as the first track on the album Doppelg√§nger (1983) by the group Daniel Amos; the song is a paraphrase of Eliot's poem spoken over the music of \\"Ghost of the Heart\\" played backwards; \\"Ghost of the Heart\\" is the last song on the group's previous album ¬°Alarma! (1981) * Members of the Minneapolis hiphop collective Doomtree have referenced this poem in a number of collective and individual songs, including the single \\"No Homeowners\\" on the collective's 2007 album False Hopes, \\".38 Airweight\\" on 2015's All Hands, and in the single \\"Flash Paper\\" from member Sims's 2016 album More than Ever. * The last line of the poem is referenced in Amanda Palmer's song \\"Strength Through Music\\", based on the Columbine High School massacre. * Eliot's poem inspired The Hollow Men (1944), a piece for trumpet and string orchestra by composer Vincent Persichetti and one of his most popular works. * Jon Foreman of Switchfoot says that the band's song \\"Meant to Live\\" is inspired by Eliot's poem. * The Gaslamp Killer song In the Dark... has the lyrics \\"This is the way the world ends\\" in it. * The Greek black metal band Rotting Christ uses excerpts of the poem as lyrics for the song \\"Thine Is the Kingdom\\" on their album Sleep of the Angels. The final stanza of the poem is used as the song's chorus. * Finnish musical producer Axel Thesleff created a musical interpretation of the poem in form of a five-track LP. *British 90s band EMF used the line \\"this is the way the world ends, this is the way the world ends, this is the way the world ends\\" using wordplay to add \\"not with a band\\" in their song Longtime on the album Schubert Dip * The 2011 release by North Carolina-based band Scapegoat, I Am Alien, references the poem in the title track: \\"So thank you Mr. Elliot for showing us the way the world will end, Not with a bang, but with a whimper on the wind, And I've come to tell all of my friends, That it starts with a bang, but ends with the wind.\\" * Frank Turner references The Hollow Men in his song \\"Sons of Liberty\\". His song \\"Anymore\\" also contains a reference to the last line of the poem. *In 2015, American experimental hip hop musician Lil Ugly Mane repeatedly sampled the line ‚ÄúThis is the way the world ends‚Äù in the song ‚ÄùColumns‚Äù, from his sophomore album Oblivion Access. *Wire's song \\"Comet\\" (from the 2003 album Send) features a chorus that references the poem: \\"And the chorus goes ba-ba-ba-ba-bang....then a whimper\\". =Television= * Not with a Bang was a short-lived British television sitcom produced by LWT for ITV in 1990. * British television series: Doctor Who (\\"The Lazarus Experiment\\") and Foyle's War (series 1, episode 3, which also name-drops \\"Ash Wednesday\\" and Horizons magazine, to which Eliot contributed) * American television shows: 30 Rock, The Big Bang Theory, Northern Exposure, the title of the finale of Dexter's sixth season (in which the protagonist also quotes the titular verse), Dollhouse (on \\"The Hollow Men\\" episode), Frasier, Mad Men, and The X-Files (on the \\"Pusher\\" episode). \\"The Haunting Hour\\" (\\"Scarecrow\\") \\"The Stand\\" (The Plague), The Odd Couple * British television series The Fall references the poem in its title and in series 1 episode 3 serial killer Paul Spector writes the lines 'Between the idea and the reality, Between the motion and the act falls the Shadow' in his journal of his murders. * American series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., in the finale of season 4 has Holden Radcliffe partially quote the final stanza as he disappears. * American crime drama The Sinnner has the character Nick recite the lines \\"Prickly Pear, Prickly Pear, Prickly Pear\\" from part V.

It was edited by a former bishop of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), along with a member who worked for the LDS Church. It is unique in being the only such Mormon fundamentalist magazine printed outside of the United States, and probably the only one edited and authored by active LDS Church members (although they were subsequently excommunicated for their beliefs). Their involvement in the magazine was possibly one of the factors that led to their excommunication from the LDS Church.

Managed by Transport for Wales, the station is located at street level on Windsor Road, situated back from the street fronting a small car park. It is from London Paddington (via Stroud). History A Swansea- bound South Wales Pullman at Neath General in 1967 The surviving Neath railway station is one of four railway stations originally in Neath, and to distinguish it from the others was at one time named Neath General, the suffix being applied before Nationalisation. Neath Canalside served the Rhondda and Swansea Bay Railway services until they ended in 1963. Neath Riverside (also at times known as Neath Bridge Street and Neath Low Level), served trains to and from Brecon via the Neath and Brecon Railway, with an additional stop at Neath Abbey. The railway itself remains partly in use, linking Onllwyn and the docks. The remains of the Neath Bridge Street station can be seen by looking down at the railway alongside the river bridge just before Neath railway station in the Swansea direction. Neath General also acted as the western passenger terminus of the Vale of Neath Railway for most of its life - trains running from here to Pontypool Road via and via a connecting curve at the west end of the station. These ceased in June 1964 (when the line fell victim to the Beeching Axe) and the link line was lifted, though parts of the old VoNR remains intact (but disused) as far as Resolven and from Aberdare to Hirwaun.\\"Railscot - Vale of Neath Railway\\"Railscot; Retrieved 25 August 2016 The present station buildings date from 1974, when the old GWR structures dating from 1886/87 were demolished and rebuilt in contemporary style by British Rail.

It is the home of the football club Karlsruher SC. It is located northeast of the Karlsruhe Palace (Schloss) and is part of the former deer park (Wildpark) of the Grand Dukes of Baden in the Hardtwald, hence the name. There have been football pitches at the location since 1922, and the stadium was built in 1955, with several major renovations since. A decision to rebuild the stadium was taken in 2006. The City of Karlsruhe and Karlsruher SC became engulfed in disputes about finances and finally abandoned the project in 2014. Two years later, the city again decided to renew the stadium, using the existing site and financed mostly by the city. In November 2018, demolition of parts of the old stadium and the concurrent construction of a new 34,000 seat arena began. Works are being carried out in stages so that matches can be played on the existing pitch in front of at least 15,000 spectators.

While this definition is broad enough to encompass systems such as smart automotive traffic control systems or factory automation processes, it is not commonly used to describe them. In a broader sense, physical computing is a creative framework for understanding human beings' relationship to the digital world. In practical use, the term most often describes handmade art, design or DIY hobby projects that use sensors and microcontrollers to translate analog input to a software system, and/or control electro-mechanical devices such as motors, servos, lighting or other hardware. Physical Computing intersects the range of activities often referred to in academia and industry as electrical engineering, mechatronics, robotics, computer science, and especially embedded development. Physical computing  Examples  Physical computing is used in a wide variety of domains and applications. =In Education= The advantage of physicality in education and playfulness has been reflected in diverse informal learning environments. The Exploratorium, a pioneer in inquiry based learning, developed some of the earliest interactive exhibitry involving computers, and continues to include more and more examples of physical computing and tangible interfaces as associated technologies progress. =In Art= In the art world, projects that implement physical computing include the work of Scott Snibbe, Daniel Rozin, Rafael Lozano-Hemmer, Jonah Brucker-Cohen, Camille Utterback, Virtual Reality VR/shyam, Augmented Reality AR/hiren, and Electroland LED art. =In Product Design= Physical computing practices also exist in the product and interaction design sphere, where hand-built embedded systems are sometimes used to rapidly prototype new digital product concepts in a cost-efficient way. Firms such as IDEO and Teague are known to approach product design in this way. =In Commercial Applications= Commercial implementations range from consumer devices such as the Sony Eyetoy or games such as Dance Dance Revolution to more esoteric and pragmatic uses including machine vision utilized in the automation of quality inspection along a factory assembly line. Exergaming can be considered a form of physical computing. Other implementations of physical computing include voice recognition, which senses and interprets sound waves via microphones or other soundwave sensing devices, and computer vision, which applies algorithms to a rich stream of video data typically sensed by some form of camera. Haptic interfaces are also an example of physical computing, though in this case the computer is generating the physical stimulus as opposed to sensing it. Both motion capture and gesture recognition are fields that rely on computer vision to work their magic. =In Scientific Applications= Physical computing can also describe the fabrication and use of custom sensors or collectors for scientific experiments, though the term is rarely used to describe them as such. An example of physical computing modeling is the Illustris project, which attempts to precisely simulate the evolution of the universe from the Big Bang to the present day, 13.8 billion years later.  Methods  Prototyping plays an important role in Physical Computing. Tools like the Wiring, Arduino and Fritzing as well as I-CubeX help designers and artists to quickly prototype their interactive concepts.

Sandman possessed a distinctive, deep Bass-Baritone voice and a mysterious demeanour. He was an indie rock icon and longtime fixture in the Boston/Cambridge music scene, best known as the lead singer and slide bass player of the band Morphine. Sandman was also a member of the blues-rock band Treat Her Right and founder of Hi-n-Dry, a recording studio and independent record label. An intensely private person, Sandman was known for his dark, charismatic presence and sometimes volatile temper especially with those attempting to find out more within his personal life, with many rumours circulating about his experiences outside the music industry. Sandman was the unofficial spokesman for Morphine and many of his songs were apparently autobiographical though even after his death this remains unconfirmed. On July 3, 1999, he suffered a heart attack during a concert in Italy and died instantly. He was highly regarded by many other bass players for his unique \\"slow and murky\\" style, with Les Claypool, Mike Watt, and Josh Homme all citing Sandman as an influence. Early life Mark Sandman was born into a Jewish American family in Newton, Massachusetts. He graduated from the University of Massachusetts, then worked a variety of blue-collar jobs, including construction, taxi driving, and commercial fishing. Sandman once noted he would often earn considerable overtime pay, which allowed him to take leave of work and travel outside of New England to places such as rural Colorado‚Äîthe setting for a number of Treat Her Right and Morphine songs penned by Sandman, including \\"Thursday,\\" \\"The Jury,\\" and \\"I Think She Likes Me.\\" Two tragic events affected Sandman's life and would later influence his music: he was robbed and stabbed in the chest during a robbery in his cab, and his two brothers died. These events would later be recounted in the Treat Her Right song \\"No Reason.\\" His mother, Guitelle Sandman, later self-published Four Minus Three: A Mother's Story, a book about the loss of her three sons. Few details are publicly known about Sandman's personal life. Fans have often speculated that many of Sandman's songs were autobiographical, which to this day remains unconfirmed. Although Sandman served as an unofficial spokesman for Morphine, he avoided answering questions about his personal life or his professional experiences outside of the music business. Sandman was reported to have been particularly secretive about his age, becoming angry with any reporter who expressed an interest in revealing it publicly, perhaps because he was 10 to 20 years older than most of his indie-rock contemporaries. Musical career Along with Morphine, which he formed in 1989, Sandman was a member of the bands Treat Her Right, Sandman, Candy Bar, the Hypnosonics, Treat Her Orange, Supergroup (with Chris Ballew), and the Pale Brothers. He performed as a guest with the Boston jazz band Either/Orchestra. His instruments were extensively altered and sometimes built by hand. In Morphine, he usually played a two-string slide bass guitar tuned to a fifth, and sometimes a unitar (named after the one-stringed instrument in American blues tradition), and three-string slide bass with one bass and two unison strings tuned an octave higher (usually to A). He sometimes paired bass strings with one or two guitar strings, creating the \\"basitar\\" \\"tri-tar\\" and \\"guitbass.\\" The guitbass and basitar were later used by the band The Presidents of The United States of America, with whom Sandman was close friends. For Sandman, the result was a murky, slurring sound that, particularly when paired with the baritone saxophone of Morphine's Dana Colley, created what Sandman termed \\"low rock.\\" His baritone singing completed the sound. \\"We're just baritone people,\\" he once told an interviewer. \\"And the cumulative effect of all these instruments is that it sounds really low, but you can still hear what's going on between the different instruments. It hits the body in a peculiar way that some people like a lot.\\"Morphine ‚Äì The Night (2000). zarecords.wordpress.com. As a lyricist, Sandman was influenced by pulp fiction writer Jim Thompson, crime writer James Ellroy, and Beat poet/novelist Jack Kerouac. During Morphine's active years, the band released five albums and one B-sides compilation. They toured extensively, both domestically and internationally, and became the second act signed to Dreamworks Records. During the 1990s, Sandman continued to expand his Cambridge-based home recording studio with second-hand instruments and equipment, calling the studio Hi-n-Dry. Hi-n-Dry became Morphine's unofficial home and they recorded many of their signature tracks using Sandman's unique homegrown production methods. The Twinemen In addition to his work as a musician, Sandman was also an amateur photographer and artist. He created a comic titled The Twinemen, starring three anthropomorphic balls of twine who form a band, become successful, break up, and later reunite. The Twinemen comic also showcased Sandman's signature technique of combining a simple pen or pencil drawing with watercolor paints. Sandman's art and photographs were showcased on the official Morphine website and later featured in a DVD released with the Sandbox box set. Colley, Treat Her Right and Morphine drummer Billy Conway, and singer Laurie Sargent would later adopt the Twinemen moniker for their own band as an homage to Sandman. Death Sandman collapsed on stage on July 3, 1999 at the Giardini del Principe in Palestrina, Lazio, Italy while performing with Morphine. His death, at the age of 46, was the result of a heart attack. His death has been attributed to heavy stress and the temperature of over 37 degrees Celsius on the night of his death. He was survived by his girlfriend Sabine Hrechdakian, parents Robert and Guitelle Sandman and sister Martha Holmes. Morphine disbanded following his death, although the surviving members briefly toured with other musicians as Orchestra Morphine, a tribute to Sandman and in support of the posthumous release, The Night. Following Sandman's death, Hi-n- Dry became a commercial record label and studio, dedicated to recording and releasing work by Boston-area artists. The label and studio are managed by Sandman's former Morphine band mates Conway and Colley. Hi-n-Dry issued a retrospective box set of Sandman's music called Sandbox in 2004. Another four disc Morphine box set has been compiled but has not been released due to the sale of former Morphine label, Rykodisc, to Warner Brothers. In 2009, Colley, Deupree, and Boston musician Jeremy Lyons formed the group Vapors of Morphine. The band regularly performs in Boston and New Orleans. =Memorials and tributes= Mark Sandman Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts by Zachary Armstrong (2008) * The intersection of Massachusetts Avenue and Brookline Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts' Central Square is named in Sandman's honor. This square is right outside the Middle East, a music club/restaurant frequented by Sandman. * The Mark Sandman Music Education Fund was established by his friends and family in order to give children in the Cambridge and Boston area an opportunity to learn musical instruments. As of 2008, this foundation has been renamed the Mark Sandman Music Project. Housed in the newly renovated Armory Arts Center at 191 Highland Ave. Somerville, the Project hopes to continue Mark's legacy. The Project is a community based, not-for-profit organization dedicated to bringing children and music together to foster educational, recreational and artistic goals and experiences. The Hi-n-Dry community will be the driving force behind this project which believes in that creative collaboration creates community. Donations are needed and welcomed. More information can be found at: Myspace.com/marksandmanmusicproject. * Following Sandman's death, Chris Ballew, Dana Colley, and Billy Conway recorded and released a tribute song titled \\"Gone Again Gone.\\" It was available online as an MP3 file for a limited time and a version of the song is on Chris Ballew's second solo album, The Days are Filled With Years * As a fellow bassist who admired Sandman, Les Claypool had an audience chant some \\"Yo Ho's\\" in honor of him at a show with Colonel Les Claypool's Fearless Flying Frog Brigade, which can be seen on his DVD 5 Gallons Of Diesel. Claypool also has a Sandman sticker on his bullet microphone. * La Scalinata Mark J. Sandman, Giardini Del Principe, Palestrina, Italy - is a staircase named in his honor.

He was born to a wealthy family and grew up in C√≥rdoba, Veracruz. After a brilliant university career, he became a teacher in the national college of St. John Lateran and doctor of theology at what was then the University of Mexico. He was a famous preacher and made some translations from Hebrew. He went to Europe and lived for some time in Paris. After this he became deputy director of the Madrid Museum of Natural History under the Bonapartist kingdom. In 1811 and 1812 he assisted Jos√© Mariano Moci√±o in organizing the collections of the Nueva Espa√±a Expedition (1787-1803) to survey the natural history of Mexico. In 1820 and 1821 he represented the state of Veracruz in the Spanish legislature, where he was a liberal. On his return to Mexico after it declared independence, he held church positions including treasurer of the church at Morelia (then called Valladolid), Michoac√°n. By 1823 he was Minister of Justice and of Church Matters in the imperial administration of Agust√≠n de Iturbide. In 1824, the first president of Mexico, Guadalupe Victoria, named him to the new cabinet. He also held the office of senator for Veracruz. Politically, Llave has been considered a liberal and an obedient follower of the republican priest and politician Miguel Ramos Arizpe. In biology, he and his collaborator Juan Jos√© Mart√≠nez de Lejarza :es:Juan Jos√© Martinez de Lexarza (or Lexarza) were the first to systematically study the orchids of Michoac√°n. In 1824 they published a work describing about 50 species. In 1831 La Llave was designated to direct the National Museum of Natural History of Mexico. In 1832 and 1833 he published ornithological papers in a short-lived Mexican journal in which he described and named several birds, of which the rufous-tailed hummingbird and the much more famous resplendent quetzal were new to science. Because of the obscurity of the journal, he did not receive credit for a few decades, and some sources incorrectly give the date of the paper as 1871, possibly the date of a republication. Llave died in C√≥rdoba in July, 1833. General Ignacio de la Llave was a nephew of his. The fern genus Llavea was named in his honour.

It was a male name and currently is considered a male or female name. Macaire is a common name for a 12th-century French chanson de geste, named for one of its main characters. Macaire and La Reine Sibille (14th century) are two versions of the story of the false accusation brought against the queen of Charlemagne, called \\"Blanchefleur\\" in Macaire and \\"Sibille\\" in the later poem. Macaire is only preserved in the Franco-Venetian Geste of Charlemagne (Bibl. St Mark MS. fr. xiii.). La Reine Sibille only exists in fragments, but the tale is given in the chronicle of Alberic Trium Fontium, a monk of the Cistercian monastery of Trois Fontanes in the diocese of Chlons, and in a prose version. Macaire is the product of the fusion of two legends: that of the unjustly repudiated wife and that of the dog who detects the murderer of his master. For the former motive see Genevieve de Brabant. The second is found in Plutarch, Script. moral., ed. Didot ii. (1186), where a dog, like Aubri's hound, stayed three days without food by the body of its master, and subsequently attacked the murderers, thus leading to their discovery. The duel between Macaire and the dog is paralleled by an interpolation by Giraldus Cambrensis in a manuscript of the Hexameron of Ambrose. Aubri's hound received the name of the \\"dog of Montargis,\\" because a representation of the story was painted on a chimney- piece in the chateau of Montargis in the 15th century. The tale was early divorced from Carolingian tradition, and Jean de la Taille, in his Discours notable des duels (Paris, 1607), places the incident under Charles V.

Method TUNEL is a method for detecting apoptotic DNA fragmentation, widely used to identify and quantify apoptotic cells, or to detect excessive DNA breakage in individual cells. The assay relies on the use of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), an enzyme that catalyzes attachment of deoxynucleotides, tagged with a fluorochrome or another marker, to 3'-hydroxyl termini of DNA double strand breaks. It may also label cells having DNA damaged by other means than in the course of apoptosis. History The fluorochrome-based TUNEL assay applicable for flow cytometry, combining the detection of DNA strand breaks with respect to the cell cycle-phase position, was originally developed by Gorczyca et al. Concurrently, the avidin-peroxidase labeling assay applicable for light absorption microscope was described by Gavrieli et al. Since 1992 the TUNEL has become one of the main methods for detecting apoptotic programmed cell death. However, for years there has been a debate about its accuracy, due to problems in the original assay which caused necrotic cells to be inappropriately labeled as apoptotic. The method has subsequently been improved dramatically and if performed correctly should only identify cells in the last phase of apoptosis. New methods incorporate the dUTPs modified by fluorophores or haptens, including biotin or bromine, which can be detected directly in the case of a fluorescently-modified nucleotide (i.e., fluorescein-dUTP), or indirectly with streptavidin or antibodies, if biotin- dUTP or BrdUTP are used, respectively. The most sensitive of them is the method utlilizing incorporation of BrdUTP by TdT followed by immunocytochemical detection of BrdU.

His responsibilities included Further Education, Skills, Apprenticeships and Consumer Affairs.Ministerial Responsibilities dbis.gov.uk He was Shadow Minister for Business, Innovation and Skills until he resigned on 28 June 2016. Background Brennan was born in Cwmbran, South Wales, the son of a steelworker and a school dinner lady. He was educated at St Alban's RC High School in Pontypool and Pembroke College, Oxford. He graduated in Philosophy, Politics and Economics in 1982, and was elected President of the Oxford Union in the same year with support from William Hague, who preferred Brennan's candidacy over those from the left of the Conservative faction in the Union. After Oxford he returned to Wales to study at the University College of Wales, Cardiff, where he qualified as a teacher with a Postgraduate Certificate in Education in history in 1985. He finished his education with a master's degree in Education Management at the University of Glamorgan (now the University of South Wales) in 1992. In 1982, Brennan joined the Cwmbran Community Press as a journalist. He joined the National Union of Teachers in 1984 before becoming a teacher at Radyr Comprehensive School in 1985. He left the school in 1994 as Head of the Economics Department. Between 1991‚Äì2001, Brennan was a member of Cardiff Council representing the ward of Canton, Cardiff. During this time he served as Chair of the Finance Committee, Chair of the Economic Scrutiny Committee and Vice-Chair of Economic Development.Biography kevinbrennan.co.uk Parliamentary career Following Rhodri Morgan's decision to step down as the Member of Parliament for Cardiff West in order to concentrate on being the First Minister of Wales, Brennan was selected as the Labour candidate for the constituency and became the MP for Cardiff West at the 2001 general election. In 2002, he appeared in the House of Commons without a tie, as he favours a less formal dress code. After the 2005 general election, he was promoted to Tony Blair's government as an Assistant Government Whip. In June 2007, Blair's successor, Gordon Brown, appointed Brennan as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children, Young People and Families in the new Department for Children, Schools and Families, replacing Parmjit Dhanda. Brennan was replaced in this role by Lady Morgan following the government reshuffle in October 2008. He was moved to the Cabinet Office before being promoted in 2009, becoming the Minister of State for Further Education, Skills, Apprenticeships and Consumer Affairs, with responsibilities in both the Department for Education and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. Following the 2010 General Election, he continued this role in a Shadow Ministerial capacity before Ed Miliband's decision to appoint Brennan to the position of Shadow Minister for Schools. Brennan was made Shadow Minister for Trade, Investment, and Intellectual Property by Jeremy Corbyn in September 2015, with responsibility for, among others, low carbon business sectors, manufacturing, construction, trade, and intellectual property. He resigned from this position on 28 June 2016, following a motion of no confidence in Corbyn which was passed overwhelmingly by Labour MPs.http://www.kevinbrennan.co.uk/2016/06/resignation-from-font-bench.html He supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 Labour Party (UK) leadership election. On 12 December 2019, Brennan was re-elected as the Member of Parliament for Cardiff West. Brennan supported Lisa Nandy in the 2020 Labour Party leadership election. =Pensions Bill/Allied Steel and Wire= In July 2002, the steel manufacturer Allied Steel and Wire (ASW) entered receivership, and many of their employees were told they would not receive their full company pensions because of a fund shortfall. Mr Brennan, who had many former workers of Allied Steel & Wire as constituents, tabled an early day motion in the Commons in November calling for compensation, and threatened to table an amendment to the Pensions Bill if the government did not offer any help. After Brennan carried out his threat to table the amendment, The Independent newspaper reported that Tony Blair faced the \\"biggest backbench rebellion\\" of his career. Ultimately, Brennan was successful. The BBC said he was \\"instrumental in extracting the government's commitment to establish a ¬£400 million fund to provide compensation for workers who lost their pensions when their firms went bankrupt\\". =Dress down Thursdays= In 2002 Kevin Brennan appeared in the House of Commons without a tie and called for Westminster to have \\"dress down\\" Thursdays, pointing out that Billy Bragg had complained Parliamentarians gave a \\"besuited image that's male, pale and stale\\". It provoked jeers from Conservative MPs. Michael Fabricant was so incensed that he made a point of order to the speaker. The Speaker, Michael Martin, agreed with Fabricant; and Brennan was forced to leave the chamber to retrieve a tie from his office. =Expenses= In 2009, Brennan came under scrutiny during the Expenses scandal for claiming questionable items, including a ¬£450 television claimed for his London second home which was delivered to this family home in Cardiff. He claimed for bunk beds for his daughter while the expenses system was intended exclusively for items for the MPs' use. Brennan said he bought from businesses in his constituency but the items were for use in his second home, calling the story a \\"smear with no basis in fact\\". =Social Media Award= In 2010, Brennan became the first Member of Parliament to win the British Computer Society's (BCS) Social Media MP of the year award, beating Nick Clegg and Jeremy Corbyn, who both finished as runners-up. =Guitars for prisoners= In 2014, Brennan led a campaign with musician Billy Bragg to lift a blanket ban on prisoners having access to guitars. They were backed in their campaign by musicians including Johnny Marr, David Gilmour and Richard Hawley. Brennnan held a Westminster Hall debate on the subject to try and get the government to overturn the ban, citing the importance and the efficacy of music as a means for the rehabilitation for prisoners. The Government agreed and prisoners can now have access to the instruments. Personal life Brennan has been married to Amy Lynn Wack since 1988; the couple have one daughter. Brennan supports Cardiff City Football Club and the Cardiff Blues rugby team. He is also a member of a parliamentary rock band MP4 with fellow politicians Ian Cawsey, Pete Wishart and Greg Knight. They have helped to raise over ¬£1 million for charity as well as releasing an album and an EP. They are currently the house band on the television show Unspun with Matt Forde.MP4 (band) The Friends of Jo Cox In 2016, following the murder of Jo Cox, the MP for Batley and Spen, Brennan put together the 'Friends of Jo Cox' to record a charity single to raise money for the Jo Cox Foundation which had been set up in her memory. The Friends of Jo Cox included the parliamentary rock band MP4, the House of Commons choir, MPs from other parties and a group of famous musicians including David Gray, KT Tunstall, Ricky Wilson and Steve Harley. The song was a cover of The Rolling Stones' \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\", with the Rolling Stones waiving their royalties for the Jo Cox Foundation. The single made the iTunes Top 10, and narrowly missed out on the top 100 UK Singles chart before Christmas Day. The single has raised more than ¬£35,000.

From south to north, the area runs from Nimule, at the South Sudan-Uganda border, to Nyolo River where the Ma‚Äôdi mingle with the Acholi, the Bari, and the Lolubo. From the east to west, it runs from Parajok/Magwi to Uganda across the River Nile. Language The speakers refer to themselves and are known as Madi. In standard orthography, this is Ma'di; the aprostrophe indicates that d is implosive. The speakers refer to their language as madi ti, literally meaning Ma'di mouth. Among themselves, Ma'di refer to each other as belonging to a suru (\\"clan\\" or \\"tribe\\"), which may further be broken down to pa, \\"the descendants of,\\" which in some cases overlap with suru. While a Madi can only marry someone from outside their clan, they must normally marry within the group that shares the Madi language. Many neighboring speakers of Moru‚ÄìMadi languages go by the name of Madi. Brief history = Etymologies about '–ú–∞ 'di' = Madi women According to one popular folk tale, the name Madi came as an answer to a question by a white man to a Madi man. When the first white person in the area asked the question 'who are you?', the bemused response was madi, i.e. a person. This was taken to be the name of the people, which came to be corrupted to the present. Another Ma'di narrative tries to account for the names of some of the Moru‚ÄìMa'di group members. When the progenitors of the Ma'di were pushed southwards, on reaching a strategic location they declared, Muro-Amadri, i.e., \\"Let's form a settle here\\". And so they formed a cluster to defend themselves. This group came to be known as the Moru. A group broke off in search of greener pastures in a more or less famished state, until they found an edible tree called lugba('desert dates' - ximenia aegyptiaca). After they ate some of the fruits, they took some with them. When the time came to refill their stomachs again, a woman who lost her harvest was heard enquiring about the lugba ri 'the desert dates'. This group came to be known as logbara but the Ma'di still call them lugban. The final group on reaching fertile grounds resolved and declared ma di 'here I am (finally)'. And these came to be known as the Ma'di. =Early history= Ma‚Äôdi oral history claims Nigeria as the cradle of Ma‚Äôdi people ‚Äì their place of origin. According to the one commonly told oral narrative, the Ma‚Äôdi people left Nigeria, moved southward until they reached Amadi, a town in southwest Sudan, where they settled. The word Amadi in Ma‚Äôdi language means here we are. It also means, at our place. From this storyline by then the Ma‚Äôdi and Moru were still one ethnic group. From Amadi, Ma‚Äôdi people traveled eastward reaching River Nile. There they separated into two clusters ‚Äì Moru and Ma‚Äôdi. The Moru cluster went back ‚Äì westward; the Ma‚Äôdi cluster settled by the riverbank. It is believed the two clusters (groups) separated because of a squabble over a piece of groundnut. A Ma‚Äôdi man found some groundnut, which he ate it alone. His Moru brother blamed him for being greedy and hence moved away from him. However today Ma‚Äôdi oral history cannot specify the period during which Ma‚Äôdi migrated from Nigeria to Sudan. Moreover, it cannot also bridge the missing historical link between the present-day Ma‚Äôdi people and their assumed accentors ‚Äì the Nigerians. None- Madi scholars who have written on Ma‚Äôdi have different opinions about the origin of Ma‚Äôdi. Though it has remained unclear where the Ma‚Äôdi people came from, most likely they arrived to southern Sudan region, around 1400-1700 A.D. This period coincided with the migration of the Nilotic people from north to south. From one Ma‚Äôdi oral history narrative, after the Ma‚Äôdi and Moru parted, some Ma‚Äôdi groups settled near Mount Rajaf, near the Nile. Others settled in Nyarabanga, south of Rajaf. In those places, they intermingled with Bari people. In Rajaf, the Ma‚Äôdi people lived for years. As their number grew, they also dispersed into sub-groups, many of them left Rajaf. Over the years many moved southward on different routes, looking for better terrains to settle. Along the way, several groups evolved and acquired different names: Arapi, Goopi (Logopi), Logili, Mugi, Okei, Pandikeri, Patibi (Moi-ba), etc. According to one storyline, the Ma‚Äôdi people found the Bari had already settled in Rajaf and Nyarabanga. Adherents to this storyline believe that the Bari have settled in Gondokoro, Rajaf and Nyarabanga, around 1600 A.D. That the Ma'di had found the Bari had already settled in Rajaf and Nyarabanga. Another commonly known narrative among Madi claims that some Ma‚Äôdi groups came from Bari. That the Mugi descends from the Bari of Nyarabanga; the Arapi, Logopi, and Logili descend from Bari-Logo. That the Okei, Ngaya, Patibi and Pandikeri also descend from Bari. However, some none-Madi writers have different point of view; they suggest that Ma'di came from Bari-Logo. For example, according to the Belgian writer, Armand Hutereau, the Bari-Logo thinks are probably or Lugbara who descended from the Lowa or the Kibali until they encountered the Dai; riverains of the Makua. They were later probably dispersed by the Medje- Mangbele under Abonga, followed by the Azande under Wando, Ukwa, and Bokoio (Bokoyo). It is believed that from Rajaf, a group journeyed southeast and settled at Aru, few kilometers, southeast of Rajaf. That group founded the Olubo ethnic group. One of the founders was chief Luala. From Aru, an Olubo group moved southward, crossed River Yii (River Kit) and settled in Moli. Later on, the Ngaya, Okei, Pandikeri also came to Moli. They were followed by the Beka and Kiloloro groups, which narrators believe are of Kuku origin. The Paselo and Kamia groups also crossed the Nile and settled near Mount Ayo, by the riverbank. From Moli, the Mugi, Kiloloro, Pandikeri, etc., moved southeast ‚Äì to Opari. The Logopi group from Bari-Logo, across the Nile, also came to Opari. Collectively the groups, which settled in Opari, called themselves Bori. It is debatable which group settled first in Opari. Some people believe the Logopi came first. Some say the Ngaya came first. Yet others say the Pandikeri arrived first. Andruga from Pandikeri became the first chief of Bori. His son Milla Akeri succeeded him. Milla became the greatest chief of Bori. His son Kanyara Draru succeeded him. During Milla's reign, Bori also settled in Owingykibul and Ayipa, a territory east of Opari. Until then that area was a forest; a hunting terrain for Bori and Acholi groups. Scramble for Owinykibul then became a source of conflict of between the Acholi and Madi. Each group claimed Owinykibul as its ancestral land. By the time different Ma‚Äôdi groups settled in Moli and Opari, one group, which lived in Kuku area, left and moved eastward. It passed Mount Nyeri, crossed the Nile, and settled at the foot of Mount Bolizo. The group called its new settlement named the place Guru (later renamed Nimule). The word Guru, in Madi language means valley. According to one narrative, a man called Manini, who led his group from across the Nile, founded Guru. However, another narrative claims that Manini and his people found a man called Aci (also known as Motto) in Guru. According to that storyline, the Nile carried Motto to Guru from Bunyoro. As time passed by, some groups (Pakurukwe, Pakoi, Bari-Bilinya, etc.,) from Kuku and Bari, also came to Guru. As several Ma‚Äôdi groups moved southeast and southwest of Rajaf, one group crossed the Nile, and traveled south. That group settled at a place called Avori ‚Äì the present-day Loa. In Avori, a man named Vuri, from Pavura family, became the first custodian of the land. Two groups from Avori moved northward and settled near Mount Remo. One group was called Paakori, the other was called Pafoki. Years later in Avori, one group called itself Lukai. Ma‚Äôdi oral history narrators believe the ancestor of Lukai came from Lolubo (Olubo). According one narrative, a man called Jukiri founded the Lukai group. It is believed that Jukiri and his brother Nyikwara were fugitives from Aru, driven away by Lolubo elders. According to one narrative, in Aru, a group of people gathered under a tree for a meeting. Jukiri and Nyikware were among them. As the meeting went on, the shadow shifted towards the brothers, and Olubo elders were left on the sun. The elders asked the brothers to leave the shadow for them. They refused; so fight broke up. Consequently, the brothers were forced to leave Aru. The fugitives ran southward ‚Äì and crossed river Yii. They traveled and reached near Mount Foki. Jukiri, the elder brother, then told Nyikwara, they should separate and go in different directions. So that in case the Lolubo men follow them, find one person, and kill him, the other will survive. The survivor will carry on the family name. So, the brothers separated. Nyikwara went southeast, where in time; he became the ancestor of Acholi-Panyikwara ethnic group. Jukiri travelled southwest and arrived in Avori. In Avori, Jukiri met Vuri, who was the custodian of the land. Vuri cared for Jukiri until he grew up. He then gave Jukiri his daughter for wife. Jukiri and his wife became the parents of three sons: Girale, Bilaro and Kado. They also had a daughter called Abinia. After Jukiri settled in Avori, a man called Muludia Kwiakwia also came to Avori. According to one account, he was carried by the Nile ‚Äì another way of saying he came from the south. Vuri welcomed Muludia and gave him a place to settle. The two became friends. Their friendship lasted until a conflict started between them. Vuri demanded that Muludia should leave Avori. So, fight broke up. During the fight Vuri's son shot and killed Muludia's son. Jukiri then came and brokered peace between the warring parties. As tradition demanded, Vuri had to pay a ransom, to Muludia. During those years, blood- price could also be paid by women. Vuri did not have a virgin daughter. So, he asked Jukiri to give him his daughter. Jukiri gave Abinia to him. He in turn gave her to Muludia. Then a council of elders settled the conflict between them. Afterward Muludia left Avori. He went northward and built settlement in Musura, near Kerepi, west of Opari. By then Milla Akeri was the chief of Bori. When Milla heard that Muludia and his people moved from Avori and settled in Musura, he became angry. His army went to drive Muludia away. Fight broke up and Muludia was pushed out of Musura. He went and settled in Kerepi-Borongole. There he had several children among which were the sons: Julu, Toke, Kicere, and Loku. In time, he became the ancestor of the Kerepi and Gonyapi groups. In Kerepi, Loku became the founder of the Abacha family; Kicere became the first chief of Kerepi-Tedire. Eberu, the son Kicere succeeded the father as a chief. After Muludia left for Musura, in Avori, Jukiri who gave his daughter to Vuri demanded that Vuri should compensate him. He did not want to take any offer from Vuri, other than the chieftaincy, which Vuri held. So Vuri gave Jukiri his chieftaincy as compensation. Jukiri's chieftaincy marked the beginning of the Odrupee rule in Lukai. Girale became the second chief of Lukai after his father Jukiri. The Lukai people lived in Avori for many years. From Avori they then moved southeast, to Mugali. In Mugali, Odu, the son of Girale become a chief. Odu had two sons Volo and Bada. After Odu died, his uncle Kado succeeded him. After Kado died his nephew, Volo became a chief. After Volo died, Bada succeeded him. When Bada was slain during a war, his brother Amoli succeeded him. After Amoli died his cousin, Loku succeeded him. After Loku died his son, Surur Iforo succeeded him. It is believed that several factors: drought, inter-clan fights and fights with the Turkish slave raiders (which the indigenous people called Tukutuku), forced Lukai to Mugali. They called Mugali, Agali ‚Äì meaning, we refused conflicts. However, for their misfortune, conflicts followed them to Mugali. The Tukutuku did not leave them alone. =The Ma'di resistance during the age of Tukutuku (Turkiyah) invasion= The people of the southern Sudan had almost no contacts with the northern Sudan, until the beginning of Egyptian rule (also known as Turkish Sudan or Turkiyah) in the north in the early 1820s and the subsequent expansion of the slave trade into the south. According to an oral history, the Nilotic peoples ‚Äî the Dinka, Nuer, Shilluk, and others ‚Äî had already established themselves in south Sudan by the time Turks invaded the region. In the nineteenth century, the Shilluk people had established a centralized monarchy which allowed them to conserve their tribal heritage in the face of external pressures in the years which followed the Turkish rule. By the time the Nilotic peoples had established their dominium in the northern part of the southern Sudan (notably the Bahar El Ghazal region), the non-Nilotic Azande, Moru‚ÄìMa'di, etc., had established themselves in Equatoria region. The Azande people occupied the largest part of the region. Geographical barriers sheltered the people of southern Sudan, and made it difficult for the Turks to invade the region. Moreover, the people of the southern Sudan were hostile to any foreign adventure in their land. But the military might of the Turkish army prevailed in the battles to subdue south Sudan. Because of their proximity to north Sudan, the Nilotic peoples were the first to give in to the Turkyiah. As the Bahar El Ghazal region fell to the Turkish rule, many Nilotic people moved southward to escape from the new regime. The Turkish army also moved southward to extend its rule. By 1841 the Turkish armies had already entered Equatoria. Their first encounter were with the people of Bari, Kakwa, Pojulu, Mundari and others. When the Turks arrived in Bari, initially they were not met with hostility. In April 1854, the relatively peaceful relationship between the Bari people and the foreigners came to an abrupt end, when a Turkish trader, without provocation, fired his guns into a crowd of Bari at Gondokoro. In anger the Bari mounted a counterattack, and the result was destructive to both sides. That incident made the Bari people to become more defensive and less friendly towards the traders (mostly Arabs and Turks) who used violent means to obtain ivory tusks, but also started taking people (young men and women) as slaves. Girls were raped, or taken as wives by force. Some of the foreign traders even built fortified warehouses near Gondokoro where people were kept waiting shipment down the White Nile to north Sudan. In time the Turkish army was able gain complete control in Equatoria, with its trading headquarter now in Gondokoro. Next, the Turkish army then expanded its occupation further south. Consequently, the Madi, Kuku, Lotuko, Acholi and others whose territories lie south of Gondokoro were to fall prey. Around 1854, the Tukutuku who had already taken over Gondokoro (a Bari town, north of present- day Juba), had also established a camp in Kajo-Keji (a town in Kuku territory). They used the base to mount attacks on the Ma‚Äôdi people across the Nile. The attacks of the Tukutuku were not limited on Lukai alone, but rather on the Madi people as a whole. In eastern front, the Tukutuku had established a base in Obbo (a settlement, about a hundred miles southeast of Gondokoro). In the mid-1860s, the chief of Obbo was a man called Katchiba. As the Tukutuku consolidated its base in Eastern Equatoria, they managed to pull some natives (Bari and Acholi) to their side. With the help of the natives, they waged successful battles on the Ma‚Äôdi. For example, in one battle, the Tukutuku colluded with the Acholi-Patiko and Acholi-Palabe. They then attacked Mugali, captured chief Bada and took him to Lebubu (Odrupele) and slain him. =The Madi migration to Uganda= Given the superior military power of the Tukutuku and the assistance they got from the natives (who joined them), it was only a matter of time, they defeated the Ma‚Äôdi people. The Ma‚Äôdi people were forced to disperse. Some went deeper into the forests; others went further south, to Uganda. Those who were less fortunate were captured, and taken away. Some of those captured were later conscripted into the Tukutuku army; others became laborers. When the Tukutuku consolidated its base in the Sudan, some of them went further south, and built some bases in Uganda. In Uganda, a group of Tukutuku camped in Odrupele (Lebubu). Tukutuku commander called, Emin Pasha, made the Madi and other ethnic groups (he conscripted into his army), to build a fort. The fort, today known as Dufile Fort, was completed in 1879. The fort is located on the Albert Nile, inside Uganda. Many of the laborers who built the forte were from Ma‚Äôdi people. The Madi people mostly live in Moyo, Oodrupele now. In 1888 mutineers from Emin's Pasha jailed him and A.J. Mounteney Jephson. They later released the two and rallied to fight Mahdist forces. In 1889, Emin and his army abandoned Dufile Forte. The Belgian forces reoccupied and reconstructed it, from 1902 to 1907. Another group of Tukutuku army from the eastern front (which settled near Obbo) moved southward and settled in Faloro, a town in present-day Uganda. Faloro was part of Lado Enclave. So by the late 1860s, several Ma‚Äôdi groups from Sudan had migrated to Uganda, where they settled in different places. Some in the west side of the Nile, others on the east. The southern territory of Ma‚Äôdi groups extended up to Faloro. Faloro was called Ma‚Äôdi Country, by the English explorers John Hanning Speke and James Augustus Grant, who visited the area in 1863 A.D. Sir Samuel White Baker, who visited the place also a year later also called Faloro Ma‚Äôdi Country Several Ma'di groups from Moli, Kerepi, Arapi, Pageri, Loa, and Nimule settled in the Metu mountains. Some of the early settlers in Metu included the Padika group. Kerepi people arrived after Padika. In Metu, Kutulungu became the first chief of Erepi and Pamujo, in southern Metu. Lukere became the first chief of northern Metu. Other groups which came to Metu included Pacara and Vura. The first chief of Pacara was Lumara. From Metu some members of the Vura group moved further west ‚Äì to Moyo district. In Moyo, the first chief of Vura was Aliku, the son of Bandai. Aliku ruled Moyo until the arrival of the British rule. The British arrested him. He was accused of killing an English explorer who came to Moyo. Aliku was taken to prison. He did not come back. It is believed he was killed. Whereas the groups from northern and central Ma‚Äôdi settled in Metu, others went to Moyo. According to Madi oral history narrators (Albino Akasi, Samuel Anzo and Makpe), a group of migrants from Lulubo came to Uganda and settled southwest of Moyo. That group was called Ma‚Äôdi Agai, after their leader's name. The group was also called Ma‚Äôdi Okollo, meaning \\"Peripheral Ma‚Äôdi\\" because the group's dialect is rather different mainstream Ma‚Äôdi. The other Madi groups referred to Ma‚Äôdi Okollo, as Ma‚Äôdi Indri, because they owned many goats. One None-Madi ethnic group from the south, probably from Bunyoro came and settled near Ma‚Äôdi Okollo. The group was later called Ma‚Äôdi Oyuwi. Some Oyuwi members moved eastward and settled near Pakele. In Sudan, the Bori also dispersed into groups. Some of them then went southeast, to Uganda. Others moved southwest. Those who moved southeast settled in Padibe, where they mixed with Acholi-Padibe and Acholi-Parabongo groups. Those who moved southwest crossed the Nile and settled in Metu. Like the other Ma‚Äôdi groups, the Lukai of Mugali also moved to Uganda. Many of them settled in Kitgum. Others settled in Adjumani. =The Madi people and Anglo- Egyptian Sudan= In the 1840s, Turkiyah (under the khedive of Egypt) had by now consolidated its control in Equatoria region. In 1845, a British man John Petherick who entered the service of Mehemet Ali, and was employed in examining Upper Egypt, Nubia, the Red Sea coast and Kordofan in an unsuccessful search for coal. In 1861, he was made a consul in Euqatoria region. Patherik was later to set his center in Faloro, Madi country. In March 1861, a British explorer, Mr. Samuel Baker, started an expedition in central Africa, with the aim \\"to discover the sources of the river Nile\\". He also hoped to meet the East African expedition led by John Hanning Speke and James Augustus Grant, somewhere about the Victoria Lake. Baker spent a year on the Sudan-Abyssinian border, during which time he learned Arabic, explored the Atbara river and other Nile tributaries. In early 1862 he arrived at Khartoum, and in December the same year, he left the city to follow the course of the White Nile. Months later in arrived in Gondokoro. In 1862, Speke and Grants who Mr. Baker planned to meet Mr Baker in Gondokoro, arrived in the Madi country, after traveling from Zanzibar passing through several countries: Abyssinia, Uganda, Gani‚Ä¶ and Unyoro. In Madi country, the two were supposed to be met by Mr. Petherik, who was entrusted with a mission by the Royal Geographical Society to convey to Gondokoro relief stores for Speke and Grant. Petherick got boats to Gondokoro in 1862, but Speke and Grant had not arrived. In February 1863, when the two man arrived at Faloro, Mr. Petherik went out for hunting and the visitors were met by of Mr. Mohamed (a black man) who was a vakeel (i.e. assistant consul). The explorers spent several weeks in the Madi country before going to Gondokoro. In his recollections about his stay, Mr Speke was to confess that the Madi people were civilized as compared to the people of Unyoro, Gani, Bari, etc. Mr Speke also recalled of stories about the Turkish slave traders who often clashed with the Madi people. In April 1863, Samuel Baker finally met Speke and Grant at Gondokoro, who, told him about their discovering of the source of the Nile. The success of the two men made Baker to fear that there was nothing left for his own expedition to accomplish. Nonetheless the two explorers gave him information which enabled him, after separating from them, to achieve the discovery of Albert Nyanza (Lake Albert), of whose existence credible assurance had already been given to Speke and Grant. After the meeting with Speke and Grant, Baker started his own expedition. He travelled from Gondokoro passing through the Bari, Latooka, Shooa, Madi countries. On the way he faced several hardship. In Latooka country, he stayed for several days, where he met with a Latooka chief, Mr. Bokke. He then continued southward and arrived at Obbo, which at a town of Madi Shooa country. In Obbo, he spent several weeks, where he met with chief of Obbo, Mr. Katchiba. Baker and Katichba discussed several topics. On March 14, 1864, finally Baker arrived at Lake Albert. He spent several months in the exploration of the neighborhood before returning to his base. He arrived in Khartoum in May 1865. In the following October he returned to England with his wife, who had accompanied him throughout the whole of the perilous and arduous journey. In 1869, at the request of the khedive Ismail, Baker undertook the command of a military expedition to the equatorial regions of the Nile, with the object of suppressing the slave-trade there and opening the way to commerce and civilization. Before starting from Cairo with a force of 1700 Egyptian troops - many of them discharged convicts - he was given the rank of pasha and major-general in the Ottoman army. Lady Baker, as before, accompanied him. The khedive appointed him Governor-General of the new territory of Equatoria for four years; and it was not until the expiration of that time that Baker returned to Cairo, leaving his work to be carried on by the new governor, Colonel Charles George Gordon. In 1910, a few months after the death of Leopold II, the king of the Belgians, also came the demise of Lado Enclave (of which Madi territories were a part). This brought a new foreign rule to Ma‚Äôdi. In 1912, the British, now the new ruler of the region, arbitrary annexed southern Madi-land to Uganda. With the changes that occurred in both Sudan and Uganda, many Ma‚Äôdi migrants in Uganda, decided to go back to Sudan. Many people from Nimule who settled in Atiyak and Kitgum went back. Some Bori people who settled Parabongo went back to Opari. Others stayed in Owinykibul. The Pageri moved from Ogoligo, in Uganda to Nimule. The elders in Nimule gave the Pageri group a place at foot of Mount Bolijo (now Mount Gordon). The settlement was named Pageri Andu. From Pageri Andu the group moved to northward and settled in Jelei. From Jelei the group settled in present-day Pageri area. Most of Lukai people also went back to Mugali. However the conflicts between them and Acholi-Palabe continued. Ma‚Äôdi oral history narrator Lucia Nya-Tiangwa believes it was the conflict between the Lukai and Acholi-Palabe, which forced Lukai people back from Uganda to Mugali. The British administrators in the region believed the Lukai people were to blame. So one day an army from the Kings African Rifles (KAR) colluded with the Acholi. They came and attacked Mugali. They killed many people ‚Äì several from the members from the Odrupee ruling family. People killed included Inyani, son chief Laziru Coro and Kaku, the mother of Chief Alimu Dengu. To escape the massacre, the Lukai people ran to Ndindi, across River Acca, north of Mugali. Those events happened around year 1920. Amoli was the chief of Lukai. In Ndindi, Surur Iforo became chief of Lukai. He was given the task to take the people to a new place, which was more fertile and hospitable. He failed to achieve the task. So his cousin, Alimu Dengu forced Iforo to resign. Alimu Dengu became a chief. He then took the people to a place called Mua. It was also called Wangchori (in Acholi language), meaning, the eyes of man ‚Äì a place of war. In Wangchori, Lukai people lived for some years. Lubai replaced Alimu Dengu. After he died, Kasmiro Luku became a chief. Kasmiro died within a year. Laziru Coro became a chief. He ruled for nine months and resigned. Alimu Dengu became a chief, the second time. Lukai people then went back to Mugali. Those events happened around 1930-1945 A.D. The Anglo-Egyptian rule had now brought the Ma‚Äôdi chiefs under its control. In attempt to make it easy to rule the indigenous people, the British introduced the notion of paramount chief, who was to rule the whole of Ma‚Äôdi. That marked the end of the old era in Ma‚Äôdi history and the beginning a new era. =Madi people during the Second Sudanese Civil War (1983‚Äì2005)= Until 1986, to the Madi people the Second Sudanese Civil War, was a foreign story. It did not affect their daily life. Many of them only heard about the war from the radio or from hearsay. However, as the SPLA insurgents started moving southward, at one stage they reached the territories inhabited by the Madi people. One of their first encounters with the Madi people was in Owingibul. In 1985, insurgent group claiming to be SPLA, robbed and plundered the villages in Owinykibul. Some people who witness the incident in Owingibul run to Nimule, to ask the government for help. To their disappointment they did not get the help they needed. The failure of the government to help them, forced the Madi people in Owingibul and others elsewhere, to consider taking the issue of their security into their hands. The incident in Owingibul also caused the Madi people to form the most negative opinion on SPLA. Further encounters of the Madi people with SPLA soldiers in 1985, only served to harden the position of the Madi people against SPLA. Example, the looting of the property late chief Sabasio Okumu in Loa, the killing of a Madi man called Kayo Mojadia in Loa, the looting of the villages in Moli, made the Madi people to look at SPLA as an enemy and not as a liberation army. And since most of the SPLA soldiers who first came to Madiland were from the Acholi tribe, the Madi people started to look at the Acholi people as aggressors. Such a perception coupled with provocations on the Madi people by some elements in the Acholi tribe, was to breed an enmity between the two tribes, which led to conflicts resulting in dire consequences ‚Äì for both sides. The defining movement for the Madi people to take side in the conflict came early in 1986, when some insurgent group in SPLA uniform, killed in cold-blood, Mr. Joseph Kebulu, a very respected Madi politician. Mr. Kebulu was on his election trail, when the bus he was traveling with was stopped at Juba-Nimule road. The gun-men dragged him out of the bus and shot him. Angered by what was happening to their people, and the inability the government to protect them, the Madi people decided to take things into their hand. So in March 1986, in Nimule, the council of Madi elders gathered to decide how to prepare to face further aggressions and plunders from SPLA in the Madiland. The meeting was chaired by Mr. Ruben Surur, then the chief of Lukai. The council unanimously selected Mr. Poliodoro Draru to lead the Madi people in the fight against the aggressors. The meeting was concluded by a traditional Madi ritual, during which Surur gave his ajugo (the biggest spear of a warrior) to Draru. The choice of the council of elders who selected Draru as an ajugo, was not an accident of history. It was rather based on Draru's track-record in leadership. Moreover, both Surur and Draru came from the Lukai royal family. In fact Draru was the prot√©g√©e of His Majesty Alimu Dengu. Draru was supposed to succeed Alimu Dengu, but for several reasons, he did not, so Alimu Dengu became the last King of the Madi people. Years later, when General Joseph Lagu (general Lagu began the Anyanya movement in the fifties this makes it appear like he did so after 1983please correct this history Anyanya movement, Draru wanted to be in the frontline. But General Lagu appointed Draru as intelligence officer. He worked hand in hand with [Mr. Angelo Vuga] (who was also an intelligence officer), in managing the logistics of Anyanya I, and also helped in recruiting young fighters - some of whom had to go to Israel for training. Now as fate had, Draru had to be in the frontline. To prepare for the future battles, Draru and his chief advisor, Jino Gama Agnasi consulted General Peter Cirilo (of the Sudanese Army, then the governor of Eastern Equatoria) about the situation in Madiland who then gave his blessing for the Madi people to defend themselves. Thus a Madi militia was formed, led by Draru. As the Madi militia was being was formed, in the meantime the geopolitical situation in the Sudan was changing so fast. The SPLA was becoming stronger as it captured more territories, not least, in Eastern Equatoria region. Moreover, some Madi people decided to join SPLA. Some of the Madi people who were first to join SPLA were Dr Anne Itto (who previously worked as a lecturer at the University of Juba), Mr. John Andruga, and Mr. Martin Teresio Kenyi. These people were later to hold high position in SPLA. By joining SPLA, first Madi people in the movement thought to turn the SPLA from being the enemy of the people to the liberator of the people. But such as a tactical ploy was not bear the expected fruits. Instead, the Madi people became polarized. One group took side with Draru, the other group stood with SPLA. For example, in Moli clan, two brothers (Mr. Tibi and Tombe Celestino) took opposite sides in the war. Whereas Tibi joined SPLA, Mr. Celestino went with Draru. The polarization of the Madi society was to bring the Madi society to conflicts in which the Madi people paid so heavily; many with their own lives. Only within a matter of three years (between 1986‚Äì1988), the Madiland which was very peaceful, became a war zone ‚Äì a place of great tragedies. For example, in Moli area alone, many innocent people were murdered at river Liro, in resulting battles led by the two brothers: Mr. Tibi and Mr. Celestino. Initially Acholi-Madi clan also took side with the SPLA. In 1988, realizing that the Madi and Acholi-Madi people had been taken in by the calamity brought by the polarization in the society, in order to stop further tragedies, the Madi and Acholi elders decided that the warring parties reach out to each other. Consequently, Draru's group met his counterpart. Talks and negotiations were then followed by some sort of agreement. However, it seemed that the agreement between the two groups did not change the dynamics of things very much. On a national scale, the SPLA continued to become stronger, as the Sudanese government and the militias it supported were losing ground. In 1988, SPLA captured several strategic towns in Eastern Equatoria: Magwi, Obbo, etc. When it finally captured Torit, the capital city of Eastern equatorial, it became apparent that it was only matter of weeks, it will also capture Nimule. So early in 1989 (on 3 March 1989 at 3:00 pm), An army of SPLA soldiers made its way to Nimule. However two days before it arrived Nimule, General Peter Cirilo, sent an urgent message to Mr Draru. He wrote, \\"It is over, please don't fight and destroy your people for the sake of Pyrrhic victory!\\" Draru listened to the senior General and didn't risk the lives of his soldiers and many Madi people. So Nimule fell to SPLA ‚Äì without a big battle. With the fall of Nimule, the militia led by Draru and even the ordinary Madi people fearing revenge from the SPLA soldiers, escaped to [Uganda]. The fear of the people was not to be unfounded; upon their arrival in Nimule, some SPLA soldiers murdered several civilians in cold-blood. However, as the SPLA established itself in Nimule, it leadership started to appeal to the Madi people who escaped to Uganda and elsewhere to come back home. Some of the Madi people listened to the appeal and came back. Others waited until the Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the Sudanese government and SPLA was signed before repatriating. Yet many Madi people decided to remain in Uganda, even after the CPA. Thus the second civil war, diminished the population of the Madi people in Sudan very considerably. Religion = Ori ‚Äì the spirits of the reincarnated ancestors= Before the coming of Christianity and Islam to Madi, the predominant religion of Madi people was all about the belief in, and the worship of ancestors who were believed to survive death in form of spirits known as ori. It was believed that the ori could intervene directly in human affairs. Thus the Madi attribute every misfortune to the anger of a spirit and in the event of a misfortune or sickness, they would immediately consult an odzo or odzogo (spirit-medium) to find out which ancestor was behind the ordeal. Sacrifices were then offered to the particular spirit in order to avert its malign influence on the living. The powerful families among the Madi were believed to have powerful ancestral spirits to help them however with conversion of majority of Madi people to Christianity, and some to Islam, Rubanga - the Christian God and the Allah of Islam, took the places and roles which once belonged to the ori. Nonetheless, today in the age where most Madi people have converted to the foreign religions, still some believers in the traditional Madi religion try to build a bridge between Rubanga and Ori. Today some Madi people still keep miniature altars called Kidori, were sacrifices are offered to the ancestral spirits in both in good and bad times as a way to approach God. Often at harvest time, the first harvest must be offered to the spirits to thank them for successfully interceding to God on behalf of the living. =Spirituality and the Madi Deities= Besides the belief in ori, the Madi people also believe in creatures, which are not the spirits of the reincarnated ancestors, but they are deities in their own right. Some of these deities are sacred trees, hills, rivers, snakes, etc. For example, among the Moli clan, Jomboloko (a tortoise who is believed to be living in a hill around Moli Tokuru hill), is well known deity. Many stories have been told about Jomoloko. Some Moli people still believe in Jomboloko. In the pre-Christian age, it was common practice for a group of people believe in more than one deity. In that sense, some Madi people were polytheistic in their belief. However today, belief in those creatures diminished considerably. =Christianity= Christianity was first introduced to the Sudan, i.e. Nobatia (northern Sudan and part of Dongola), by a missionary sent by Byzantine empress Theodora in 540 AD. The second wave of Christianity to the Sudan came during the time of the European Colonialism. In 1892, the Belgian expediters took parts of southern Sudan that came to be named Lado Enclave (i.e. the western bank of Upper Nile region which is today the southeast Sudan and northwest Uganda). After the death of king Leopold II on 10 June 1910, the Lado Enclave, became the province of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, with its capital city at Rajaf. In 1912 the southern part of Lado Enclave become part of northern Uganda, which was also the British Colony. It was during that time the Madi people were divided into the Sudanese and Ugandan Madi. Christianity to the northern part of Lado Enclave was brought via Uganda at about the same time - as Colonialism always went hand in with Christianization The notion God and the Madi word for it Rubanga, have very recent history. They came with Christianity. For example, in the Roman Cathotic Catechesis in Madi language, when asked Rubanga ido oluka adu nga (How old is God), we're expected to answer Rubanga ido oluka ku (God has no beginning). And when asked Adi obi nyi ni oba nyi vu dri ni (who has created you and put you on the Earth), you are expected to answer Rubanga obi mani obama vu dri ni (God has created me and put me on Earth). And we are also asked to believe ta Rubanga abi le ati ri anjeli (the first things God created were angels). Moving away from the Christian paradigm, if you are to go back in time, you reach beroniga. Before that there was nothing; the notions like time and space are void of meaning and content. Thus vu(space-time) came along with beronigo and all events and creation came after beroniga. Now without the context of Christianity, in Madi cosmogony there is no say Rubanga obi vu ni. That cannot be the case since Rubanga came to Madi with Christianity, while vu (space-time) came about since beroniga. It is also erroneous to give the quality of godness to vu since it hasn't any. Vu has always been at the mercy of the ori (the spirit gods). The ori, both good and bad often have their manifestations in trees, snakes, rivers, hills or the souls of departed parents and relatives. While tree-god may die, river-god may dry up, the ori which gave those entities the qualities of godness, never die - they reincarnate! It was at the kidori (stone altars) the Madi people worship ori. In Madi worship is called kirodi di ka (or sometimes vu di ka). When the ori are happy with the people they bless vu, and vu becomes friendly to the inhabitants. =Islam= The majority of the Madi are now Christians, while some are Muslim. Most Christian Ma'di are Catholics with some Anglicans. However a plethora of new churches are springing up daily in the area. There is also a sizeable Moslem community, mostly of Nubi (in Uganda), especially in trading areas like Adjumani, Dzaipi and Nimule. See Juma Oris and Moses Ali. However, even the so-called 'people of the books' often revert to traditional beliefs and practices at traumatic moments. In addition some modern people continue to believe in traditional African religions. The socio-political and cultural system Governance The social and political set-up of the Madi is closely interwoven with spirituality and this forms their attitudes and traditions. The society is organized in chiefdoms headed by a hereditary chief known as the Opi. The Opi exercised both political and religious powers. The rain-makers, land chiefs ‚Äì vudipi (who exercises an important influence over the land) and the chiefs are believed to retain similar powers even after their deaths. There was a hierarchy of spirits corresponding exactly to the hierarchy of authority as it existed in the society. The Opi (Chief/King) is the highest Authority in Madi, he is followed in rank by the community of elders who are responsible for resolving disputes, in the clans/villages. Historically the office an opi has always been held by a man. There is no record of a female opi. Legend has it that in the past, a person only needed a seed of grain to pound to provide a meal for a whole family. One day, when the farming population had gone to their farms and the blacksmiths as usual were left all alone at home, greed took hold of them. They wanted more than the single seed the farming community gave them for their services. So on this fateful day, they stole and pounded a mortarful of grain. The gods reacted swiftly and harshly to this disobedience; a single grain seed was never again to be enough. Human beings had to (toil harder for an ever decreasing yield per grain seed. When twins are born, the first of the pair is called opt 'chief (or the related form opia for a female) and the second of the pair is eremugo 'blacksmith' (or muja for a female second twin). The blacksmith is there to provide for the chief. The main economic activity that the Ma'di have traditionally engaged in is agriculture. The prevalence of tsetse fly depleted the livestock population at the end of the nineteenth century. Almost the whole population live off the land planting and growing mostly seasonal food crops like sesame, groundnuts, cassava, sweet potatoes, maize, millet and sorghum. Most of these are for personal consumption; only the excess is sold for cash. The main cash crops grown are cotton in Uganda and tobacco in the Sudan. Those who live close by the Nile do some fishing for commercial purposes. The main fishing grounds are Laropi (Uganda) and Nimule (South Sudan). Most of the fish caught in Nimule is smoke dried and transported to be sold in Juba, the capital of South Sudan. An important seasonal activity used to be hunting. This has dwindled in importance partly because of curbing of hunting by governments, and partly because Nimule is designated as a National Park, making it illegal to hum in or around it. The hunting season used to be the dry season when most of the agricultural activities for the year have been completed and the grass is dry enough to be burned. Blacksmiths have a particular significance in regard to the Ma'di. The Ma'di were at one time associated with the 'Ma'di hoc', which was once used as currency in marriages by both the Ma'di and the neighbouring tribes like the Acholi. who call it kweri ma'di 'Ma'di hoe. This was made by the blacksmiths (eremu). However, the Ma'di have low opinions of the blacksmiths, despite the important economic role they play in the society. They are thought to be a lazy lot who spend the whole day in the shed while the rest are toiling in the hot sun. They are also blamed for the fall of mankind from grace.  Social customs  The Madi society is established on the notions of clans and kinship under traditional rulers which all the subjects in the same geographical area pay their allegiance. There are clan and village leaders and family units who ensure that law and order within communities are kept and maintained socially, people do not worry within close relations, communal field work, feasts, hunting and funerals take place which brings about consolidation of unity, cooperation and peace. Marriages normally take place in churches, in homes of bridegrooms and in the government Administrators office. Traditional shrines are respected. Hereditary rulers and their spouses are buried in those sacred places (rudu). ''' Dances * Mure ‚Äî the dance of celebration and mourning. It is often danced during celebration (of events such: a victory in war, the birth of a king, etc.) and mourning (the death of king, loss of land during war, etc.). Mure is often danced to the tune of the sounds of wooden trumpets (ture, odiri), animal horns (pkere,bila), mgbiri (dancing bells), and drums (leri). At mure dance, men sporadically utter bellows (sira soka). Every cira is unique and carries coded message. A sira is normally used as sign of identification and authority. Women (often the wives of the men who utter cira) would answer with their own bellow (Gbilili) as sign of recognition and reverence. During mure, war songs (jenyi) are often sung - specially when the Madi people at war. Jenyi could even be sung during the time of battles, accompanied by the sounds of sira, ture and pkere, by Madi warriors to encourage themselves and to threaten the enemies to surrender or escape. * Gayi ‚Äî a youth flirtation dance similar to flamingo. * Kore ‚Äî a graceful dance * Kejua ‚Äî mostly danced by women Notable Ma'di individuals *Joseph Lagu, Vice President (Sudan), leader of Anyanya *John Baptist Angalefo Maku Iga, director general, Uganda External Security Organisation Moira, the war hero of Madi who fought for the Madi people Important tourist attractions In Uganda there are substantial earthworks of a fort at Dufile which was built in 1879 by Emin Pasha close to a site selected by Charles George Gordon in 1874; Dufile was originally used as a port for steamers and is today passenger ferries link it to Nimule. In the Sudan, there is the Nimule national park, and the Fulla Rapids, which may become a major provider of hydro-electricity for the whole region.

Richard Hovey of the class of 1885 wrote the original lyrics in 1894, titling the song \\"Men of Dartmouth\\". Traditionally the original second verse was only sung during time of war. On May 28, 1988, Dartmouth changed the title and words to reflect the presence of women as part of the College, since Dartmouth had become coeducational in 1972. Nicole Sakowitz, Dartmouth Glee Club President was the first person to conduct the new Alma Mater. The 1988 transition generated significant controversy at the time from students and alumni wishing to maintain the original lyrics, attracting national attention.

He attended schools in Alberta and British Columbia, and earned a degree at the University of British Columbia. He married Ruth Evelyn Pidcock on July 1, 1942. He worked in saw mills, as editor of the Wells Chronicle (Wells, BC), and was active in trade union affairs. Barnett was a member of the United Church of Canada. He did missionary work as a student. Barnett was manager of the Alberni and District Co-op, the first employee of the Alberni and District Credit Union and a long- serving executive member of the Industrial, Wood and Allied Workers of Canada (IWA), Local 1-85. In the 1930s he served as a school trustee in Wells, BC. He also served as an alderman in the former Alberni, British Columbia, (now part of Port Alberni) from 1959 until 1962. After retiring from Federal politics he served as Mayor of the District of Campbell River from 1976 to 1980. In his first foray into Federal politics he was defeated as the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) candidate for the House of Commons of Canada in the riding of Comox‚ÄîAlberni in the 1945 federal election. He was elected from that riding in the 1953 election. He then won re-election in the 1957 election, was defeated in the 1958 election. The CCF was almost wiped out in 1958 and soon reformed itself as the New Democratic Party (NDP). Barnett won re-election again in the 1962 election, becoming an NDP Member of Parliament, and was re-elected until his defeat in the 1968 election when he was defeated by Liberal Party candidate Richard Durante. The results were voided, however, and Barnett defeated Durante in a 1969 by-election. Barnett won his final House of Commons election in the 1972 election, and retired two years later.

Early life and debuts Born in Bern, Switzerland, to Sicilian parents, Licitra grew up in Milan. He fell into opera by accident. As many tenors before him, he was not altogether confident about his vocal capabilities and started working as a graphic artist for Italian Vogue. At the age of 19 he began attending singing classes on a regular basis and enrolled at the Music Academy of Parma and the Corsi Verdiani. After 8 years of studies, initially as a choir vocalist, he left his voice teacher and enrolled at Carlo Bergonzi's voice academy in Busseto. He debuted in Un ballo in maschera in Parma in 1998, in a performance for Bergonzi's students. His success led to a contract as cover in Ballo, Rigoletto and Aida in Verona, and he ended up singing them all. Buoyed by positive audience reception, he auditioned for Riccardo Muti at La Scala, who hired the young tenor for Alvaro in a new production of La forza del destino. At La Scala and other houses In March 1999, he debuted at La Scala under Riccardo Muti in La forza del destino as Alvaro, then sang in Tosca and Madama Butterfly at the Arena di Verona in June and July, then Tosca at La Scala in March 2000, again with Muti. The performance was recorded and released on Sony Classical. In May he debuted in Madrid in La forza del destino, and in Verona, he was awarded the Premio Zenatello as tenor of the year, and sang in La forza del destino at the Arena in July. In September he traveled to Japan with the La Scala ensemble for performances of Forza. Milan honoured him with the Honorary Citizenship Medal, and Sony offered him an exclusive recording contract. A performance of Il trovatore, recorded and issued by Sony, opened the 2000/2001 season at La Scala and the centennial of Verdi's death, the Anno Verdi. The opera had not been performed at La Scala in 22 years, and controversy ensued after Muti, who was the conductor and who had personally hand-picked Licitra for the role of Manrico, forbade his tenor to sing the traditional, interpolated high C of the 3rd act cabaletta \\"Di quella pira\\". There was an uproar in the audience, who booed the maestro's decision. Six months later Licitra sang the part again in Verona to great acclaim. Prior to Il trovatore in Verona, he had performed in Un ballo in maschera at La Scala under Muti, then repeated the success in Rome in December. In November he made his American debut as a guest soloist at the 26th annual Richard Tucker Music Foundation Opera Gala in New York. In December he left for Vienna and the Wiener Staatsoper to sing in Tosca, then Manrico in Il trovatore at the Sao Carlos in Lisbon in January 2002 and Alvaro (Forza) in Turin in February. The Met and beyond The Metropolitan Opera followed unexpectedly on 12 May 2002 when he appeared in Tosca, substituting for Luciano Pavarotti, then 66, who had cancelled the performance two hours before curtain time. Licitra, who was not scheduled to debut there until 2004, was flown in by the Met as a back-up singer and eventually received a 43-second ovation at the conclusion of \\"Recondita armonia\\" and a 46-second ovation at the conclusion of \\"E lucevan le stelle\\". In the short time since his debut in 1998, Licitra was dubbed the New Pavarotti, a tenor \\"worthy of the great Italian tradition\\". The New York Times reported after his American debut with the Richard Tucker Gala: \\"... an Italian tenor with a deep baritonal lower range, a brighter upper register, and strong secure high notes [...] in true Italian tenor tradition [...] If he can withstand the inevitable \\"fourth tenor\\" hype, he could be one to watch\\". He subsequently added the title roles in Andrea Ch√©nier, Ernani, Don Carlos, Turiddu in Cavalleria rusticana, Canio in Pagliacci, Dick in La fanciulla del West, and Luigi in Il tabarro, to his repertoire. Licitra's final public appearance was a concert performance of Puccini's Tosca with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at the Ravinia Festival on 30 July 2011. James Conlon conducted, and the cast included Patricia Racette and Bryn Terfel. Death On 27 August 2011, Licitra sustained severe head and chest injuries when he suffered a cerebral hemorrhage while riding his motor scooter and crashed into a wall in Donnalucata, Scicli, Ragusa Province, Sicily. He remained in a coma for nine days in the Garibaldi Hospital in Catania and was pronounced dead on 5 September 2011.

One of the last Seminole leaders to resist, he eventually moved to Indian Territory (present- day Oklahoma). He is buried in Fort Gibson National Cemetery, Muskogee County, Oklahoma. Early life and Seminole Wars Billy Bowlegs, 1858 Bowlegs was born into a family of hereditary chiefs descended from Cowkeeper of the Oconee tribe of the Seminole in the village of Cuscowilla on the Alachua savannah (present-day Payne's Prairie, near Micanopy, Florida). His father's name was Secoffee, while it is thought that the chief Micanopy was his uncle. The surname \\"Bowlegs\\" may be an alternate spelling of Bolek, a preceding Seminole chief. (A story that he had bowlegs from riding horses is unsubstantiated.) Although Bowlegs signed the Treaty of Payne's Landing of 1832, he refused to leave Florida. He wasn't well-noted at the beginning of the Second Seminole War (roughly, 1835 to 1842). After the capture (under a flag of truce offered by Gen. Thomas Jesup) and subsequent death of OsceolaOsceola and Abiaka , Seminole Tribe and the death of Micanopy, amidst the loss of other prominent Seminole chiefs, Bowlegs and his band of 200 warriors became some of the most prominent fighters surviving at the time hostilities ended on 14 August 1842. To impress and awe the Seminole chiefs, the US government brought Bowlegs to Washington, D.C. to underline the power of the United States. Bowlegs and his band lived in relative peace until 1855. A group of army engineers and surveyors invaded his territory in southwestern Florida, where they cut down banana trees and destroyed other property in the course of building forts. Some historians have viewed these actions as intentional provocation to make Bowlegs react, so the settlers would have a reason to force the Seminole out. If so, the provocation worked: Bowlegs led his warriors in sporadic attacks against settlers for the next few years, in what is known as the Third Seminole War. The Army was unable to subdue his guerrilla warfare. Relocation Chief Billy Bowlegs by Karl Ferdinand Wimar, 1861 In early 1858, Chief Wild Cat of the Western Seminole was brought back from Indian Territory to convince Bowlegs to relocate voluntarily. The US government offered Bowlegs $10,000 and each of his chiefs $1000 if they did so. Warriors and non-warriors were offered less. They initially refused but later that year, the band of 123 agreed to relocation. Billy's Creek in downtown Fort Myers, Florida is named after Bowlegs as this was the spot where he was forced to surrender in 1858. In May, Bowlegs and his followers arrived in New Orleans, en route to Arkansas and their new home in the Indian Territory. A journalist described the chief as having \\"two wives, one son, five daughters, and a hundred thousand dollars in hard cash.\\"Harpers Weekly, June 12, 1858. on-line version After reaching Indian Territory, Bowlegs became a leading chief there.

He is considered as being among the earlier and most influential applicants of historical revisionism to commonly held narratives regarding the Spanish colonial period in Latin America. Early life and education O'Gorman was born in Coyoac√°n, in the southern part of Mexico City. He was the son of painter and mining engineer Cecil Crawford O'Gorman, an Irishman who emigrated to Mexico in 1895, and the great-great-nephew of the first British consul to Mexico City, Charles O'Gorman, who later married a Mexican citizen. He was the younger brother of celebrated architect and painter Juan O'Gorman. He graduated with a degree in Law (1928) from the Escuela Libre de Derecho. In 1940 he began lecturing in the Philosophy faculty of the Mexico City College. In 1948 he obtained a Masters in Philosophy and in 1951 he completed his doctorate in History with summa cum laude honorific distinction from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). While at UNAM, he was at the university's Faculty of Philosophy and Letters, and a researcher at the university's Institute of Historical Research. During his time at UNAM, O'Gorman met and developed relationships with distinguished Mexican intellectuals and Spanish refugees, such as Jos√© Gaos, who would greatly influence his later works. O'Gorman also lectured at the Universidad Iberoamericana. Career Between 1938 and 1952, O'Gorman worked for the Mexican General National Archive. He became a member of the Mexican Academy of the Spanish Language in 1969 and the Mexican Academy of the Corresponding History of the Real of Madrid, corporation of which he was a director from 1972 to 1987. He resigned after disagreements over concepts such as the \\"discovery of America\\", \\"encounter between two worlds\\", \\"cultural fusion\\" (or \\"natural mixing\\"), names he rejected and instead preferred the terms \\"empowerment\\", \\"domination\\" and others more according with history.

Biography Husain's ode to Queen Victoria on the occasion of her Golden Jubilee in 1887 written in Urdu. =Early life= Husain was born into an aristocratic ashraf family in the northern Indian city of Monghyr, Bihar. He was raised a Shi'ite, but later abandoned that faith. He began his studies in Sadiqpur in Bihar where he first came into contact with the revolutionary preacher Sayyid Ahmad Barelvi (1786‚Äì1831) in the 1820s. He later moved to Delhi in 1826 where he studied under Shah Abdul Aziz (1746-1824), son of the revivalist theologian Shah Waliullah Dehlawi (1703‚Äì1762), and then Abdul Aziz's son and successor Muhammad Ishaq (1778‚Äì1846), the renowned muhaddith in India. When Muhammad Ishaq emigrated to the Hijaz, Husain took his place as a teacher. Self-consciously identifying himself with Shah Waliullah, and viewing himself as spiritual heir to his legacy, Husain took on the title miyan sahib, a title closely associated with Shah Waliullah's successors. At Delhi's prestigious Madrasah-i Rahimiyah seminary, which had broken up into a number of interlinked schools following Muhammad Ishaq's death in 1846, Husain led the most Wahhabi-oriented school. =Attitude towards the British= Nazeer Husain advocated political quietism and was among a large number of Muslim scholars from both the Sunni and Shia sects, who supported British rule and rejected calls for armed jihad against it. He was also among a number of Muslim scholars, including the muftis of Mecca, who declared British India to be dar al-Islam (abode of peace) and not Dar al-harb (abode of war). During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, he resisted pressure from the mutineers to call for a jihad and instead declared in favour of British rule, viewing the Muslim-British relationship as a legal contract which could not be broken unless their religious rights were breached. Despite having denied any involvement in the rebellion in its aftermath and having strongly opposed the declaration of jihad as sinful and a faithless breach of covenant, Husain was widely believed to have been among a group of Delhi ulema pressured into signing a jihad fatwa. He was arrested in 1868 by the British on suspicion of being the leader of the Wahhabi insurgents in Delhi and detained for six months but was eventually released without charge after it had emerged that he had not supported the rebels. Husain consistently denied any links with the Wahhabis as well as any role in the Delhi uprising in 1857. Because he was seen by the British as the only scholar of the Ahl-i Hadith who could allay the conflict between the movement and followers of the prevailing Hanafi school of thought, which often resulted in civil disturbances that the Government sought to prevent, and because he also knew English which was very rare among Indian Muslim scholars at the time, Husain's turbulent relations with the British at Delhi had improved. He was granted a letter of recommendation by the government to the British Vice Consul in Jedda when he travelled there in 1883 to perform the Hajj pilgrimage. However, he was already denounced as a Wahhabi by Indian Hanafis to the Ottoman governor of Jedda who had him arrested and imprisoned before he could present the letter. He was later released with the intervention of the British Vice Consul. =Founding of Jamaat Ahl-i Hadith= Within a couple of years of his release from prison in 1868, Husian, together with Siddiq Hasan Khan of Bhopal and Muhammad Husain Batalvi (c.1840‚Äì1920), two influential fellow alumni of the Madrasah-i Rahimiyah, formally founded the politico-religious organisation known as the Jamaat Ahl-i Hadith, the Party of the People of the Hadith. However, their zealous opposition against co-religionists and non-Muslims alike, to the extent of using violence against mosques and shrines, and their strong anti-polytheist, anti-innovation, anti-Shia and anti-Christian message in close resemblance to the followers of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab (1703‚Äì1792), did not stop other Muslim groups from denouncing them as Wahhabis. Neither did the British Government of India cease using this term for them until the Ahl-i Hadith leaders published, in 1885, a book denying any links with Wahhabism and called for the Government to cease employing this term in reference to them. Husain taught hadith at Delhi for half a century,Annmarie Schimmel, Islam in the Indian Subcontinent, pg. 208‚Äì9.

Tamer (eds.), Islamic Theology, Philosophy and Law: Debating Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya, Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, pp.162‚Äì219 Husain held together a network of scholars who aligned themselves to the teachings of Ahmad Sirhindi and Shah Waliullah Dehlawi, but were more uncompromising in their rejection of what they believed were blameworthy innovations in the faith and the legitimacy given to the four Sunni schools of law. The solicitude of the British also gained Husain favour among modernist Muslims associated with the Aligarh Institute, whose Aligarh Institute Gazette dedicated an obituary praising him when he died in 1902 at the age of ninety-seven. Teachings The teachings of Nazeer Husain and Siddiq Hasan Khan were shaped amidst broader reformist developments in South Asia which saw the Muslims of India as having drifted away from 'authentic' Islamic beliefs and practices that compromised the Islamic concept of the indivisible oneness of God and bordered on idolatry. For guidance on religious matters, however, in contrast to other reformist currents in India, they advocated direct use of the central Islamic scriptures: the Quran and hadith ‚Äì which they interpreted literally and narrowly ‚Äì rather than looking to the classical lawmakers and the legal traditions of Islam that developed around them. Accordingly, Husain was known for his emphasis on the primacy of the Prophetic traditions as the source of Islamic law over deference (taqlid) given to the Sunni legal schools and for the opposition to popular rituals and folk practices associated with the Sufis which were deemed to be illegitimate innovations in the faith. Although Husain himself has been seen as less literalist and more favourably inclined towards Sufism than later exponents of the Ahl-i Hadith, demanding an oath of allegiance (bay'ah) from his disciples, a practice commonly associated with Sufism, and even praising Ibn Arabi, a colossus among Sufis.Martin Riexingr. (2013; p.501), 'Ibn Taymiyya's Worldview and the Challenge of Modernity: A Conflict Among the Ahl-i ·∏§adƒ´th in British India' in B. Krawietz & G. Tamer (eds.), Islamic Theology, Philosophy and Law: Debating Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya, Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, pp.493‚Äì518 Nevertheless, overall, these teachings resulted in the development of close ties with Wahhabi scholars but strong controversy between the Ahl-i Hadith and the Deobandis who upheld strict adherence to the Hanafi school. Notable students and influence According to author Charles Allen, among Syed Nazeer Husain's students were Imdadullah Muhajir Makki, Muhammad Qasim Nanotvi and Rashid Ahmad Gangohi, the founding figures of the Deobandi movement; although prominent Deobandi scholars including Mufti Muhammad Taqi Usmani have issued fatwas against him. Husain is also considered by some scholars to have had an influence on Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, the founder of the Ahmadiyya movement, whose second marriage Husain had performed in 1884, though Ghulam Ahmad never studied under him. Prior to pledging his allegiance to Ghulam Ahmad and becoming his foremost disciple, Hakim Nur-ud-Din had also briefly studied under Husain. Other students of Husain included the Afghan- Indian scholar Abdullah Ghaznavi; the two major Ahl-i Hadith proponents in the Punjab: Muhammad Husain Batalvi and Sana'ullah Amritsari; and the Indian hadith scholar Shams-ul-Haq Azimabadi.The modernist founder of the Aligarh Movement and Muslim University, Syed Ahmad Khan, also studied under Husain in the 1850s.

Early life Pope was born at Deddington, near Banbury, Oxfordshire, probably in 1507, as he was about sixteen years old when his father, a yeoman farmer, died in 1523. He was educated at Banbury School and Eton College, and entered the Court of Chancery. He there found a friend and patron in the Lord Chancellor, Thomas Audley. As clerk of briefs in the Star Chamber, Warden of the Mint (1534‚Äì1536), Clerk of the Crown in Chancery (1537), and second officer and Treasurer of the Court of Augmentations for the settlement of the confiscated property of the smaller religious foundations, he obtained immense wealth and influence. In this last office he was superseded in 1541, but from 1547 to 1553 he was again employed as fourth officer. He himself won by grant or purchase a considerable share in the spoils, for nearly 30 manors, which came sooner or later into his possession, were originally church property. According to John Aubrey, \\"He could have rode in his owne lands from Cogges (by Witney) to Banbury, about 18 miles.\\" He established his country seat at Tittenhanger, Hertfordshire. Parliament He was Member of Parliament for Buckingham in 1536 and for Berkshire in 1539. In 1537 he was knighted. He was High Sheriff of Essex and Hertfordshire for 1552 and 1557. The religious changes made by Edward VI were not to his liking, but at the beginning of Mary's reign he became a member of the privy council. In 1556, he was sent to reside as guardian in Elizabeth's house. Trinity College As early as 1555, he had begun to arrange for the endowment of a college at Oxford, for which he bought the site and buildings of Durham College, the Oxford house of the abbey of Durham, from George Owen and William Martyn. He received a royal charter for the establishment and endowment of a college of the \\"Holy and Undivided Trinity\\" (now known simply as Trinity College on 8 March 1556. The foundation provided for a president, twelve fellows and eight scholars, with a schoolhouse at Hooknorton. The number of scholars was subsequently increased to twelve, the schoolhouse being given up. On 28 March 1556, the members of the college were put in possession of the site, and they were formally admitted on 29 May 1556. Death Pope died at Clerkenwell on 29 January 1559, and was buried at St Stephen's, Walbrook; but his remains were subsequently removed to Trinity College, where his widow erected a semi-Gothic alabaster monument to his memory. Personal life Pope was married three times, but had no children. Much of his property was left to charitable and religious foundations, and the bulk of his Oxfordshire estates passed to the family of his brother, John Pope of Wroxton, and his descendants, the viscounts Dillon and the earls of Guilford and barons North.

Background Primates often have notions of fairness and sharing, with violations punished by exclusion or banishment from social groups. In human history, prior to agriculture, more nomadic cultures had systems of punishment for behavior or resistance, including those developed by the Huns throughout Mongolia. With the development of agriculture, which led to more closely populated cities and cultures and behavior to address fears of persons taking advantage of or causing harm to others, more formal systems of punishment for crimes developed, independently around the world, or based upon other cultures, including those developed in the early Babylonian laws of Hammurabi and the Hammurabic Code.  Ancient China  Law enforcement in Ancient China was carried out by \\"prefects\\". The notion of a \\"prefect\\" in China has existed for thousands of years. The prefecture system developed in both the Chu and Jin kingdoms of the Spring and Autumn period. In Jin, dozens of prefects were spread across the state, each having a limited authority and employment period. In Ancient China, under the rule of Dang Lin Wang, a new judicial system emerged. This new system had prefects appointed by local magistrates, who in turn were appointed by the head of state, usually the emperor of the dynasty. The prefects oversaw the civil administration of their \\"prefecture\\", or jurisdiction. Prefects usually reported to the local magistrate, just as modern police report to judges. Under each prefect were \\"subprefects\\" who helped collectively with law enforcement of the area. Some prefects were responsible for handling investigations, much like modern police detectives. Eventually the concept of the \\"prefecture system\\" would spread to other cultures such as Korea and Japan. Law enforcement in Ancient China was also relatively progressive, allowing for female prefects. Some examples of ancient Chinese prefects include: Chong Fu, prefect of the Ying District in the East Han Dynasty, and Ching Chow, prefect of the modern Shang-tung Province. An example of a female prefect would be Lady Qu of Wuding (serving 1531 ‚Äì c. 1557). In ancient China, when minor judicial incidents such as robberies occur, the client reports to a police officer (a.k.a. constable) at the prefectural office. To catch a thief, a constable can arrest another thief by baiting him with a forged opportunity and use the thief's same-field knowledge to predict the one in question. The assisting thief would still be punished for robbery but since he assisted the officer his punishment would be lowered. By Ming law, police officers have a strict time schedule to arrest the criminals. They usually have thirty days to arrest the issued criminals. If officers have not capture their assigned criminals after thirty days or assigned deadline, they would subject to physical punishments. Successfully arresting criminals earns police officers promotions. However, this method was often subject to abuse in order to quickly earn promotions. Police officers were appointed by the head officials from the populations. These selected officers, however, were not recognized as part of the magistrates for they were merely runners. Approximately one out of four court cases features corrupted officers who accepts bribes to ignore certain crimes, or sometimes even assisting the criminals. Officers focusing on building social network which may include criminals instead of making examples of preventing crimes.  Pre-modern Europe  For the most part, crime was viewed as a private matter in Ancient Greece and Rome. Even with offenses as serious as murder, justice was the prerogative of the victim's family and private war or vendetta the means of protection against criminality. Publicly owned slaves were used by magistrates as police in Ancient Greece. In Athens, a group of 300 Scythian slaves was used to guard public meetings to keep order and for crowd control, and also assisted with dealing with criminals, manhandling prisoners, and making arrests. Other duties associated with modern policing, such as investigating crimes, were left to the citizens themselves. The Roman Empire had a reasonably effective law enforcement system until the decline of the empire, though there was never an actual police force in the city of Rome. When under the reign of Augustus the capital had grown to almost one million inhabitants, he created 14 wards, which were protected by seven squads of 1,000 men. If necessary, they might have called on the Praetorian Guard for assistance. Beginning in the 5th century, policing became a function of clan chiefs and heads of state. During the Middle Ages, crime and punishment were dealt with through blood feuds (or trial by ordeal) between the parties. Payment to the victim (or their family), known as wergild, was another common punishment, including for violent crimes. For those who could not afford to buy their way out of punishment, harsh penalties included various forms of corporal punishment. These included mutilation, whipping, branding, and flogging, as well as execution. V√§stg√∂talagen specifies exactly how much to pay, if anything, depending on who was slain. The primary form of state- administered punishment during ancient times and the Middle Ages was banishment or exile. Though a prison, Le Stinche, existed as early as the 14th century in Florence, incarceration was not widely used until the 19th century. Rather, it was used to detain prisoners before trial or for imprisoning people without judicial process. The Anglo-Saxon system of maintaining public order was a private system of tithings, since the Norman conquest led by a constable, which was based on a social obligation for the good conduct of the others; more common was that local lords and nobles were responsible to maintain order in their lands, and often appointed a constable, sometimes unpaid, to enforce the law. Colonial America When early colonists first came to America, they did not include trained lawyers or other law- knowledgeable persons. Many parts of the criminal justice system in colonial America were similar to those in England, France, and the Dutch Republic. Gradually French and Dutch influences disappeared in the islands. What remained was the basic idea many had of the English common law system. This system was the best-known to seventeenth-century colonists. The common law system included a set of rules that were used to solve problems in society. It was based on the history of decisions previous judges had made instead of lawmaking codes or laws. This system made a distinction between two basic types of crimes: felonies and misdemeanors. The legal process, mostly for more serious crimes, involved a grand jury, composed of members of the community, which decided whether there was enough evidence for prosecution. However, in these proceedings no district attorneys or public prosecutors were available. The victim of the crime was responsible for instigating the prosecution and financing it. It was these fundamental principles that stuck with the colonists and were used selectively to create a new and unique criminal justice system. Many factors influenced the colonists‚Äô selection process by which they constructed their approach to criminal justice. As previously mentioned, there were no professional legal experts and few law resources available. This left a lot of room for creativity and mistakes. The colonists were largely left to their own devices concerning the details of their developing criminal justice system. The new environment the colonists encountered in the New World, especially the western frontier, also affected the way the law was shaped. The system was molded to fit the colonists‚Äô needs as they settled further and further west. Vigilantism was an inevitable byproduct of the faults of the development of justice in America. Religion, especially early on in the colonial period, exerted a strong influence on law making. Legal codes, such as the 1648 Book of the General Laws and Liberties of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, contained very strong biblical references, more so than did the ones in England. Although this religious impact was felt most strongly in Puritan colonies, similar ideas were evident among other colonists as well. Many colonial makeshift criminal codes considered lying, idleness, drunkenness, certain sexual offenses, and even bad behavior to be crimes. These moralistic crimes stemmed from the relation of crime to sin and sin to crime. Adding to the religious factor, the colonists held individual liberty in high regard. This later influenced more contemporary criminal codes. =County sheriff= Besides being one of the most important criminal justice officials of the colonial period in America, the county sheriff had other responsibilities. These included collecting taxes, running and supervising elections, and handling any other legal business in the community. With such a workload, sheriffs were usually the most important political figures in the county and represented the governor and the English government. In the criminal justice system of the period, the sheriff acted as a reactive official. His job was to follow up on complaints or information of misconduct from the other citizens. He was paid through a system of fees rather than a set salary which came mostly from tax collecting. This discouraged many sheriffs from concentrating heavily on law enforcement. Such high powers often led to corruption in this field with embezzlement and other irregularities with tax collections and fees. =Judges and magistrates= Judges are also known as magistrates or justices of the peace. Even though a judge held very influential positions in their counties, they were far from the professionals that they are today. They were usually religious or political leaders. The county judge was in charge of the court for the area he presided in and vehemently believed their role in society was to enforce God's will. Their understanding of God's will usually caused colonial justices to seek confessions and repentance from the accused rather than just punishment. The main goal was to bring order back to society. Most of the minor cases in the county only involved the judge while more serious crimes were heard by a court of several judges. The courts met only periodically, slowing down the sentencing of serious crimes. =Colonial courts= Although the colonial courts did closely mimic the proceedings of the courts of England, they were much simpler and more informal. They were also made available to everyone and used to relieve tensions and conflicts in the community. In addition to hearing the disputes of the local colonists, the courts also held the responsibilities of the legislature, executive, and judicial branches of the county's government. These responsibilities illustrated the highly unspecialized nature of colonial government agencies. The courts became connected to an informal role in the county's social and economic life. Although some county courts were presided over by one judge, some consisted of ten to fifteen judges. However, the courts with many judges met very infrequently and this made it almost impossible to conduct any legal business in a fast and efficient way. The matter was even worse in the back country where there often was a complete lack of courts to settle any conflicts or perform governmental services. =Legal process= The legal process of trials in colonial America was quite different from the modern one in many ways. After an alleged crime was reported, a magistrate, or judge, would consider the presented evidence and decide whether it was a true crime. If the magistrate decided that a crime was indeed committed the accused was apprehended and sent to be questioned by the magistrate. The interrogation was usually held in the magistrate's own house with a few marshals or deputies as witnesses. However, during this step in the procedure, no lawyers were involved on behalf of either party. After the hearing the accused was usually free to leave until the trial without bail. Just as in the interrogation, there was no defense attorney present at the trial and the proceedings moved quickly as each witness testified against the defendant. However, a district attorney, who was often appointed by the governor and assigned to a certain district or county, usually handled the prosecution. Unlike the prosecutors in England, who worked privately and for a payment from the victim, the district attorneys of colonial America handled the prosecution in almost all trials. The district attorney's position soon became one of the most important political position in county government because they often had to be elected. The role of the defense attorney was minuscule, if not unheard of, in the colonial period. This stemmed from an English legal tradition of severely restricting the role of the defense to challenging or question narrow points of the law. In time the American practice of trials allowed a greater and more vigorous role to the defense of the accused. However, at that current time there were few trained lawyers to begin with and most defendants could not afford one. Juries were also not used at that time and those who requested them were thought to be challenging the authority of the judge. Since the magistrate who had proclaimed the trial necessary was also the judge who presided over the trial, the verdict was quite often guilty. The main purpose of the trial was to give the defendant a chance to admit their guilt and repent. The theory behind the trial and punishment being very public was that they would serve to reinforce the rules of conduct and discourage others from acting out and breaking laws. =Protection of cities= The colonists soon realized that a sheriff was not enough to keep their colonies safe and crime- free. Many villages and cities began adding other criminal justice agents to help maintain order. The rising populations were proving to be too much to handle for just one law enforcement agent in the county. The mayor was originally the chief law enforcement official, but he acted only in extreme circumstances. In addition to the sheriff, the mayor appointed a high constable and several lesser constables and marshals to help him. Those holding such positions had powers similar to those of the sheriff. To protect their citizens during the night, many counties established a night watch, an institution of criminal justice originally inherited from Europe. The night watch consisted of a group of civilians who patrolled and kept watch over the city, making sure to look for fires, suspicious individuals, or possible riots. This was a collective responsibility, but few were willing to serve. Certain cities imposed fines on those who refused. The night watch, though relatively effective, only served during the night. During the day, the responsibility of protecting innocent citizens and apprehending criminals fell to the constables and marshals. Soon a day watch was implemented in many areas. In extreme situations, such as riots, the colonial communities often had to call out the militia. Riots, a common disturbance in colonial America, occurred for many reasons including to contest elections, to protest economic conditions, or to enforce standards of morality. Even at the first sign of a riot the mayor or some other official would appear and literally read the riot act to the assembled crowd. =Punishments= Depending on the crimes that the colonists committed, there were plenty of punishments to choose from. Most of the punishments were public, where heavy use of shame and shaming was included. Through the method of shaming, the criminal justice system meant more to teach a lesson than simply punish the offender. The ‚Äúcriminal‚Äù was almost always male. However, punishment for such crimes as witchcraft, infanticide, and adultery fell heavily on the women. In addition, much of the blame and punishment for crimes was attributed to those in the lowest rank in society. Whipping was the most commonly used form of punishment, especially in the south with slaves. Other frequently used punishments included branding, cutting off ears, and placing people in the pillory. These punishments were sometimes harsher, depending on the crimes committed. In the American colonies, executions were less common than in England. However, when such a method was used, it was most often a public hanging. Usually capital offenses, such as murder or rape, or repeated serious offenses constituted a need for an execution. Imprisonment was uncommon in colonial America since the budding colonies did not have people to spare to keep the community in order. Every person was valuable for their working ability, and losing even one worker to lawkeeping was neither reasonable nor an efficient use of resources. In addition, colonial communities rarely had enough extra money to build a prison and feed prisoners. Since probation was not yet known to the colonists, they used a system of nods to guarantee troublemakers would not cause any problems. Courts began to require many problem-causing people to put up money to make sure they would stay out of trouble. This system worked especially well in communities where everyone minded each other's business. =County jails= In the early colonial period, prisons were not yet a major staple in the criminal justice system. They were used mainly for holding people who were awaiting trial rather than punishment. The early jails resembled ordinary houses in many aspects and had no distinctive architectural features. Prisoners were placed in rooms instead of cells and were not classified or segregated in any way. Men, women, and juveniles were mixed together causing many problems. Overcrowding soon became a big concern, as well as poor sanitation. The jails turned into breeding houses of illness. Furthermore, the jails were even unable to fulfill their basic purpose of containing offenders within its walls. Escapes were very frequent. The prisons held not only those who were awaiting trial but also people who owed money, called debtors. These people were free during the day so they could work to pay off their debt but they returned to the jail at night. Other prisoners included the homeless, unemployed, or impoverished. They were expected to learn good work ethic during their stay. The financial arrangements of the jailer were similar to those of the sheriff, especially since the same person usually held both jobs. He was paid by the county through a system of fees. Specific items such as food, clothing, and other things were submitted to the county commissioners for money. Just like other criminal justice positions with a lot of power, the jailer was often corrupt and was notoriously known for embezzling public funds, soliciting bribes from prisoners and their families, selling whiskey to the prisoners, and abusing the inmates. =Administration of justice in colonial America= Crime problem The gradual development of a sophisticated criminal justice system in America found itself extremely small and unspecialized during colonial times. Many problems, including lack of a large law-enforcement establishment, separate juvenile-justice system, and prisons and institutions of probation and parole. Criminal matters were also not the top priority of the sheriff and the courts. The lack of a large institutional framework was a result of relatively small and homogenous colonial communities. These colonies were self-policing and social control was maintained by an omnipresent set of informal restrictions. They also depended on community pressure to regulate human conduct.  Invention of \\"police\\"  In Western culture, the contemporary concept of a police paid by the government was developed by French legal scholars and practitioners in the 17th century and early 18th century, notably with Nicolas Delamare's Trait√© de la Police (\\"Treatise of the Police\\", published between 1705 and 1738). The German Polizeiwissenschaft (Science of Police) was also an important theoretical formulation of police. The first police force in the modern sense was created by the government of King Louis XIV in 1667 to police the city of Paris, then the largest city of Europe and considered the most dangerous European city. The royal edict, registered by the Parlement of Paris on March 15, 1667 created the office of lieutenant g√©n√©ral de police (\\"lieutenant general of police\\"), who was to be the head of the new Paris police force, and defined police as the task of \\"ensuring the peace and quiet of the public and of private individuals, purging the city of what may cause disturbances, procuring abundance, and having each and everyone live according to their station and their duties\\". This office was held by Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie, who had 44 commissaires de police (police commissioners) under his authority. In 1709, these commissioners were assisted by inspecteurs de police (police inspectors). The city of Paris was divided into 16 districts policed by the 44 commissaires de police, each assigned to a particular district and assisted in their districts by clerks and a growing bureaucracy. The scheme of the Paris police force was extended to the rest of France by a royal edict of October 1699, resulting in the creation of lieutenants general of police in all large French cities or towns. However, this early conceptualization of police was quite different from today's police forces, exclusively in charge of maintaining order and arresting criminals. As conceptualized by the Polizeiwissenschaft, the police had an economical and social duty (\\"procuring abundance\\"). It was in charge of demographics concerns and of empowering the population, which was considered by the mercantilist theory to be the main strength of the state. Thus, its functions largely overreached simple law enforcement activities, and included public health concerns, urban planning (which was important because of the miasma theory of disease; thus, cemeteries were moved out of town, etc.), surveillance of prices, etc.Michel Foucault, Security, Territory, Population, 1977-78 course (published 2004) Development of modern police was contemporary to the formation of the state, later defined by sociologist Max Weber as detaining \\"the monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force\\", primarily exercised by the police and the military. = Modern police = After the troubles of the French Revolution the Paris police force was reorganized by Napol√©on I on February 17, 1800 as the Prefecture of Police, along with the reorganization of police forces in all French cities with more than 5,000 inhabitants. On March 12, 1829, a government decree created the first uniformed policemen in Paris and all French cities, known as sergents de ville (\\"city sergeants\\"), which the Paris Prefecture of Police's website claims were the first uniformed policemen in the world.Bicentenaire : theme_expo4 In London, there existed watchmen hired to guard the streets at night since 1663. Watchmen were the first paid law enforcement in the country, augmenting the force of unpaid constables, but were not professionally organized. The word \\"police\\" was borrowed from French into the English language in the 18th century, but for a long time it applied only to French and continental European police forces. The word, and the concept of police itself, was \\"disliked as a symbol of foreign oppression\\" (according to Britannica 1911). Prior to the 19th century, the only official use of the word \\"police\\" recorded in the United Kingdom was the appointment of Commissioners of Police for Scotland in 1714 and the creation of the Marine Police in 1798 (set up to protect merchandise at the Port of London). On June 30, 1800, the authorities of Glasgow, Scotland successfully petitioned the Government to pass the Glasgow Police Act establishing the City of Glasgow Police. This was the first professional police service in the world that differed from previous law enforcement in that it was a preventive police force. This was quickly followed in other Scottish towns, which set up their own police forces by individual Acts of Parliament. On September 29, 1829, the Metropolitan Police Act was passed by Parliament, allowing Sir Robert Peel, the then home secretary, to found the London Metropolitan Police. Based on the Peelian principles, this was the city's first full-time, professional and centrally- organised police force. The Metropolitan Police officers were often referred to as ¬¥Bobbies¬¥ after Sir Robert (Bobby) Peel. They are regarded as the first modern police force and became a model for the police forces in most countries, such as the United States, and most of the then British Empire (Commonwealth). Bobbies can still be found in many parts of the world (for example in British Overseas Territories or ex-colonies such as Bermuda, Gibraltar or St Helena). The model of policing in Britain had as its primary role the keeping of the Queen's Peace and this has continued to the present day. Many of the Commonwealth countries developed police forces using similar models, such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Sir Robert Peel In North America, the Toronto Police was founded in Canada in 1834, one of the first municipal police departments on that continent, followed by police forces in Montreal and Quebec City both founded in 1838. In the United States, the first organized police service was established in Boston in 1838, New York in 1844, and Philadelphia in 1854. Early on, police were not respected by the community, as corruption was rampant. In the late 19th and early 20th century, there were few specialized units in police departments. In 1905, the Pennsylvania State Police became the first state police agency established in the United States, as recommended by Theodore Roosevelt's Anthracite Strike Commission and Governor Samuel Pennypacker. The advent of the police car, two- way radio, and telephone in the early 20th century transformed policing into a reactive strategy that focused on responding to calls for service. In the 1920s, led by Berkeley, California police chief, August Vollmer, police began to professionalize, adopt new technologies, and place emphasis on training. With this transformation, police command and control became more centralized. O.W. Wilson, a student of Vollmer, helped reduce corruption and introduce professionalism in Wichita, Kansas, and later in the Chicago Police Department. Strategies employed by O.W. Wilson included rotating officers from community to community to reduce their vulnerability to corruption, establishing of a non-partisan police board to help govern the police force, a strict merit system for promotions within the department, and an aggressive, recruiting drive with higher police salaries to attract professionally qualified officers. Despite such reforms, police agencies were led by highly autocratic leaders, and there remained a lack of respect between police and the community. During the professionalism era of policing, law enforcement agencies concentrated on dealing with felonies and other serious crime, rather than focusing on crime prevention. Following urban unrest in the 1960s, police placed more emphasis on community relations, and enacted reforms such as increased diversity in hiring. The Kansas City Preventive Patrol study in the 1970s found the reactive approach to policing to be ineffective. In the 1990s, many law enforcement agencies began to adopt community policing strategies, and others adopted problem-oriented policing. In the 1990s, CompStat was developed by the New York Police Department as an information-based system for tracking and mapping crime patterns and trends, and holding police accountable for dealing with crime problems. CompStat, and other forms of information-led policing, have since been replicated in police departments across the United States. Prisons Until the late 19th century, law enforcement in the United States was a responsibility of local and state governments only. In 1870, with the passage of the Interstate Commerce Act, the Federal government in the U.S. began to take on some law enforcement responsibilities, and the Department of Justice was established in 1870, to carry out these duties. In 1872, control of federal prisons was transferred to the new department, from the Department of Interior. New facilities were built, including the penitentiary at Leavenworth in 1895, and a facility for women located in West Virginia, at Alderson was established in 1924.

Together with acetic acid, glycolic acid, and oxalic acid, glyoxylic acid is one of the C2 carboxylic acids. It is a colourless solid that occurs naturally and is useful industrially. Structure and nomenclature Although the structure of glyoxylic acid is described as having an aldehyde functional group, the aldehyde is only a minor component of the form most prevalent in some situations. Instead, it often exists as a hydrate or a cyclic dimer. For example, in the presence of water, the carbonyl rapidly converts to a geminal diol (described as the \\"monohydrate\\"). The equilibrium constant (K) is 300 for the formation of dihydroxyacetic acid at room temperature: :300px In solution, the monohydrate exists in equilibrium with a hemiacetal dimer form:Georges Mattioda and Yani Christidis ‚ÄúGlyoxylic Acid‚Äù Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. :300px In isolation, the aldehyde structure has as a major conformer a cyclic hydrogen-bonded structure with the aldehyde carbonyl in close proximity to the carboxyl hydrogen: :100px The Henry's law constant of glyoxylic acid is KH = 1.09 √ó 104 √ó exp[(40.0 √ó 103/R) √ó (1/T ‚àí 1/298)]. Preparations The conjugate base of glyoxylic acid is known as glyoxylate and is the form that the compound exists in solution at neutral pH. Glyoxylate is the byproduct of the amidation process in biosynthesis of several amidated peptides. For the historical record, glyoxylic acid was prepared from oxalic acid electrosynthetically: in organic synthesis, lead dioxide cathodes were applied for preparing glyoxylic acid from oxalic acid in a sulfuric acid electrolyte. :380px Hot nitric acid can oxidize glyoxal to glyoxylic; however this reaction is highly exothermic and prone to thermal runaway. In addition, oxalic acid is the main side product. Also, ozonolysis of maleic acid is effective.  Biological role  Glyoxylate is an intermediate of the glyoxylate cycle, which enables organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, and plants to convert fatty acids into carbohydrates. The glyoxylate cycle is also important for induction of plant defense mechanisms in response to fungi. The glyoxylate cycle is initiated through the activity of isocitrate lyase, which converts isocitrate into glyoxylate and succinate. Research is being done to co-opt the pathway for a variety of uses such as the biosynthesis of succinate. = In humans = Glyoxylate is produced via two pathways: through the oxidation of glycolate in peroxisomes or through the catabolism of hydroxyproline in mitochondria. In the peroxisomes, glyoxylate is converted into glycine by AGT1 or into oxalate by glycolate oxidase. In the mitochondria, glyoxylate is converted into glycine by AGT2 or into glycolate by glycolate reductase. A small amount of glyoxylate is converted into oxalate by cytoplasmic lactate dehydrogenase. centerthumb600x600pxOxalate and glyoxylate metabolism in hepatocytes. AGT1 and 2, alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase 1 and 2; GO, glycolate oxidase; GR, glyoxylate reductase; HKGA, 4-hydroxy-2-ketoglutarate lyase; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase = In plants = In addition to being an intermediate in the glyoxylate pathway, glyoxylate is also an important intermediate in the photorespiration pathway. Photorespiration is a result of the side reaction of Rubisco with O2 instead of CO2. While at first considered a waste of energy and resources, photorespiration has been shown to be an important method of regenerating carbon and CO2, removing toxic phosphoglycolate, and initiating defense mechanisms. In photorespiration, glyoxylate is converted from glycolate through the activity of glycolate oxidase in the peroxisome. It is then converted into glycine through parallel actions by SGAT and GGAT, which is then transported into the mitochondria. It has also been reported that the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex may play a role in glycolate and glyoxylate metabolism. centerthumb600x600pxBasic overview of photorespiration in Arabidopsis. GGAT, glyoxylate:glutamate aminotransferase; GLYK, glycerate kinase; GO, glycolate oxidase; HPR, hydroxypyruvate reductase; PGLP, phosphoglycolate phosphatase; Rubisco, RuBP carboxylase/oxygenase; SGAT, serine:glyoxylate aminotransferase; SHM, serine hydroxymethyltransferase  Disease Relevance  = Diabetes = Glyoxylate is thought to be a potential early marker for Type II diabetes. One of the key conditions of diabetes pathology is the production of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) caused by the hyperglycemia. AGEs can lead to further complications of diabetes, such as tissue damage and cardiovascular disease. They are generally formed from reactive aldehydes, such as those present on reducing sugars and alpha- oxoaldehydes. In a study, glyoxylate levels were found to be significantly increased in patients who were later diagnosed with Type II diabetes. The elevated levels were found sometimes up to three years before the diagnosis, demonstrating the potential role for glyoxylate to be an early predictive marker. = Nephrolithiasis = Glyoxylate is involved in the development of hyperoxaluria, a key cause of nephrolithiasis (commonly known as kidney stones). Glyoxylate is both a substrate and inductor of sulfate anion transporter-1 (sat-1), a gene responsible for oxalate transportation, allowing it to increase sat-1 mRNA expression and as a result oxalate efflux from the cell. The increased oxalate release allows the buildup of calcium oxalate in the urine, and thus the eventual formation of kidney stones. The disruption of glyoxylate metabolism provides an additional mechanism of hyperoxaluria development. Loss of function mutations in the HOGA1 gene leads to a loss of the 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase, an enzyme in the hydroxyproline to glyoxylate pathway. The glyoxylate resulting from this pathway is normally stored away to prevent oxidation to oxalate in the cytosol. The disrupted pathway, however, causes a buildup of 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate which can also be transported to the cytosol and converted into glyoxylate through a different aldolase. These glyoxylate molecules can be oxidized into oxalate increasing its concentration and causing hyperoxaluria.  Reactions and uses  Glyoxylic acid is about ten times stronger an acid than acetic acid, with an acid dissociation constant of 4.7 √ó 10‚àí4 (pKa = 3.32): :OCHCO2H + H+ With base, glyoxylic acid disproportionates, forming hydroxyacetic acid and oxalic acid: :2 OCHCO2H + H2O ‚Üí HOCH2CO2H + HO2CCO2H Glyoxylic acid gives heterocycles upon condensation with urea and 1,2-diaminobenzene. =Phenol derivatives= In general, glyoxylic acid undergoes an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction with phenols, a versatile step in the synthesis of several other compounds. The immediate product with phenol itself is 4-hydroxymandelic acid. This species reacts with ammonia to give hydroxyphenylglycine, a precursor to the drug amoxicillin. Reduction of the 4-hydroxymandelic acid gives 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, a precursor to the drug atenolol. The sequence of reactions, in which glyoxylic acid reacts with guaiacol the phenolic component followed by oxidation and decarboxylation, provides a route to vanillin as a net formylation process. =Hopkins Cole reaction= Glyoxylic acid is a component of the Hopkins‚ÄìCole reaction, used to check for the presence of tryptophan in proteins. =Environmental chemistry= Glyoxylic acid is one of several ketone- and aldehyde-containing carboxylic acids that together are abundant in secondary organic aerosols. In the presence of water and sunlight, glyoxylic acid can undergo photochemical oxidation. Several different reaction pathways can ensue, leading to various other carboxylic acid and aldehyde products. Safety The compound is not very toxic with an for rats of 2500 mg/kg.

Overo is a Spanish word, originally meaning \\"like an egg\\".American Paint Horse Association's Guide to Coat Color Genetics American Paint Horse Association, 2007. Accessed August 19, 2008There are at least three genetically different spotting patterns which fall under the \\"overo\\" classification: frame overo, sabino overo, and splash or splashed white overo. \\"Genetic Equation: The overo patterns\\" American Paint Horse Association. Web page accessed August 19, 2008 \\"Horse coat color tests\\" from the University of California, Davis Veterinary Genetics Lab To complicate matters further, some of the spotting gene patterns can be combined to produce a horse with multiple color traits, such as the Tovero. The genetics of pinto spotting patterns are still being researched and are not fully understood. Some patterns may be polygenic, dominant, or incomplete dominants, and spotting can be so minimally expressed on an individual that the animal is mistaken for a \\"solid\\" colored horse. The sabino pattern is one of the most complex, as there has been one gene identified, SB-1, that creates one type of sabino patterning, but not all sabino-patterned horses carry it. There is a DNA test for the allele associated with the frame overo pattern, which causes the controversial lethal white syndrome, and there is a DNA test for three mutations, SW-1, SW-2, and SW-3, associated with splashed white. Although the condition lethal white syndrome is also sometimes called \\"overo lethal white\\", that term is somewhat a misnomer. Because there are many different ways a horse can be classified as an \\"overo\\", and different genes linked to overo patterning, it is not accurate to say the \\"overo gene\\" is what \\"causes\\" lethal white syndrome. The frame allele is associated with lethal white, but the other genetics, such as horses with sabino and splash alleles, are not. There is a genetic link between splash white and deafness, but the correlation is not yet fully understood. Frame overo Frame overos have sharply defined, irregular, horizontally oriented white patches. As here, they are often bald-faced and white patches seldom cross the topline, creating a \\"frame\\" of non-white coat. The frame overo pattern is the most common of the three types of overo patterns recognized in the American Paint Horse breed. A frame overo horse appears to be any solid base color (bay, black, chestnut, etc.) with white irregular patches added, usually with a horizontal orientation. Markings are often of jagged shape rather than rounded, the white rarely crosses the back, the lower legs tend to be dark, and the tail is one color, usually dark. The head is often white or bald-faced, and blue eyes are not uncommon. The frame overo pattern usually behaves like a dominant gene, in that when frame overo horses are crossed on nonspotted horses, about half of the foals come out spotted. There are records of frame overos being produced by two nonspotted parents. There is a theory, however, that these \\"solid\\" horses simply may be horses with very minimal expression of overo genetics. Frame coloring is controversial because it is associated with lethal white syndrome (OLWS or LWS),\\" Overo-Lethal White Foal Syndrome (OLW)\\" , University of Queensland, web page accessed December 1, 2007 the equine version of Hirschprung disease. LWS occurs when a foal is homozygous for the Ile118Lys EDNRB mutation, which is considered by many researchers to be \\"usually responsible\\" for the frame overo phenotype. However, other researchers emphasize that overo spotting patterns are phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous, that is, may have multiple sources.\\"Horse Coat Color Tests\\" Veterinary Genetics Laboratory, University of California, Davis. web page accessed August 21, 2008 The frame overo gene can be masked by other white patterns, particularly tobiano, which is a dominant gene and epistatic to overo. Epistatic means that when both genes are present, this is the one expressed. In addition, some carriers of the LWS allele appear to be solid. One theory holds that such horses carry the frame gene, but so minimal in expression that they appear solid. Either way, all LWS foals have horses with frame overo patterning in their pedigrees, and horses carrying a frame allele may not necessarily have a visible expression of the frame overo color. =\\"Lethal white\\"= Foals which are homozygous for frame and thus have lethal white syndrome (LWS) are not albinos. Albinism does not exist in horses. LWS foals are born almost or completely white with pink skin, but have blue eyes, not red ones. The lethal trait is that the nerves of the foal's digestive system are undeveloped and the bowel cannot move food along. All lethal white foals die within 72 hours after birth, and are typically euthanized sooner for humane reasons. A horse can be a carrier of the trait when it carries only one copy of the gene, (that is, heterozygous) and carriers are healthy and show no clinical signs of lethal white syndrome. Thus, it is recommended by organizations such as the American Paint Horse Association that horses of any pattern with overo ancestors be tested to verify their carrier state before being bred. There is a DNA test for the gene which can be used to plan breedings and avoid producing affected foals. The mutation has not been found in solid-colored horses from breeds without frame patterning. Likewise, a sick foal that happens to be white can be tested to avoid inadvertent euthanization of a non-lethal foal who has a simple case of colic. Lethal white horses should not be confused with non-lethal forms of white, such as dominant white, which may be completely white with pink skin. Blue-eyed, pink-skinned cremellos and other horses carrying the cream gene do not carry the LWS allele unless they also have an ancestor with overo genetics. The splash white and sabino genetics are not associated with lethal white, though such horses could also be carriers of the frame allele. Splash overo A splash overo with some minor sabino traits A splash or splashed white overo pattern appears like a solid-colored horse who has been dipped in white paint, and the color splashed up from the bottom. It is the least common of the overo patterns. The legs and bottom portion of the body are usually white, as is the head, and blue eyes are common. Edges where white and dark color meet are usually crisp and sharp. Recent studies suggest that splashed white may be caused by a dominant gene. Splash overos are more prone to being deaf than other horses.APHA Genetic Equation: Splashed White Outside of the United States, the term \\"splash\\" is sometimes applied to horses of apparent Sabino patterning. Sabino \\"overo\\" A Sabino, called \\"sabino overo\\" by some registries Sabino is listed a type of overo coloring by the American Paint Horse Association.APHA Genetic Equation, \\"Sabino Spotting\\" This terminology, outdated in terms of modern genetics, creates confusion, because other breeds, including many that will not register \\"pinto\\" or \\"paint\\" horses, may have individuals with sabino genetics. One reason for the terminology confusion is that \\"overo\\" was used by Paint horse breeders in the United States to refer to \\"anything that is not tobiano.\\" Another reason for this terminology is that the term \\"overo\\", when used outside of the USA, particularly in Spanish- speaking countries, refers to horses with the speckled roaning patterns typical of horses called sabino in the USA. In addition, strongly marked sabino horses may mimic either overo or tobiano coloring. In general, sabino is a generic description for a group of similar white spotting patterns. These include high white stockings on all four feet, often extending up the legs with jagged edges, a fairly white head, with markings often extending past the eyes, roaning at the edges of white markings, lip spots, \\"lacing,\\" and white patches on the lower barrel that may extend to the flanks. A minimal sabino may only have one of the traits associated with sabino horses. On the other hand, a \\"sabino-white\\" is a near-white or completely white horse, and sabino genetics are not linked to lethal white. Tobiano The tobiano pattern Tobiano coloring is the inverse of overo spotting. Tobianos have a vertical spotting pattern, large, rounded spots, white that crosses the topline, dark heads, but mostly white legs and white or multi-colored tail. Typical examples tend to have more white than dark, whereas typical frame overo horses tend to more dark than white, though there are many exceptions in both cases. It is created by a different gene from any of the overo patterns and is a dominant gene. All tobianos must have at least one tobiano parent. When a tobiano allele is present, it is epistatic and often masks other patterns. Tovero and other mixed patterns A tovero horse has pinto spotting patterns that show characteristics of both overo and tobiano and probably carries genes for both. For example, a tovero might have tobiano body spotting with rounded edges and white across the back, yet have irregular facial markings and blue eyes. Horses may also have a combination of sabino and frame overo genetics or any other combination of genes, resulting patterns that are difficult to smoothly classify into any one group.

Until recently, it was not thought that any Greek Church Father had taken note of the passage before the 12th century; but in 1941 a large collection of the writings of Didymus the Blind (ca. 313-398) was discovered in Egypt, including a reference to the pericope adulterae as being found in \\"several copies\\", and it is now considered established that this passage was present in its usual place in some Greek manuscripts known in Alexandria and elsewhere from the 4th century onwards. In support of this it is noted that the 4th-century Codex Vaticanus, which was written in Egypt, marks the end of John chapter 7 with an umlaut, indicating that an alternative reading was known at this point. Jerome reports that the pericope adulterae was to be found in its usual place in \\"many Greek and Latin manuscripts\\" in Rome and the Latin West in the late 4th century. This is confirmed by some Latin Fathers of the 4th and 5th centuries CE, including Ambrose and Augustine. The latter claimed that the passage may have been improperly excluded from some manuscripts in order to avoid the impression that Christ had sanctioned adultery: > Certain persons of little faith, or rather enemies of the true faith, > fearing, I suppose, lest their wives should be given impunity in sinning, > removed from their manuscripts the Lord's act of forgiveness toward the > adulteress, as if he who had said, Sin no more, had granted permission to > sin. \\"Sed hoc videlicet infidelium sensus exhorret, ita ut nonnulli modicae > fidei vel potius inimici verae fidei, credo, metuentes peccandi impunitatem > dari mulieribus suis, illud, quod de adulterae indulgentia Dominus fecit, > auferrent de codicibus suis, quasi permissionem peccandi tribuerit qui > dixit: Iam deinceps noli peccare, aut ideo non debuerit mulier a medico Deo > illius peccati remissione sanari, ne offenderentur insani.\\" Augustine, De > Adulterinis Conjugiis 2:6‚Äì7. Cited in Wieland Willker, A Textual Commentary > on the Greek Gospels , Vol. 4b, p. 10. Papias (circa AD 125) refers to a story of Jesus and a woman \\"accused of many sins\\" as being found in the Gospel of the Hebrews, which may refer to this passage; there is a very certain quotation of the pericope adulterae in the 3rd-century Syriac Didascalia Apostolorum, though without indicating John's Gospel. The Constitutions of the Holy Apostles Book II.24 refers to the passage \\"And when the elders had set another woman who had sinned before Him, and had left the sentence to Him, and were gone out, our Lord, the Searcher of the hearts, inquiring of her whether the elders had condemned her, and being answered No, He said unto her: 'Go thy way therefore, for neither do I condemn thee. Book II is generally dated to the late third century (Von Drey, Krabbe, Bunsen, Funk).The Early Church Fathers Volume 7 by Philip Schaff (public domain) pp. 388-390, 408 Codex Fuldensis, which is positively dated to AD 546 contains the adulterae pericope. The Second Epistle of Pope Callistus section 6Clontz, T.E. and J., \\"The Comprehensive New Testament\\", Cornerstone Publications (2008), p. 571, contains a quote that may be from John 8:11: \\"Let him see to it that he sin no more, that the sentence of the Gospel may abide in him: 'Go, and sin no more. However the epistle quotes from eighth- century writings and is not thought to be genuine.The Early Church Fathers Volume 8: The Twelve Patriarchs, Excerpts and Epistles, The Clementia, Apocrypha, Decretals, Memoirs of Edessa and Syriac Documents, Remains of the First - by Philip Schaff (public domain) pp. 607, 618 Almost all modern translations now include the Pericope de Adultera at John 7:53-8:11, but some enclose it in brackets or add a note concerning the oldest and most reliable witnesses. =Narrative= At the end of the Feast of Tabernacles, Jesus goes overnight to the Mount of Olives (John 8:1), \\"lodging probably in the house of Lazarus\\", according to the Expositor's Greek Testament,Expositor's Greek Testament on John 8, accessed 8 May 2016 whilst everyone else \\"goes home\\" (John 7:53). This is the only mention of the Mount of Olives in John's Gospel, although it is also referred to in , \\"Jesus crossed the Kidron Valley with his disciples and entered a grove of olive trees\\". Jesus returns to the Temple early the next morning. =Verse 7= :So when they continued asking Him, He raised Himself up and said to them, ::\\"He who is without sin among you, let him throw a stone at her first.\\" NKJV *\\"He raised Himself up\\": or \\"He looked up\\"Note [a] on John 8:7 in NKJV *\\"Let him thrown a stone at her first\\" (KJV: \\"let him first cast a stone at her\\"): that is, as a witness to the sinful deed, one can first cast a stone at the guilty party, according to the law in which commands that \\"the hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the people\\".Benson, Joseph. '‚ÄôCommentary on the Old and New Testaments. John 8. Accessed July 9, 2019. The Light of the World In John 8:12, Jesus describes himself as \\"the light of the world\\", revisiting a theme of the Prologue to the Gospel: :The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it. (John 1:5) The Pharisees complain that Jesus bears witness to himself, an issue also addressed in the Prologue: :John the Baptist came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all through him might believe. He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. That was the true Light which gives light to every man coming into the world. (John 1:7-8) Jesus' statement is discontinuous both with the narrative of John 7:53-8:11, everyone but the woman having left the Temple convicted by their own consciences, and with the preceding verse, John 7:52, where Nicodemus the Pharisee had been urged by the other members of the Sanhedrin to re-examine the scriptures on the issue of whether a prophet could come from Galilee. Theologian Heinrich Meyer attempts to find a connection: :We must look for some connection with John 7:52. This may be found simply as follows. As the had not been able to carry out their design of apprehending Jesus, and had, moreover, become divided among themselves (as is recorded in John 7:45-52), He was able, in consequence of this miscarriage in their plans against Him (), to come forth afresh and address the assembled people in the temple.Meyer's NT Commentary on John 8, accessed 10 May 2016 Jesus' dialogue with the Jews who had believed in Him Many of Jesus' hearers believed in him (John 8:30). Verse 31 moves Jesus' dialogue from the Pharisees to the Jews who had believed in him (). Many English translations have \\"Jews who believed in Him\\" Geneva Bible, King James Bible, Wycliffe Bible, Jerusalem Bible Anglican Bishop Charles Ellicott identifies a contrast and \\"perhaps, something of wonder\\" in the idea that there were Jews who were believers.Ellicott's Commentary for Modern Readers on John 8, accessed 13 May 2016 The tone of verses 31 to 59 is critical and argumentative with this group; the Pulpit Commentary finds them to be believers of \\"the most imperfect kind\\", who \\"accepted the Messianic claims [of Jesus], but persisted in interpreting them, not by his word, but by their own ideas of the theocratic kingdom, by their privileges as children of Abraham, by their national animosity to their nearest neighbours the Samaritans, by their inability to press behind the veil of his humanity to his Divine nature\\".Pulpit Commentary on John 8, accessed 13 May 2016 American theologian J. Louis Martyn suggested that John's Gospel could be read on two levels, portraying events and contesting controversies in the early church through a narrative portraying the life and teaching of Jesus.J. Louis Martyn, History and Theology in the Fourth Gospel, Nashville, Abingdon Pess, 1968 Such a reading suggests a controversy regarding Jewish partial-believers in Jesus as the Messiah who, according to the evangelist, did not accept the whole \\"truth\\" of orthodox Christian teaching and maintained that their covenantal relationship with God was rooted in the Abrahamic tradition rather than the salvation (freedom) offered by Jesus. For this group of Jews, the fundamental credal proposition was that \\"Abraham is our father\\" (John 8:39a). The evangelist's response is to acknowledge that they are indeed the descendants of Abraham (John 8:37 and 8:39b), but to explore the behavior which should follow: \\"If you were Abraham‚Äôs children, you would do the works of Abraham\\". Instead, \\"you seek to kill Me, a Man who has told you the truth which I heard from God\\" (John 8:40). The Pulpit Commentary notes this phrase as \\"the only place [in the gospels] where the Lord speaks of himself as 'a man, although the threat to kill \\"a man\\" can also be read as indicating that the Jews threatened to kill those proclaiming the message which the evangelist identifies as the true gospel (John 8:32). In John 8:48, Jesus is accused of being a Samaritan and being demon-possessed. He denies having a demon, but makes no comment on the Samaritan accusation. The controversy portrayed as Jesus arguing with \\"the Jews who had believed in Him\\" continues through to verse 59. Jesus states that the current times fulfil Abraham's hopes and that Abraham saw this time and \\"was glad\\" (John 8:56). The Jews' response is that Jesus is not yet fifty years old, i.e. has not yet reached the age of \\"full manhood\\" Ellicott's Commentary for Modern Readers on John 8, accessed 13 May 2016 as indicated in , and . The evangelist brings the chapter to its climax with Jesus' words, \\"before Abraham was, I AM\\" (John 8:58), words which inevitably are interpreted as Jesus \\"[taking] to Himself the Divine Name\\"Plummer, A (1902), Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on John 8, accessed 14 May 2016 and so they \\"prepare to stone Him for blasphemy\\". The evangelist ends the narrative with a verse in which Jesus evades their violent response and leaves the Temple. Some manuscripts add Jesus \\"going through the midst of them, and so passed by\\". Alfred Plummer, in the Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges, states that \\"these words are apparently an insertion, and probably an adaptation of . No English Version previous to the one of 1611 contains the passage\\".

Located near Patiala Gate opposite Hira Mahal. *Tapia Mandir : It is about 100 years old temple. It is a strong belief among people of Nabha that visiting this temple brings happiness in their lives. *Hira Mahal: Residence of the royal family. The gardens and orchards surrounding it have developed into the Hira Mahal Colony. *Qila Mubarak: Situated at the heart of the city in a dilapidated condition. Various government offices are housed here including the courts shifted to new building at Mini-Secretariat.Nabha Fort or Qila Mubarak *Hira Singh Park: Now known as municipal park, near Duladdi Gate. The park is home to the statue of Hira Singh Nabha. * Royal Samadhis: on a circular road, built in memory of the deceased rulers of Nabha, now in a state of disrepair. *The Courthouse of Nabha, the original residence of Wazir Ishwari Singh Katoch, Prime Minister of Kangra, father of Maharani Lilavati and cousin of Maharaja Sansar Chand of Kangra (father-in-law of Maharaja Ranjit Singh). *Old Temple of Shri Hanuman Ji (near Civil Hospital), Old Temple of Attharan Bhuji Mata Rani (Patiala Gate), Shri Vedas Mandir (Sadar Bazar), and Kali Mata Mandir (near Dulladi Gate) are famous Hindu worship places. * Gurdwara Dera Baba Ajaypal Singh, famously known as Gurdwara Ghodhiyan Walla and Gurdwara Akalgarh Sahib * Mahtab Nagar Nabha, named after Sardar Mehtab Singh Grewal, Mandi Minister with Nabha Maharaja Hira Singh Court. * King George V Silver Jubilee Park, near Santoshi Mata Mandir, Dulladi Gate *Mata Rajrajeshwari Balasundari Ji Mandir, popularly known as chownk wala mandir, is a great mighty temple with great historical significance, built approximately 250‚Äì300 years ago by the king of the state.

The history of the Haveli makes it full of Goosebumps. Visiting Haveli will be a very good and scary experience. Please note that there are two locations of Royal Samadhis. One is for the family of Hira Singh, the other, for the original rulers of Nabha, is located on the grounds of Punjab Public School, near the water tank, on what was originally known as Shyam Bagh (near Jamunawali Sark (Road)). There rests Maharaja Devinder Singh, his two sons, his wives, Maharani Lilavati, Maharani Mann Kaur and \\"Cheteanwali\\" Rani. Dr. Sumerendra Vir Singh Chauhan, from the family of Maharani Lilavati, and uncle of the present Raj Kumari of Nabha, wife of Maharaja Pratap Singh's second son, is negotiating with the present authorities to allow for repairs to take place of the Royal samadhis of the original rulers. Also the Samadhi of Maharani Lilavati's mother is located in the Ram Temple near Hira Mahal.  Modern Nabha  In 1947, Nabha formed a part of Patiala and East Punjab States Union (PEPSU). At a subsequent reorganisation, Patiala was created as a district and Nabha formed a subdivision in Patiala District. The modern Nabha is a thriving, if somewhat dusty town (about 25 kilometres from Patiala). Nabha is famous as a manufacturing hub of combine harvesters A new colony HIRA ENCLAVE(PUDA) has been established on the outskirts of Nabha city and has 864 plots with a population capacity of about 5000 people Like many other cities of India, Nabha has landmarks called \\"gates\\" which roughly circumscribe the city.

Since it was created in 1979, the Mercantour Park has proven popular, with 800,000 visitors every year enjoying the 600 km of marked footpaths and visiting its villages.  Extent  Vallon de Molli√®res The protected area covers some 685 km¬≤, consisting of a central uninhabited zone comprising seven valleys: Roya, B√©v√©ra, V√©subie, Tin√©e, Haut Var and Cians (in the Alpes-Maritimes) plus Verdon and Ubaye (in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence), and a peripheral zone comprising 28 villages. Many of them are perched villages, such as Belv√©d√®re at the entrance to the spectacular Gordolasque valley, concealing great architectural riches (numerous churches decorated with murals and altar pieces by primitive Ni√ßois painters). More than 150 rural sites are located within the Park. Around Mont B√©go there are petroglyphs pecked out on schist and granite faces. They have been dated from the late Neolithic and Bronze Ages.Valley of Marvels;Jegues- Wolkiewiez, Chantale (1997) Des gravures de la vall√©e des merveilles au ciel du Mont Bego Dissertation, Laboratoire d'Ethnologie, UNSA.  Geography  = Valley of marvels = In the heart of this setting of vertiginous summits (including Cime du G√©las, the third highest mountain in the Maritime Alps at 3,143 m), lies a gem listed as a Historical Monument, the famous Vall√©e des Merveilles, the aptly named \\"valley of marvels\\". At the foot of Mont B√©go, climbers can admire some 37,000 petroglyphs dating back to the Bronze Age, representing weapons, cattle and human figures that are sometimes very mysterious. A less challenging destination is the Mus√©e des Merveilles at Tende. _Enter the route guidance_ From Nice, take the A8 motorway to Ventimiglia, Italy, then go up the Roya Valley in the direction of Tende. In Saint-Dalmas-de-Tende, village located a few kilometers before Tende, take a road on the left towards the hamlet of Casterino. After 20 minutes by car, we reach the different starting points for hikes (2 hours drive from Nice). A first car park, at a place called \\"Lac des Mesches\\", serves as a starting point for the Vall√©e des Merveilles. A few kilometers further there will be a lake - Lac Des Mesches, where you will find a parking spot in the end of the road. Few meters after parking spot you will be able to see signs, showing the beginning of Vall√©e des Merveilles route. = Lakes = Several lakes can be visited, for example the lake of Allos, the lake of the Lauzanier, the lakes of Vens, the lakes of Morgon, and the lakes of the valley of marvels.  Flora  In addition to the holm oak, the Mediterranean olive tree, rhododendrons, firs, spruces, Swiss pines and above all larches, the Mercantour is also endowed with more than 2,000 species of flowering plants, 200 of which are very rare: edelweiss and martagon lily are the best known, but there is also saxifrage with multiple flowers, houseleek, moss campion and gentian offering a multi-coloured palette in the spring. The Mercantour is the site of a large- scale All Taxa Biodiversity Inventory and Monitoring programme to identify all its living species, organised by the European Distributed Institute of Taxonomy (EDIT). Mercantour Fauna Example  Fauna  Walkers may easily glimpse a chamois, several thousand of which live in the park and may often hear the whistling of marmots. The ermine is rarer (and more furtive), as is the ibex and the mouflon, although with a little luck you may be able to observe them during the coolest parts of the day in the summer. There is a tremendous variety of wildlife in the Mercantour: red deer and roe deer in the undergrowth, hares and wild boars, partridges, golden eagles and buzzards, numerous species of butterflies and even about 50 Italian wolves (which migrated there at the beginning of the 1990s). A Wolves Centre welcomes visitors in Saint-martin-V√©subie.

Psycholinguistics is interdisciplinary in nature and is studied by people in a variety of fields, such as, psychology, cognitive science, linguistics, neuroscience and many more. The main aim of psycholinguistics is to outline and describe the process of producing and comprehending communication. Education and training More specifically, a psycholinguist studies language, speech production, and comprehension by using behavioral and neurological methods traditionally developed in the field of psychology, but other methods such as corpus analysis are also widely used. Psycholinguists typically receive undergraduate degrees in linguistics or psychology and then seek a higher degree. Psycholinguistics is not usually a degree of its own; graduate degrees range from scientific studies to criminal justice. The majority of students who become psycholinguists receive a master's degree or a Ph.D.; however, there are also some opportunities available for those who choose not to attend graduate school. Careers Psycholinguists currently represent a widely diverse field. Many psycholinguists are also considered to be neurolinguists, cognitive linguists, neurocognitive linguists, or are associated with those who are. There are subtle differences between the titles, though they are all attempting to use different facets of similar issues. Psycholinguists are sometimes categorized into separate groups by the models and theories in which they believe. The two main groups, either interactive or autonomous, are based on ideas of language processing. Psycholinguists who support the interactive side, believe that our levels of processing for language work side-by-side and share information as words are received. The other argument is the autonomous side, which believes that the levels of processing for language occur independent of one another. When conducting research, psycholinguists use a variety of techniques that can involve qualitative and/or quantitative data. Typical methods of research include: observation (language recording), experimentation (issuing language tests), and self-reports (participants report what they are experiencing). The research tends to result in either theoretical evidence or a realistic application. Professional associations There are many associations that include professionals in the psycholinguist field worldwide, such as the following: * Linguistic Society of America: started in 1924 with the goal of furthering scientific linguistic studies, and has come to include all subsets of the linguistic field including psycholinguistics. * Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics: located in The Netherlands; it is a subset of the Max Planck Society that focuses solely on psycholinguistics, making it a one-of-a- kind institution. * International Society of Applied Psycholinguistics (ISAPL): an international organization founded in 1982 that is devoted to furthering research and teaching in the field of psycholinguistics. * American Association for Applied Linguistics: an association founded in 1977 for professionals interested in contributing to the vast field of linguistics.  Examples  * Eric Lenneberg (1921-1975): a German-born psycholinguist who completed his undergraduate degree at the University of Chicago, and continued on to receive a Ph.D. in linguistics, and a Ph.D. in psychology from Harvard. * Roger Brown (1925-1997): attended the University of Michigan where he received a Ph.D. in psychology. and went on to work with Lenneberg to research and study linguistic relativity. * Wilhelm Wundt (1832-1920): known as \\"the father of experimental psychology,\\" Wundt was a man of many interests and contributed to several areas of psychology including psycholinguistics. * Susan Ervin Tripp (1927-1955): a notable woman in the profession, Ervin-Tripp was a founding member of psycholinguistics as a field within the realm of cognitive psychology.

If a theory has gauge transformations, it means that some physical properties of certain equations are preserved under those transformations. Likewise, the gauge covariant derivative is the ordinary derivative modified in such a way as to make it behave like a true vector operator, so that equations written using the covariant derivative preserve their physical properties under gauge transformations. Overview There are many ways to understand the gauge covariant derivative. The approach taken in this article is based on the historically traditional notation used in many physics textbooks.L.D. Faddeev, A.A. Slavnov, Gauge Fields: Introduction to Gauge Theory, (1980) Benjamin Cummings, Claude Itzykson, Jean-Bernard Zuber, Quantum Field Theory (1980) McGraw-Hill Warren Siegel, Fields (1999) ArXiv Another approach is to understand the gauge covariant derivative as a kind of connection, and more specifically, an affine connection.Richard S. Palais, The Geometrization of Physics (1981) Lecture Notes, Institute of Mathematics, National Tsing Hua UniversityM. E. Mayer, \\"Review: David D. Bleecker, Gauge theory and variational principles\\", Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. (N.S.) 9 (1983), no. 1, 83--92Alexandre Guay, Geometrical aspects of local gauge symmetry (2004) The affine connection is interesting because it does not require any concept of a metric tensor to be defined; the curvature of an affine connection can be understood as the field strength of the gauge potential. When a metric is available, then one can go in a different direction, and define a connection on a frame bundle. This path leads directly to general relativity; however, it requires a metric, which particle physics gauge theories do not have. Rather than being generalizations of one-another, affine and metric geometry go off in different directions: the gauge group of (pseudo-)Riemannian geometry must be the indefinite orthogonal group O(s,r) in general, or the Lorentz group O(3,1) for space-time. This is because the fibers of the frame bundle must necessarily, by definition, connect the tangent and cotangent spaces of space-time.Charles W. Misner, Kip S. Thorne, and John Archibald Wheeler, Gravitation, (1973) W. H. Freeman and Company By contrast, the gauge groups employed in particle physics could be (in principle) any Lie group at all (and, in practice, being only U(1), SU(2) or SU(3) in the Standard Model). Note that Lie groups do not come equipped with a metric. A yet more complicated, yet more accurate and geometrically enlightening, approach is to understand that the gauge covariant derivative is (exactly) the same thing as the exterior covariant derivative on a section of an associated bundle for the principal fiber bundle of the gauge theory;David Bleecker, \\"Gauge Theory and Variational Principles\\" (1982) D. Reidel Publishing (See chapter 3) and, for the case of spinors, the associated bundle would be a spin bundle of the spin structure.David Bleecker, op. cit. (See Chapter 6.) Although conceptually the same, this approach uses a very different set of notation, and requires a far more advanced background in multiple areas of differential geometry. The final step in the geometrization of gauge invariance is to recognize that, in quantum theory, one needs only to compare neighboring fibers of the principal fiber bundle, and that the fibers themselves provide a superfluous extra description. This leads to the idea of modding out the gauge group to obtain the gauge groupoid as the closest description of the gauge connection in quantum field theory.Meinhard E. Mayer, \\"Principal Bundles versus Lie Groupoids in Gauge Theory\\", (1990) in Differential Geometric Methods in Theoretical Physics, Volume 245 pp 793-802 For ordinary Lie algebras, the gauge covariant derivative on the space symmetries (those of the pseudo-Riemannian manifold and general relativity) cannot be intertwined with the internal gauge symmetries; that is, metric geometry and affine geometry are necessarily distinct mathematical subjects: this is the content of the Coleman‚ÄìMandula theorem. However, a premise of this theorem is violated by the Lie superalgebras (which are not Lie algebras!) thus offering hope that a single unified symmetry can describe both spatial and internal symmetries: this is the foundation of supersymmetry. The more mathematical approach uses an index-free notation, emphasizing the geometric and algebraic structure of the gauge theory and its relationship to Lie algebras and Riemannian manifolds; for example, treating gauge covariance as equivariance on fibers of a fiber bundle. The index notation used in physics makes it far more convenient for practical calculations, although it makes the overall geometric structure of the theory more opaque. The physics approach also has a pedagogical advantage: the general structure of a gauge theory can be exposed after a minimal background in multivariate calculus, whereas the geometric approach requires a large investment of time in the general theory of differential geometry, Riemannian manifolds, Lie algebras, representations of Lie algebras and principle bundles before a general understanding can be developed. In more advanced discussions, both notations are commonly intermixed. This article attempts to hew most closely to the notation and language commonly employed in physics curriculum, touching only briefly on the more abstract connections. Fluid dynamics In fluid dynamics, the gauge covariant derivative of a fluid may be defined as : abla_t \\\\mathbf{v}:= \\\\partial_t \\\\mathbf{v} + (\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\cdot abla) \\\\mathbf{v} where \\\\mathbf{v} is a velocity vector field of a fluid. Gauge theory In gauge theory, which studies a particular class of fields which are of importance in quantum field theory, the minimally-coupled gauge covariant derivative is defined as : D_\\\\mu := \\\\partial_\\\\mu - i q A_\\\\mu where A_\\\\mu is the electromagnetic four potential. (This is valid for a Minkowski metric signature , which is common in general relativity and used below. For the particle physics convention , it is D_\\\\mu := \\\\partial_\\\\mu + i q A_\\\\mu . The electron's charge is defined negative as q_e=-e, while the Dirac field is defined to transform positively as \\\\psi(x) \\\\rightarrow e^{iq\\\\alpha(x)} \\\\psi(x).) =Construction of the covariant derivative through gauge covariance requirement= Consider a generic (possibly non-Abelian) Gauge transformation, defined by a symmetry operator U(x)= e^{i\\\\alpha(x)}, acting on a field \\\\phi(x), such that : \\\\phi(x) \\\\rightarrow \\\\phi'(x) = U(x) \\\\phi(x) \\\\equiv e^{i\\\\alpha(x)} \\\\phi(x), : \\\\phi^\\\\dagger(x) \\\\rightarrow \\\\phi{'}^{\\\\dagger} = \\\\phi^\\\\dagger(x) U^\\\\dagger (x) \\\\equiv \\\\phi^\\\\dagger(x) e^{-i\\\\alpha(x)}, \\\\qquad U^\\\\dagger = U^{-1}. where \\\\alpha(x) is an element of the Lie algebra associated with the Lie group of symmetry transformations, and can be expressed in terms of the generators of the group, \\\\\\\\{t^a\\\\\\\\}_{a}, as \\\\alpha(x) = \\\\alpha^a(x) t^a. The partial derivative \\\\partial_\\\\mu transforms, accordingly, as : \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\phi(x) \\\\rightarrow \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\phi'(x) = U(x) \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\phi(x) + (\\\\partial_\\\\mu U) \\\\phi(x) \\\\equiv e^{i\\\\alpha(x)} \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\phi(x) + i (\\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\alpha) e^{i\\\\alpha(x)} \\\\phi(x) and a kinetic term of the form \\\\phi^\\\\dagger \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\phi is thus not invariant under this transformation. We can introduce the covariant derivative D_\\\\mu in this context as a generalization of the partial derivative \\\\partial_\\\\mu which transforms covariantly under the Gauge transformation, i.e. an object satisfying : D_\\\\mu \\\\phi(x) \\\\rightarrow D'_\\\\mu \\\\phi'(x) = U(x) D_\\\\mu \\\\phi(x), which in operatorial form takes the form : D'_\\\\mu = U(x) D_\\\\mu U^\\\\dagger(x). We thus compute (omitting the explicit x dependencies for brevity) : D_\\\\mu \\\\phi \\\\rightarrow D'_\\\\mu U \\\\phi = UD_\\\\mu \\\\phi + (\\\\delta D_\\\\mu U + [D_\\\\mu,U])\\\\phi, where : D_\\\\mu \\\\rightarrow D'_\\\\mu \\\\equiv D_\\\\mu + \\\\delta D_\\\\mu. The requirement for D_\\\\mu to transform covariantly is now translated in the condition : (\\\\delta D_\\\\mu U + [D_\\\\mu,U])\\\\phi = 0. To obtain an explicit expression, we follow QED and make the Ansatz : D_\\\\mu = \\\\partial_\\\\mu - ig A_\\\\mu, where the vector field A_\\\\mu satisfies, : A_\\\\mu \\\\rightarrow A'_\\\\mu = A_\\\\mu + \\\\delta A_\\\\mu, from which it follows that : \\\\delta D_\\\\mu \\\\equiv -ig \\\\delta A_\\\\mu and : \\\\delta A_\\\\mu = [U,A_\\\\mu]U^\\\\dagger -\\\\frac{i}{g} [\\\\partial_\\\\mu,U]U^\\\\dagger which, using U(x) = 1 + i \\\\alpha(x) + \\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\alpha^2) , takes the form : \\\\delta A_\\\\mu = \\\\frac{1}{g} ( [\\\\partial_\\\\mu, \\\\alpha] - ig [A_\\\\mu,\\\\alpha] ) + \\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\alpha^2) = \\\\frac{1}{g} [D_\\\\mu, \\\\alpha] + \\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\alpha^2) We have thus found an object D_\\\\mu such that : \\\\phi^\\\\dagger(x) D_\\\\mu \\\\phi(x) \\\\rightarrow \\\\phi'^\\\\dagger(x) D'_\\\\mu \\\\phi'(x) = \\\\phi^\\\\dagger(x) D_\\\\mu \\\\phi(x). =Quantum electrodynamics= If a gauge transformation is given by : \\\\psi \\\\mapsto e^{i\\\\Lambda} \\\\psi and for the gauge potential : A_\\\\mu \\\\mapsto A_\\\\mu + {1 \\\\over e} (\\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\Lambda) then D_\\\\mu transforms as : D_\\\\mu \\\\mapsto \\\\partial_\\\\mu - i e A_\\\\mu - i (\\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\Lambda) , and D_\\\\mu \\\\psi transforms as : D_\\\\mu \\\\psi \\\\mapsto e^{i \\\\Lambda} D_\\\\mu \\\\psi and \\\\bar \\\\psi := \\\\psi^\\\\dagger \\\\gamma^0 transforms as : \\\\bar \\\\psi \\\\mapsto \\\\bar \\\\psi e^{-i \\\\Lambda} so that : \\\\bar \\\\psi D_\\\\mu \\\\psi \\\\mapsto \\\\bar \\\\psi D_\\\\mu \\\\psi and \\\\bar \\\\psi D_\\\\mu \\\\psi in the QED Lagrangian is therefore gauge invariant, and the gauge covariant derivative is thus named aptly. On the other hand, the non-covariant derivative \\\\partial_\\\\mu would not preserve the Lagrangian's gauge symmetry, since : \\\\bar \\\\psi \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\psi \\\\mapsto \\\\bar \\\\psi \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\psi + i \\\\bar \\\\psi (\\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\Lambda) \\\\psi . =Quantum chromodynamics= In quantum chromodynamics, the gauge covariant derivative ishttp://www.fuw.edu.pl/~dobaczew/maub-42w/node9.html : D_\\\\mu := \\\\partial_\\\\mu - i g_s \\\\, G_\\\\mu^\\\\alpha \\\\, \\\\lambda_\\\\alpha /2 where g_s is the coupling constant of the strong interaction, G is the gluon gauge field, for eight different gluons \\\\alpha=1 \\\\dots 8, and where \\\\lambda_\\\\alpha is one of the eight Gell-Mann matrices. The Gell-Mann matrices give a representation of the color symmetry group SU(3). For quarks, the representation is the fundamental representation, for gluons, the representation is the adjoint representation. =Standard Model= The covariant derivative in the Standard Model combines the electromagnetic, the weak and the strong interactions. It can be expressed in the following form:See e.g. eq. 3.116 in C. Tully, Elementary Particle Physics in a Nutshell, 2011, Princeton University Press. : D_\\\\mu := \\\\partial_\\\\mu - i \\\\frac{g'}{2} Y \\\\, B_\\\\mu - i \\\\frac{g}{2} \\\\sigma_j \\\\, W_\\\\mu^j - i \\\\frac{g_s}{2} \\\\lambda_\\\\alpha \\\\, G_\\\\mu^\\\\alpha The gauge fields here belong to the fundamental representations of the electroweak Lie group U(1)\\\\otimes SU(2) times the color symmetry Lie group SU(3). The coupling constant g' provides the coupling of the hypercharge Y to the B boson and g the coupling via the three vector bosons W^j (j = 1,2,3) to the weak isospin, whose components are written here as the Pauli matrices \\\\sigma_j. Via the Higgs mechanism, these boson fields combine into the massless electromagnetic field A_\\\\mu and the fields for the three massive vector bosons W^\\\\pm and Z. General relativity In general relativity, the gauge covariant derivative is defined as : abla_j v^i := \\\\partial_j v^i + \\\\sum_k\\\\Gamma^i{}_{j k} v^k where \\\\Gamma^i{}_{j k} is the Christoffel symbol. More formally, this derivative can be understood as the Riemannian connection on a frame bundle. The \\"gauge freedom\\" here is the arbitrary choice of a coordinate frame at each point in space-time.

Police identified the main perpetrator as a 17-year-old former student who was expelled in 1987. Police said that he, along with two students, armed themselves with a nail-studded stick and a chain and looked for a target in revenge for an incident two months earlier, when a white football player beat two black students. The Algebra teacher pressed a panic button, but it did not work as they were turned off. The teacher sent a student to report the incident. A 1988 Houston Chronicle article written one day after the brawl stated that Sharpstown had a history of racial tension. Deborah Tedford and Burke Watson of the Houston Chronicle wrote that \\"The Sharpstown campus has been plagued with outbursts of violence during school year ‚Äî with parents taking to the halls as volunteer security monitors in November to quell disturbances.\\" Gayle Fallon, president of the Houston Federation of Teachers, criticized the school. Fallon said that the school should have taken more precautionary measures to ensure a racially motivated fight did not happen. Larry Yawn, an HISD spokesperson, and principal Don Carlisle said the officials were not aware of rumors about an upcoming fight. In spring 1991, as a result of the 1988 scuffle, Carlisle prohibited students from wearing Confederate States of America-related clothing at the May 17 prom. Five white students faced ejection when they were found with the clothing; some white students criticized the school, saying that it had a double standard as it allowed African-American students to wear Malcolm X-related clothing.

He was a Cambridge Apostle. Early life and Cambridge Roby was the son of a solicitor and was born in Tamworth, and was educated at Bridgnorth Grammar School. He won a scholarship to St John's College, Cambridge in 1849. He graduated as a Bachelor of Arts in 1853, and was the \\"Senior Classic\\" or top classics student of that year. He was made a fellow of St John's College in the following year. He worked as a lecturer and private tutor in Cambridge from 1854 to 1861. He was, however, highly critical of the administration of the university. In particular he felt that the constituent colleges were prone to pursue policies in complete isolation from each other, leading to frequent conflicts. This he likened to the collision of \\"17 bodies in a confined space moving vagueley in the dark\\". Dulwich In 1860 he left Cambridge, becoming under master of the Upper School at the College of God's Gift, Dulwich. On 13 August 1861 he married Mary Ann Mathilda Ermen, the daughter of Peter Albert Ermen, a Dutch-born Manchester cotton spinner.The Gentleman's Magazine. Vol. 211, Jul-Dec 1861, p. 435. Finding the teaching of Latin at Dulwich in need of reform, he wrote An Elementary Latin Grammar in 1862.An Elementary Latin Grammar. Henry John Roby. 1862. Cambridge: MacMillan & Co. He remained at Dulwich until 1865. Educational reform Roby was involved in reforming the governance of public and grammar schools. In December 1864 he was appointed secretary of the Schools Inquiry Commission, which examined some 800 institutions. He was the author of much of the final report of the commission, which led to the enactment of the Endowed Schools Act 1869. The 1869 Act established an Endowed Schools Commission of which Roby was the first secretary, serving in that office until 1872, when he became a commissioner. The commission was dissolved at the end of 1874. From 1866 to 1868 he was professor of jurisprudence at University College, London, lecturing on Roman Law. In 1877 he was made life governor and a member of the Council of Owens College, and a governor of Manchester Grammar School. Later publications Between 1871 and 1874 Roby expanded his 1862 publication into a two volume Grammar of the Latin Language, from Plautus to Suetonius, described by Encyclop√¶dia Britannica as \\"a storehouse of illustrative quotations from Latin literature\\". In 1884 he published Introduction to Justinian's Digest and Commentary, for which he was awarded the honorary degree of LL.D by the University of Edinburgh. This was followed in 1902 by Roman Private Law in the Time of Cicero and the Antonines. Industry With the ending of his work as a schools commissioner in 1874, Roby became a partner in his father in law's firm of Ermen and Engels, sewing cotton manufacturers of Patricroft near Manchester. Soon afterwards the firm changed its name to Ermen and Roby. Parliament Roby was an active member of the Liberal Party, serving variously as chairmen of the Manchester Liberal Executive, the Executive for the North-West Manchester Liberal Association and of the Manchester Liberal Union, and as president of the Eccles Liberal Association. In 1890 the member of parliament for the Eccles division of Lancashire died, and Roby was chosen to contest the seat at the ensuing by-election. He won the seat from the Conservatives, holding it at the subsequent general election of 1892. He was a Deputy Chairman of Committees of the House of Commons. Retirement In 1894 Roby retired from business and in the following year from parliament. He spent the last twenty years of his life in at his residence Lancrigg, Grasmere in the Lake District. He died at Lancrigg in January 1915 aged 84.

Early life and move to Europe Born Lamine Sekka in Dakar, Senegal, the youngest of five siblings, his Gambian father died shortly after his birth. When he was still young, his Senegalese mother sent him to live with an aunt in Georgetown (now Janjanbureh) in the Gambia, but he ran away to live on the streets in the capital, then known as Bathurst (now Banjul). In the Second World War he found employment as an interpreter at an American air base in Dakar. He then worked on the docks. When he was 20, he stowed away on a ship to Marseilles, France, and lived for three years in Paris. He arrived in London, England in 1952, and served for two years in the Royal Air Force, where he first received the nickname \\"Johnny\\", but then Caribbean actor Earl Cameron persuaded him to become an actor, and he attended RADA. He became a stagehand at the Royal Court Theatre, and appeared on stage in various plays from 1958. He had a small part in the 1958 film version of Look Back in Anger, directed by Tony Richardson, who had seen him on stage. He took a leading role in the 1961 film Flame in the Streets, playing the Jamaican boyfriend of the (white) daughter (played by Sylvia Syms) of a liberal working-class trades unionist (played by John Mills). He lived for a period in Paris, where he met his wife, Cecilia Enger. He continued in British films during the 1960s, portraying stereotypical roles, such as a butler in the film Woman of Straw (1964), and in other films, such as East of Sudan (1964), Khartoum (1966) and The Last Safari (1967). He also appeared on television, in programmes such as The Human Jungle, Z-Cars, Dixon of Dock Green, Gideon's Way, Danger Man, and a 1968 episode of The Avengers. In 1968, he also played the lead role in a West End production of Night of Fame. According to his obituary in The Times, this was the first time that a black actor had played a role written for a white man in English theatre. He was seen as a British equivalent to Sidney Poitier, and was frustrated that actors who started out at around the same time as him ‚Äì such as Sean Connery, Terence Stamp, Michael Caine, Tom Courtenay and John Hurt ‚Äì had become stars, and he had not. Later life Sekka eventually moved to the United States with the aim of getting better roles. He had a minor part in the films A Warm December (1972) and Uptown Saturday Night (1974), both directed by Poitier. The first also featured Earl Cameron and the second Bill Cosby and Richard Pryor. These roles led to a more memorable role in the sitcom Good Times, where he portrayed Ibe, Thelma's (BernNadette Stanis) African love interest. In 1976, he starred in the movie Mohammad, Messenger of God (also known as The Message) about the origin of Islam and the message of Muhammad, in which he played Muhammad's Ethiopian disciple Bilal al-Habashi. He appeared in the 1982 film Hanky Panky, and played Banda in the 1984 miniseries Master of the Game. He was not cast in Roots (1977), being considered insufficiently American, but secured a role in the sequel, Roots: The Next Generations (1979), playing an African interpreter. Sekka is widely known among science fiction fans for his role as Dr. Benjamin Kyle in the television series Babylon 5's pilot movie, The Gathering (1993). Recurring health problems forced him to decline a future role in the series, and ultimately were the reason he retired from acting altogether. He died of lung cancer at his ranch in Agua Dulce, California, aged 72, survived by his wife Cecilia and son Lamine.Obituary by Kaye Whiteman, The Guardian, 29 September 2006.

Domestic media =Private media= Initial coverage Private Venezuelan media officials stated that the majority of the media supported Ch√°vez and the change he promised when originally elected in 1998, but after they reported the \\"negative realities\\" occurring in Venezuela, the Venezuelan government began to portray the media as an enemy. The relationship between Ch√°vez's government and the media was then in dispute over press freedom, with the Venezuelan government threatening to revoke licenses of media organizations.David Adams and Phil Gunson, St. Petersburg Times, 18 April 2002, Media accused in failed coup Media owners, managers, and commentators working for the five major private mainstream television networks and largest mainstream newspapers then stated their opposition to Ch√°vez's policies.Dinges, John. Columbia Journalism Review (July 2005). \\"Soul Search\\", Vol. 44 Issue 2, July‚ÄìAugust 2005, pp52-8 These media outlets accused the Ch√°vez administration of intimidating their journalists using specially dispatched gangs. Ch√°vez in turn alleged that the owners of these networks had primary allegiance not to Venezuela but to the United States, and that they sought the advancement of neoliberalism via corporate propaganda. Coverage of the 2002 coup The private media was accused of assisting the 2002 coup against Hugo Ch√°vez due to actions performed before and during the events that unfolded.Maurice Lemoine, Le Monde Diplomatique, August 2002, (French)\\"Coups d'Etat sans fronti√®re\\", (Portuguese)\\"Golpes Sem Fronteiras\\". On 11 April, the anti-government march, the message \\"remove Ch√°vez\\", and the call to redirect the march to the presidential palace in Milaflores, were \\"widely announced, promoted, and covered by private television channels, whose explicit support for the opposition became evident.\\" The media ran ads encouraging viewers to protest and news coverage was biased and even manipulated, with a Foreign Policy blog citing Ch√°vez supporters stating that \\"[s]uch tactics were crucial to the coup's strength.\\" On the first morning after the 2002 coup, many of the new Carmona government's highest-ranking members appeared on-air to offer their appreciation to the private media for their support. Once the counter-coup was launched by Chavistas and loyalist elements of the Palace Guard, stations censored any reporting on the events and chose to broadcast classic films and sitcom reruns. Media officials instead attributed this to safety concerns and further denied taking part in the coup: while admitting that they made mistakes, they stated that factual coverage was impeded by the confusion surrounding the coup attempt. Later coverage In 2006, President Ch√°vez announced that the terrestrial broadcast license for RCTV‚ÄîVenezuela's second largest TV channel‚Äîwould not be renewed.BBC NEWS. Chavez to shut down opposition TV. (29 December 2006). The channel's terrestrial broadcasts ended on 28 May 2007 and were replaced with a state network. RCTV was accused of supporting the coup against Ch√°vez in April 2002, and the oil strike in 2002‚Äì2003. It was also accused by the government of violating the Law on the Social Responsibility of Radio and Television.Declaraciones del Ministerio de Comunicaci√≥n e Informaci√≥n The director of the station, Marcel Granier, denied taking part in the coup.Forero, Juan.

Greg Grandin, professor of Latin American history at New York University stated that \\"[The Venezuelan] media is chronically obsessed with Ch√°vez, and critical in a way that would be completely alien for most US observers.\\" After the media-backed 2002 coup attempt, Venezuela passed 'social responsibility' legislation regulating the media.Democracy Now! Thursday, 21 September 2006. Retrieved 4 October 2006. Leftist media watchdog Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) also questioned whether, in the event a television station openly supported and collaborated with coup leaders, the station in question would not be subject to even more serious consequences in the United States or any other Western nation. In a poll conducted by Datanalisis, almost 70 percent of Venezuelans polled opposed the shut-down, but most cited the loss of their favorite soap operas rather than concerns about limits on freedom of expression. After RCTV lost its terrestrial broadcast licence in 2007, private television media remained opposed to the Chavez government, but in most cases moderated that opposition by presenting more government spokesmen.CounterPunch, 21 June 2007, An Analysis of How the Network Has Deliberately Misinformed Its Viewers: Fox News and Venezuela By 2008, Reporters Without Borders reported that following \\"years of 'media war,' Hugo Chavez and his government took control of almost the entire broadcast sector\\". Globovision then became perhaps the most vocally and stridently anti-Chavez television station.Venezuelanalysis, 22 May 2009, Globovision: The Loose Cannon of Venezuelan Media The Venezuelan Government proceeded to file a complaint against Globovision with the Attorney General Office on this matter.El Universal In , Venezuela's telecommunications regulator launched an investigation into Globovisi√≥n after the Venezuelan government stated that the network used an earthquake as an opportunity to attack the government. The government said Globovision was illegally inciting fear and violated the public's right to access critical information in a time of crisis, in particular by claiming that Venezuelan institutions were unaware of the quake and that the only information was available from the US (although in fact the US data had come from Venezuela's National Seismological Institute). The Director of Globovision, who intervened personally on air, claiming to have been unable to reach Venezuelan authorities.Axis of Logic, 27 June 2009, Reporters Without Borders‚Äô Lies about Venezuela Venezuelanalysis, 11 June 2009, Venezuela's Media Quake Ch√°vez demanded sanctions against Globovisi√≥n, calling station director Alberto Federico Ravell \\"a crazy man with a cannon\\". This action was criticized by two officials who monitor freedom of speech, Frank La Rue of the United Nations and Catalina Botero of the OAS. Globovision was fined $4.1m in 2009, for illegal broadcasting on unauthorized microwaves and unpaid taxes from the years 2002‚Äì2003 on political advertising airtime donated by Globovision. Venezuelanalysis, 17 June 2009, Venezuela Investigates Private TV Station Globovision for Inciting Assassination, Other CrimesVenezuelanalysis, 6 June 2009, Venezuelan Government Fines Opposition TV Globovision The private media in Venezuela was eventually pressured by the Venezuelan government into self-censorship. Reporters Without Borders said that the media in Venezuela is \\"almost entirely dominated by the government and its obligatory announcements, called cadenas while Freedom House stated that \\"many previously opposition-aligned outlets have altered their editorial stances to avoid drawing the government‚Äôs ire\\" with censorship increasing significantly during the final years of Ch√°vez's presidency. Since Ch√°vez's death, private media organizations such as El Universal, Globovisi√≥n and Ultimas Noticias were bought by individuals linked to the Venezuelan government. =State media=  Al√≥ Presidente  In 2001, Chavez turned Al√≥ Presidente from a radio show to a full-fledged live, unscripted, television show on public-owned media that ran during all hours of the day promoting the Bolivarian Revolution. The show aired every Sunday, depicting Ch√°vez (wearing red, the color of the revolution) as the charismatic leader, passionate about the well being of his country. Many Venezuelans tuned in because Ch√°vez was known for unveiling new financial assistance packages every weekend.McCaughan (2005), p. 196. Ch√°vez spent an average of 40 hours a week on television.Schoen (2009), p. 154. The show was considered the principal link between the Venezuelan government and its citizens, and was a source of information for both official and opposition media and at international level. The show featured Ch√°vez addressing topics of the day, taking phone calls from the audience, and touring locations where government social welfare programs were active. On 11 June 2009, Chavez inaugurated a \\"theoretical\\" edition of his show, in which he wanted to promote \\"the study, reading and deepening of the revolutionary ideals\\" in order to strengthen socialism. This program aired on Thursday afternoons.\\"Al√≥, Presidente Te√≥rico es un espacio para afianzar el socialismo\\" Bolivarian News Agency, 11 June 2009 (Retrieved on 15 July 2009) Bolivarian propaganda Hugo Ch√°vez used propaganda that took advantage of emotional arguments to gain attention, exploit the fears (either real or imagined) of the population, created external enemies for scapegoat purposes, and produced nationalism within the population, causing feelings of betrayal for support of the opposition.Manwaring (2005), p. 11. In 2007, The World Politics Review stated that \\"As Ch√°vez pushes on with transforming Venezuela into a socialist state, government propaganda plays an important role in maintaining and mobilizing government supporters\\". A 2011 New York Times article said that Venezuela had an \\"expanding state propaganda complex\\" while The Boston Globe described Ch√°vez as \\"a media savvy, forward-thinking propagandist [who] has the oil wealth to influence public opinion\\". Ch√°vez used television both domestically through cadenas and international through outlets like TeleSUR for propaganda purposesManwaring (2005), p. 12. while websites like Aporrea.org, Radio Nacional de Venezuela, Venezuelanalysis.com, were allegedly used by the Venezuelan government for propaganda purposes. Ch√°vez was also promoted through educational systems introduced by his government in Venezuela which focused on achievements made under his policies.Nichols and Morse (2010), p. 230. A cult of personality was then created around Ch√°vez in Venezuela among his supporters. International media =Europe= According to PBS, Hugo Ch√°vez was popular among anti-globalization individuals of the press in Europe, including former director of Le Monde diplomatique, Ignacio Ramonet. =North America= Canada On 13 March 2007 the Ontario Press Council upheld a complaint that a series of articles published in the Toronto Star in May 2006 lacked balance due to the absence of comment from Venezuelan government representatives and did not attribute figures about murder rate, poverty and unemployment to opposition sources. United States Media outlets in the United States, and in other parts of the world, have consistently suggested that Hugo Ch√°vez is a \\"dictator\\" or is \\"headed in that direction\\" in spite of the fact that he and his party have won numerous national elections certified by international observers, and confirmed by independent international polling companies. The leftist media watchdog FAIR frequently criticized media coverage of the Ch√°vez government. The Venezuelan government also attempted to improve the image of Hugo Ch√°vez through the Venezuela Information Office.

This has led to the development of new analytical methods used for software development and test process analysis. ODC is process model, language and domain independent. Applications of ODC have been reported by several corporations on a variety of platforms and development processes, ranging from waterfall, spiral, gated, and agileOrthogonal Defect Classification (ODC) in Agile Development. M. Jagia, S. Meena, IEEE ISSRE 2009 Supplemental Proceedings, Nov. 2009. Orthogonal Defect Classification: An Agile Test/QA Primer, Agile Development Conference, Nov. 2012 development processes. One of the popular applications of ODC is software root cause analysis. ODC is known to reduce the time taken to perform root cause analysis by over a factor of 10. The gains come primarily from a different approach to root cause analysis, where the ODC data is generated rapidly (in minutes, as opposed to hours per defect) and analytics used for the cause and effect analysis. This shifts the burden of analysis from a purely human method to one that is more data intensive.\\"ODC - a 10x for Root Cause Analysis\\", R. Chillarege 2006 ODC as proposed in the original papers have specific attribute-value sets that create measurements on the development process. Two of the five more well known categories are the Defect Type and Defect Trigger. The Defect Type captures the changes made in the code as a result of the defect. There are seven values for Defect Type and they have been empirically established to provide a measurement of the product through the process through their distribution. The concept is that changes in the Defect Type Distribution is a function of the development process model, and thus provides an intrinsic measurement of progress of the product through the process. The Defect Trigger, similarly provides a measurement of the Testing process. The concept of the Trigger is a key contribution that came through ODC and is now fairly widely used in technical and research publications.Software Defects and their Impact on System Availability - A Study of Field Failures in Operating Systems. M.Sullivan and R. Chillarege, IEEE 21st Fault-Tolerant Computing Systems, 1991. The software Trigger is defined as the force that surfaced the Fault to create the Failure. The full set of Triggers is available in ODC Documentation. The Defect Type and Trigger collectively provide a large amount of causal information on Defects. Additional information from the defect that is captured in standard ODC implementations includes \\"Impact\\", \\"Source\\" and \\"Age\\". ODC Training courses report that, once trained, an individual can categorize a defect via ODC in less than 3 minutes when performing the task retrospectively.Diamonds from Defects, LADC Keynote, http://www.unicauca.edu.co/ladc2016/?q=node/22 The time taken is far lower when done in-flight, or in-process. The categorization cannot be directly compared to root-cause-analysis, since ODC data is about \\"what-is\\", not \\"why\\". However, root cause analysis is very commonly performed using ODC. The analysis that studies ODC data is performing the first pass of root cause analysis, which is confirmed by discussing the results with the development team.

Thus, the attributes, either singularly, or in conjunction with one of the others provides specific measurements on certain aspects of the engineering process. These measurements can be used for one or more analytical methods, since they were designed with general measurement principles in mind. Todate, several research papers have applied these for a variety of purposes. More recently, there have been research articles that use ODC to assess the methods used for security evaluation, and expanded the scope of ODC.Are Vulnerabilities Discovered and Resolved like Other Defects?, P.

Agoraphobia typically develops as a result of having panic disorder. In a small minority of cases, however, agoraphobia can develop by itself without being triggered by the onset of panic attacks. Agoraphobia can be caused by traumatic experiences, such as bullying or abuse. Historically, there has been debate over whether agoraphobia without panic genuinely existed, or whether it was simply a manifestation of other disorders such as panic disorder, general anxiety disorder, avoidant personality disorder and social phobia. One researcher said: \\"out of 41 agoraphobics seen (at a clinic) during a period of 1 year, only 1 fit the diagnosis of agoraphobia without panic attacks, and even this particular classification was questionable...Do not expect to see too many agoraphobics without panic\\".Barlow, D.

In spite of this earlier skepticism, current thinking is that agoraphobia without panic disorder is indeed a valid, unique illness which has gone largely unnoticed, since its sufferers are far less likely to seek clinical treatment.

His work has appeared in movies such as the original Star Wars trilogy, Jurassic Park, and RoboCop. He is currently involved with his ongoing Mad God stop-motion series, which were funded through Kickstarter. Early life Tippett was born in Berkeley, California. When he was seven, Tippett saw Ray Harryhausen's special effects classic, The 7th Voyage of Sinbad, and his life's direction was set., StarWars.com Tippett completed a bachelor's degree in art at the University of California, Irvine, and went to work at the animation studio Cascade Pictures in Los Angeles. Career = Stop motion = In 1975, while still working at Cascade Pictures, Phil Tippett and Jon Berg were hired by George Lucas at Industrial Light & Magic to create a stop-motion miniature chess scene for the original Star Wars film.Phil Tippett bio , in the Tippett Studio official web site When Star Wars was being released on theatres, in 1977, Tippett was approached by Joe Dante and Jon Davison to create the fish for Roger Corman's Piranha (released in 1978, although Tippett was not credited in the film).Phil Tippett special effects filmography, IMDB That year, 1978, Tippett headed the ILM animation department with Jon Berg for The Empire Strikes Back (released in 1980). For this film, Tippett co-developed the animation technique called go motion to animate the sinister AT-AT Imperial Walkers and the hybrid alien tauntauns. In 1981, Tippett continued using go motion for Dragonslayer, and received his first Academy Award nomination for the extraordinarily realistic dragon animation. By 1983, Tippett led the famed Lucasfilm creature shop for Return of the Jedi for which he was awarded his first Oscar in 1984. In 1984, Tippett Studio was born when Tippett left ILM and set up a studio in his garage to create a 10-minute experimental film called Prehistoric Beast. The realism of the dinosaurs it depicted and the film's reflection of contemporary scientific theory led to the 1985 CBS animated documentary Dinosaur!. The next year, in 1986, Dinosaur! earned Tippett Studio its first award, a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects, for the animated dinosaur sequences. In 1986, producer Jon Davison hired Tippett to create the animated robot sequences for RoboCop. The ED-209 stop-motion model was animated by Tippett but designed by Craig Hayes (also known as Craig DaviesCraig Hayes' description page in the IMDB website (section \\"Personal Details\\": Alternate Names: Craig Davies)), who also built the full size models. As one of the setpieces of the movie, the ED-209's look and animated sequences were under the close supervision of director Paul Verhoeven, who sometimes acted out the robot's movements himself. ED 209 was voiced by producer Jon Davison. This project became the start of a long and successful collaboration between Davies and Tippett. He also modeled the Dark Overlord creatures seen in Howard the Duck. =Computer generated effects= In 1991, Tippett was hired to create the dinosaur effects for the Steven Spielberg blockbuster Jurassic Park using his go motion technique made famous in the film Dragonslayer. However, Dennis Muren and his CGI team at Industrial Light & Magic created animated test footage of a T. rex that Spielberg loved. When Tippett was told that Jurassic Park dinosaurs would be computer-generated, he was shocked, exclaiming \\"I've just become extinct\\" (a line Spielberg borrows and uses in the movie).2Shay, Don and Duncan, Jody. Ballantine Books 1993 \\"The Making of Jurassic Park\\" Softcover page 53, first paragraph Far from being extinct, Tippett evolved as stop-motion animation gave way to computer-generated imagery or CGI, and because of Tippett's background and understanding of animal movement and behavior, Spielberg kept Tippett on to supervise the animation on 50 dinosaur shots for Jurassic Park. Tippett supervised both the Tippett Studio and ILM animators, resulting in realistic digital dinosaurs that breathe, flex, twitch and react. His effort earned him a second Oscar. Work done on Jurassic Park resulted in the development by Tippett Studio's Craig Hayes of the DID (Digital Input Device) which was pivotal in the transition from stop motion to computer generated animation in bringing creatures to life. Tippett is also the subject of a humorous internet meme regarding his credit in the film (\\"Dinosaur Supervisor\\"), which is displayed with the tagline \\"One job, Phil! You had one job!\\", implying that because he didn't supervise the dinosaurs properly, he was responsible for the on-screen deaths. Mashable interviewed Tippett in April 2014 about this meme, which he called \\"beyond silly\\" and \\"such a waste of time\\". In June 2015, after media attention due to his new credit of \\"Dinosaur Consultant\\" in Jurassic World and the ensuing deaths in the film, Tippett tweeted: \\"to be fair, there were a lot of dinosaurs. it was a large job.\\" In 1995, Tippett Studio was hired to create the giant, hostile alien arachnids in Paul Verhoeven's adaptation of Robert A. Heinlein's classic science fiction novel Starship Troopers. Tippett marshaled a team of 100 animators, model makers, computer artists and technicians and expanded his all-CGI facility. Because of the intensity of his involvement, and his ability to pre-visualize the hordes of teeming arachnids, Verhoeven has credited Tippett with co-directing the large-scale battle sequences for the film. The excellence of this work resulted in Tippett's sixth nomination in 1997 for an Academy Award. During 1997‚Äì98, Tippett supervised animation and effects for Universal's Virus and Disney's My Favorite Martian. In 1998‚Äì99 he and Craig Hayes co-supervised the visual effects on Jan De Bont's The Haunting, for DreamWorks. Under Tippett and Hayes' lead, Tippett Studio created over 100 complex effects shots that expressed the horrific character of the house and the spirits that live there. In 2000, Tippett joined director Ivan Reitman as the visual effects supervisor on the DreamWorks science fiction comedy Evolution. In just under a year, Tippett Studio designed, realized and animated over 17 extraterrestrial creatures in 175 shots. Throughout 2001 and into 2002, Tippett changed direction to focus on developing and directing his own film. Tippett achieved this with Starship Troopers 2: Hero of the Federation, by partnering with his longtime associates, writer Ed Neumeier and producer Jon Davison, with whom he worked on the original Starship Troopers and Robocop. In 1990, Tippett began work on an independent project entitled Mad God but during the rise of his studio, the project was dropped. in 2010, Mad God was brought back up, but Tippett did not have the budget for the film. He started a Kickstarter page to make the funds with the needed budget goal of $40,000. On June 16, 2012, the project was successfully funded after exceeding the goal and making $124,156. The first and second chapters have been completed as of August 2017, with parts 3 and 4 underway. The website for the film is online and shows information on the project, as well as allowing purchase of parts 1 and 2.

(see B.Rust: Music Hall on Record, Gramophone 1979 p. 282 et seq.) Over 500 recordings sold in their thousands long after his early death in 1915. Born in Melbourne, Williams tried a number of jobs before embarking on an entertainment career which led him to come to England in 1899. He became a popular entertainer in the music halls singing what were known as chorus-songs ‚Äì he also appeared in pantomime. Career It was in 1906 that Williams made his first recordings and from that date he recorded prolifically on cylinder and disc. In 1910, he returned for an extended tour of his native Australia where he was greeted with wild enthusiasm. Returning to England later in that year, he continued his business relationship with songwriter Fred Godfrey. The two had what might be described as a \\"song factory\\" and worked in partnership (although it is believed that Godfrey did all of the song writing). The year 1912 seemed to be the zenith of Williams' career ‚Äì he appeared in the first Royal Command Performance of that year and achieved glowing reviews in the national press. Sadly this fame was not to last as Williams became ill in late 1914 and died in Hove near Brighton in March 1915, the proximate cause being septic prostatitis and consequent complications after an operation for that condition, but rumoured ultimately to be connected with \\"previous social excesses.\\" (an Edwardian euphemism for syphilis) (Myerscough, book to CD set, 2001) Personal life and death  He is buried in Mill Lane Cemetery, Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex, England. His headstone is in a family plot and read: Billy was also the brother of Richard and Rowley Banks, two of Australia's earliest professional golfers, who were also foundation members of the Australian Professional Golfers Association, founded in 1911. Williams had married Amy Robinson in 1901 and she survived her husband by some 61 years. Billy and Amy Williams produced four living children: Reginald, William, Margaret and Cathleen, who after his death, moved with Amy to Australia to live out their lives. Williams is survived by his grandson Richard John Williams and great grandson Richard Guy Williams who both reside in Sydney, Australia.

They line most of the North Carolina coastline, separating Currituck Sound, Albemarle Sound, and Pamlico Sound from the Atlantic Ocean. A major tourist destination, the Outer Banks are known for their wide expanse of open beachfront and the Cape Hatteras National Seashore. The hundreds of shipwrecks along the Outer Banks have given the surrounding seas the nickname Graveyard of the Atlantic. The Graveyard of the Atlantic Museum is in Hatteras Village near a United States Coast Guard facility and the Hatteras ferry. The English Roanoke Colony--where Virginia Dare was born--vanished from Roanoke Island in 1587. The Lost Colony, written and performed today on Roanoke Island to commemorate the original colonists, is the second longest-running outdoor drama in the United States and its theater acts as a cultural focal point for much of the Outer Banks. The Wright brothers' first flight in a controlled, powered, heavier-than-air vehicle took place on the Outer Banks on December 17, 1903, at Kill Devil Hills near the seafront town of Kitty Hawk. The Wright Brothers National Monument commemorates the historic flights, and First Flight Airport is a small, general-aviation airfield located there. Geography NASA - Outer Banks - North Carolina, United States International Space Station (north = upper right; April 2019) The Outer Banks is a string of peninsulas and barrier islands separating the Atlantic Ocean from mainland North Carolina. From north to south, the largest of these include: Bodie Island (which used to be an island but is now a peninsula due to tropical storms and hurricanes), Hatteras Island, Ocracoke Island, Portsmouth Island, and the Core Banks. Over time, the exact number of islands and inlets changes as new inlets are opened up, often during a breach created during violent storms, and older inlets close, usually due to gradually shifting sands during the dynamic processes of beach evolution. The Outer Banks stretch southward from Sandbridge in Virginia Beach down the North Carolina coastline. Sources differ regarding the southern terminus of the Outer Banks. Generations of North Carolina schoolchildren have learned that the term includes the state's three prominent capes: Cape Hatteras, Cape Lookout, and Cape Fear. Other sources limit the definition to two capes (Cape Hatteras and Cape Lookout) and coastal areas in four counties (Currituck County, Dare County, Hyde County, and Carteret County). Some authors exclude Carteret's Bogue Banks; others exclude the county entirely. The abbreviations OBX (Outer Banks) and SOBX (Southern Outer Banks) are modern terms used to promote tourism and to market a variety of stickers, t-shirts, and other items to vacationers. OBX, which originated first, is generally used in the northern Outer Banks. SOBX is a misnomer, used to capitalize on the popularity of \\"OBX\\" and refers to the Crystal Coast area and the Bogue Banks. The northern part of the Outer Banks, from Oregon Inlet northward, is actually a part of the North American mainland, since the northern inlets of Bodie Island and Currituck Banks no longer exist. It is separated by the Currituck Sound and the Intracoastal Waterway, which passes through the Great Dismal Swamp occupying much of the mainland west of the Outer Banks. Road access to the northern Outer Banks is cut off between Sandbridge and Corolla, North Carolina, with communities such as Carova Beach accessible only by four-wheel drive vehicles. North Carolina State Highway 12 links most of the popular Outer Banks communities in this section of the coast. The easternmost point is Rodanthe Pier in Rodanthe, NC . The Outer Banks are not anchored to offshore coral reefs like some other barrier islands and as a consequence they often suffer significant beach erosion during major storms. In fact, their location jutting out into the Atlantic makes them the most hurricane-prone area north of Florida, for both landfalling storms and brushing storms offshore. Hatteras Island was cut in half on September 18, 2003, when Hurricane Isabel washed a 2,000 foot (600 m) wide and 15 foot (5 m) deep channel called Isabel Inlet through the community of Hatteras Village on the southern end of the island. The tear was subsequently repaired and restored by sand dredging by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It was cut off once again in 2011 by Hurricane Irene. Access to the island was largely limited to boat access only from August to late October until another temporary bridge could be built. NASA - Outer Banks - North Carolina, United States - International Space Station (north = lower left; April 2019) Vegetation The vegetation of the Outer Banks has biodiversity, although it is considered the northern limit for many southern plants such as wild scrub palms. In the northeast part of the Outer Banks, from Virginia Beach southward past the North Carolina border to Oregon Inlet, the main types of vegetation are sea grasses, beach grasses and other beach plants including Opuntia humifusa on the Atlantic side and wax myrtles, bays, and grasses on the Sound side with areas of pine and Spanish moss-covered live oaks. Yucca aloifolia and Yucca gloriosa can be found growing wild here in the northern parts of its range on the beach. Sabal Minor palms were once indigenous to the entire Outer Banks, and they are still successfully planted and grown. Its current most northerly known native stand is on Monkey Island in Currituck County. From Cape Hatteras National Seashore southward, the vegetation does include that of the northeastern Outer Banks such as Dwarf palmetto (Sabal minor), Yucca aloifolia and Yucca gloriosa; however, the main vegetation consists of Cabbage palmetto (Sabal palmetto), which can be found in the north, although they are native in the southern part of the Outer Banks, specifically prevalent from Cape Hatteras and all points southward. Pindo palms and windmill palms are also planted widely throughout the Outer Banks; although, they are not indigenous to the area. A wide variety of native plants can be found at the Elizabethan Gardens in Manteo on Roanoke Island. Climate The Outer Banks has a humid subtropical climate. The outer banks have unusual weather patterns because of their unique geographical location. As the islands are jutted out from the eastern seaboard into the Atlantic Gulf Stream, the Outer Banks has a predisposition to be affected by hurricanes, Nor'easters (usually in the form of rain, and rarely snow or mixed precipitation), and other ocean-driven storms. The winters are typically milder than in inland areas, averaging lows in the upper 30s and highs in the lower 50s, and is more frequently overcast than in the summer. However, the exposure of the Outer Banks makes them prone to higher winds, often causing wind chills to make the apparent temperature as cold as the inland areas. The summer months average lows from the mid-70s to highs in the upper 80s, depending on the time of the summer. The spring and fall are typically milder seasons. The fall and winter are usually warmer than areas inland, while the spring and the summer are often slightly cooler because of the moderating effects of being surrounded by water. Although snow is possible, averaging from 3 inches in the north to less than 1/2 inch per year in the south, there are many times when years pass between snowfalls. The majority of nor'easters are \\"born\\" off the coasts of the Outer Banks. Culture Graveyard of the Atlantic Museum, Hatteras, North Carolina, June 2007 The Outer Banks is one of the most culturally distinctive areas of the East Coast of the United States. The Outer Banks were inhabited before the arrival of Europeans, with small branches of larger tribes, such as the Algonquin speaking Chowanoke, Secotan and Poteskeet living semi nomadic lives. Oftentimes Native Americans would use the barrier islands facing the Atlantic Ocean for fishing in the summer, and reside on Roanoke Island or the North Carolina mainland in the winter. European explorers to the Outer Banks as far back as the 1500s noted encountering the friendly Hatteras Island and Outer Banks Natives, noting their hospitality to foreign explorers as well as their happiness and overall quality of life. European-borne diseases and migration to the mainland were likely the main causes for the decline of the Native population. Before bridges were built in the 1930s, the only form of transport between or off the islands was by boat, which allowed for the islands to stay isolated from much of the rest of the mainland. This helped to preserve the maritime culture and the distinctive Outer Banks accent or brogue, which sounds more like an English accent than it does an American accent. Many \\"bankers\\" have often been mistaken for being from England or Ireland when traveling to areas outside of the Outer Banks. The brogue is more distinctive the further south one travels on the Outer Banks, with it being the thickest on Ocracoke Island and Harkers Island. Some residents of the Outer Banks, known as wreckers, made part of their living by scavenging wrecked ships‚Äîor by luring ships to their destruction. Horses with lanterns tied to their necks would be walked along the beach; the lanterns' up and down motion would appear to ships to represent clear water and a ship ahead; the unsuspecting captain would then drive his ship ashore following this false light. The islands are home to herds of feral horses, sometimes called \\"banker ponies\\", which according to local legend are descended from Spanish mustangs washed ashore centuries ago in shipwrecks. Populations are found on Ocracoke Island, Shackleford Banks, Currituck Banks, and in the Rachel Carson Estuarine Sanctuary. Ocracoke was the last refuge of pirate Edward Teach, better known as Blackbeard. It is also where the infamous pirate was killed November 22, 1718 in a fierce battle with troops from Virginia.D.

(North Carolina Maritime History Council) The Outer Banks are home to Yaupon Holly (Ilex vomitoria), the roasted leaves of which were brewed into a high caffeine beverage called black drink by the Native Americans. The Outer Banks may be one of the few places where it is still consumed. Economy Major industries of the region include commercial fishing, boat building and tourism. Since the 1990s the rise of tourism, has led the region to become an increasingly service oriented economy. There has been a long history of fishing in the Outer Banks, dating back to the end of the 17th century. Pirates ravaged the coast for the majority of the 1600s, but once they were ridden, the local settlers used fishing as their lifeline. In the mid-19th century, large-scale commercial fishing erupted, mostly due to the construction of the Albemarle and Chesapeake Canal, which simplified shipping methods for fishermen. Saltwater fishing became the cash-crop of the Outer Banks, and blossomed it into a popular tourist destination. In modern times, tourists will flock to the area just for the abundance of fishing opportunities. Anglers, otherwise known as fishermen, have a wide range of fishing methods, some of these methods date back to when the first settlers arrived, to choose from in the Outer Banks.

It consists of three parts, starting in provincial France, thereafter moving to Paris, and finally returning to the provinces. Thus it resembles another of Balzac's greatest novels, La Rabouilleuse (The Black Sheep, 1842), in that it is set partly in Paris and partly in the provinces. It is, however, unique among the novels and short stories of La Com√©die humaine (The Human Comedy, 1829‚Äì1848) by virtue of the even-handedness with which it treats both geographical dimensions of French social life. Background The novel's main character, Lucien Chardon, works as a journalist, and his friend David S√©chard is a printer. These were both professions with which Balzac himself had experience. Balzac had started a printing business in Paris in 1826. It became bankrupt in 1828. His experiences influenced his description of David S√©chard's working life.\\"Introduction\\" by Herbert J. Hunt from Penguin Classics edition of Lost Illusions, 1971 He had bought the newspaper La Chronique de Paris in 1836, and founded La Revue Parisienne in 1840. Both of these business ventures were failures. A number of his novels had been published in serial form in the newspapers, though he often had disagreements with the publishers. He had also received harsh reviews in the newspapers from critics such as Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve and Jules Janin. Balzac had been critical of the press in La Peau de chagrin, and later published a criticism of the press called Monograph of the Paris Press in 1842.  Writing and publication  Illusions perdues was published in three parts. *1837 - Les Deux Po√®tes (The Two Poets), Paris: Werdet *1839 - Un grand homme de province √† Paris (A Great Man of the Provinces in Paris), Paris: Souverain *1843 - √àve et David (Eve and David), Paris: Furne The titles of the various constituent parts of Illusions perdues, which came out over a period of six years, vary considerably from edition to edition and also because of pre-original publication in serialized form. The eventual title of Part III, Les Souffrances de l‚Äôinventeur (The Inventor‚Äôs Sufferings), was superimposed by Balzac onto his personal copy of the Furne edition of La Com√©die humaine. The Two Poets includes sonnets by the main character. In real life, these were written by poet friends of Balzac's including Th√©ophile Gautier. Plot summary Lucien Chardon, the son of a lower middle-class father and an impoverished mother of aristocratic descent, is the pivotal figure of the entire work. Living at Angoul√™me, he is impoverished, impatient, handsome and ambitious. His widowed mother, his sister √àve and his best friend, David S√©chard, do nothing to lessen his high opinion of his own talents, for it is an opinion they share. Even as Part I of Illusions perdues, Les Deux po√®tes (The Two Poets), begins, Lucien has already written a historical novel and a sonnet sequence, whereas David is a scientist. But both, according to Balzac, are \\"poets\\" in that they creatively seek truth. Theirs is a fraternity of poetic aspiration, whether as scientist or writer: thus, even before David marries √àve, the two young men are spiritual brothers. Lucien is introduced into the drawing-room of the leading figure of Angoul√™me high society, Mme de Bargeton, who rapidly becomes infatuated with him. It is not long before the pair flee to Paris where Lucien adopts his maternal patronymic of de Rubempr√© and hopes to make his mark as a poet. Mme de Bargeton, on the other hand, recognises her m√©salliance and, though remaining in Paris, severs all ties with Lucien, abandoning him to a life of destitution. In Part II, Un Grand homme de province √† Paris, Lucien is contrasted both with the journalist Lousteau and the high-minded writer Daniel d‚ÄôArthez. Jilted by Mme de Bargeton for the adventurer Sixte du Ch√¢telet, he moves in a social circle of high-class actress-prostitutes and their journalist lovers: soon he becomes the lover of Coralie. As a literary journalist he prostitutes his talent. But he still harbours the ambition of belonging to high society and longs to assume by royal warrant the surname and coat of arms of the de Rubempr√©s. He therefore switches his allegiance from the liberal opposition press to the one or two royalist newspapers that support the government. This act of betrayal earns him the implacable hatred of his erstwhile journalist colleagues, who destroy Coralie's theatrical reputation. In the depths of his despair he forges his brother-in-law's name on three promissory notes. This is his ultimate betrayal of his integrity as a person. After Coralie's death he returns in disgrace to Angoul√™me, stowed away behind the Ch√¢telets‚Äô carriage: Mme de Bargeton has just married du Ch√¢telet, who has been appointed prefect of that region. In Part III, Les Souffrances de l‚Äôinventeur, in Angoul√™me David S√©chard is betrayed on all sides but is supported by his loving wife. He invents a new and cheaper method of paper production: thus, at a thematic level, the advances of paper-manufacturing processes are very closely interwoven with the commercialization of literature. Lucien's forgery of his brother-in-law's signature almost bankrupts David, who has to sell the secret of his invention to business rivals. Lucien is about to commit suicide when he is approached by a sham Jesuit priest, the Abb√© Carlos Herrera: this, in another guise, is the escaped convict Vautrin whom Balzac had already presented in Le P√®re Goriot. Herrera takes Lucien under his protection and they drive off to Paris, there to begin a fresh assault on the capital. Lucien's story continues in Splendeurs et mis√®res des courtisanes. Themes =Provincial Life= The lifestyle of the provinces is juxtaposed with that of the metropolis, as Balzac contrasts the varying tempos of life at Angoul√™me and in Paris, the different standards of living in those cities, and their different perceptions. =Artistic Life in Paris= Balzac explores the artistic life of Paris in 1821‚Äì22 and the nature of the artistic life generally. Lucien, who was already a not quite published author when the novel begins, fails to get his early literary work published whilst he is in Paris, and during his time in the capital writes nothing of any consequence. Daniel d‚ÄôArthez, on the other hand, does not actively seek literary fame; it comes to him because of his solid literary merit. =Journalism= Balzac denounces journalism, presenting it as the most pernicious form of intellectual prostitution. =Duplicity= Balzac affirms the duplicity of all things, both in Paris and at Angoul√™me, e.g., the character of Lucien de Rubempr√©, who even has two surnames; David S√©chard's ostensible friend, the notary Petit-Claud, who operates against his client, not for him; the legal comptes (accounts) which are contes fantastiques (fantastic tales); the theatre which lives by make-believe; high society likewise; the Abb√© Carlos Herrera who is a sham priest, and in fact a criminal; the Sin against the Holy Ghost, whereby Lucien abandons his true integrity as a person, forging his brother-in-law's signature and even contemplating suicide. Narrative strategies (1) Although Illusions perdues is a commentary upon the contemporary world, Balzac is tantalizingly vague in his delineation of the historico-political background. His delineation of the broader social background is far more precise. (2) Illusions perdues is remarkable for its innumerable changes of tempo. However, even the change of tempo from Part II to Part III is but a superficial point of contrast between life as it is lived in the capital and life in the provinces. Everywhere the same laws of human behaviour apply. A person's downfall may come from the rapier thrust of the journalist or from the slowly strangling machinations of the law. (3) Most notably in La Cousine Bette Balzac was one of the first novelists to employ the technique of in medias res. In Illusions perdues there is an unusual example of this, Part II of the novel serving as the prelude to the extended flashback which follows in Part III. (4) Illusions perdues is also full of the \\"sublimities and degradations\\", \\"excited emphasis\\" and \\"romantic rhetoric\\" to which F.R. LeavisF.R. Leavis, The Great Tradition, London 1948, p. 29 has objected in Le P√®re Goriot. Characters and viewpoints are polarized. There is the strong and perhaps somewhat artificial contrast between Lucien and David, art and science, Lousteau and d‚ÄôArthez, journalism and literature, Paris and the provinces, etc. And this polarization reaches the point of melodrama as Balzac appears to draw moral distinctions between \\"vice\\" and \\"virtue\\". Coralie is the Fallen Woman, √àve an Angel of strength and purity. Yet Balzac also describes Coralie's love for Lucien as a form of redemptive purity, an \\"absolution\\" and a \\"benediction\\". Thus, through what structurally is melodrama, he underlines what he considers to be the fundamental resemblance of opposites. (5) Introduced into narrative fiction by the Gothic novel (The Castle of Otranto, The Mysteries of Udolpho, The Monk), melodrama was widespread in literature around the time when Illusions perdues was written. Jane Austen satirizes it in Northanger Abbey. Eug√®ne Sue made regular use of it. Instances in Illusions perdues are the use of improbable coincidence; Lucien, in an endeavour to pay Coralie's funeral expenses, writing bawdy love-songs when her body is hardly yet cold; and the deus ex machina (or Satanas ex machina?) in the form of Herrera's appearance at the end of the novel. (6) Like all the major works of the Com√©die humaine, Illusions perdues pre-eminently focuses on the social nexus. Within the nexus of love, in her relationship with Lucien, Coralie is life-giving: her love has a sacramental quality. However, in an environment of worldly man≈ìuvring her influence upon him is fatal. She is, in other words, both a Fallen and a Risen Woman, depending upon the nexus within which she is viewed. In the unpropitious environment of Angoul√™me Mme de Bargeton is an absurd bluestocking; transplanted to Paris, she undergoes an immediate \\"metamorphosis\\", becoming a true denizen of high society ‚Äì and rightfully, in Part III, the occupant of the pr√©fecture at Angoul√™me. As to whether Lucien's writings have any value, the social laws are paramount: this is a fact which he does not realize until it is too late. (7) A parallel ambiguity is present in the character of the epicene Lucien de Rubempr√©. Mme de Bargeton finds no fault with his amorous competence, nor does Coralie. Yet, partly because of his existential circumstances and also because of the narrative context in which Balzac places him, it appears that Lucien is fundamentally homosexual. This, incidentally, is almost the first appearance of homosexuality in modern literature. (8) Illusions perdues is, according to Donald Adamson, \\"a revelation of the secret workings of the world, rather than a Bildungsroman illuminating the development of character\\".Donald Adamson, \\"Illusions perdues\\", London 1982, p. 86 Sequel The success of this novel inspired Balzac to write a four-part sequel, Splendeurs et mis√®res des courtisanes (published in four parts from 1838-1847). Illusions perdues and Splendeurs et mis√®res des courtisanes form part of La Com√©die humaine, the series of novels and short stories written by Balzac depicting French society in the period of the Bourbon Restoration and July Monarchy (1815‚Äì1848).

However, to the general public he is mostly known for his writing, in particular as a columnist for Vrij Nederland and de Volkskrant and as linguist and literary critic for Vrij Nederland, de Volkskrant, and NRC Handelsblad. Pseudonyms Hugo Brandt Corstius wrote under over sixty different pseudonyms, allonyms and aliases. He claimed each them to be a component of his character. In Vrij Nederland he used the pseudonym Piet Grijs and between 1979 and 1986 in de Volkskrant he used the pseudonym Stoker. His other pseudonyms include Battus (in NRC Handelsblad and Vrij Nederland), Raoul Chapkis, Victor Baarn, Dolf Cohen, Maaike Helder, Peter Malenkov and Talisman. The Battus name was reserved for writing on linguistics and language play, in columns, articles and books. Many forms of word play (palindromes, the longest attested word in Dutch, e-less Dutch, etc. etc.) were bundled in the volume Opperlandse taal- & letterkunde, (\\"Upperlandic linguistics\\", where \\"Upperlandic\\" is word play on \\"Netherlandic\\"), and twenty years later a sequel Opperlans! (deliberate misspelling). Both books are concerned with the form of Dutch words with little regard to meaning.

The album received acclaim from music critics, and was included at number 55 on Pitchforks list of \\"The 200 Best Albums of the 2000s\\". As of 2008, Feels sold 55,000 copies in the US. Recording Feels is known for its unconventional guitar sounds, which were obtained in part by the unique tuning the band used. Geologist explained how they created and used this tuning on the Collected Animals message board: > \\"All the songs on Feels are tuned to our friends piano which was out of tune > to begin with. Dave and I made loops from recordings of him playing her > piano, and we used those loops in the early songwriting process for feels. > So since those loops are premade and can't be tuned, the guitars have to be > tuned to the loops. it's not out of tune in any traditional whole step/half > step kind of way...we're talking microtonally out of tune after years of not > being professionally tuned and subtle natural detuning. Kind of like if you > played guitar in standard tuning for years but never once re-tuned it to > make sure it was right. It would have its own unique out-of-tune tuning > based on what strings you played most often, how hard you played it, the > temperature in the room, the humidity, etc... When we went into the studio > it ruled over everything we did. Even Doctess's live piano playing required > us bringing in a professional piano tuner, playing him a minidisc recording > of our friend's out of tune piano, and having him try to de-tune the > studio's piano in exactly the same way our friend's was. Without those > recordings or the loops dave and i made, you wouldn't be able to get it > exact unless you tune to the album while it's playing, and even then, you'd > have to know which loop in the album we use to tune, which one chord it is, > and because of the way we mixed the loop in, it is almost impossible to > separate from dave's guitar. I'll never forget when the tuner finished (we > had to wait to start recording until he finished) and he stood up from the > bench and went 'there you go, the piano's perfectly out of tune.'\\" Feels is the first album to feature significant contributions from musicians outside its core members. Geologist described the contributions of Doctess (at that time married with band member Avey Tare) and the recording process on the Collected Animals message board: > \\"kristin plays on every song. she played live as we did the live tracking > but there was often a lot of bleed into the piano mics from the other > instruments so she often re-did or elaborated on her parts at night when she > could have quiet in the studio. we all played in one room so there was so > [sic] isolation, except josh's guitar amps which we stuck in a bathroom.\\" Geologist also described working with Eyvind Kang on the Collected Animals message board: > \\"he was only there for an afternoon. we had sent him live recordings of the > songs we wanted him on (daffy, bees, fickle cycle, and people) but he never > had a chance to listen to them. so he came in and would listen to each track > once, then talk with us about ideas, and then just improvise over the song. > as scott [Colburn] predicted (he has worked with eyvind many times over the > last 10 years), he never hit a wrong note. it was pretty mindblowing to > watch. he played violin, viola, and tried some traditional Chinese > instrument, which we took out because it didn't mix so well. wish we had > more time to jam because i'm sure it [would] have [been] a lot of fun. dave > [aka Avey Tare] and i had been thinking about who to ask to play violin on a > few songs that we wanted violin on, and eyvind was our first choice. we'd > been big fans of his since first hearing him play violin on a sun city girls > record in the mid-90s. it was kind of just great luck that he was our first > choice and that scott knew him and had recorded him a bunch, and that he > lived in the seattle area. when i first asked him if he'd be interested his > crucial question was what we wanted out of a violin part in a song. did we > want it to stand out melodically so a listener would say, oh here comes the > violin part, or did we want him to explore the violin and how it would fit > into the song (i.e. doing noise, more textural parts)? i replied the latter > and he was stoked. that was the ultimate reason we chose him. he's so good > at exploring and pushing the limits of his instruments. he can master the > pretty and melodic stuff, harsh noise music, trancey drones, etc.\\" Engineer Scott Colburn also provided a few details about recording Feels on the Collected Animals message board (under the username \\"Scooter\\") \\"Feels started on tape and ended up in Nuendo...The vocals had effects on them, but they were no different than the effects used live. BUTT [sic], each vocal track was recorded with 6 microphones, thereby creating a whole new effect.\\" Title and artwork The cover art is reminiscent of the work of artist Henry Darger. Its creator, the group's singer Dave Portner, has been a huge fan of Darger but didn't have Darger in mind while creating the cover art. He found a children's educational guide on the street and thought \\"the images fit the sound and the lyrics perfectly.\\" In an interview, Kria Brekkan, Portner's ex- wife, revealed the origin of the title, \\"I think what I brought to it perhaps got channeled through Dave's creativity and so on. We had been intense pan- pals [sic] for nearly a year, at the time when it was recorded, and when my friends saw the album cover, they thought it was my art, and they laughed about the title because it came from my use of English. I used the word \\"feels\\" for feelings.\\" Critical reception Feels received widespread acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 84, based on 35 reviews. Mark Richardson of Pitchfork wrote, \\"Feels is an excellent record, one that, despite a more conventional approach, happens to get better over time.\\" AllMusic critic John Bush said, \\"The group sounds freer than ever before, almost as though they've never bothered with rock in their lives, and have only happened upon a bare few LPs before beginning their recording career.\\" The Guardians Betty Clarke wrote, \\"Swapping campfire cosiness for expansive joy, they sound so accomplished the Flaming Lips comparisons fall by the wayside.\\" The album placed third in The Wires annual critics' poll.

Use of pipes was suggested by Francis Bacon in the New Atlantis (1672). The usage for telecommunications was experimented and proposed for administrative communications in 1782 by the French monk Dom Gauthey in a memorandum communicated to the Acad√©mie des Sciences. Dom Gauthey launched a subscription supported by Benjamin Franklin and other French scientists to finance further experiments but was not able to raise enough money to go ahead. The British utilitarist philosoph Jeremy Bentham proposed the inclusion of \\"conversation tubes\\" in the architecture of his Panopticon (1787, 1791, 1811) and then as military telecommunication mean (1793) and at the end as a necessary equipment in the architecture of ministries (1825). While its most common use was in intra-ship communications, the principle was also used in affluent homes and offices of the 19th century, as well as expensive automobiles, military aircraft, and even locomotives. For most purposes, the device was outmoded by the telephone and its widespread adoption. Design Le Petit Journal, 21 August 1910. French air-force ready to deter hostile advances along the eastern frontier, and equipped with intercom - two speaking tubes for full duplex send and receive. Early voicepipes consisted of two cones, of wood or metal, one end shaped to fit the speaker's mouth, connected to the other which was flared to amplify the sound (specifically to match the impedance of the tube to that of the open room). Later designs of the voicepipe inserted a removable cork-mounted whistle, which could be sounded by blowing into the tube from the other end. On naval vessels, this created a distinctive sound associated with urgent intra-ship communication on old warships. The sound of the whistle would summon the listener, who would remove the whistle and answer the call. Voice pipes could be used over distances as long as . However, very long speaking tubes might use an electrical signalling device to indicate a call, as the large volume of air in the pipe would make it difficult to blow with enough pressure to sound a whistle at the far end. Despite this, a pipe with a larger internal diameter was desirable for longer runs as the signal loss is inversely proportional to the pipe's cross-sectional area. Voicepipes have no switching mechanism and so, to provide multiple destinations, separate voicepipes with dedicated transit pipes have to be provided between all pairs of desired endpoints. The technology continues to be used into the electronic age due to its reliability and low cost. Voice pipes are unaffected by a complete electrical power loss or by an electromagnetic pulse. Warships built as late as the 1950s continued to incorporate voicepipes alongside more advanced technology. Maritime use British warship officer with mounted binoculars and two speaking tubes Voice pipes, the maritime term, served to transmit reports from lookout positions aloft to the deck and from the bridge to the steering position and engine room. These were somewhat larger in diameter than the domestic version and were often covered in sound absorbent material to increase their efficiency. Copper voice pipes were being fitted to British two and three-deck warships as early as 1803. A notable use was on board HMS Victory at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Victory's ship's wheel was shot away early in the battle. A voice tube was then used to carry steering orders from the quarterdeck down three decks, to where a gang of sailors operated the ship's tiller directly using ropes and pulleys. One disadvantage of voice pipes is that they may breach the integrity of watertight spaces. This led to the introduction of shut-off valves on both ends of voicepipes to prevent water from a flooded compartment from entering other compartments via its voicepipes. Permanently fitted, rigid voice pipes are still in use and are generally covered with heavy lids to avoid ingress of water. The speaker has to place his mouth in the \\"horn\\" or bell-shaped end of the pipe and the receiver has to 'bend an ear' to hear what is being said. Voice pipes have generally been replaced by sound powered telephones. The speaking tubes on naval ships are used when they are in \\"clam\\" mode instead of telephones for electronic stealth. Domestic use An office in 1903, showing speaking tubes hanging on the end of a desk Domestic speaking tube on the sidewalk end. Brussels,(2014) Caption is Please listen to the voice-carrier. In domestic applications, voicepipes were smaller and referred to as \\"speaking tubes\\". The ends of the tube were often flexible for convenience of use. The speaking tube supplemented the array of remotely controlled hand bells that were operated in the upstairs rooms and rang in the servant's quarters in even modest houses in the 19th century. The phrase \\"get on the horn\\" and \\"give him a blow\\" as well as the use of \\"blower\\" as a synonym for \\"telephone\\" are generally accepted as having their origin in this feature of speaking tubes. Speaking tubes were employed in some offices, with whistles at either end and were therefore also known as whistling tubes.http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/w/a/r/Silas-j- Ward/BOOK-0001/0003-0010.html Several speaking tubes could be hung from the edge of a desk to communicate with different locations. Speaking tubes were also used in fine automobiles such as the 1927 Rolls Royce Phantom, allowing communication between the separate passenger and driver's compartments when desired. Gosport tube A 'Gosport Tube' was a voice tube used by flight instructors in the early days of military aviation to give instructions and directions to their students. It was invented by flying instructor Robert Raymond Smith-Barry at the School of Special Flying he opened at Gosport in 1917.Vincent Orange, \\"Barry, Robert Raymond Smith- (1886‚Äì1949)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 12 September 2007 Modern usage Acoustic tube headphones (also called pneumatic earphones or air earphones) are used especially in two-way radio. These are useful because a clear tube can be used to hide the earphones. They are also sometimes used for the microphone on telephonists headsets and to provide music to patients undergoing an MRI scan, as it would be dangerous to use metal wiring in the scanner's magnetic field. In Europe, they were installed on the wards of hospitals for a time where the patient's 'radio' was built into the nurse call and lighting control unit. This unit contains an electromagnetic conventional speaker but from there to the patients ears was by tube - presumably so that the part contacting the patient could be easily cleaned. These systems are still in use. Pneumatic intercoms can be applied to motorcycle helmets for pilot-passenger communication. Similar systems are common on ultralight aviation too. They are sometimes preferred over bluetooth or other radio technologies due to their simplicity and absence of batteries. Up to the 2000s acoustic tubes were in use in some civil aircraft for movies, audio and other audio broadcasting in-flight entertainment. The principle of the speaking tube can be found on certain playground equipment, which employs tubing connecting sound horns or other speaking boxes to allow voices to travel to separate points, for the amusement of the children.

Open rescue involves rescuing animals in pain and suffering, giving the rescued animals veterinary treatment and long-term care, documenting the living conditions, and ultimately publicly releasing the rescue and documentation. Open rescue's public nature contrasts with clandestine animal rights activism. Open rescue activists typically publish their full identities. Open rescue is nonviolent towards humans and other animals, although some groups practice property damage. History = Beginnings = The open rescue method was largely developed by Animal Liberation Victoria (ALV) Rescue Team, based in Melbourne.Rescate abierto de animales Equanimal (in Spanish)Qu√© son los rescates abiertos - Rescate Abierto Animal Equality (in Spanish) Inspired by satyagraha, the method and philosophy used by Mahatma Gandhi in the struggle for independence for India, the ALV developed this method in the 1980s and has since been conducting investigations and open rescue operations, actions which reportedly have been well received by the public. At one point an Australian MP joined in the rescue operation of factory farmed piglets.About Open Rescue openrescue.org While not called open rescue, several other activist groups began engaging in activities similar to open rescue around the same time. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals rescued several monkeys in 1981 from a lab in Silver Spring, Maryland and sparked discussion in The Washington Post. = Introduction to United States = In 1999, Patty Mark of the ALV presented open rescue at United Poultry Concern's Direct Action for Animals Conference. Displaying the positive results of the open rescue actions in Australia and by comparing videos from an open rescue action and a clandestine action, she managed to convince a number of people of the usefulness of open rescue both on the grounds of compassions for animals and on the grounds of the reception by the general public, opening for the open rescue method on the international arena. Soon after this, Compassionate Action for Animals (US) adopted the method, and other organizations followed. Activist Adam Durand with Compassionate Consumers conducted an open rescues at a Wegmans' egg farm in 2004. The Animal Protection and Rescue League conducted an open rescue and investigation at a Hudson Valley foie gras farm in 2011. = U.S. Revival and International Growth = In the United States, open rescue became less common and came to a halt for ten years in the mid-2000s until Direct Action Everywhere released an investigation of a \\"Certified Humane\\" cage-free Whole Foods egg supplier in January 2015. There have since been over a dozen open rescues in several different locations in North America. Direct Action Everywhere's open rescues in The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and elsewhere have put pressure on several Whole Foods suppliers. A DxE investigation at a cage-free Costco egg supplier raised questions about an industry-wide shift in 2016 toward cage-free eggs. DxE centers its investigations around \\"humanewashing,\\" or the alleged attempt by animal food companies to falsely market products as humane. In 2017, DxE sued Whole Foods turkey supplier Diestel Turkey Ranch under California's false advertising laws. Currently, openrescue.org, a network for organisations practising open rescue, lists 18 different open rescue organisations, with varying level of activity, in five different countries on three continents - Australia and New Zealand (Oceania), Austria, Germany, The Czech Republic and Sweden (Europe) and United States (North America).Rescue Archives openrescue.org A number of organizations, including Animal Liberation Victoria, Direct Action Everywhere, Tomma burar, Tierretter.de, VGT, and Animal Rights have begun coordinating an \\"international open rescue day\\" on March 5 launched on the website openrescues.com. Criminality Some practitioners of open rescue claim to not be guilty of any crime, claiming to have acted in defense of others, especially if the rescued animals have not been kept in accordance with laws regulating animal husbandry. Similarly, others cite the disregard of the owner's violations of such laws as sufficient justification, and point out the hypocrisy of the strict enforcement of the law against open rescue activists. Majja Carlsson of R√§ddningstj√§nsten The Rescue Service, a Swedish open rescue organisation, was one of four activists that rescued 120 hens in the largest open rescue operation to date. In her description of the action, she writes the following (translated from Swedish): :Quite possibly legal ramifications will follow this action. Naturally, I realize that some will label this as a crime even though I disagree with them. It is sad that we are the ones considered criminals in this society, and not the egg industry which has in fact violated the Swedish Animal Protection Act for over fifteen years. That the law intended to protect the animals is widely ignored while crimes against the right of ownership are seen as serious offences.Majja Carlsson‚Äôs Story of the Action The Rescue Service Similarly, R√§ddningstj√§nsten writes in a comment to the legal proceedings that followed the action (translated from Swedish) \\"We acted and saved 120 individuals from unnecessary suffering and certain premature death. [...] The real crimes are not committed by us, but by the animal industry.\\"Action 16 Indicted The Rescue Service Arguments for open rescue Open rescue \\"puts a face on animal liberation\\". By being open, proponents claim that they get a more positive response from the media and the general population, and that by not wearing masks they reduce the distance between themselves and the public, they become a normal everyday person whom the public can identify with and not an abstract masked \\"terrorist\\". Being open removes or tones down the militant edge of direct actions. Open rescue proponents also claim that their method of operation is conducive to their compassion for the rescued animals. One of the things reportedly shown by the video comparison at the aforementioned United Poultry Concern's forum on Direct Actions was that the open rescue activist displayed more compassion and care for the animals compared to the clandestine activists (which is not to say that the clandestine activists did not display compassion and care). Whether this is due to that the operations are unmasked, that the operations are open or some other quality is still open for argument. Criticism One can divide the criticism against open rescue into two general categories: Criticism against open rescue as a method of direct action, which often comes from other practitioners of direct action, and criticism of the use of direct action, which can come both from other animal rights activists and from outside the animal rights movements. =Criticism against open rescue as a method of direct action= It has been argued that because open rescue virtually guarantees that the activists will be found and convicted due to the publication of their identities, open rescue can be construed as a more resource-demanding method compared to clandestine methods. According to this, open rescue would allegedly require more money, as the resulting convictions following the actions means that fines have to be paid and damages have to be compensated. In addition, more manpower could be needed as the activists could be imprisoned. This is seen as a waste of resources and people which could be used to rescue even more animals. However, all these claims have resulted to be wrong in practice. In part because of the sympathies that open rescuers gain from the public, legal actions against them are uncommon, even if the identities of the rescuers is known. It is also argued that open rescue is not a reasonable alternative for everyone. Some activists are on probation, and being sentenced for another crime could mean that their previous sentences would be transformed to jail time. It might be argued as well that some activists have or will have careers which require the lack of a criminal record, careers or dreams which would effectively be over if they used the open rescue method, and regardless for most professions and careers a criminal record - in particular an extensive one - will be a hindrance both in regards to getting employed and getting promotions. This, however, would apply in the case of any kind of illegal action. =Defending open rescues over rescues in which the identity of the rescuers is hidden= Defenders of open rescues claim that when activists do not hide their faces their actions are much better received by the public, thus being able to be much more successful in achieving their aim of questioning the public's speciesist attitudes. Some who are not involved in animal rights activism but sympathise with the goal of animal rights may have other reasons to defend open rescues, though this is extremely uncommon among animal rights activists, and those involved in open rescues do not support them. Some people consider direct actions to be counter-productive. While they may sympathise with the activists and what they wish to achieve, they think that the groups should abide the laws and by extension the democratic system that they live in. It is argued that the activists have a democratic and civic responsibility to operate within the confines of the law and that to do otherwise would be undemocratic, possibly even tyrannical. A common response to this criticism, made by both proponents of open rescues and other kinds of rescues, is that the argument suffers a fundamental flaw: We live in a democracy, but it is a democracy of man, for man, by man.

It is also applied in pharmacology, when choosing a drug to treat a specific disease you want the drug to reach the disease. It is applicable to any process of diagnosis, e.g. debugging computer programs. Computer-aided diagnosis provides a statistical and quantitative approach. A more thorough analysis will consider the false positive rate of the test and the possibility that a less likely diagnosis might have more serious consequences. A competing principle is the idea of performing simple tests before more complex and expensive tests, moving from bedside tests to blood results and simple imaging such as ultrasound and then more complex such as MRI then specialty imaging. The law can also be applied in prioritizing tests when resources are limited, so a test for a treatable condition should be performed before an equally probable but less treatable condition.

The Pact was a written guarantee that the signing parties would respect future election results, prevent single-party hegemony, cooperate to fight dictators, share political power, and divide oil wealth amongst themselves. The Pact is credited with undergirding democracy in Venezuela, and inaugurating the most stable period in the history of Venezuela's republics, known as the Puntofijismo. While the Pact provided a strong foundation for future democratic development, it was increasingly criticized for starting a corrupt duopoly by AD and COPEI, and it ultimately collapsed by the 1998 Venezuelan presidential election of Hugo Ch√°vez.  Background  On January 23, 1958, President of Venezuela and de facto dictator Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez fled Venezuela for the Dominican Republic, and a group of military leaders took control of the country. The regime of P√©rez Jim√©nez had relied heavily on oil revenues to pay for a massive urbanization and modernization campaign in the cities of Venezuela, and the United States had supported the government of Venezuela because it was a reliable oil source. Following P√©rez Jim√©nez's ouster, three of the four major parties in the country ‚Äî COPEI, AD, and URD ‚Äî came together to ensure a lasting democracy in Venezuela, which had not had stable democracy for all of its history since gaining independence in 1830. Notably, the PCV (Communist Party of Venezuela) was not included in this collaboration. The parties were aware that if one of them disputed the results of the upcoming election, it would seriously damage the country's fledgling democracy, given the economic instability and volatility that had resulted from declining oil prices and the post-coup atmosphere. The Pact was a solution for the parties to ensure cooperation and compliance with election results, allowing for a peaceful transition to democracy.  Signing and results  Table where the Puntofijo Pact was signed. The Pact was signed in, and named after, the residence of COPEI leader Rafael Caldera in Caracas, by representatives for the three parties. Its adherents claimed the Pact was aimed at preserving Venezuelan democracy by respecting elections, having the winners of the elections consider including members of the signing parties and others in positions of power in bids for national unity governments, and having a basic shared program of government. They guaranteed, for example, the continuation of obligatory military service, improved salaries, housing, and equipment for the military, and, perhaps most importantly, amnesty from prosecution for crimes committed during the P√©rez Jim√©nez dictatorship. Three members of each party signed the Pact. These delegations were led by R√≥mulo Betancourt of AD, Rafael Caldera of COPEI, and J√≥vito Villalba of URD. Betancourt, Caldera, and AD signatory Ra√∫l Leoni would all go on to become President of Venezuela. In the short-term, the Pact served to immediately deepen democracy in the region as it successfully ensured an uncontested democratic election of Betancourt later that year. In the long-term, however, the Pact bound the parties to limit Venezuela's political system to an exclusive competition between the signing parties, limiting the democratic improvement over the P√©rez Jim√©nez regime that could have happened. The agreed rules of the Pact ensured that no matter which party won the Presidency, the others would share in power. The result was permanent coalition-style government that effectively centered power in the hands of COPEI and AD (URD leaving the Pact in 1962). Moreover, it led to future democratic erosion as COPEI and AD became increasingly corrupt, relying on oil revenues to bribe political opponents and assure their dominance over Venezuelan politics. This system would disparagingly be called \\"partyarchy\\" by critics, among them Hugo Ch√°vez.  Opposition  Initially, there was little opposition to the Puntofijo Pact aside from journalists and leftists, who objected to the Pact's exclusion of the Communist Party of Venezuela (PCV). They viewed the exclusion as denial of any leftist participation or the more radical reforms they had hoped for when P√©rez Jim√©nez was ousted. In 1962, URD left the Pact in protest of Cuba's removal from the Organization of American States (due to its Communist government). Later, opposition to the Pact widened to more sectors of society. Criticism focused on the Pact's power-sharing agreement between the two main political parties (COPEI and AD). Citizens, intellectuals, journalists, and the media demanded reform of the entire political system to fit Venezuela's growing democratic society. More open opposition to the Pact emerged in the late 1980s. One of the first indicators of serious public discontent was the 1989 Caracazo, deadly riots in the capital city of Caracas due to government increases in prices of public transportation and gas. The 1993 presidential election brought a decisive and surprising break from the Pact: the founder of COPEI and signatory of the Pact, Rafael Caldera, was elected President for a second term under a new party, Convergencia.  Deterioration  The system of patronage and duopoly of power constructed by the Puntofijo Pact deteriorated in the 1980s when oil revenues, a key component of the Pact's success, took a sharp decline. This was important to the Pact's downfall due to the nature of the 1961 Constitution of Venezuela. The Constitution had originally been designed by AD and COPEI, and was crafted in order to maximize the political benefits of the Puntofijo Pact. The resulting constitutional design gave the Presidency highly concentrated powers. According to Julia Buxton, the Constitution of 1961 gave the Presidency control over \\"the nation's defense, the monetary system, all tax and tariff policy, the exploitation of subsoil rights, the management of foreign affairs, and a variety of other powers. It had the authority to name all cabinet ministers, state governors, and state enterprise officials.\\" Since the Pact gave AD and COPEI exclusive access to oil revenues, which were used to buy out potential political opponents, the Presidency (and thus many powers of the Venezuelan government) would always be won by AD and COPEI nominees. The exclusiveness of the Pact was most obvious in the exclusion of the Communist Party of Venezuela (PCV) from the Pact itself. This status quo was interrupted when oil revenues sharply declined in the 1980s. Without the ability to buy out political rivals, the AD-COPEI duopoly began using violence to maintain its dominance, initiating a pattern of escalating violence with the populace. Among this violence was the 1989 Caracazo, where government agents engaged in extrajudicial killings and \\"disappearances\\" of citizens. Events reached a fever pitch with the 1992 coup attempts, where Hugo Ch√°vez unsuccessfully attempted to forcefully overthrow the democratic government, then led by President and AD member Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez.  Under Ch√°vez  The Pact of Puntofijo was ultimately invalidated forty years after its creation as Hugo Ch√°vez sought the presidency. The Pact was already irreversibly damaged by the earlier 1993 election of Rafael Caldera under a third party, but the 1998 Venezuelan presidential election effectively ended it. Ch√°vez promised in his presidential campaign that he would eliminate the old system and open up political power to independents and third parties. He ran on a platform of condemning the acts of AD and COPEI, and their duopoly of power, known as \\"partyarchy,\\" considering the Pact to be \\"synonymous with elitist rule\\". As he argued, the Pact of Puntofijo had institutionalized a system of patronage that allowed AD and COPEI to embed themselves in the political system of Venezuela. Ch√°vez believed the duopoly had created a government that no longer reflected its citizens, and that the two parties had prevented democratic political participation. Increasing public distrust of the political parties led to a referendum prohibiting parties from participating in the 1999 presidential election entirely. This inherently strengthened Ch√°vez‚Äôs anti-establishment rise to power. Citizens themselves offered overwhelming support for the break from the Puntofijismo, handing Ch√°vez the election victory over an establishment-backed opponent by a 16-point margin.  Similar pacts  Puntofijo bore a resemblance to the Turno Pac√≠fico of the restored Spanish monarchy between 1876 and 1923, in which Conservative and Liberal Parties alternated in power. More contemporaneously, the 1957 Miami Pact signed in Cuba was similar to Puntofijo. It was also a political agreement between parties that was designed to confront dictatorship (Fulgencio Batista's regime in Cuba), uphold democracy, and invite political participation. However, the Miami Pact ultimately failed to deepen democracy due to struggles in the alliance between the signers, rather than the citizenry like in Puntofijo. The 1956 Colombian National Front was another contemporary agreement.

Originally incorporated by investors from Cleveland and patterned after New York's Coney Island, the park was managed by William R. Ryan, Sr., who ran the park with featured attractions including vaudeville acts, concerts, gambling, a beer garden, and sideshows as well as a few early amusement rides. In 1899, Lee Holtzman became Euclid Beach's new manager. Later that same year, as reported in a Cleveland newspaper, Euclid Beach Park had failed. Former management was faced with the loss of more than half their investment if they sold the land for building development, and it was established that the original Euclid Beach Park Company was losing $20,000 a season. Dudley S. Humphrey, Jr. led six members of his family in undertaking management of the park as of 1901 (they had previously operated concessions at the park, but had been unhappy with the way Ryan ran it), leasing the park for five years at $12,000 a year. They expanded the beach and bathing facilities, including adding a lakeside swing, added many new attractions, and advertised to locals with the slogan, \\"one fare, free gate and no beer\\".Van Tassel, David D. and John J. Grabowski, eds. The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History 2nd ed. Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 1996. Designed to be a family-friendly park, the Humphreys would not admit anyone who had consumed intoxicating beverages at a bar directly across the street from the entrance to the park. Signs throughout the park instructed that only children were permitted to wear shorts, because the Humphreys thought that proper dress would promote a family-friendly atmosphere. At one point the park advertised that it would \\"present nothing that would demoralize or depress,\\" and that visitors would \\"never be exposed to undesirable people\\",Francis, David & Diane. Cleveland Amusement Park Memories , Gray and Company (2004). including African Americans. In August 1910, the park was the site of an exhibition flight by aviator Glenn Curtiss from Euclid Beach to Cedar Point and back. Rides and attractions Euclid Beach Park was built abutting a beach on Lake Erie, which was part of the attraction, and, for a time, a principal part of the Park's attraction. An early addition to the park was its dance hall. After the Humphreys acquired the park, many more attractions were made part of Euclid Beach. =The Euclid Beach carousel= Euclid Beach and the bath house, circa 1905 The first carousel to be installed at Euclid Beach Park was the Philadelphia Toboggan Company Carousel Number 9 design. It debuted in 1905; in 1910, it was replaced by Philadelphia Toboggan Company Carousel Number 19. This carousel had fifty eight horses and two chariots, which were decorated with leaf carvings surrounding a Greek god and two cherubs. The chariots retained these classic designs when the carousel's other decorations were replaced with ones having an art deco motif. After Euclid Beach Park ceased operation, this carousel was sold and moved to Palace Playland in Old Orchard Beach, Maine, where it operated until 1996. In 1997, the Euclid Beach Park Nuts (today called Euclid Beach Park Now) and the Trust for Public Land partnered to acquire the carousel and bring it back to Cleveland. On June 30, 2010, the Western Reserve Historical Society (WRHS), which owns the carousel horses, chariots, and mechanism, announced a collaboration with Cleveland's Euclid Beach Park Carousel Society and Euclid Beach Park Now to restore, reassemble, and operate the carousel at the Historical Society's location in University Circle. The plan envisions a $6 million fund-raising campaign to pay for the project, including the construction of a pavilion to house the restored ride, and provide an endowment to ensure its operation into the future. Since that time, the Euclid Beach Carousel Society entered into a contract with a firm which designs and builds new wooden carousels as well as restores old carousels. The Carousel Works of Mansfield, Ohio was given the task of coming as close as possible to restoring the ride to its original appearance and function, a process which was found to essentially require the remanufacturing of the ride because of damage said to have occurred during the transport of the components from Maine back to Cleveland. On Tuesday, April 17, 2012 the WRHS broke ground for the construction of a glass pavilion to house the restored and reassembled carousel. The carousel reopened to the public on November 23, 2014. =Roller coasters= A picture of Euclid Beach Park taken some time between 1895 and 1910 Seven roller coasters operated at Euclid Beach in the history of the park. All were wood coasters. The first roller coaster, the Switchback Railway, debuted in 1896 and closed in 1904. It was built by LaMarcus A. Thompson. The Switchback Railway was followed by the Figure Eight (1904‚Äî1909, designed by Henry B. Auchy and built by Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters) and the Scenic Railway, the second coaster to be built by Thompson (1907‚Äî1937). In 1909, John A. Miller premiered his first coaster at the park, the New Velvet Coaster (later renamed Aero Dips), which operated until 1965. He also designed the Derby Racer, later renamed Racing Coaster, which was built by Frederick Ingersoll and debuted in 1913 to much fanfare. It was featured in a Plain Dealer advertisement published on May 30, 1913, and survived until the close of the park in 1969. Racing Coaster only featured one track which formed a M√∂bius loop, where both coaster trains would begin on one side of the station and return on the opposite side. The Thriller was designed by Herbert Paul Schmeck and Howard Stoneback. Also built by Philadelphia Toboggan Company, the ride premiered in 1924 and survived until the park's closure. The Thriller featured an \\"out and back\\" track design and cost $90,000 to build. The Flying Turns The Flying Turns was the name of a roller coaster at Euclid Beach Park, but it was also the name for a type of roller coaster. John Norman Bartlett, a British aviator in World War I, came to North America after the war with an idea for a trackless wooden chute, full of twists like a bobsled course, with toboggan-like cars. He filed a patent for the idea in 1926. Bartlett met John Miller in 1928, and they commenced building the new ride. When the ride went into production, much of the idea was the same, but the cars looked more like monoplanes, which Bartlett designed. Miller worked on the loading station, supporting structure, braking system and incline. The first Flying Turns ride was built and operated at Lakeside Park in Dayton, Ohio. The Flying Turns at Euclid Beach Park was the second to be built (there would later be a half-dozen more, including one at Coney Island). It was also the tallest, and the Park's version used three-car trains. Couples enjoyed the ride because one rider could sit in the other's lap. \\"At Euclid Beach on the Flying Turns I'll bet you can't keep her smilin'\\" is a line from the Beach Boys' song \\"Amusement Parks U.S.A.\\" (from their 1965 album Summer Days (and Summer Nights!!)). The Euclid Beach Park riot By around 1915, Euclid Beach Park would only admit African Americans on certain days as part of its efforts to promote what its management saw as a family-friendly atmosphere. On the other days, the park's special police enforcement team would see to the exclusion of blacks entirely. On the days when blacks were allowed into the park, they were not permitted to interact with white park-goers. A series of protests occurred at Euclid Beach Park in 1946. On July 21, 1946, twenty people from American Youth for Democracy, United Negroes and Allied Veterans of America, and the National Negro Congress visited the park as an interracial group. They were evicted after a park policeman told them that it was park policy that there be \\"no sitting, no talking, no mixing of any kind... between the races.\\" Subsequently, Euclid Beach Park was picketed on several occasions by these and other organizations. On August 23, 1946, twelve members of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), another interracial group, attempted to visit the park, but were also ejected by park police. Albert T. Luster, an African-American man who had gone to the park to meet the CORE group but never actually met with its members, was later beaten by a park policeman. CORE continued to fight the segregation policy. A six-member interracial group from CORE visited the park on September 21, 1946, and were again removed from the park by the park police. However, on this occasion two off-duty Cleveland policemen, Lynn Coleman and Henry MacKey, both African-American, intervened and a fight broke out between the city police and the park police. In the scuffle, Coleman was shot in the leg with his own gun. After this incident, the park closed a week early, per the Mayor's request. Decline, closure, and legacy Euclid Beach Park Gateway Arch By the 1960s, Euclid Beach was beginning to face financial problems. In 1965, the park took two drastic measures in order to stay open. The Aero Dips roller coaster, which was the oldest in the park, was demolished. The Great American Racing Derby was also sold to Cedar Point that year. These actions were not enough to keep the park afloat. Euclid Beach Park closed forever in September 1969, after the summer season. It was one of many aging parks from another era which closed during the 1960s. Forest Park Highlands in St. Louis burned down in 1963 never to be rebuilt, New Jersey's Olympic Park closed in 1965 due to blight. Riverview Park of Illinois shut down in 1967 due largely to operating and maintenance costs.Riverview Park - Chicago, Illinois, accessed 21 May 2012 Some rides or other attractions were placed in operation at other locations.

This process was also used in constructing the trailer park wall, which is still standing. The wall runs along Lakeshore Boulevard. A few original guy-wire remnants attached to the sycamore trees remain along with the loading platform for the Antique Cars, the anchor post for the Thriller coaster, and part of the path to the Flying Turns platform. The bridge for the Turnpike Cars still stands across the driveway for one of the apartment buildings built on the former west end of the Park and the remains of the supports for the Turnpike Cars center directional rail which was used on the track to keep the turnpike cars from going off of the track are also still visible. Next to the pier, of which the concrete portion is largely intact, sits an empty, circular cement pool which was once a ride. Beach-goers could sit in suspended swing seats, and be taken for rides around the pool via a motor in the pool's center. Later, the swing seat apparatus was removed, and a center fountain was put in its place. The pool is now filled in with dirt and grass. Plans are to rebuild the Pier. Perhaps the most famous of the remnants of Euclid Beach Park is the arched main gate. This archway has been declared a Cleveland landmark, and is now protected from demolition. The arch was severely damaged by a hit-and-run driver in January 2007.Summers, Dave. \\"Euclid Beach Park arch damaged\\", WKYC. 2007-01-11. On June 12, 2007, the rebuilt Arch was rededicated.

Woodpecker finches, like many other species of birds, form breeding pairs and care for young until they have fledged. The most distinctive characteristic of woodpecker finches is their ability to use tools to for foraging. This behaviour indicates that they have highly specialized cognitive abilities.

However, the density of woodpecker finches is greater in the more humid zones than in the drier ones. Woodpecker finches are also found at a variety of altitudes, from sea level to higher inland elevations. They are a not a migratory species and when they do fly, they only fly short distances.  Diet  Woodpecker finch diets mainly consist of arthropods found in and around crevices in trees. They eat both adult insects and larvae, which are often located within trees and shrubs. Their habit of pecking at branches is similar to a woodpecker's drumming on a tree trunk. Wood-boring beetle larvae are a staple of their diet. They also often feed on moths, caterpillars and crickets. Another significant part of their diet includes fruit and seeds, making woodpecker finches important dispersers.  Foraging behaviour  One of the most distinguishable traits of Camarhynchus pallidus which has caused it to gain fame, is its ability to use a twig, stick, or cactus spine as a tool. This behaviour earned it the nicknames tool-using finch, and carpenter finch. The tool is used as compensation for its short tongue. The finch manipulates the tool to dislodge invertebrate prey, such as grubs, from crevices in trees. It has been hypothesized that woodpecker finches filled a niche, similar to that of woodpeckers, on the Galapagos Islands. Woodpeckers have strong bills for drilling and drumming on trees, as well as long sticky tongues for extracting food. On the isolated Galapagos islands, without competition from South American woodpecker species, the woodpecker finch was able to adapt, and evolve its tool-utilizing capability to compensate for its short tongue. The ability to use tools is a highly specialized cognitive ability as it involves the animal creating and recognizing a relationship between two foreign objects found in its environment. Woodpecker Finch (Camarhynchus pallidus). Woodpecker finches are capable of using a variety of materials to construct the tools they use. They are capable of modifying the tools they find in order to maximize their efficiency. Scientists have observed finches shortening the length of sticks or cactus spines in order to make them more manageable for tool use. The same tool can be used multiple times and on different trees. Woodpecker finches may also try various sticks or spines at one site before finding one that can reach and extract the prey item. There is conflicting evidence of whether or not this behaviour was acquired through social learning, as juveniles have been observed using tools without previous contact with adults. In contrast, juvenile woodpecker finches have also been observed utilizing novel tools made from non-native plant species, such as blackberry bushes. After observing adult woodpecker finches prep barbed twigs and use them to obtain prey from crevices in trees, juvenile finches displayed the same behaviour with the novel tool. These observations contrasted previous studies to show that social learning may occur in wild woodpecker finch populations. The frequency of tool use by woodpecker finches depends largely on whether they live in a more wet or dry environment. Woodpecker finches that live in more wet environments seldom use tools as prey is much more abundant. In contrast, they employ tool use much more when living in dry areas. During the dry season, woodpecker finches use tools while foraging to acquire up to 50% of their prey. The use of tools has allowed woodpecker finches to be able to obtain prey that they would otherwise be unable to reach with their short tongues. It is thought that this behaviour came to evolve due to the harshness of the dry and unstable environmental conditions of the Galapagos Islands.  Reproduction  There are no morphological differences between either sex in woodpecker finches, as they are monomorphic. Woodpecker finches mainly use moss, lichens, and grass as building materials for their nests. During the 2 week incubation period when females are sitting on the eggs, males linger nearby, often feeding the females. Female woodpecker finches typically lay around 2-3 eggs. Both males and females participate in the feeding of the chicks from the day they hatch until well after they have become independent. Woodpecker finch chicks will fledge around 2 weeks after hatching.

Early life Born on 20 August 1871 at Ifield, Goulburn, New South Wales,Sydney Long, Australian Dictionary of Biography. Sydney Long began formal art classes at the New South Wales Art Society in 1890. In 1894 his Heidelberg School-influenced painting, a bathing scene set on the Cooks River By Tranquil Waters (1894) caused a small scandal, but was purchased by the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Career The sale brought Long to the attention of Julian Ashton, a Trustee of the Gallery and founder of the influential Julian Ashton Art School (at that time called the Sydney Art School), and in 1907 he became Ashton's second-in-command in the school. In 1898 he was briefly engaged to Thea Proctor. In 1910 he moved to London, where he learned etching and became an associate of the Royal Society of Painters, Etchers and Engravers. He returned to Australia in 1921 and helped found the Australian Painters, Etchers and Engravers Society, lived in England for the period 1922‚Äì1925, then returned once more to Australia, becoming President of the Society. From 1933 to 1949 he was a Trustee of the Art Gallery of New South Wales. He won the Wynne Prize twice; in 1938 for The Approaching Storm, and in 1940 for The Lake, Narrabeen. He remained a director of the Society for many years, as well as remaining an active art teacher. In 1952 he returned once again to England. Style NGA QAG While influenced by the Heidelberg School, Long's first successful painting, By Tranquil Waters (1894), shows a markedly different engagement with the Australian scene: where Heidelberg artists such as Arthur Streeton and Frederick McCubbin showed the Bush as a place of work and struggle (and occasional sentimentality), Long's painting of young naked bathers is hedonistic and charged with low-key eroticism ‚Äî the eroticism, rather than the nudity per se, was the cause of the scandal. After 1895 Long moved even further from the Heidelberg School's approach to the Australian landscape (a fusion of Victorian genre painting and a Barbizon-like plein air informal realism), seeking instead to achieve \\"soulful and graceful evocations of the spirit of the land, as did the Greeks and their beautiful myths.\\" In practice this resulted in a new school of Australian Paganism, reflected in the literature of the period as much as in the art, and counting among its practitioners Lionel Lindsay and his brother Norman. Hawkesbury Landscape (ca. 1928). Art Gallery of South Australia. Long's greatest triumph in this style was The Spirit of the Plains (1897), using the flowing patterns and pastel colours of Art Nouveau to create a poetic vision of the Australian bush as the incongruous setting for a naked Grecian wood-nymph leading a procession of dancing brolgas. \\"Synthesising shimmering visual form, mythological subject and musical allusion Long established his vision of landscape as a dream-like, poetic formulation.\\" Another example of this style is his work depicting the mythological god Pan (1898) which was purchased by the Art Gallery of New South Wales.http://artabase.net/exhibition/1036-sydney- long These works painted after 1897 were extremely popular, and provided the money to allow him to fulfill his dream of studying in London after 1910. He studied printmaking at the Central School of Arts and Crafts and was taught etching by Frank Emanuel and Malcolm Osborne. His post-1910 work retained only the faintest lingerings of the earlier Australian poetic landscapes. There is an excellence in etchings which can be found in 'Young Kookaburras' 1925, examples of which are located at the Art Gallery of New South Wales and a private collection in Doreen, Victoria.

CAPB is available as a viscous pale yellow solution and it is used as a surfactant in personal care products. The name reflects that the major part of the molecule, the lauric acid group, is derived from coconut oil. Cocamidopropyl betaine to a significant degree has replaced cocamide DEA. Production Despite the name cocamidopropyl betaine, the molecule is not synthesized from betaine. Instead it is produced in a two step manner, beginning with the reaction of dimethylaminopropylamine (DMAPA) with fatty acids from coconut or palm kernel oil (lauric acid, or its methyl ester, is the main constituent). The primary amine in DMAPA is more reactive than the tertiary amine, leading to its selective addition to form an amide. In the second step chloroacetic acid reacts with the remaining tertiary amine to form a quaternary ammonium center (a quaternization reaction). :CH3(CH2)10COOH + H2NCH2CH2CH2N(CH3)2 ‚Üí CH3(CH2)10CONHCH2CH2CH2N(CH3)2 :CH3(CH2)10CONHCH2CH2CH2N(CH3)2 \\\\+ ClCH2CO2H + NaOH ‚Üí CH3(CH2)10CONHCH2CH2CH2N+(CH3)2CH2CO2‚àí \\\\+ NaCl + H2O Chemistry CAPB is a fatty acid amide containing a long hydrocarbon chain at one end and a polar group at the other. This allows CAPB to act as a surfactant and as a detergent. It is a zwitterion, consisting of both a quaternary ammonium cation and a carboxylate.  Specifications and properties Cocamidopropyl betaine is used as a foam booster in shampoos. It is a medium-strength surfactant also used in bath products like hand soaps. It is also used in cosmetics as an emulsifying agent and thickener, and to reduce irritation purely ionic surfactants would cause. It also serves as an antistatic agent in hair conditioners, which most often does not irritate skin or mucous membranes. However, some studies indicate it is an allergen. CAPB is obtained as an aqueous solution in concentrations of about 30%. Typical impurities of leading manufacturers today: *Sodium monochloroacetate < 5 ppm *Amidoamine (AA) < 0.3% *Dimethylaminopropylamine (DMAPA) < 15 ppm *Glycerol < 3% The impurities AA and DMAPA are most critical, as they have been shown to be responsible for skin sensitization reactions. These by-products can be avoided by a moderate excess chloroacetate and the exact adjustment of pH value during betainization reaction accompanied by regular analytical control.  Niche Uses  CAPB is also used as a co-surfactant with Sodium dodecyl sulfate for promoting the formation of gas hydrates. CAPB, as an additive, helps in scale-up the gas hydrates formation process.  Safety  CAPB has been claimed to cause allergic reactions in some users, but a controlled pilot study has found that these cases may represent irritant reactions rather than true allergic reactions. Furthermore, results of human studies have shown that CAPB has a low sensitizing potential if impurities with amidoamine (AA) and dimethylaminopropylamine (DMAPA) are low and tightly controlled. Other studies have concluded that most apparent allergic reactions to CAPB are more likely due to amidoamine.

The son of John Glas, the divine, Glas was born at Dundee in 1725, and is said to have been brought up as a surgeon. He obtained command of a ship which traded between Brazil, the northwest coasts of Africa and the Canary Islands. During his voyages he discovered on the Western Sahara seaboard a river navigable for some distance inland, and here he proposed to found a trading station. The exact spot is not known with certainty, but it is plausibly identified with Gueder, possibly the haven where the Spaniards had in the 15th and 16th centuries a fort called Santa Cruz de Mar Peque√±a. Glas made an arrangement with the Lords of Trade whereby he was granted ¬£15,000 if he obtained free cession of the port he had discovered to the British crown; the proposal was to be laid before Parliament in the session of 1765. Having chartered a vessel, Glas, with his wife and daughter, sailed for Africa in 1764, reached his destination and made a treaty with the Moors of the district. He named his settlement Port Hillsborough, after Wills Hill, earl of Hillsborough (afterwards marquis of Downshire), president of the Board of Trade and Plantations (1763‚Äì1765). In November 1764, Glas and some companions, leaving his ship behind, went in the longboat to Lanzarote, intending to buy a small barque suitable for the navigation of the river on which was his settlement. From Lanzarote he forwarded to London the treaty he had concluded for the acquisition of Port Hillsborough. A few days later he was seized by the Spaniards, taken to Tenerife and imprisoned at Santa Cruz de Tenerife. In a letter to the Lords of Trade from Teneriffe, dated 15 December 1764, Glas said he believed the reason for his detention was the jealousy of the Spaniards at the settlement at Port Hillsborough because in a time of war the English might ruin their fishery and effectually stop the whole commerce of the Canary Islands. The Spaniards further looked upon the settlement as a step towards the conquest of the islands. They therefore contrived how to make out a claim to the port and forged old manuscripts to prove their assertion (Calendar of Home Office Papers, 1760-1765). In March 1765 the ships company at Port Hillsborough was attacked by the natives and several members of it killed. The survivors, including Mrs and Miss Glas, escaped to Tenerife. In October following, through the representations of the British government, Glas was released from prison. With his wife and child he set sail for England on board the barque Earl of Sandwich. On 30 November British mariners George Gidley, Richard St. Quinton, Peter McKinlie and a Dutchman Andres Lukerman, http://www.dippam.ac.uk/ied/records/20862.transcriptwho had learned that the ship contained much treasure, mutinied, killing the captain and passengers. Glas was stabbed to death, and his wife and daughter thrown overboard. (The murderers were afterwards captured and hanged at Dublin.) There is some evidence to suggest that R.S. Stevenson based his novel ‚ÄòTreasure Island‚Äô in part on the murders of the Glas family. He grew up in the shadow of the Glasite church in Edinburgh. After the death of Glas the British Government appears to have taken no steps to carry out his project. In 1764, Glas published in London The History of the Discovery and Conquest of the Canary Islands, which he had translated from the manuscript of an Andalusian monk named Juan Abreu de Galindo, then recently discovered at La Palma. To this Glas added a description of the islands, a continuation of the history and an account of the manners, customs, trade, etc., of the inhabitants, displaying considerable knowledge of the archipelago.

Two houseboats were rented and some, but not all, of the players performed sexual acts in front of crew members. Prostitutes from Atlanta and Florida were flown in for the party, in order to perform the sex acts. There were at least ninety people on the two boats, and Smoot later estimated that there were 100 women present. An anonymous former player of the Minnesota Vikings claimed that this is not the first time that such an incident had happened. The scandal has sometimes been referred to as the Love Boat scandal after the television program, or as the Smoot Boat Scandal in the news. Allegedly, photographs were taken at the party showing people engaging in sexual intercourse. Four of the players were charged with misdemeanors related to the events. Later commentators pointed to the scandal as a key event in the history of the team, leading to firing of head coach Mike Tice, who was replaced by Brad Childress, who would lead the team to the 2009 NFC Championship Game. Incident A woman called police around 9:20 p.m. on October 6 to report that approximately \\"seven black men\\" had urinated in her yard after exiting a \\"big shuttle bus limousine\\", according to the transcript. The woman later mentioned that the men were \\"sitting at Al and Alma's\\", the name of the charter cruise company that the Vikings players were later alleged to have used for the party. Stephen Doyle, attorney for the charter company, said some of the sex acts alleged by witnesses to have taken place during the party included, \\"Masturbation, oral sex, anal sex, woman on man, woman on woman, toys, double penetration, middle of the floor, middle of the couches, middle of the room.\\" The cleaning crew reported finding \\"used condoms, K-Y Jelly, Handi Wipes, wrappers for sex toys\\" and said \\"it was just incredible how it was left. Never in the history of this group of people have they ever had anything like this.\\" According to Doyle, there were no drugs and no minors on the two boats and that not every Vikings player aboard acted inappropriately. Parties involved =Fred Smoot= Smoot was the alleged ringleader of the entire operation. He is said to have been the one who hired the boats for the cruise on Lake Minnetonka. Smoot's agent has dismissed these claims. Smoot, however has not denied that he was on the boat that night. Smoot allegedly held a double-headed dildo and inserted it into the vaginas of two women who were lying on the floor in the lounge area. After one woman left he continued to \\"manipulate the dildo\\" inside the other woman in front of the crew. Merritt Geyen, who worked at the docks, told a sheriff's detective that three men planned the charter boat cruises. The day before the party, Geyen told the detective that Smoot showed up with another man she did not recognize. =Lance Johnstone= Merritt Geyen, a dock employee, told the detective that crew members showed Johnstone, Smoot and an unidentified player around the boats, went over menus and talked about specialty liquors. Smoot then signed a contract for the event and gave his address and phone number so she could bill him for it. Johnstone put his credit card down for the $1,000 deposit and said the rest of the bill could be added to his card later. =Mewelde Moore= Moore admitted being on the boat, but he claimed that \\"nothing happened\\". Asked if he saw strippers or sex on his boat, Moore quickly replied: \\"Sex? What are you talking about? Is that what ‚Äì man, that's crazy. Sex? Come on. Look man, I'm engaged so... none of that. Thing about that... that ‚Äì that put me in trouble.\\" =Koren Robinson= Robinson claimed he was not on either boat and was upset the Minneapolis Star Tribune associated him with this incident, given his effort to rebuild his life after struggling with substance abuse. Robinson says \\"I wasn't there, as far as the whole situation, I just know I wasn't on the boat, and I don't want to get involved. I don't want my name brought up because of what I just went through and what I'm still going through. So for my name to be brought up like that is just crazy and upsetting, because I don't want anyone looking at me because I had nothing to do with it.\\" =Bryant McKinnie= McKinnie allegedly picked up a naked woman, placed her on the bar and performed cunnilingus on her in front of the crew and other guests. In a June 2013 Reddit Ask Me Anything thread, Fred Smoot referred to this act as \\"runnin through the okra patch\\".

A catcher in Major League Baseball during the first two decades of the 20th century, he played 1,219 of his 1,290 games as a member of the Philadelphia Phillies and managed the Phils from 1910 through 1914. Biography Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, Dooin began his career with the St. Joseph, Missouri, club of the Western League in 1900. Two years later, he reached the Phillies and the National League, catching in 84 games. He was the club's regular catcher from 1904 through 1910, and although a broken ankle and a broken leg ‚Äî suffered in plays at home plate in 1910 and 1911 ‚Äî curtailed his playing career, he stayed in the majors as a catcher through 1916. A right-handed hitter, he batted .240 with ten career home runs. Oddly, six of those home runs came in one season: 1904, Dooin's first season as a full-time regular. In 1910, Dooin succeeded Billy Murray as manager of the Phils; under Murray, the Quakers had placed fifth in 1909. Player-manager Dooin piloted the Phillies for five years and compiled a winning record (392‚Äì370, .514). Moreover, along with fellow catcher and player-coach Pat Moran, he nurtured the great pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander to stardom in his earliest big league seasons. The Phillies rose to second place in the 1913 NL, but when they fell to sixth the following season, Dooin was replaced by Moran as the team's skipper. Still an active player, he then was traded to the Cincinnati Reds and, ultimately, the New York Giants, where he played his final two seasons in the Majors. He caught 111 shutouts during his career, ranking him 20th all-time among major league catchers.

It was a significant event in the development of constitutional monarchy in Denmark. It began with the dismissal of the elected government by the reigning monarch, King Christian X, a reserve power which was granted to him by the Danish constitution. After protests, the King agreed to install a caretaker government who could hold a general election, and no Danish monarch has since interfered in politics. Long-running Schleswig-Holstein question King Christian X in 1925The immediate cause was a conflict between the king and the cabinet over the reunification with Denmark of Schleswig, a former Danish fiefdom which had been lost to Prussia during the Second War of Schleswig. Danish claims to the region persisted to the end of World War I, at which time the defeat of the Germans made it possible to resolve the dispute. According to the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, the disposition of Schleswig was to be determined by two Schleswig Plebiscites: one in Northern Schleswig (today Denmark's South Jutland County), the other in Central Schleswig (today part of the German state of Schleswig-Holstein). No plebiscite was planned for Southern Schleswig, as it was dominated by an ethnic German majority and, in accordance with prevailing sentiment of the times in favor of the nation state, remained part of the post-war German state. Prime Minister Carl Theodor Zahle In Northern Schleswig, 75% voted for reunification with Denmark and 25% for remaining with Germany. In Central Schleswig, the situation was reversed with 80% voting for Germany and 20% for Denmark. In light of these results, the government of Prime Minister Carl Theodor Zahle determined that reunification with Northern Schleswig could go forward, while Central Schleswig would remain under German control. Many Danish nationalists felt that Central Schleswig should be returned to Denmark regardless of the plebiscite's results, generally motivated by a desire to see Germany permanently weakened in the future. Christian agreed with these sentiments, and ordered Prime Minister Zahle to include Central Schleswig in the re-unification process. As Denmark had been operating as a parliamentary democracy since the Cabinet of Deuntzer in 1901, Zahle felt he was under no obligation to comply. He refused the order and resigned several days later after a heated exchange with the king. Christian X dismisses government Subsequently, Christian dismissed the rest of the government and replaced it with a de facto conservative care-taker cabinet under Otto Liebe. The dismissal caused demonstrations and an almost revolutionary atmosphere in Denmark, and for several days the future of the monarchy seemed very much in doubt. In light of this, negotiations were opened between the king and members of the Social Democrats. Christian X appoints more widely accepted prime minister Faced with the potential overthrow of the Danish crown, Christian backed down and dismissed his own government, installing as a compromise cabinet under Michael Pedersen Friis until elections could be held later that year. This was the most recent time that a sitting Danish monarch took political action without the full support of parliament. Following the crisis, Christian accepted his drastically reduced role as symbolic head of state.

Cap. (), was born on 18 May 1515 to peasant parents in Cantalice, Italy, in the central Italian region of Lazio. Canonized by Pope Clement XI in 1712, he was the first Capuchin friar to be named a saint. Life Felix was the third of four sons born to Santi and Santa Porri. They were poor farmers. At about the age of ten, Felix was hired out first as a shepherd to a family at Citt√†ducale, where he later worked as a farm hand. Until the age of twenty-eight he worked as a farm laborer and shepherd. He developed the habit of praying while he worked. Toward the end of autumn 1543, Felix entered the newly founded Capuchin friars as a lay brother at the Citta Ducale friary in the municipality of Anticoli Corrado. It is said that he was well noted for his piety. In 1547 he was sent to Rome as quaestor of the Capuchin Friary of St. Bonaventure, where he spent his remaining 40 years begging alms to help in the friars' work of aiding the sick and the poor. In Rome, Brother Felix became a familiar sight, wandering barefoot through the streets, with a sack slung over his shoulders, knocking on doors to seek donations. He received permission from his superiors to help the needy, especially widows with many children. It is said that his begging sack was as bottomless as his heart.\\"Who is St. Felix of Cantalice?\\" Felician sisters International, May 17 2013 Brother Felix blessed all benefactors and all those he met with a humble ‚ÄúDeo Gratias!‚Äù (thanks be to God!), causing many to refer to him as ‚ÄúBrother Deo Gratias\\". \\"Saint Felix of Cantalice\\", Felician Sisters of North America Felix was so successful in his work that during the famine of 1580, the political leader of Rome asked the Capuchins if they would 'lend' Felix to them so he could collect food and provisions for the entire city.

A recent study on the heart rate's contribution to the regulation of the caimans' body temperature showed an increase in heart rate as the temperature increased, and it lowers once the temperature lowered.Micheli, M.A. Campbell, H. A. Autonomic control of heart rate exhibits diurnal shifts in a crocodilian.Amphibia-Reptilia, Vol. 29 Issue 4, 2008. 567-571. The heat of the sun is absorbed through the skin into the blood, keeping its body temperature up. An increased heart rate helps the newly absorbed heat transfer throughout the body more quickly. When the air becomes cooler, the need for the heart rate to remain at an increased rate is lost.Micheli, M.A. Campbell, H. A.

The drums were played with brushes to emulate the albums Ocean Rain and Forever Changes. Avey Tare would dictate what he wanted the rhythm to be through beatboxing. Other sounds, such as the majority of \\"Spirit They've Vanished\\", were created through the use of feedback loops. Future Animal Collective member Deakin (Josh Dibb) helped with the promotion and sent packages to record companies. Portner recalled, \\"Southern Records called us back immediately and said ‚ÄòIs there something wrong with this?

The art was later discovered to be an illustration by Dorothy P. Lathrop from the book Stars To-Night: Verses New and Old for Boys and Girls by Sara Teasdale. The album was intended to be released under Avey Tare's name alone, but he was so impressed by Panda Bear's drumming that he added Panda's name on the front cover. This method of choosing monikers for Animal Collective's recorded output‚Äînaming themselves after who played on each respective album‚Äîwould last until 2003's Campfire Songs.

Track listing  There has been some confusion about the album's track listing. On the original, limited release, the untitled track #3 was not listed along with the other songs. Since the track listing gave no corresponding track numbers to the rest of the songs, it was incorrectly assumed that tracks #3-9 were actually titled as tracks #4-10 are here, and that \\"Alvin Row\\" had no title.

Jacobson (born July 29, 1943), who holds a Ph.D. in microbiology from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is an American scientist and nutrition advocate. Jacobson co-founded the Center for Science in the Public Interest in 1971, along with two fellow scientists (James B. Sullivan, Albert J. Fritsch) he met while working at the Center for the Study of Responsive Law. When his colleagues left CSPI in 1977, Jacobson became its executive director. In 2017 he was replaced as the executive director by Peter Lurie and holds the position of Senior Scientist; he is also on the board of directors of the organization. He has been a national leader in the movement for healthier diets, focusing both on education and obtaining laws and regulations. It was Jacobson who coined the now widely used phrases \\"junk food\\" and \\"food porn\\".Food And Social Media ‚Äî A Complicated Relationship His views Jacobson and his organization have both publicized healthy diets and criticized a wide variety of foods and beverages as unhealthful. He and CSPI frequently use colorful terms to emphasize their opposition to certain foods, for instance referring to fettuccine alfredo as a \\"heart attack on a plate.\\" He founded Food Day, a nationwide celebration of healthy, affordable, and sustainably produced food and a grassroots campaign for better policies. Food Day was celebrated annually from 1975‚Äì77 and 2011‚Äì15. Jacobson also founded Big Business Day and the Center for the Study of Commercialism. \\"Soda is the quintessential junk food‚Äîjust sugar calories and no nutrients,\\" says Jacobson. \\"Americans are drowning in soda pop‚Äîteenagers, in particular. The average teenage boy is consuming two cans of soda pop a day.\\" Jacobson proposes several warning labels, including \\"Drinking (non-diet) soft drinks contributes to obesity and tooth decay,\\" and \\"Consider switching to diet soda, water, or skim milk.\\" He once asked a CBS News reporter: \\"Obesity is an epidemic. One- third of youths already are overweight or obese. Are we just going to sit around and do nothing? Or should we do something‚Äîa modest, sensible step of putting a health message on cans and bottles?\\" In 2005, Jacobson's organization proposed mandatory warning labels on all containers of sugar- sweetened soft drinks, to warn consumers about the possible health risks of consuming these beverages on a regular basis. Beginning in 1993, Jacobson spearheaded efforts to require that artificial trans fat, a potent cause of heart disease, be labeled on food packages. As evidence of trans fat's harmfulness accumulated, in 2004 CSPI petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to ban the use of partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, the source of artificial trans fat. The FDA banned that oil in 2015, with June 18, 2018, being the effective date to stop using it. To bring about changes in eating habits, Jacobson advocates higher taxes on unhealthy foods, greater use of warning labels on food and beverage packaging, restrictions on advertising and selling junk foods (‚Äúsnack foods\\"), and lawsuits against food producers and retailers whose practices he believes are detrimental to public health. His publicity campaigns and legal actions regarding such harmful ingredients as urethane (a carcinogen) in alcoholic beverages, sulfite preservatives (deadly allergen) in fresh vegetables, wine, and other foods; sodium nitrite (source of cancer-causing nitrosamines) in bacon and other processed meats; and acrylamide (a carcinogenic contaminant) in baked and fried foods led to governmental restrictions or voluntary actions to reduce or eliminate those substances. Jacobson led the effort to get \\"Added Sugars\\" listed on Nutrition Facts labels. Criticism Due to the public-interest passion he brings to his efforts and in part to his criticisms of the food industry, Jacobson's methods have been questioned by the libertarian community, with the Center for Consumer Freedom awarding him \\"nanny of the year\\" on three occasions. Some argue that parents have control over their children's diet and can moderate their intake of sugar-sweetened soft drinks. However, Jacobson contends that \\"kids know about vending machines, and they can go to 7-Eleven and get a big gulp which contains half a gallon () ‚Äîa thousand calories, almost!‚Äîof soda pop in a single serving... We've come a long way from the six-and-a-half ounce () Coke bottles some 50 years ago.\\"  Works written by Jacobson  *Eater's Digest: The Consumer's Fact-Book of Food Additives, Doubleday & Company Inc.

He was a leading participant in planning and carrying out economic exploitation of the Soviet Union, most notably the Hunger Plan. Thomas's role in plotting against Hitler has led some historians to describe him as a member of the German resistance, while others find his record more ambiguous.Hans Rothfels, The German Opposition to Hitler: An Appraisal, pg. 79.  Career summary  Thomas was born in Forst (Lausitz), Brandenburg. The factory owner's son and later general joined Infantry Regiment 63 as an ensign and a career soldier in 1908. From 1928, he dealt with armament questions at the Army Weapons Office in the Reich Defence Ministry in Berlin. Thomas continued to work as the Chief of Staff for the Army Weapons Office in the Reich Defence Ministry from 1928-1938, where he intensively studied the dynamic of national economics and war preparations, pushing forward the idea of a \\"defense economy\\" - that is, the marshaling of Germany's resources for the purpose of war under a central planning commission. Despite his misgivings with National Socialism following the dismissal of Colonel General Baron Werner von Fritsch on trumped up allegations of homosexuality, Thomas remained an important member of the German General Staff. Nevertheless, it was upon von Fritsch's removal in 1938 that Thomas experienced his first major inner conflict with National Socialism.Wheeler-Bennett, The Nemesis of Power: The German Army in Politics, 1918-1945, pgs. 431-432. It is speculated that he stayed aboard from here forward to foment plans for a coup. In 1939, he became head of the Defence Economy and Armament Office in the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW). He was a member of the board of Kontinentale √ñl AG (an oil company whose purpose was to exploit petroleum resources in occupied countries) as well as Reichswerke Hermann G√∂ring, a major iron and steel company. Thomas, who since 1940 had been a General of Infantry recognized early on that Germany's ability to wage a lengthy war was limited by the state of its economy. When the threat of war with the Western Powers loomed great in the wake of Hitler's bold political moves to secure the Austrian Anschlu√ü, the acquisition of the Sudetenland, and then with the impending Blitzkrieg into Poland awaiting the German General Staff, Thomas produced an extensive report for Hitler assessing the risks. Thomas' analysis was replete with graphics and statistics demonstrating the military-economic superiority of the Western Powers, at which Hitler balked and exclaimed that, \\"he did not share General Thomas' anxiety over the danger of a world war, especially since he had now got the Soviet Union on his side\\" (consequent the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact).William L. Shirer, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, pgs. 744-745. Not only was Thomas worried about an attack provoking the British and French but so were Generals von Brauchitsch, Colonel-General Halder, and Quartermaster General von St√ºlpnagel, yet Hitler refused to countenance any delays or reluctance from his military staff about his plans and more earnestly pushed forward the attack despite their sound arguments otherwise.Joachim Fest, Hitler, pg. 626. During the planning phase of Operation Barbarossa, General Thomas' pragmatic and realistic nature once again gripped him as he thought a full-scale war with the Soviet Union should be delayed until the logistical concerns were remedied. Along said lines, Thomas informed Colonel-General Franz Halder, then Chief of the OKH General Staff, that the attack on the Soviet Union would experience logistical delays due to the fact that Russian railways were of a different gauge than German ones. Thomas also warned Halder of the insufficiency of German transport vehicle tires for the task ahead of them, and most significantly, Thomas revealed to Halder that they (the Germans) only had two months worth of fuel oil and petrol to support the advancing assault. Inexplicably, Halder did not convey this information to Hitler and when Thomas attempted to do this himself, General Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel stepped in and prevented the report from going any further.Barnett, Hitler's Generals, pg. 115. Reassurances soon made their way to General Thomas when no less than Reichsminister Hermann G√∂ring told him not to worry about using up Germany's resources since \\"they would soon be masters of France, Belgium, and Holland\\", likewise adding that they would plunder all the available resources in the \\"captured territories\\".Anthony Read, The Devil's Disciples: Hitler's Inner Circle, pg. 603. In November 1942, Thomas resigned from the Defence Economy and Armament Office. Albert Speer and his Armament Ministry, meanwhile, had taken over almost all the expertise relating to armament issues. Of note, during the autumn of 1943 (Paulus surrendered at Stalingrad in January 1943), Hitler asked for a projection over the progress the Germans might expect to make in the near term. Chief of the Operations Staff for the OKW, Colonel- General Alfred Jodl submitted the report to Hitler as commanded, but Hitler became irate when the estimates were given to him, reflecting back sardonically on earlier calculations made by General Thomas who \\"rated the Soviet war potential as high.\\"Albert Speer, Inside the Third Reich, pg. 303. As a result of the negative assessment about the campaign's future in the East, Hitler forbade any more war studies by the OKW. From what the sources indicate, General Thomas tried unsuccessfully on several occasions to bring the German General Staff and Hitler back to reality about their long-term prospects for success. The pragmatism of Thomas likely contributed to his disillusionment with the regime and its leadership, perhaps leading him to believe that a coup was necessary to stop Germany from being totally annihilated.  Resistance to Hitler  Through contacts with his former superior Ludwig Beck, as well as with Carl Friedrich Goerdeler and Johannes Popitz, he got to work as early as 1938-39 on the planning for a military coup d'√©tat against Adolf Hitler. After the failed attempt on Hitler's life at the Wolf's Lair in East Prussia on 20 July 1944, the coup d'√©tat plans from 1938‚Äì39 were found, leading to Thomas's arrest on 11 October 1944. After his arrest, he was transferred to the Flossenb√ºrg and Dachau concentration camps. In late April 1945, he was transferred to Tyrol together with about 140 other prominent inmates. On April 30, after advancing US troops and soldiers from Wichard von Alvensleben's unit, surrounded the village, the SS guards decided to escape. Thomas and the other prisoners were liberated by the Fifth U.S. Army on 5 May 1945.georg-elser-arbeitskreis.de (German) Thomas died in Allied custody in 1946.  Role in Hunger Plan  Thomas has been described as someone who at times \\"toyed with opposition to Hitler's war\\" but who fundamentally was a \\"ruthless pragmatist\\" whose only concern was \\"Germany's future as a great power.\\" As such, he was deeply involved in the crafting of Nazi policy for the occupied Soviet Union, which in short was designed to exploit the entire resources of the country for the benefit of Germany and the German armed forces, at the expense of the deaths by starvation of millions of people.Tooze, Wages of Destruction, at page 478. This became known as the Hunger Plan. Thomas worked closely with Herbert Backe, the de facto chief of Nazi agriculture, in developing this plan. In the course of this, on 2 May 1941, Thomas held a high level meeting to review the strategy. An internal Wehrmacht memorandum prepared by his staff described this policy and acknowledged that \\"if we take what we need out of the country, there can be no doubt that many millions of people will die of starvation.\\"Tooze, Wages of Destruction, at page 479. This memorandum has been described as: The historian Christopher Browning writes that on 2 May 1941, the state secretaries of various ministries met with Thomas, and agreed to make it a priority to supply the army with food from Russia, and to ship other essential agricultural products, including grain, to Germany. \\"In doing so,\\" Thomas's protocol laconically stated, \\"umpteen million people will doubtless starve to death, if we extract everything necessary for us from the country.\\"Browning, The Origins Of The Final Solution, 2004, p. 235 While the memorandum did not estimate how many millions would die, Backe himself stated that the \\"surplus population\\" of the Soviet Union was 20 to 30 million. German policy for the invasion, and instructions to the troops, were deliberately calculated either to kill these 20 to 30 million through starvation, or force them to flee to Siberia.Tooze, Wages of Destruction, at page 480.

Its population is compared to . Geography The town is located in the southwest of the Sambia Peninsula (Samland). It is situated by a bay on the northern shore of the Vistula Lagoon, about west of the administrative centre Kaliningrad. History The site has been associated with the name of St. Adalbert of Prague, who was sent with soldiers of Boleslav Chrobry of the newly established Poland to conquer Prussia. St. Adalbert was beheaded nearby in 997 by the pagan Sambians after he destroyed their sacred oak grove. Several further attempts of conquest by Poles followed, but were successfully repelled. In 1254 the Old Prussian Samland territory was conquered by forces of the Teutonic Order, led by King Ottokar II of Bohemia, during the Prussian Crusade. Fischhausen, copper engraving, 1684 Upon the division of the conquered lands, the Bishop of Samland had a castle erected at the site named Schonewik (derived from Old Prussian: Skanevƒ´s). First mentioned in a 1268 deed, it is one of the oldest in the region. A settlement was laid out from 1299 onwards and its citizens, mainly descending from Stralsund in the Danish Principality of R√ºgen, received a first town charter in 1305. As the episcopal residence of the Samland bishops, it was called Bischoveshusen or shortly Vischhusen from about 1325. The richly endowed Gothic parish church was one of the oldest in the province. When in 1525 Bishop George of Polentz waived his rights, his Fischhausen residence was incorporated into the secular Duchy of Prussia. On 12 February 1526, the Hohenzollern duke Albert, former Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, married Princess Dorothea of Denmark at the Fischhausen Castle chapel. The fortress became the residence of his mentally disabled son Albert Frederick until his death in 1618. Afterwards, the castle decayed and was finally demolished by order of King Frederick I of Prussia, who had its stones used for the expansion of the nearby Pillau fortress. Fischhausen church, about 1930 Upon the re-organisation of the Prussian lands after the Congress of Vienna, Fischhausen became the administrative seat of a district (Kreis Fischhausen) within the Province of East Prussia in 1818. A station on the East Prussian Southern Railway line from K√∂nigsberg to Pillau with a branch-off to Palmnicken (Yantarny) on the Amber Coast was inaugurated in 1865. According to the German 1939 census, the town's population was 3,879. During World War II, the Soviet Red Army advanced towards Fischhausen after the capture of K√∂nigsberg. The town was captured after a battle on April 21‚Äì24, 1945; during the fighting the medieval town was almost completely destroyed. After the war, the town was transferred to Soviet control and in 1946 it was given its present name (which literally means \\"by the sea\\" in Russian). It finally lost its status as a district seat and was incorporated into Zelenogradsky District in 1947. Part of the newly established Baltiysky District since 1996, it was demoted in status to that of an urban-type settlement in 2005. In 2008, its town status was restored.

Sam Lucas's exact date of birth is disputed. Lucas's year of birth, to freed former slaves, has also been cited as 1839, 1840, 1841, and 1850. His career began in blackface minstrelsy, but he later became one of the first African Americans to branch out into more serious drama, with roles in seminal works such as The Creole Show and A Trip to Coontown. He was the first black man to portray the role of Uncle Tom on both stage and screen. James Weldon Johnson described him as the \\"Grand Old Man of the Negro Stage\\".Johnson (1968). Black Manhattan, p. 90. Quoted in Toll 218. Despite his beginnings in minstrelsy, he was vocal about liberating himself from the minstrel profession, and was the only composer of spirituals of his time to present them consistently within the context of jubilee concerts. Early career Lucas was born Samuel Mildmay Lucas (or Samuel Lucas Milady) in Washington Court House, Ohio to free black parents. He showed a talent for guitar and singing as a teenager, and while working as a barber, his local performances gained him a positive reputation. In 1858 he began his career as a performer with the traveling African-American minstrel companies. Over the next five years, he sang and acted on stage and on riverboats, and composed music for his shows. Meanwhile, he found ways to integrate his African-American roots into the mostly white form; for instance, his tune \\"Carve Dat Possum\\" borrowed its melody from a black religious song. As black minstrelsy grew popular with the general public, Lucas became one of its first celebrities, particularly known for his portrayals of pitiable, comic characters. His fame allowed him to choose his engagements, and over the span of his career, he performed with some of the best black minstrel troupes. He never led a troupe of his own, however. Throughout his life, Lucas performed with many minstrel groups including Lew Johnson's Plantation Minstrels (1871‚Äì73), Callender's Georgia Minstrels (1873‚Äì74, 1875‚Äì76), and Sprague's Georgia Minstrels (1878‚Äì79) in Havana, Cuba. After his time as a minstrel performer, Lucas began to perform in vaudeville. As a writer and performer of jubilee songs, Lucas was unique in branding himself a \\"jubilee singer\\" and in forming a jubilee group in 1881 to highlight the popular songs of black composers, as well as his own character songs. His jubilee troupe never performed jubilee songs in the original sense of arranged traditional spirituals. Instead, he mixed commercial spirituals, cultivated songs, instrumental selections, and comedy, forging a new kind of concert that was part variety, part band concert, and part art music. Besides his own ensemble, \\"Mr. Sam Lucas and quartet,\\" he was involved with numerous other jubilee ensembles such as the Norfolk Jubilee Singers, the Harper's Ferry Jubilee Singers, the Original Nashville Singers, the Southern Jubilee Singers, and the Hyers Sisters, among others. Cover for Sam Lucas' Songs Dramatic roles Meanwhile, Lucas attempted to branch out into non-minstrel material. In 1875, for instance, he performed alongside Emma and Anna Hyer in Out of Bondage, a musical drama about a freed slave who is made over to fit into upper-class, white society. He followed this by another stint in black minstrelsy, and in 1876, he was playing with Sprague's Georgia Minstrels, alongside both James A. Bland and Billy Kersands. In 1878, Charles and Gustave Frohman needed an advertising gimmick to help rescue a poorly performing comedy troupe. Their answer was to stage a serious production of Uncle Tom's Cabin with a black man in the lead role. Lucas's reputation as an actor was well known, as was his wealth; Gustave wired Charles, \\"Get me an Eva and send her down with Sam Lucas. Be sure to tell Sam to bring his diamonds.\\"Toll, pp. 217‚Äì218. Lucas became the first USA born African American to play Uncle Tom in a serious production in the USA, sometime after July 1878 (John W. Frick, Uncle Tom's Cabin on the American Stage and Screen, 121.) He was preceded by the Melbourne, Australia, production on June 8, 1878 ( Melbourne Argus, June 8, 1878) featuring USA born Hosea Easton. West Indian born Hackett Coulthurst had performed it earlier still, in Australia at Ballarat's Theatre Royal (Ballarat Star, June 12, 1867). Lucas's show fared poorly in Richmond, Virginia, and not even a change of venue to Lucas's home state of Ohio could save the production. The problems seem to have been many. One critic remarked that \\"little\\" Eva was so large that she nearly flattened St. Clair when she sat in his lap. Lucas had to hawk his stash of diamonds to pay the troupe's transport back to Cincinnati. Lucas rejoined the Hyer sisters for The Underground Railroad, only to go back to blackface acts after its run. He also continued to write, and much of his output shows a more African American perspective when compared to work of other black composers, such as James Bland.Watkins, p. 119. For example, the lyrics to \\"My Dear Old Southern Home\\" say: :I remember now my poor wife's face, :Her cries ring in my ear; :When they tore me from her wild embrace, :And sold me way out yere. :My children sobbed about my knees, :They've all grown up since then, :But bress de Lord de good time's come; :I'se freed by dose Northern men.Quoted in Toll 247. Toll does not specify whether this piece was published in Sam Lucas' Plantation Songster, c. 1875, or in Sam Lucas' Careful Man Songster, c. 1881. Another Lucas tune declares, \\"I nebber shall forget, no nebber, / De day I was sot free.\\"Lucas, Sam (1878). Sheet music, \\"De Day I Was Sot Free\\". Quoted in Toll 247. Later career In 1890, Lucas served as an endman in Sam T. Jack's The Creole Show, often cited as the first African American production to show signs of breaking the links to minstrelsy.Watkins, p. 118. He married during its run, and afterward he and his wife played a succession of variety houses, vaudeville stages, and museums. In 1898, he performed in Boston in A Trip to Coontown, produced by Bob Cole. This was the first black production to use only African American writers, directors, and producers, and the first black musical comedy to make a complete break with minstrelsy.Toll, p. 218. From 1905 to 1906, he starred in Rufus Rastus, which was directed by Ernest Hogan. In 1907, Lucas starred in the second showing of an original musical comedy from Cole and Johnson, The Shoe-Fly Regiment, which ran from June 3, 1907 to August 17, 1907. This production showed at the Grand Opera House in New York City from June 6‚Äì8, 1907 and at the Bijou Theatre, which was also located in New York, from August 6 to 17, 1907. The Shoe-Fly Regiment was a three-act musical, with Acts One and Three taking place in the Lincolnville Institute in Alabama and act two taking place in the Philippines. Lucas played Brother Doolittle, who was a member of the Bode of Education. Lucas later performed in another original musical comedy The Red Moon, portraying Bill Webster, a barber. The Red Moon ran from May 3, 1909 to May 29, 1909. The Red Moon was also a three- act musical, but set in fictional \\"Swamptown, Virginia\\". In 1908, he became a charter member for the professional theatrical club The Frogs, and in 1913 he participated in The Frog Follies. Lime Kiln Field Day (1913) In 1913, Lucas was featured in the unfinished film, Lime Kiln Field Day, produced by the Biograph Company and Klaw and Erlanger. The footage of the unfinished film was assembled in 2014 by the Museum of Modern Art, which had rescued the film cans from a Biograph film storage vault in 1938. Uncle Tom's Cabin (1914) In 1914, Lucas revived his role of Uncle Tom in William Robert Daly's film adaptation of Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin. He is generally credited as the first black man to portray Uncle Tom, a character that had typically been played by white actors in black face. The film was released on August 10, 1914, by the World Film Company.https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film- registry/descriptions-and-essays/  accessed March 18, 2018.

The six dravyas include the jiva and the fivefold divisions of ajiva (non-living)  dharma (motion), adharma (rest), akasha (space), pudgala (matter) and kala (time).Sharma, Chandradhar (1960, reprint 1997). A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, , p.63 Pudgala, like other dravyas except kala is called astikaya in the sense that it occupies space. Pudgala is derived from the words 'pud', which is defined as Supplement (Addition /Fusion), and gala, which is defined as Disintegrate, or Division or Fission. Therefore, Pudgalas are best defined as all things that are continuously changing by the process of Supplementation or Disintegration, namely matter. The individual unit of Pudgala is the material from which all is made called a Paramanu, which, by the process of supplementation, can combine to form what can be roughly said is an aggregate, called a Skandha. It possesses at all times four qualities, namely, a color (varna), a taste (rasa), a smell (gandha), and a certain kind of palpability (sparsha, touch). In Buddhism, Pudgala means the entity that reincarnates as an individual or person, i.e., the bundle of tendencies that keeps an individual reincarnating until they attain enlightenment.Dasgupta, Surendranath (1975, reprint 2010).

The modern name of the mountain was given to it in 1895 by Theodore S. Solomons and E. C. Bonner of the United States Geological Survey as part of a series of mountains named for the six major exponents of the theory of evolution. Mount Darwin is named for the naturalist, Charles Darwin. Other nearby mountains in the Evolution Group include Mount Mendel, Mount Fiske, Mount Haeckel, Mount Huxley, Mount Spencer, Mount Wallace, and Mount Lamarck. The area around the peaks, known as the Evolution Region, includes Evolution Basin and Evolution Valley. Nearby landmarks include Darwin Glacier and Darwin Canyon. A similar exercise in naming mountains after naturalists and other late nineteenth century proponents of evolution theory was carried out at the West Coast Range in Tasmania, Australia. In contrast, Mount Darwin in Tierra del Fuego was given its name during the voyage of the Beagle by captain Robert FitzRoy to celebrate Darwin's 25th birthday on 12 February 1834.

He made some recordings as Dickie Podolor in the late 1950s, and toured as a member of the Pets, a group that also included session musicians Plas Johnson and Earl Palmer. He played on the Pets' 1958 hit \\"Cha Hua Hua\\". His success as a musician enabled his family to open a recording studio, the American Recording Company, initially run by his brother Don Podolor. Together with drummer Sandy Nelson, Richie Podolor recorded a demo of \\"Teen Beat\\", but the song was then taken up and recorded by other musicians with Nelson, becoming a hit in 1959. Because Podolor was not given a co-writing credit for \\"Teen Beat\\", Nelson later credited him with co-writing some of his later recordings, including his 1961 hit \\"Let There Be Drums\\". Podolor released recordings for Imperial Records in the early 1960s, using the name Richie Allen (or, on one single, Dickie Allen). His 1960 single \\"Stranger from Durango\\" reached number 90 on the Billboard Hot 100.

The experiments aim to detect particles in the form of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) by looking for rare interactions via nuclear recoils in a liquid xenon target chamber. The current detector consists of a dual phase time projection chamber (TPC). The experiment detects scintillation and ionization produced when particles interact in the liquid xenon volume, to search for an excess of nuclear recoil events over known backgrounds. The detection of such a signal would provide the first direct experimental evidence for dark matter candidate particles. The collaboration is currently led by Italian professor of physics Elena Aprile from Columbia University. Detector principle Sketch of the working principle of a xenon dual-phase TPC The XENON experiment operates a dual phase time projection chamber (TPC), which utilizes a liquid xenon target with a gaseous phase on top. Two arrays of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), one at the top of the detector in the gaseous phase (GXe), and one at the bottom of the liquid layer (LXe), detect scintillation and electroluminescence light produced when charged particles interact in the detector. Electric fields are applied across both the liquid and gaseous phase of the detector. The electric field in the gaseous phase has to be sufficiently large to extract electrons from the liquid phase. Particle interactions in the liquid target produce scintillation and ionization. The prompt scintillation light produces 178 nm ultraviolet photons. This signal is detected by the PMTs, and is referred to as the S1 signal. This technique has proved sensitive enough to detect single photoelectrons. The applied electric field prevents recombination of all the electrons produced from a charged particle interaction in the TPC. These electrons are drifted to the top of the liquid phase by the electric field. The ionization is then extracted into the gas phase by the stronger electric field in the gaseous phase. The electric field accelerates the electrons to the point that it creates a proportional scintillation signal that is also collected by the PMTs, and is referred to as the S2 signal. The detector allows for a full 3-D position determination of the particle interaction. Electrons in liquid xenon have a uniform drift velocity. This allows the interaction depth of the event to be determined by measuring the time delay between the S1 and S2 signal. The position of the event in the x-y plane can be determined by looking at the number of photons seen by each of the individual PMTs. The full 3-D position allows for the fiducialization of the detector, in which a low-background region is defined in the inner volume of the TPC. This fiducial volume has a greatly reduced rate of background events as compared to regions of the detector at the edge of the TPC, due to the self-shielding properties of liquid xenon. This allows for a much higher sensitivity when searching for very rare events. Charged particles moving through the detector are expected to either interact with the electrons of the xenon atoms producing electronic recoils, or with the nucleus, producing nuclear recoils. For a given amount of energy deposited by a particle interaction in the detector, the ratio of S2/S1 can be used as a discrimination parameter to distinguish electronic and nuclear recoil events. This ratio is expected to be greater for electronic recoils than for nuclear recoils. In this way backgrounds from electronic recoils can be suppressed by more than 99%, while simultaneously retaining 50% of the nuclear recoil events. XENON10 The cryostat and shield of XENON100. The shield consists of an outer layer of 20 cm of water, a 20 cm layer of lead, a 20 cm layer of polyethylene, and on the interior a 5 cm copper layer The XENON10 experiment was installed at the underground Gran Sasso laboratory in Italy during March 2006. The underground location of the laboratory provides 3100 m of water- equivalent shielding. The detector was placed within a shield to further reduce the background rate in the TPC. XENON10 was intended as a prototype detector, to prove the efficacy of the XENON design, as well as verify the achievable threshold, background rejection power and sensitivity. The XENON10 detector contained 15 kg of liquid xenon. The sensitive volume of the TPC measures 20 cm in diameter and 15 cm in height. An analysis of 59 live days of data, taken between October 2006 and February 2007, produced no WIMP signatures. The number of events observed in the WIMP search region is statistically consistent with the expected number of events from electronic recoil backgrounds. This result excluded some of the available parameter space in minimal Supersymmetric models, by placing limits on spin independent WIMP- nucleon cross sections down to below for a WIMP mass. Due to nearly half of natural xenon having odd spin states (129Xe has an abundance of 26% and spin-1/2; 131Xe has an abundance of 21% and spin-3/2), the XENON detectors can also be used to provide limits on spin dependent WIMP-nucleon cross sections for coupling of the dark matter candidate particle to both neutrons and protons. XENON10 set the world's most stringent restrictions on pure neutron coupling. XENON100 PMT array of XENON100 contains 98 Hamamatsu R8520-06-A1 PMTs. The PMTs on the top array are placed in concentric circles to improve the reconstruction of the radial position of observed events. The bottom PMT array of XENON100 contains 80 PMTs which are spaced as closely as possible in order to maximize light collection efficiency. The second phase detector, XENON100, contains 165 kg of liquid xenon, with 62 kg in the target region and the remaining xenon in an active veto. The TPC of the detector has a diameter of 30 cm and a height of 30 cm. As WIMP interactions are expected to be extremely rare events, a thorough campaign was launched during the construction and commissioning phase of XENON100 to screen all parts of the detector for radioactivity. The screening was performed using high-purity Germanium detectors. In a few cases mass spectrometry was performed on low mass plastic samples. In doing so the design goal of <10‚àí2 events/kg/day/keV was reached, realising the world's lowest background rate dark matter detector. The detector was installed at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in 2008 in the same shield as the XENON10 detector, and has conducted several science runs. In each science run, no dark matter signal was observed above the expected background, leading to the most stringent limit on the spin independent WIMP-nucleon cross section in 2012, with a minimum at for a WIMP mass. These results constrain interpretations of signals in other experiments as dark matter interactions, and rule out exotic models such as inelastic dark matter, which would resolve this discrepancy. XENON100 has also provided improved limits on the spin dependent WIMP-nucleon cross section. An axion result was published in 2014, setting a new best axion limit. XENON100 operated the then-lowest background experiment, for dark matter searches, with a background of 50 mDRU (1 mDRU=10‚àí3 events/kg/day/keV). XENON1T Construction of the next phase, XENON1T, started in Hall B of the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in 2014. The detector contains 3.2 tons of ultra radio- pure liquid xenon, and has a fiducial volume of about 2 tons. The detector is housed in a 10 m water tank that serves as a muon veto. The TPC is 1 m in diameter and 1 m in height. The detector project team, called the XENON Collaboration, is composed of 135 investigators across 22 institutions from Europe, the Middle East, and the United States. Upper limit for spin- independent WIMP-nucleon cross section according to recent data (published Nov. 2017) The first results from XENON1T were released by the XENON collaboration on May 18, 2017, based on 34 days of data-taking between November 2016 and January 2017. While no WIMPs or dark matter candidate signals were officially detected, the team did announce a record low reduction in the background radioactivity levels being picked up by XENON1T. The exclusion limits exceeded the previous best limits set by the LUX experiment, with an exclusion of cross sections larger than for WIMP masses of . Because some signals that the detector receives might be due to neutrons, reducing the radioactivity increases the sensitivity to WIMPs. In September 2018 the XENON1T experiment published its results from 278.8 days of collected data. A new record limit for WIMP-nucleon spin-independent elastic interactions was set, with a minimum of at a WIMP mass of . In April 2019, based on measurements performed with the XENON1T detector, the XENON Collaboration reported in Nature the first direct observation of two-neutrino double electron capture in xenon-124 nuclei. The measured half-life of this process, which is several orders of magnitude larger than the age of the Universe, demonstrates the capabilities of xenon-based detectors to search for rare events and showcases the broad physics reach of even larger next-generation experiments. This measurement represents a first step in the search for the neutrinoless double electron capture process, the detection of which would provide valuable insight into the nature of the neutrino and allow to determine its absolute mass. As of 2019, the XENON1T experiment has stopped data-taking to allow for construction of the next phase, XENONnT.url=http://www.lowbg.org/ugnd/workshop/sympo_all/201903_Sendai/slides/8am/8am_6.pdf In June 2020, the XENON1T collaboration reported an excess of electron recoils: 285 events, 53 more than the expected 232. Three explanations were considered: existence of to-date-hypothetical solar axions, a surprisingly large magnetic moment for neutrinos, and tritium contamination in the detector. There is insufficient data to choose among these three, though the XENONnT upgrade should provide this capacity. XENONnT XENONnT is an upgrade of the XENON1T experiment underground at LNGS. Its systems will contain a total xenon mass of more than 8 tonnes. Apart from a larger xenon target in its time projection chamber the upgraded experiment will feature new components to further reduce or tag radiation that otherwise would constitute background to its measurements. It is designed to reach a sensitivity (in a small part of the mass-range probed) where neutrinos become a significant background. As of 2019, the upgrade is on-going and first light is expected in 2020.http://www.lowbg.org/ugnd/workshop/sympo_all/201903_Sendai/slides/8am/8am_6.pdf References Further reading * External links *The XENON Experiment *XENON home page at the University of Chicago *XENON home page at Columbia University *XENON home page at the University of Zurich *XENON home page at Rice University *XENON home page at Brown University *XENON home page at University of California, Los Angeles *Dark matter limit plotter with the latest results from XENON and other experiments *Enlightening the dark, CERN Courier, Sep 27, 2013 Experiments for dark matter search ","title":"XENON"},{"id":"2949558","text":"Under-12 aged nippers in start position before their swim in Stanwell Park, dressed in local SLSC uniform.

Its name derives from that of an ancient tribe, the Viromandui. In the 10th century, it was organised around two castellan domains: St Quentin (Aisne) and P√©ronne (Somme). In today's times, the Vermandois county would fall in the Picardy region of northern France. Pepin I of Vermandois, the earliest of its hereditary counts, was descended in direct male line from the emperor Charlemagne. More famous was his grandson Herbert II (902‚Äì943), who considerably increased the territorial power of the house of Vermandois, and kept the lawful king of France, the unlucky Charles the Simple, prisoner for six years. Herbert II was son of Herbert I, lord of P√©ronne and St Quentin, who was killed in 902 by an assassin in the pay of Baldwin II, Count of Flanders. His successors, Albert I, Herbert III, Albert II, Otto and Herbert IV, were not as historically significant. In 1077, the last count of the first house of Vermandois, Herbert IV, received the county of Valois through his wife. His son Eudes (II) the Insane was disinherited by the council of the Barons of France. He was lord of Saint-Simon through his wife, and the county was given to his sister Adela, whose first husband was Hugh the Great, the brother of King Philip I of France. Hugh was one of the leaders of the First Crusade, and died in 1102 at Tarsus in Cilicia. The eldest son of Hugh and Adela was count Raoul I (c. 1120‚Äì1152), who married Petronilla of Aquitaine, sister of the queen, Eleanor, and had by her three children: Raoul (Rudolph) II, the Leper (count from 1152‚Äì1167); Isabelle, who possessed from 1167 to 1183 the counties of Vermandois, Valois and Amiens conjointly with her husband, Philip, Count of Flanders; and Eleanor. By the terms of a treaty concluded in 1186 with the king, Philip Augustus, the count of Flanders kept the county of Vermandois until his death, in 1191. At this date, a new arrangement gave Eleanor (d. 1213) a life interest in the eastern part of Vermandois, together with the title of countess of St Quentin, and the king entered immediately into possession of P√©ronne and its dependencies.

The Mariners had the home field advantage, which was predetermined and assigned to either the West Division champion or their opponents in the Division Series. The two teams were victorious in the AL Division Series (ALDS), with the Indians defeating the East Division champion Boston Red Sox three games to none, and the Mariners defeating the wild card qualifier New York Yankees three games to two. The Indians won the series four games to two to become the American League champions, and lost to the National League champion Atlanta Braves in the 1995 World Series. Summary =Seattle Mariners vs. Cleveland Indians= Game summaries =Game 1= Tuesday, October 10, 1995, at Kingdome in Seattle, Washington The Indians called on the veteran Dennis Mart√≠nez for Game 1. The Mariners rode the arm of rookie Bob Wolcott. Obviously nervous at the outset, Wolcott walked the first three hitters on 13 pitches, but he would get out of the bases-loaded, nobody-out situation with ease; he first struck out Albert Belle, got Eddie Murray on a foul pop-fly, then induced a groundout from Jim Thome on a great diving stop by Joey Cora. In the second, Mike Blowers hit a two-run homer to put the Mariners in front, 2‚Äì0. However, the Indians would put together a run in the next inning and in the seventh, Belle's homer tied the game at two. With Martinez still pitching in a tie game, the Mariners would take the lead thanks to Luis Sojo's go-ahead double in the bottom half of the seventh. Norm Charlton would come on in the eighth for a inning save. He would retire the side in order in the ninth, and the Mariners took Game 1. =Game 2= Wednesday, October 11, 1995, at Kingdome in Seattle, Washington The Indians' second veteran Orel Hershiser was called upon to stem the tide against Tim Belcher. Both pitchers dueled for four innings until the Indians broke through in the top of the fifth with a two-run single by Carlos Baerga. In the next inning, the Indians grabbed two more on a Manny Ram√≠rez homer and an RBI triple by Sandy Alomar, Jr.. Ken Griffey, Jr.'s sixth postseason homer put the Mariners on the board to make it 4‚Äì1 in the bottom of the sixth. The Indians would put the game away when Manny Ram√≠rez hit his second homer of the game in the eighth to make it 5‚Äì1. Hershiser would give way to Jos√© Mesa in the ninth. Mesa would issue a one-out homer to Jay Buhner but would recover to close out the win. With the victory, Hershiser raised his postseason record to 6‚Äì0 with a 1.47 ERA in innings.The Glorious Indian Summer of 1995, p.164, Russell Schneider, Russell Schneider Enterprises, Cleveland, =Game 3= Friday, October 13, 1995, at Jacobs Field in Cleveland, Ohio In Game 3, the starting pitchers were Randy Johnson and Charles Nagy. Nagy and Johnson pitched a scoreless first but the Mariners broke through on a homer by Jay Buhner. Then an error in the third by √Ålvaro Espinoza gave the Mariners one more run to make it 2‚Äì0 Seattle. The Indians put a run on the board after a leadoff triple by Kenny Lofton and a sac fly by Omar Vizquel in the fourth. In the bottom of the eighth, Buhner missed a deep fly ball to right; Lofton then singled through the left side to tie the game at two. The game moved to extra innings and in the eleventh, Buhner, whose miscue tied the game, got sweet redemption with a three-run home run to give the Mariners a 5‚Äì2 lead. Charlton, pitching in relief since the ninth inning, got the win and shut down the Indians in the bottom of the eleventh. =Game 4= Saturday, October 14, 1995, at Jacobs Field in Cleveland, Ohio With their backs to the wall in Game 4, Cleveland called on Ken Hill to help tie the series. Opposing him would be Andy Benes. Benes wouldn't fare well against Hill and the Cleveland hitters. The Indians put three on the board in the first, a rally capped by Murray's two-run homer. A sac fly by Kenny Lofton made it 4‚Äì0 in the second. Then the rain began to fall on Seattle's parade in the third as Benes surrendered a two-run homer to Jim Thome in the rain. Benes was done and the rain ended after the third was over. Hill would pitch beyond expectations and lead his team to an easy 7‚Äì0 shutout. =Game 5= Sunday, October 15, 1995, at Jacobs Field in Cleveland, Ohio Game 5 was a matchup between Chris Bosio and Orel Hershiser. Hershiser was looking to continue his excellence and he got help quickly when the Indians knocked home a run in the first thanks to an error by Tino Martinez. But Hershiser's slim lead would be cut in the third when Ken Griffey, Jr.'s RBI double tied the game. In the fifth, an error by Belle gave the Mariners the lead. The Mariners were closing in on a 3‚Äì2 series lead going home, but the Indians wouldn't allow it as Thome stepped to the plate in the sixth with a man on and hit a two-run homer to give the lead back to the Indians. The Mariners had their share of chances; in the seventh, they had men on the corners with one out and Griffey at the plate. Paul Assenmacher was summoned from the bullpen. He proceeded to strike out Griffey on a high fastball, then Jay Buhner stepped to the plate. In this situation, manager Mike Hargrove would usually bring in a right-hander, but he stayed with Assenmacher. He struck out Buhner on a low breaking ball and then slowly, stoically walked off the mound, with 40,000 fans screaming wildly. The Mariners could never capitalize on any more opportunities and Jos√© Mesa closed the door in the ninth. =Game 6= Tuesday, October 17, 1995, at Kingdome in Seattle, Washington In the potential clincher, Dennis Mart√≠nez faced Randy Johnson. Both pitchers kept the game scoreless until the top of the fifth. A key error by Joey Cora allowed Kenny Lofton to single home a run to put the Indians up. With the score still 1‚Äì0 in the eighth, the Indians put three runs together against Johnson. A passed ball with two men in scoring position allowed both of them to score. Kenny Lofton made a mad dash from second base, sliding in just ahead of the tag from Johnson, and the entire Cleveland dugout ran onto the field to celebrate. Then Carlos Baerga followed with a homer to give the Indians a commanding 4‚Äì0 lead with six outs to go. Once again, Jos√© Mesa came on to close the door in the ninth and did so with ease. The Indians had won their first pennant since 1954. The Mariners were one of the very few teams to have lost in two shutouts in one series.

ULA is the largest public university in the Venezuelan Andes, having one of the largest student bodies in the country. History Fray Juan Ramos de Lora, Founder of University of the Andes. ULA was initially established as a Catholic seminary on March 29, 1785 by the Bishop of M√©rida, Friar Juan Ramos de Lora. De Lora called the newly founded house of studies \\"Real Colegio Seminario de San Buenaventura de M√©rida\\", or Royal Seminary College of San Buenaventura of M√©rida. The school was elevated to the status of Royal University of San Buenaventura of M√©rida de los Caballeros on September 21, 1810, entitling it to confer junior and senior degrees in Philosophy, Medicine, Civil and Canonical (Catholic) Law, and Theology. Universidad de Los Andes maintained its affiliation with the Catholic Church until 1832, when the president of Venezuela, General Jos√© Antonio P√°ez, passed an act making it a secular institution. Currently, Universidad de Los Andes operates two campuses in M√©rida, with about a dozen faculties spread throughout the city, as well as two satellite campuses in the other Venezuelan Andean states of Tachira and Trujillo.

It was later retroactively classified as the second studio album by experimental pop band Animal Collective. Background Only one thousand copies were made for the Catsup Plate release, but it was reissued as a double CD along with Spirit They're Gone, Spirit They've Vanished in 2003 on FatCat Records. Band member Geologist, who joined Avey Tare and Panda Bear for the first time on this release, has said that this is perhaps his favorite Animal Collective album, despite its general lack of popularity among fans and critics. The album was recorded in many different locations, including Avey's parent's house, the house the band shared in Brooklyn Heights, and Geologist's college dorm room and radio station. To create the sounds the group made use of guitar, synths, samples, and did percussion with whatever was lying around. The band's goal in the recording and production of the album was to experiment with extreme frequencies and how they were perceived by the listener. This created a challenge during the mastering process, as they could not raise the volume of the whole mix without causing the sounds to digitally distort. Geologist had this to say about the recording of the album on the Collected Animals forum: For the Spirit/Danse reissue on FatCat Records, Danse Manatee was remastered by Sung Tongs producer Rusty Santos. \\"Essplode\\" and \\"Lablakely Dress\\" were later re-worked as a mashup with \\"Fireworks\\" from Strawberry Jam for live performances during 2007 through 2009.

La lucha sigue (\\"Chav√©z lives. The struggle continues\\") Since 2 February 1999, Venezuela saw sweeping and radical shifts in social policy, moving away from the government officially embracing a free-market economy and neoliberal reform principles and towards income redistribution and social welfare programs. Then-President Hugo Ch√°vez dramatically shifted Venezuela's traditional foreign policy alignment. Instead of continuing Venezuela's past alignment with the United States and European strategic interests, Ch√°vez promoted alternative development and integration policies targeted the Global South. Ch√°vez died in office on 5 March 2013 and was succeeded by his Vice President Nicol√°s Maduro, who gained a slim majority in the 14 April 2013 special election and has ruled by decree for the majority of the period between 19 November 2013 through 2018. Background: 1970‚Äì1992 Hugo Ch√°vez's political activity began in the 1980s and 1990s, a period of economic downturn and social upheaval in Venezuela.On the economic and social situation: Lander, pp 21‚Äì25; McCaughan, pp 31‚Äì34; The Militant, 21 December 1998. Venezuela's economic well-being fluctuated with the unstable demand for its primary export commodity, oil. Oil accounts for three-quarters of Venezuela's exports, half of its government's fiscal income, and a quarter of the nation's GDP.Venezuela Information Office, \\"A More Just Foreign Policy?\\" (see Sources section) p 67. The 1970s were boom years for oil, during which the material standard of living for all classes in Venezuela improved. This was partly due to the ruling AD and COPEI parties' investing in social welfare projects which, because of the government's oil income, they could do without heavily taxing private wealth.\\"The upper and middle classes did not see their ever-increasing levels of consumption and cosmopolitan cultural orientation as threatened by popular demands, since state income continued to rise. Expanded education, health, and public works expenditure did not depend on taxing private wealth.\\" - Lander, p 21. \\"Venezuelan workers enjoyed the highest wages in Latin America and subsidies in food, health, education and transport.\\"McCaughan, p 31. However, \\"toward the end of the 1970s, these tendencies began to reverse themselves.\\"Lander, p 22. Per capita oil income and per capita income both declined, leading to a foreign debt crisis and forced devaluation of the bolivar in 1983. The negative trend continued through the 1990s. \\"Per capita income in 1997 was 8 percent less than in 1970; workers' income during this period was reduced by approximately half.\\" \\"Between 1984 and 1995 the percentage of people living below the poverty line jumped from 36 percent to 66 percent, while the number of people suffering from extreme poverty tripled, from 11 percent to 36 percent.\\"McCaughan, p 32. Along with these economic changes came various changes in Venezuelan society. Class division intensified, as summarised by Edgardo Lander:Lander, p 22 > A sensation of insecurity became generalized throughout the population, > constituting \\"an emerging culture of violence. . . very distinct from the > culture of tolerance and peace that dominated Venezuelan society in the > past.\\" (Brice√±o Le√≥n et al., 1997: 213). Along with unemployment, personal > safety topped the problems perceived as most serious by the population. > Between 1986 and 1996 the number of homicides per 10,000 inhabitants jumped > from 13.4 to 56, an increase of 418 percent, with most of the victims being > young males (San Juan, 1997: 232‚Äì233). Countless streets in the middle- and > upper-class neighborhoods were closed and privatized; increasingly, bars and > electric fences surrounded houses and buildings in these areas. The threat > represented by the \\"dangerous class\\" came to occupy a central place in the > media ‚Äì along with demands that drastic measures be taken, including the > death penalty or direct execution by the police. During this period, the prospect of a reasonably comfortable life for most Venezuelans, which had appeared attainable in the 1970s, became increasingly remote; poverty and exclusion appeared inescapable for many. According to Lander:Lander, p 23 > These crises-like conditions increasingly became permanent features of > society.

On the political front, the AD's Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez became president in 1989 on a platform of anti-neoliberalism, describing International Monetary Fund (IMF) structural adjustment recipes as \\"la-bomba-s√≥lo-mata-gente\\" ‚Äì the bomb that only kills people.McCaughan, p 32 However, shortly after attaining office, P√©rez, \\"faced with a severe crisis of international reserves, fiscal as well as trade and balance-of-payment deficits, and an external debt ($34 billionThe Militant, 21 December 1998.) that under these conditions could not be paid,\\" signed a letter of intent with the International Monetary Fund stipulating that he carry out a neoliberal adjustment program that entailed privatisation, deregulation, and the dismantling of social welfare programs and subsidies.The quote is from Lander, p 25. On the IMF program, McCaughan p 32. The agreement was not submitted to parliamentary consultation and was made public only after having been signed.Lander, p 25 On 25 February 1989, the government announced an increase in gasoline prices, and two days later a public transit price rise precipitated the Caracazo, a series of mass demonstrations and riots in Caracas and Venezuela's other principal cities.Lander, p 25, says \\"the principal cities of the country.\\" P√©rez suspended civil rights and imposed martial law. The military's suppression of the rebellion resulted in, by the government's own admission, 300 deaths; and others estimate the toll at more than 1000.Mc Caughan, p 34; Lander, p 25; The Militant, 21 December 1998. =1992 and beyond= Ch√°vez, who had been involved since the early 1980s in a leftist group in the military called the Movimiento Bolivariano Revolucionario 200 (MBR 200), first came to national prominence as the leader of a coup attempt on P√©rez in February 1992. Although the attempt failed, before being imprisoned Ch√°vez was granted one minute on national television, during which he apologised for the loss of lives and called on his forces to cease fighting, but also defended his goals of reform and stated famously that he was putting down his weapons \\"por ahora\\" ‚Äì for now ‚Äì implying that he might one day return. That brief television appearance gave Ch√°vez national recognition and caused him to become for many a heroic symbol of resistance to the disliked regime.McCaughan, p 35. Also, The Militant, 21 December 1998: \\"Both Democratic action and COPEI were completely discredited after those events, while Ch√°vez was elevated to hero status. For weeks after the coup, slum residents rallied in support of the arrested officers.\\" P√©rez survived another coup attempt in November 1992, but was impeached by Congress in 1993 for illegally using $17 million to finance the campaign of Violetta Chamorro in Nicaragua and his own inauguration fiesta.McCaughan, p 36. New York Times, 21 May 1993, said that P√©rez was accused by the prosecutor of making about $10 million by changing a discretionary fund into dollars at a preferential rate, then, after an 88% devaluation of the Bolivar, reconverting it to Bolivares. Rafael Caldera, campaigning on an anti-neoliberal platform, succeeded him by winning elections in December 1993 with 30% of the vote to his nearest rival's 23%.McCaughan, p 43; New York Times, 5 December 1993 As per one of his election promises, he released Ch√°vez and other army dissidents in March 1994. Like P√©rez, however, he reversed himself on economic policy, adopting IMF programs in 1996 and 1997 that stipulated neoliberal adjustment and opened the state oil industry to private investment.McCaughan, p 44. In November 1996, about 1.3 million workers walked off the job in a general public sector strike; and in late August 1998, Caldera obtained legislation from Congress enabling him to rule by decree.On the strike: Workers World 9 December 1996. On the legislation to govern by decree: BBC World Service, 28 August 1998. During this period, the late 1990s, the principal leftist parties were La Causa Radical (LCR), which won 48 congressional seats in 1993, and the Movimiento al Socialismo (MAS). Hugo Ch√°vez and the MBR 200 also remained active. At the MBR 200 national assembly in December 1996, its members voted to participate in the upcoming 1998 presidential and 1998 parliamentary elections, and created a new organisation, the Fifth Republic Movement (Movimiento Quinta Rep√∫blica, MVR) intended to unite groups opposed to the mainstream parties.McCaughan, p 47. Ch√°vez's bid for the presidency was supported by a coalition called the Polo Patri√≥tico (Patriotic Pole, PP) which, besides Ch√°vez's MVR, included the PPT, and significant portions of the MAS, LCR, Movimiento Primero de Mayo, and Bandera Roja.McCaughan, p 48. The major planks in the election platform enunciated by Ch√°vez during his 1998 campaign included the following: *Reorientation of the oil industry: **Cease privatisation of the state oil company, Petr√≥leos de Venezuela. **Review concessions that the state had granted to foreign oil companies(New York Times, 2 September 1998, section A, page 11). **Redistribute income from the oil industry to more benefit the lower economic classes(BBC World Service, 9 November 1998). *Pursue an economic course independent of global capitalist, especially United States, dictates; he characterised this as a \\"third way\\", an alternative to \\"neo-liberalismo salvage\\", \\"savage neo-liberalism\\"(La Jornada, Mexico, 3 December 1998; also The Militant, 21 December 1998). *Rewrite the 1961 constitution. He proposed to hold a referendum seeking approval to dissolve Congress and convene an elected \\"constitutional assembly\\" whose task would be to write a new constitution(New York Times, 8 December 1998, section A, page 26; The Militant, 21 December 1998). *Attack corruption, which he said eats up 15% of public revenues(New York Times, 2 September 1998, A 11; El Nuevo Diario, Managua, 8 October 1998; La Jornada, Mexico, 3 December 1998; New York Times, 8 December 1998, A 26). *Crack down on the epidemic of tax evasion by major contributors(El Nuevo Diario, Managua, 8 October 1998; La Jornada, Mexico, 3 December 1998; New York Times, 8 December 1998, A 26). *Raise the minimum wage, provide a 30,000 Bolivar ($53) stipend to the unemployed, improve job security and retirement guarantees, increase spending on job creation and education.(The Militant, 21 December 1998; U.S. News & World Report, 13 December 1998). 1999: Economic crisis and new constitution With many Venezuelans tired of politics in the country, the 1998 elections had the lowest voter turnout in Venezuelan history, with Ch√°vez winning the presidency on 6 December 1998 with 56.4% of the popular vote. His nearest opponent was Henrique Salas R√∂mer with about 40%.L√≥pez Maya, p 12. He took the presidential oath of office on 2 February 1999, the principal points of his mandate were to reform the constitution, break up what his supporters perceived as an entrenched oligarchy, reverse Venezuela's economic decline, strengthen the role of the state in the economy, and redistribute wealth to the poor. Ch√°vez's first few months in office were dedicated primarily to constitutional reform, while his secondary focus was on immediately allocating more government funds to new social programs. However, as a recession triggered by historically low oil prices and soaring international interest rates rocked Venezuela, the shrunken federal treasury provided very little of the resources Ch√°vez required for his promised massive populist programs. The economy, which was still staggering, shrunk by 10% and the unemployment rate increased to 20%, the highest level since the 1980s. Ch√°vez sharply diverged from previous administrations' economic policies, terminating their practice of extensively privatizing Venezuela's state-owned holdings, such as the national social security system, holdings in the aluminum industry, and the oil sector.Ellner, Steve. (North American Congress on Latin America (NACLA), 17 October 2005). \\"Venezuela's \\"Demonstration Effect\\": Defying Globalization's Logic\\". Venezuelanalysis.com. Retrieved 9 November 2005. Ch√°vez worked to reduce Venezuelan oil extraction in the hopes of garnering elevated oil prices and, at least theoretically, elevated total oil revenues, thereby boosting Venezuela's severely deflated foreign exchange reserves. He extensively lobbied other OPEC countries to cut their production rates as well. As a result of these actions, Ch√°vez became known as a \\"price hawk\\" in his dealings with the oil industry and OPEC. Ch√°vez also attempted a comprehensive renegotiation of 60-year-old royalty payment agreements with oil giants Philips Petroleum and ExxonMobil.Center for Cooperative Research. Profile: Hugo Ch√°vez Frias . Retrieved 8 November 2005. These agreements had allowed the corporations to pay in taxes as little as 1% of the tens of billions of dollars in revenues they were earning from their extraction of Venezuelan oil. Afterwards, Ch√°vez stated his intention to complete the nationalization of Venezuela's oil resources. Although unsuccessful in his attempts to renegotiate with the oil corporations, Ch√°vez focused on his stated goal of improving both the fairness and efficiency of Venezuela's formerly lax tax collection and auditing system, especially for major corporations and landholders. Ch√°vez wished to promote the redistribution of wealth, increased regulation, and social spending, he did not wish to discourage foreign direct investment (FDI). In keeping with his predecessors, Ch√°vez attempted to shore up FDI influxes to prevent an economic crisis of chronic capital flight and inflation. Despite such actions and a tripling in oil prices, capital flight more than doubled from $4 billion in 1999 to $9 billion in 2002 due to the uncertainties of Ch√°vez's controversial actions. In April 1999, Ch√°vez ordered all branches of the military to devise programs to combat poverty and to further civic and social development in Venezuela's vast slum and rural areas. This civilian-military program was launched as \\"Plan Bolivar 2000\\", and was heavily patterned after a similar program enacted by Cuban President Fidel Castro during the early 1990s, while the Cuban people were still suffering through the \\"Special Period\\". Projects within Plan Bolivar 2000s scope included road building, housing construction, and mass vaccination. Though the plan initially had $20.8 million set aside for costs, some state that the program cost Venezuela approximately $113 million, nearly five times as more than planned.Gott 2005. pp. 178‚Äì179.Kozloff 2006. pp. 83‚Äì84.Marcano and Tyszka 2007. p. 138. The plan faltered at the end of 2001 with accusations and revelations of corruption by military officers, including both military officers who later rebelled against the president in April 2002 and officers linked to the president.Text of report by Patrick J. O'Donoghue: \\"President Hugo Ch√°vez, Copyright 2004 British Broadcasting Corporation, BBC Monitoring Latin America - Political Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring, 19 January 2004. =New constitution= In April 1999, a national referendum was held, the question being whether to create an elected assembly to draw up a new Constitution of Venezuela. The result of the referendum was 71.8% in favour.Venezuela Information Center, \\"The truth about Venezuela's presidential election.\\" (see sources section.) Consequently, in July 1999, elections were held to choose delegates to the assembly. In these elections, Ch√°vez's slate of candidates received 52% of the vote but won 95% of the seats, 125 of the 131 seats, due to the voting procedures decided by the government beforehand. Fifty-four per cent of the eligible electorate did not vote.Election results are from McCaughan, p. 52. The job of the assembly, which was called the Assemblea Nacional Constituyente (ANC), was to come up with a new constitution in six months or less. The draft would then be submitted to the Venezuelan people for acceptance or rejection via a referendum. The Assembly set up 21 commissions to work on specific topics, including citizen power, indigenous rights, sovereignty, economic issues, defence, education, health, the environment, human rights, women, sport, culture and justice.McCaughan, p 56. Conflict soon arose between the Constitutional Assembly and the older institutions it was supposed to reform or replace. During his 1998 presidential campaign, and in advance of the 25 July elections to the Assembly, Ch√°vez had maintained that the new body would immediately have precedence over the existing National Assembly and the courts, including the power to dissolve them if it so chose.Russell Pelle, \\"Venezuela enters 2000 with progressive new constitution,\\" People's Weekly World. Against this, some of his opponents, including notably the chief justice of the supreme court, Cecilia Sosa Gomez, argued that the Constitutional Assembly must remain subordinate to the existing institutions until the constitution it produced had been ratified.Larry Rohter, \\"Voters Push Power Toward Venezuela Leader,\\" New York Times, 26 July 1999. In mid August 1999, the Constitutional Assembly moved to restructure the nations judiciary, giving itself the power to fire judges, seeking to expedite the investigations of corruption outstanding against what the New York Times estimated were nearly half of the nation's 4700 judges, clerks, and bailiffs.Larry Rohter, New York Times, 27 August 2009. On 23 August, the supreme court voted 8-6 that the Assembly was not acting unconstitutionally in assuming those powers; however, the next day Cecilia Sosa Gomez resigned in protest. Over 190 judges were eventually suspended on charges of corruption. Eventually the Supreme Court was also dissolved and new judges were appointed that were supporters of Ch√°vez. On 25 August, the Constitutional Assembly declared a \\"legislative emergency,\\" voting to limit the National Assembly's work to matters such as supervising the budget and communications. In response, the National Assembly, which in July had decided to go into recess until October to avoid conflict with the Constitutional Assembly, declared its recess over, effective 27 August. At one point the Constitutional Assembly prohibited the National Assembly from holding meetings of any sort. However, on 10 September, the two bodies reached an agreement allowing for their \\"coexistence\\" until the new constitution took effect.El Pais (Spanish), 11 September 1999 Venezuelan Constitution at the 2005 World Social Forum held in Porto Alegre, Brazil. On 20 November 1999 the Constitutional Assembly presented the proposed constitution that was to be accepted or rejected by the nation's voters. With 350 articles, it was one of the world's lengthiest. A general tendency of this Constitution is that it attempts to establish a participatory as well as a representative democracy. On specific points, it changes the country's official name from \\"Republic of Venezuela\\" to \\"Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\\". It also increased the presidential term of office from five to six years, allowed for two consecutive presidential terms rather than one, and introduced provisions for national presidential recall referendums‚Äîthat is, Venezuelan voters gained the right to remove the president from office before the expiration of his presidential term. Such referendums are activated by a petition to do so with the required number of signatures. The presidency was given more power, including the power to dissolve the National Assembly. The new constitution converted the formerly bicameral National Assembly into a unicameral legislature, and stripped it of many of its former powers. Provisions were made for a new position, the Public Defender, an office with the authority to check the activities of the presidency, the National Assembly, and the constitution. Ch√°vez characterized the Public Defender as the guardian of the \\"moral branch\\" of the new Venezuelan government, tasked with defending public and moral interests. The constitution is unusual in that it incorporates as rights not only those, such as freedom of expression and assembly, found in most liberal constitutions, but also \\"social human rights:\\" to employment, housing, and health care.Gregory Wilpert, \\"Venezuela's New Constitution\\", Venezuelanalysis.com, 27 August 2003. Retrieved 2009. On 15 December 1999, after weeks of heavy rain, statewide mudslides claimed the lives of an estimated 30,000 people. Critics claim Ch√°vez was distracted by the referendum and that the government ignored a civil defense report, calling for emergency measures, issued the day the floods struck. However, Ch√°vez's government rejected these claims.BBC News. (BBC, 29 December 1999). \\"Venezuela disaster 'worst this century'\\". Retrieved 10 June 2006.

During this same election, Ch√°vez himself stood for reelection. Going into the elections, Ch√°vez had control of all three branches of government. Ch√°vez's coalition also garnered a commanding two-thirds majority of seats in the National Assembly while Ch√°vez was reelected with 60% of the votes. The Carter Center monitored the 2000 presidential election; their report on that election stated that, due to lack of transparency, CNE partiality, and political pressure from the Ch√°vez government that resulted in early elections, it was unable to validate the official CNE results. However, they concluded that the presidential election legitimately expressed the will of the people.Neumann(2001), p. 10. Later, on 3 December 2000, local elections and a referendum were held. The referendum, backed by Ch√°vez, also proposed a law that would force Venezuela's labor unions to hold state-monitored elections. The referendum was widely condemned by international labor organisations‚Äîincluding the International Labour Organization‚Äîas undue government interference in internal union matters; these organisations threatened to apply sanctions on Venezuela.Neumann(2001), p. 73. = Enabling act and rule by decree = After the May and July 2000 elections, Ch√°vez backed the passage of a Ley Habilitante (enabling act) by the National Assembly. This act allowed Ch√°vez to rule by decree for one year. In November 2001, shortly before the Enabling Act was set to expire, Ch√°vez used it to put into place a set of 49 laws central to the implementation of his programs. These included a Hydrocarbons Law and a Land Law. The Land Law, or Ley de Tierras, proposed giving some of the many Venezuelans who have constructed makeshift homes in the barrios that surround the country's major cities legal title to the land they occupy. It also contained provisions for rural land reform, including: incentives for people to return to the countryside and farm; tax penalties against leaving cultivable land idle (intended to encourage large land owners to sell plots to people who want to farm); grants of federal land to qualified farmers; and limited, compensated, expropriation of idle portions of privately owned latifunda land for distribution to poor agriculturalists.Wingerter, p 32; McCaughan, p 68. With large oil incomes in Ch√°vez's first years of presidency, he had successfully initiated a land transfer program and had introduced several reforms aimed at improving the social welfare of the population. These reforms entailed the lowering of infant mortality rates; the implementation of a free, government-funded healthcare system; and free education up to the university level. By December 2001, inflation fell to 12.3% the lowest since 1986, while economic growth was steady at four percent.Hallinan, Conn (Foreign Policy in Focus 17 April 2006) U.S. Shadow Over Venezuela . Retrieved 12 July 2006. Ch√°vez's administration also reported an increase in primary school enrollment by one million students. The 49 laws, representing as they did the first major concrete step toward economic redistribution, were strenuously resisted by business and the former political establishment. McCaughan (2004: 65, 68) describes them as the \\"plus ultra non,\\" the \\"point of no return for Ch√°vez's troubled relations with business, church and media leaders.\\" Ch√°vez's clashes with multiple social groups he supposedly alienated and his close ties with controversial presidents Mohammad Khatami, Sadaam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi also hurt his approval rating. Nelson then says what hurt Ch√°vez's popularity the most was his relationship with Fidel Castro and Cuba, with Ch√°vez attempting to make Venezuela in Cuba's image. Venezuela became Cuba's largest trade partner while Ch√°vez, following Castro's example, consolidated the country's bicameral legislature into a single National Assembly and created community groups of loyal supporters allegedly trained as paramilitaries. Such actions created great fear among Venezuelans who felt like they were tricked and that Ch√°vez had dictatorial goals. = 2001 strikes and growing opposition to Ch√°vez = Ch√°vez's opposition originated from the response to the \\"cubanization\\" of Venezuela when mothers realized that the new textbooks in Venezuela were really Cuban books filled with revolutionary propaganda and with different covers causing them to protest. By the summer months of 2001, the opposition groups grew quickly from concerned mothers to labor unions, business interests, church groups, and right and leftwing political parties. The Venezuelan Federation of Chambers (c√°maras) of Commerce, - Fedec√°maras - and the Confederaci√≥n de Trabajadores de Venezuela (CTV) - a labour union federation with strong links to the AD partyMcCaughan, p 66. - then called for a general business strike (paro c√≠vico) for 10 December 2001 to protest the 49 laws. According to L√≥pez Maya, at this time the president of the Fedecamaras, Pedro Carmona Estanga, emerged as the leader of the opposition movement.Page 12. The paro \\"attracted thousands of people, many of them drawn by the employers' federation promise of a day's salary if they took to the streets.\\"McCaughan, p 72. With the strike, the positions of both government and opposition became more intractable. The opposition warned that if the 49 laws were not amended, they would take to the streets again to attempt to force the issue,McCaughan, 72 and later demanded the outright revocation of the laws.L√≥pez Maya, p 14 The government, for its part, refused to consider amending the laws.L√≥pez maya, p 14. 2002: Coup and strike/lockout The atmosphere of heightened confrontation initiated by the December 2001 paro c√≠vico continued into the year 2002. The opposition formed a \\"Coordinating group for Democracy and Freedom,\\" later known as the Democratic Coordinator (Coordinadora Democr√°tica, CD) to organise joint action against the government. On 23 January, the opposition staged a massive march, which was met by a counter march by government sympathisers. On 4 February, a pro- government march was countered by opposition marches in several cities.On the CD formation, and the 23 January and 4 February marches: L√≥pez Maya, p. 14 According to economist Francisco Rodr√≠guez, \\"real GDP contracted by 4.4 percent and the currency had lost more than 40 percent of its value in the first quarter of 2002 ... As early as January of that year, the Central Bank had already lost more than $7 billion in a futile attempt to defend the currency ... [an] economic crisis had started well before the political crisis‚Äîa fact that would be forgotten in the aftermath of the political tumult that followed.\\" A few months after the coup, in December 2002, the Ch√°vez presidency faced a two-month strike organized by management at the national oil company, Petr√≥leos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) when he took steps to dismiss 17,000 workers; the strike deepened the economic crisis and cut the government off from all-important oil revenue.Rodr√≠guez, Francisco (March/April 2008). \\"An Empty Revolution: The Unfulfilled Promises of Hugo Ch√°vez\\". Foreign Affairs. The CTV, supported by Fedec√°maras and other opposition groups, called for a one-day strike for 9 April 2002; later it extended the strike for 24 hours, and then announced that it would be indefinite, and called for a march to the PDVSA headquarters in Caracas on 11 April in protest.L√≥pez Maya, p 15. On late morning of the 11th, by which time hundreds of thousands of people were standing outside the PDVSA offices, CTV leader Carlos Ortega suddenly called for a continuation of the march to the presidential palace at Milaflores, saying \\"With a great sense of responsibility I address our nation to request in the name of democratic Venezuela. I do not rule out the possibility that the crowd, this human river marches united to Milaflores to expel a traitor to the Venezuelan people.\\" and explicitly stated an objective to \\"remove Ch√°vez.\\"First quote, McCaughan, p 88; second, L√≥pez Maya, p 15. At this time, however, Milaflores was already surrounded by Ch√°vez supporters who had been conducting a vigil there since 9 April to protect the president; and, when news of the opposition's movements spread, thousands more rushed there to augment the pro-Ch√°vez side. By early afternoon the two sides were about 200 metres apart.McCaughan, p 89. Around 2:30, shooting began with gunfire killing both Ch√°vez supporters and opposition while causing great confusion of who committed the violent actions. After the shooting had begun, a group of dissident military officers, headed by Vice Admiral Ramirez P√©rez, appeared on television and stated that \\"The President of the Republic has betrayed the trust of the people, he is massacring innocent people with snipers. Just now six people were killed and dozens wounded in Caracas.\\" and that because of this they no longer recognised Ch√°vez as president of Venezuela.Quote is from McCaughan, p 89. The message had been pre-recorded in the morning.. Ch√°vez took over the Venezuelan airwaves several times in the early afternoon in what is termed a cadena, or a commandeering of the media airwaves to broadcast public announcements, asking protesters to return to their homes, playing lengthy pre-recorded discourses, and attempting to block coverage of the ensuing violence. Then, unexpectedly, Lucas Rinc√≥n Romero, Commander-in-Chief of the National Armed Forces of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, announced in a nationwide broadcast that Ch√°vez had tendered his resignation from the presidency. While Ch√°vez was held in a military base, military leaders appointed the President of the Fedec√°maras, Pedro Carmona, as Venezuela's interim president. Immediately Carmona issued a decree nullifying the constitution, dissolving parliament and the supreme court, abolishing the ombudsman, and firing governors and mayors.McCaughan, p 92; L√≥pez Maya, p 16; Golinger, \\"Machine,\\" p 129. He also reverted the country's name to Rep√∫blica de Venezuela and reversed Ch√°vez's main social and economic policies, loosening credit controls and ending oil price quotas by raising production back to pre-Ch√°vez levels. The US government quickly gave diplomatic recognition to the coup plotters. Carmona's decrees were followed by pro- Ch√°vez uprisings and looting across Caracas. Responding to these disturbances, Venezuelan soldiers loyal to Ch√°vez called for massive popular support for a counter-coup. These soldiers later stormed and retook the presidential palace, and retrieved Ch√°vez from captivity. The shortest-lived government in Venezuelan history was thus toppled, and Ch√°vez resumed his presidency on the night of Saturday, 13 April 2002. Following this episode, Rinc√≥n was reappointed by Ch√°vez as Commander of the Army, and later as Interior Minister in 2003. =Controversy about the coup= Ch√°vez waves to supporters after disembarking at Salgado Filho Airport on 26 January 2003 while en route to the World Social Forum convened in Porto Alegre, Brazil (Ag√™ncia Brasil).

Carmona also met with U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell in Bogota, Colombia, on the second day of the 2002‚Äì2003 oil strike, and frequently met with the U.S. Ambassador to Colombia, Ann Paterson.Golinger, \\"Adaptable Machine,\\" p 134. Ch√°vez also claimed, during the coup's immediate aftermath, that the U.S. was still seeking his overthrow. On 6 October 2002, he stated that he had foiled a new coup plot, and on 20 October 2002, he stated that he had barely escaped an assassination attempt while returning from a trip to Europe. During that period, the US Ambassador to Venezuela warned the Ch√°vez administration of two potential assassination plots. =After the coup= Following his return to office, Ch√°vez quickly took steps to secure support for his government. First, Ch√°vez replaced key generals and held at least five top military leaders including the head of the army. Ch√°vez attempted conciliation by replacing some of his cabinet ministers with people more acceptable to the opposition, reinstating the PDVSA managers who he had fired in February and removing their replacements, and inviting various international figures and organisations to the country to help mediate between the government and opposition.L√≥pez Maya, p 17. Ch√°vez also took another measure to reduce the likelihood of a recurrence of the coup attempt: he sought to strengthen support among rank and file soldiers by boosting support programs, employment, and benefits for veterans. He also promulgated new civilian-military development initiatives. Despite these measures, conflict simmered throughout the rest of 2002. On 22 October 14 military officers who had been suspended for participating in the coup, led by General Enrique Medina G√≥mez, occupied the Francia de Altamira Plaza in a wealthy Eastern Caracas neighbourhood and declared it a \\"liberated territory\\".L√≥pez Maya, p 17; McCaughan, p 121. In early November, there was a major clash of government and opposition demonstrators in downtown Caracas; and, in the middle of the month, a shootout which resulted in three deaths occurred in Caracas' Bolivar Plaza between the Metropolitan Police and the National Guard.L√≥pez Maya, pp 17-18; McCaughan, p 120 has additional information on the conflict in and around the Metropolitain Police, who were controlled by the anti-Ch√°vez mayor of Caracas, Alfredo Pe√±a. Sometime in November, Ch√°vez replaced the commissioner of the force, Henry Vivas, with Gonzalo S√°nchez Delgado; whereupon the mayor ordered the police not to obey him. =Oil paro= Fedec√°maras and the CTV called for a fourth paro c√≠vico, which turned out to be the most serious, and is known as the 2002‚Äì2003 oil lockout/strike, to begin on 2 December 2002. The opposition also called a recall-referendum-petition-signature-gathering day for 4 December.McCaughan, p 123. The key element of the paro was the stoppage of production at Petr√≥leos de Venezuela, which was effected by management's locking workers out of facilities. According to some sources, it also included changing computer passwords so as to disable equipment,Venezuela: Technology and the Bolivarian Revolution and performing other acts of sabotage.INTESA, the information and technology enterprise that was formed to run electronic operations at Petr√≥leos de Venezuela, was at this time 60 per cent owned by a United States company, Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), which is \\"closely linked to the U.S. government\\", with \\"former chiefs of staff, ex-CIA agents, and high-level government employees comprising its board of directors.\\" (Golinger, \\"Machine\\", p 135.) During the work stoppage, INTESA refused requests by Petr√≥leos de Venezuela president Ali Rodriguez to provide him the computer access codes so that Petr√≥leos employees could operate the company's machinery. Eventually, Petr√≥leos employees had to enter INTESA headquarters and seize equipment to reestablish operations. Source: Golinger, \\"Machine\\", pp 135, 6, on INTESA; and Golinger, \\"Media\\", p 100, on the management's activities. Petroleum production soon fell to one-third normal; Venezuela had to begin importing oil to meet its foreign obligations; and domestically, gasoline for cars became virtually unobtainable, with many filling stations closed and long queues at others.One third normal: McCaughan, p 126; gas shortages: L√≥pez Maya, p 18. According to a previous version of this article, Venezuela's normal production of oil and oil derivatives before the strike was 2,800,000 barrells (450,000 m3) per day Many privately owned businesses closed or went on short time, some out of sympathy for the strike, others because of the fuel shortage and economic paralysis. The private media backed the strike: Eva Golinger writes that, \\"In support of the opposition's objectives, the private media symbolically joined the strike by suspending all regular programming and commercials and donating one hundred percent of air space to the opposition.\\"Golinger, \\"Machine\\", p 133. She also writes, in \\"Media War Against the People,\\" (p 101) that \\"The four primary stations suspended all regular programming throughout the duration of the 64-day strike: no product commercials, no soap operas, no movies, no cartoons, and no sitcoms. They broadcast an average of 700 pro-opposition advertisements each day, paid for by the stations themselves and by the opposition umbrella group, Democratic Coordinator.\\" Large pro- and anti-Ch√°vez marches were held in the first weeks of the strike, which on 9 December the opposition had declared to be of indefinite duration. Before the strike began to dissolve in February 2003, it produced severe economic dislocation. Reportedly, millions of citizens, even in the middle of Caracas, reverted to using wood fires to cook their food.Golinger, \\"Machine,\\" p 135. The country's GDP fell 25% during the first trimester of 2003; open unemployment, which was running about 15% before and after the shutdown, reached 20.3% in March 2003; the volume of crude oil produced was 5% less in 2003 than the previous year; and the volume of refined oil products was 17% less.L√≥pez Maya, p 19. Oil figures from OPEC, Annual Statistical Bulletin, 2004, tables 14, 19. The strike began to dissolve in February 2003, when \\"small- and medium-sized businesses reopened their doors, admitting that the strike now threatened to turn into a 'suicide watch' that could well bankrupt their businesses for good.\\"McCaughan, p 128. The government gradually reestablished control over PDVSA; oil production reached pre-strike levels by April 2003.McCaughan, p 128, says April, but I seem to recall that this is disputed. In the aftermath of the strike, the government fired 18,000 PDVSA employees, 40% of the company's workforce, for \\"dereliction of duty\\" during the strike.McCaughan, p 128; L√≥pez Maya, p 19.  2003‚Äì2004: Recall vote  A rally in Caracas. In 2003 and 2004 Ch√°vez launched a number of social and economic campaigns which had become possible as for the first time he had a good economy and the oil industry, which produces 80% of Venezuela's exports by value, 25% of its GDP, and 50% of the government's income, was for the first time not under hostile management. In July 2003 he launched \\"Mission Robinson\\", billed as a campaign aimed at providing free reading, writing and arithmetic lessons to the more than 1.5 million Venezuelan adults who were illiterate prior to his 1999 election. On 12 October 2003, Ch√°vez initiated \\"Mission Guaicaipuro\\", a program billed as protecting the livelihood, religion, land, culture, and rights of Venezuela's indigenous peoples. In late 2003, the Venezuelan president launched \\"Mission Sucre\\" (named after independence-war hero General Antonio Jose de Sucre), which is primarily a scholarship program for higher education. As of about 2005, it was giving out about 100,000 need-based grants each year to bright students who would have been financially barred from university education in the past.Wingerter, \\"People's Platform\\", p 36. In November 2003, Ch√°vez announced \\"Mission Ribas\\", with the promise of providing remedial education and diplomas for Venezuela's five million high school dropouts. On the first anniversary of Mission Robinson's establishment, Ch√°vez stated in Caracas's Teresa Carre√±o theater to an audience of 50,000 formerly illiterate Venezuelans, \\"in a year, we have graduated 1,250,000 Venezuelans.\\" Nevertheless, there were also significant setbacks. Notably, the inflation rate rocketed to 31% in 2002 and remained at the high level of 27% in 2003, causing a great deal of hardship for the poor. On 9 May 2004, a group of 126 Colombians were captured during a raid of a farm near Caracas. Ch√°vez soon accused them of being a foreign-funded paramilitary force who intended to violently overthrow his rule.BBC News. (BBC, 25 June 2004). \\"Colombian 'plotters' face charges\\".

Ch√°vez's allegations of a putative 2004 coup attempt continue to stir controversy and doubts to this day.

In early and mid-2003, S√∫mate, a grassroots volunteer civilian voter rights organization, began the process of collecting the millions of signatures needed to activate the presidential recall provision provided for in Ch√°vez's 1999 Constitution. In August 2003, around 3.2 million signatures were presented, but these were rejected by the pro-Ch√°vez majority in the Consejo Nacional Electoral (CNE; \\"National Electoral Council\\") on the grounds that many had been collected before the midpoint of Ch√°vez's presidential term.BBC News. (BBC News, 12 September 2003). \\"Chavez poll petition rejected\\". Retrieved 10 November 2005. Reports then began to emerge among opposition and international news outlets that Ch√°vez had begun to act punitively against those who had signed the petition, while pro-Ch√°vez individuals stated that they had been coerced by employers into offering their signatures at their workplaces. In November 2003, the opposition collected an entirely new set of signatures, with 3.6 million names produced over a span of four days. Riots erupted nationwide as allegations of fraud were made by Ch√°vez against the signature collectors. The provision in the Constitution allowing for a presidential recall requires the signatures of 20% of the electorate in order to effect a recall. Further, the cedulas (national identity card numbers) and identities of petition signers are not secret, and in fact were made public by Luis Tasc√≥n, a member of the Venezuelan National Assembly representing Ch√°vez' party (Fifth Republic Movement - MVR) and the Communist Party of Venezuela of T√°chira state. The government was accused of increasing the voter rolls by giving citizenship to illegal immigrants and refugees; and the opposition claimed that it was a citizenship for votes program. Voter registration increased by about 2 million people ahead of the referendum, which in effect raised the threshold of the 20% of the electorate needed to effect a recall.Bronstein, H. (14 June 2006), \\"Colombians in Venezuela thank Chavez for new life\\", Washington Post. Retrieved 22 June 2006. Reports again emerged that Ch√°vez and his allies were penalizing signers of the publicly posted petition. Charges were made of summary dismissals from government ministries, PDVSA, the state-owned oil corporation, the Caracas Metro, and public hospitals controlled by Ch√°vez's political allies. Finally, after opposition leaders submitted to the CNE a valid petition with 2,436,830 signatures that requested a presidential recall referendum, a recall referendum was announced on 8 June 2004 by the CNE. Ch√°vez and his political allies responded to this by mobilizing supporters to encourage rejection of the recall with a \\"no\\" vote. The recall vote itself was held on 15 August 2004.

Ch√°vez himself placed the development and implementation of the \\"Bolivarian Missions\\" once again at the forefront of his political agenda. Sharp increases in global oil prices gave Ch√°vez access to billions of dollars in extra foreign exchange reserves. Economic growth picked up markedly, reaching double-digit growth in 2004 and a 9.3% growth rate for 2005. Many new policy initiatives were advanced by Ch√°vez after 2004. In late March 2005, the Ch√°vez government passed a series of media regulations that criminalised broadcast libel and slander directed against public officials; prison sentences of up to 40 months for serious instances of character defamation launched against Ch√°vez and other officials were enacted. When asked if he would ever actually move to use the 40-month sentence if a media figure insulted him, Ch√°vez remarked that \\"I don't care if they [the private media] call me names.... As Don Quixote said, 'If the dogs are barking, it is because we are working.'\\"BBC Talking Point. (23 October 2005). \\"BBC's Robin Lustig interview to Hugo Chavez\\". Retrieved 21 June 2006. Ch√°vez also worked to expand his land redistribution and social welfare programs by authorizing and funding a multitude of new \\"Bolivarian Missions,\\" including \\"Mission Vuelta al Campo\\"; the second and third phases of \\"Mission Barrio Adentro\\", both first initiated in June 2005 with the stated aim of constructing, funding, and refurbishing secondary (integrated diagnostic center) and tertiary (hospital) public health care facilities nationwide; and \\"Mission Miranda, which established a national citizen's militia. Meanwhile, Venezuela's doctors went on strike, protesting the siphoning of public funds from their existing institutions to these new Bolivarian ones, run by Cuban doctors. Ch√°vez focused considerably on Venezuela's foreign relations in 2004 and 2005 via new bilateral and multilateral agreements, including humanitarian aid and construction projects. Ch√°vez has engaged, with varying degrees of success, numerous other foreign leaders, including Argentina's N√©stor Kirchner, China's Hu Jintao, Cuba's Fidel Castro, Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Russia's Vladimir Putin. On 4 March 2005, Ch√°vez publicly declared that the U.S.-backed Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) was \\"dead\\". Ch√°vez stated that the neoliberal model of development had utterly failed in improving the lives of Latin Americans, and that an alternative, anti- capitalist model would be conceived in order to increase trade and relations between Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil. Ch√°vez also stated his desire that a leftist, Latin American analogue of NATO be established. Argentinian President N√©stor Kirchner during the closing of a July 2004 joint press conference held in Venezuela (Office of the Argentine Presidency). Over the course of 2004 and 2005, the Venezuelan military under Ch√°vez also began in earnest to reduce weaponry sourcing and military ties with the United States. Ch√°vez's Venezuela is thus increasingly purchasing arms from alternative sources, such as Brazil, Russia, China and Spain. Friction over these sales escalated, and in response Ch√°vez ended cooperation between the militaries of the two countries. He also asked all active-duty U.S. soldiers to leave Venezuela. Additionally, in 2005 Ch√°vez announced the creation of a large \\"military reserve\\"‚Äîthe Mission Miranda program, which encompasses a militia of 1.5 million citizens‚Äîas a defensive measure against foreign intervention or outright invasion.Wagner, Sarah.

At the same time, he granted inalienable titles to over 6,800 square kilometres of land traditionally inhabited by Amazonian indigenous peoples to their respective resident natives, though this land could not be bought or sold as Western-style title deeds can. Ch√°vez cited these changes as evidence that his revolution was also a revolution for the defense of indigenous rights, such as those promoted by Ch√°vez's Mission Guaicaipuro. During this period, Ch√°vez placed much greater emphasis on alternative economic development and international trade models, much of it in the form of extremely ambitious hemisphere-wide international aid agreements. For example, on 20 August 2005, during the first graduation of international scholarship students from Cuba's Latin American School of Medicine, Ch√°vez announced that he would jointly establish with Cuba a second such medical school that would provide tuition-free medical training‚Äîan ex gratia project valued at between $20 and 30 billion‚Äîto more than 100,000 physicians who would pledge to work in the poorest communities of the Global South.

Ch√°vez has also taken ample opportunity on the international stage to juxtapose such projects with the manifest results and workings of neoliberal globalization. Most notably, during his speech at the 2005 UN World Summit, he denounced development models that are organised around neoliberal guidelines such as liberalisation of capital flows, removal of trade barriers, and privatisation as the reason for the developing world's impoverishment. Ch√°vez also went on to warn of an imminent global energy famine brought about by hydrocarbon depletion (based on Hubbert peak theory), stating that \\"we are facing an unprecedented energy crisis....

New York Daily News (21 September 2006). =Latin American Summit incident= In November 2007 at the Ibero-American Summit in Santiago de Chile, Ch√°vez and Spanish Prime Minister Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero were engaged in a heated exchange. Ch√°vez, irritated by Zapatero's suggestion that Latin America needed to attract more foreign capital, referred to former Spanish Prime Minister Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar as a fascist. Zapatero asked Ch√°vez to use proper decorum. Although his microphone had by that point been turned off as his time was up, Zapatero was within earshot and engaged with Ch√°vez who continued to interrupt the prime minister, attempting to make a point. King Juan Carlos I of Spain then pointed his finger at Ch√°vez, telling him, \\"¬øPor qu√© no te callas?\\" (Why don't you shut up?). Ch√°vez later said he did not hear Juan Carlos. President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, next to speak, ceded a minute of his time to Ch√°vez to allow him to finish his point. Ortega then proceeded to add emphasis to Ch√°vez's points by suggesting that Spain had used intervention in his country's elections. Ortega also referred to the monopoly of the Spanish energy company Union Fenosa on the impoverished counties' privatized power utility. The king, followed by an aide, stood up and walked out of the event‚Äîan unprecedented diplomatic incident, especially because the king had never before shown any sign of irritability. =Constitutional referendum= On 15 August 2007, Chavez called for an end to presidential term limits. He also proposed limiting central bank autonomy, strengthening state expropriation powers and providing for public control over international reserves as part of an overhaul of Venezuela's constitution. In accordance with the 1999 constitution, Chavez proposed the changes to the constitution, which were then approved by the National Assembly. The final test was a 2 December 2007 referendum. On 1 November 2007, a massive protest was staged in Caracas, led by many Venezuelan students, calling on the National Electoral Council in Caracas to postpone the referendum on the proposed constitutional reforms. Chavistas holding a demonstration in support of the reforms clashed with the protesters and the scene turned violent, prompting police action. Since then, the global community has criticized Chavez for excessive police action. The President denounced the opposition protest as resorting to \\"fascist violence\\" on 9 November 2007. On 26 November 2007 the Venezuelan government broadcast and circulated an alleged confidential memo from the US embassy to the CIA. The memo allegedly contains an update on US clandestine operations against the Chavez government. Although Independent analysts find it to be \\"quite suspect\\". Two days before the constitutional referendum, Ch√°vez threatened to cut off oil shipments to the US if it criticized the voting results. The referendum was defeated on 2 December 2007, with 51% of the voters rejecting the amendments proposed by Ch√°vez. Ch√°vez stated that he would step down at the end of his second term in 2013. In November 2008, he proposed another constitutional amendment removing term limits, so that he could remain in office until as late as 2021. This time, the resolution passed with 54% voting in favor after 94% of the votes have been counted. From 2009: Term limits eliminated and human rights abuses On 15 February 2009, Ch√°vez won a referendum to eliminate term limits, allowing him to run for re-election indefinitely. Subsequently, polls showed most Venezuelans did not want him to continue indefinitely, and expressed increasing concern over crime, the economy, and infrastructure; and increasing consolidation of power. A staunch former ally who was instrumental in returning Ch√°vez to power in 2002, Ra√∫l Baduel, broke with Ch√°vez after being charged with corruption and accused him of being a tyrant. * In March 2009 the Venezuelan government banned trawl fishing, largely employed by shrimp boats for shrimp exports, in a measure aimed at supporting coastal biodiversity and supporting the livelihoods of small fishermen. Small-scale fishermen, who account for 70% of Venezuela's fish production, have petitioned for the measure for decades.Venezuelanalysis.com, 17 March 2009, Venezuela Bans Controversial \\"Trawl\\" Fishing A 2010 OAS report indicated \\"achievements with regard to the eradication of illiteracy, the set up of a primary health network, land distribution and the reduction of poverty\\", and \\"improvements in the areas of economic, social, and cultural rights\\". The report also found \\"blistering\\" concerns with freedom of expression, human rights abuses, authoritarianism, and \\"the existence of a pattern of impunity in cases of violence\\", as well as erosion of separation of powers and \\"severe economic, infrastructure, and social headaches\\". Ch√°vez rejected the 2010 OAS report, calling it \\"pure garbage\\", and said Venezuela should boycott the OAS; a spokesperson said, \\"We don't recognize the commission as an impartial institution\\". He disclaims any power to influence the judiciary. A Venezuelan official said the report distorts and takes statistics out of context, saying that \\"human rights violations in Venezuela have decreased\\". According to the National Public Radio, the report discusses decreasing rights of opposition to the government and \\"goes into heavy detail\\" about control of the judiciary. It says elections are free, but the state has increasing control over media and state resources used during election campaigns, and opposition elected officials have \\"been prevented from actually carrying out their duties afterward\\". American economist Mark Weisbrot of the Center for Economic and Policy Research said that the government controls 5‚Äì6% of all media outlets in the country; Le Monde diplomatique say 70% of the country's radio and TV stations are privately owned. Weisbrot, writing for The Guardian, observed that \\"a journalist can say almost anything about Ch√°vez or his government and it is unlikely to be challenged, so long as it is negative\\", saying Venezuela is the most lied-about country in the world. CNN says the \\"lack of independence by Venezuela's judiciary and legislature in their dealings with Chavez often leads to the abuses\\", and the Wall Street Journal blames the government of Chavez. On 7 October 2012, Ch√°vez won his country's presidential election for a third time, defeating Henrique Capriles for another six-year term. The American press has often demonized the political process in the country, calling the government a \\"dictatorship\\". However, former US President Jimmy Carter, through his not-for-profit organization Carter Center, remarked, \\"As a matter of fact, of the 92 elections that we've monitored, I would say that the election process in Venezuela is the best in the world.\\" His victory was short-lived, however, as Chavez died five months later, on 5 March 2013. = Crime statistics = The Ch√°vez government has often been criticized for letting crime worsen. The murder rate in Venezuela was about 19 murders per 100,000 in 1999. It had risen to 75 murders per 100,000 for 2011 according to non-governmental sources and to 48 murders per 100,000 upon admission by the Minister of Justice. The national government stopped publishing regular data on the murder rate in 2004. However, in 2009, then Minister of Interior Affairs and Justice Tareck el-Aissami started massive reforms in police and security services and started to replace \\"old\\" police with new \\"bolivarian\\" police. According to new statistics, in area where \\"old\\" police was replaced by \\"bolivarian\\" police, criminality including murders dropped by 30‚Äì50%. Despite the efforts, the murder rate reached new record highs in 2011 and again in 2012. = Arms importation = Venezuela became the eighth-most-important weapons importing country in 2011 according to the Russian Centre for the Analysis of the Arms Trade, surpassing Turkey and Pakistan. As of 2012, Venezuela had about US$7.2 billion in debt for the purchase of weapons from Russia. =Nicol√°s Maduro= President Maduro was formally inaugurated as President of Venezuela on 19 April 2013, after the election commission had promised a full audit of the election results.\\"Nicolas Maduro sworn in as new Venezuelan president\\". BBC News. 19 April 2013. Retrieved 19 April 2013.Kroth, Olivia (18 April 2013). \\"Delegations from 15 countries to assist Maduro's inauguration in Venezuela\\". Pravda.ru. Retrieved 18 April 2013. In October 2013, Maduro requested an enabling law to rule by decree in order to fight corruptionMaduro requests enabling law for one year (El Universal) and to also fight what he called an 'economic war'. On 24 October, he also announced the creation of a new agency, the Vice Ministry of Supreme Happiness, to coordinate all social programmes. In November 2013, weeks before the local elections, President Maduro used his special decree powers and ordered the military to take over appliance stores. Analysts said that the move amounted to a \\"cannibalizing\\" of the economy and that it might lead to even more shortages in the future. An article by The Guardian noted that a \\"significant proportion\\" of the subsidized basic goods in short supply were being smuggled into Colombia and sold for far higher prices. In February 2014, the government said it had confiscated more than 3,500 tons of contraband on the border with Colombia‚Äîfood and fuel which, it said, was intended for \\"smuggling\\" or \\"speculation.\\" The president of the National Assembly, Diosdado Cabello, said that the confiscated food should be given to the Venezuelan people, and should not be \\"in the hands of these gangsters.\\" On 28 March 2017, the Venezuelan Supreme Court removed the immunity for parliamentary assembly members, the majority of whom were anti-Maduro. On 30 March 2017, the Venezuelan Supreme Court took over law making powers from the National Assembly, but this decision was reversed on 1 April 2017. The process and results of the May 2018 Venezuelan presidential election were widely disputed. Also available online. The opposition-majority National Assembly declared Maduro's presidency illegitimate on the day of his second inauguration, citing the 1999 Constitution of Venezuela enacted under Hugo Ch√°vez, Maduro's predecessor. The body declared that his reelection was invalid, and declared its president, Juan Guaid√≥, to be acting president of the country. The pro-Maduro Supreme Tribunal of Justice said the National Assembly's declaration was unconstitutional. Since January there has been a presidential crisis in Venezuela.

They are innervated by the fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical spinal nerves (C4-C6). The anterior and middle scalene muscles lift the first rib and bend the neck to the same side; the posterior scalene lifts the second rib and tilts the neck to the same side. The muscles are named . Structure The scalene muscles originate from the transverse processes from the cervical vertebrae of C2 to C7 and insert onto the first and second ribs.alt= =Anterior scalene= The anterior scalene muscle (), lies deeply at the side of the neck, behind the sternocleidomastoid muscle. It arises from the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical vertebrae, and descending, almost vertically, is inserted by a narrow, flat tendon into the scalene tubercle on the inner border of the first rib, and into the ridge on the upper surface of the second rib in front of the subclavian groove. It is supplied by the anterior ramus of cervical nerve 5 and 6.alt= = Middle scalene = The middle scalene, (), is the largest and longest of the three scalene muscles. The middle scalene arises from the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the lower six cervical vertebrae. It descends along the side of the vertebral column to insert by a broad attachment into the upper surface of the first rib, posterior to the subclavian groove. The brachial plexus and the subclavian artery pass anterior to it. alt= =Posterior scalene= The posterior scalene, () is the smallest and most deeply seated of the scalene muscles. It arises, by two or three separate tendons, from the posterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the lower two or three cervical vertebrae, and is inserted by a thin tendon into the outer surface of the second rib, behind the attachment of the anterior scalene. It is supplied by cervical nerves C5, C6 and C7. It is occasionally blended with the middle scalene. =Variation= A fourth muscle, the scalenus minimus (Sibson's muscle), is sometimes present behind the lower portion of the anterior scalene. Function The anterior and middle scalene muscles lifts the first rib and bends the neck to the same side as the acting muscle; the posterior scalene lifts the second rib and tilts the neck to the same side. Because they elevate the upper ribs they also act as accessory muscles of respiration, along with the sternocleidomastoids. =Relations= The scalene muscles have an important relationship to other structures in the neck. The brachial plexus and subclavian artery pass between the anterior and middle scalenes. The subclavian vein and phrenic nerve pass anteriorly to the anterior scalene as the muscle crosses over the first rib. The phrenic nerve is oriented vertically as it passes in front of the anterior scalene, while the subclavian vein is oriented horizontally as it passes in front of the anterior scalene muscle. The passing of the brachial plexus and the subclavian artery through the space of the anterior and middle scalene muscles constitute the scalene hiatus (the term \\"scalene fissure\\" is also used). The region in which this lies is referred to as the scaleotracheal fossa. It is bounded by the clavicle inferior anteriorly, the trachea medially, posteriorly by the trapezius, and anteriorly by the platysma muscle. Clinical significance The anterior and middle scalene muscles can be involved in certain forms of thoracic outlet syndrome as well as myofascial pain syndrome, the symptoms of which may mimic a spinal disc herniation of the cervical vertebrae. Since the nerves of the brachial plexus pass through the space between the anterior and middle scalene muscles, that area is sometimes targeted with the administration of regional anesthesia by an anesthesia provider. The nerve block, called an interscalene block, may be performed prior to arm or shoulder surgery. According to the medical codes in the 2016 Procedural Coding Expert, published by the American Academy of Professional Coders, for Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) and other medical codes, the scalenus anticus muscle can be divided by reparative or reconstructive surgery, with (# 21705) or without (# 21700) resection of the cervical rib.

There is a presidential retreat on this island, and the residential complex reserved for the military houses consists mainly of elevated houses made of wooden logs. There is also a court for bolas criollas. All the facilities are connected by pathways, mostly unpaved but smooth and clean. History The Spanish explorer Alonso de Santa Cruz described the island, calling it Orchilla, in the first half of the 16th century: > ...to the east of this island [Tortuga] for eight leagues is another joy, > Orchilla, eight leagues long and seven wide, with two islands to the south > of it; this name was given because there is a lot of Orchilla, of which we > speak long in the islands of Canaria General Islario... In 1589 by order of the Spanish governor Diego de Osorio La Orchila and other islands like Los Roques were formally taken over by the Spanish Crown. At the end of the 16th century the islands were considered part of the Province of Venezuela. The author M.D. Teenstra wrote in 1836 (in his book The Dutch West Indies): > The government of Cura√ßao also includes the uninhabited islets and rocks > Little Cura√ßao, Aves, Roques and Orchilla.\\" He goes on to say that > \\"Orchilla, although we consider it to belong to Cura√ßao, is of too little > importance to justify any dispute with Spain which claims this island as > well. The Republic of Venezuela also considers it theirs and their coastal > guard often chases away the fishermen from Cura√ßao who go there to collect > shell fish, fire wood, grass and hay, turtles, and birds' eggs or burn lime. Around the year 1870 the American company Philadelphia Guano Company was established in this group of islands, dedicated to the exploitation and exportation of guano, arriving to install a factory that would be abandoned over the years. On August 22, 1871 it became part of the Colon Territory, an administrative division created under the government of General Antonio Guzm√°n Blanco, which was later dissolved. In 1938, along with other islands, it became part of the Federal Dependencies created by law that same year. Until the 1950's it was populated by some 121 inhabitants, who were evicted during the government of General Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez (1952-58). Under his regime, some military installations and about thirty small houses were built, among them a presidential residence, designed by Julio Barreiro Rivas and which would be frequented by the governor and his close associates. Many of the successive Venezuelan presidents also used it as a summer residence, among them the former social democrat president Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez (1974-79 and 1989-93). In 1978 Venezuela and the Kingdom of the Netherlands established the marine limits between the Federal Dependencies and the Dutch Antilles in the Caribbean Sea. Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez was imprisoned on the island during the April 2002 coup. On March 14, 2009, Russian Air Force Major General Anatolii Zhikharev, head of the Russian Air Force's Long-Range Aviation, reported that Venezuela has offered Russia the use of the Antonio Diaz Naval Air Station on the island to base its strategic bombers.Carl Rosenberg and Phil Gunson, \\"Report: Russians to land long-range bomber aircraft in Venezuela,\\" Miami Herald, March 15, 2009. Chavez however denied this, which Kremlin official Alexei Pavlov prompted to say that the military just spoke about 'technical possibilities'. In October 2011 the Orchila and its adjacent islands are integrated to the Francisco de Miranda Island Territory, a subdivision of the Federal Dependencies with capital in Los Roques. In 2018, the Russian military released a plan to deploy supersonic Tupolev Tu-160 strategic bombers to the island. According to Colonel Eduard Rodyukov, a Corresponding Member of the Academy of Military Sciences, in turn, told Nezavisimaya Gazeta that \\"the arrival of Russia‚Äôs Tu-160 strategic bombers to Central America is kind of a signal to Trump to make him realize that abandoning nuclear disarmament treaties will have a boomerang effect.\\"http://tass.com/pressreview/1035596 See also *Federal Dependencies of Venezuela *List of marine molluscs of Venezuela *List of Poriferans of Venezuela References Federal Dependencies of Venezuela Military of Venezuela Venezuelan islands of the Leeward Antilles ","title":"La Orchila"},{"id":"2949636","text":"The parotid duct or Stensen duct is a duct and the route that saliva takes from the major salivary gland, the parotid gland, into the mouth.Ten Cate's Oral Histology, Nanci, Elsevier, 2013, page 255 Eponym It is named after Nicolas Steno (1638‚Äì1686), a Danish anatomist (albeit best known as a geologist) credited with its detailed description in 1660. Structure The parotid duct is formed when several interlobular ducts‚Äîthe largest ducts inside the parotid gland‚Äîjoin. It emerges from the gland and runs forward along the lateral side of the masseter muscle. In this course, the duct is surrounded by the buccal fat pad. It takes a steep turn at the border of the masseter and passes through the buccinator muscle, opening into the vestibule of the mouth, the region of the mouth between the cheek and the gums, at the parotid papilla, which lies across the second Maxillary (upper) molar tooth.Illustrated Dental Embryology, Histology, and Anatomy, Bath-Balogh and Fehrenbach, Elsevier, 2011, page 135 The buccinator acts as a valve that prevents air forcing into the duct, which would cause pneumoparotitis. Running along with the duct superiorly is the transverse facial artery and upper buccal nerve; running along with the duct inferiorly is the lower buccal nerve. The exit of the parotid ducts can be felt as small bumps (Papillae) on both sides of the mouth, and are usually positioned next to the maxillary second molars.

Population: History City Hall and post office in 1910 Before the arrival of the Teutonic Order and German settlers, the river valley was here settled by the Nadruvians, as evidenced by traces of settlements and fortifications found in the area. German overlordship was established around 1388, but the town is mentioned for the first time in written sources in 1539 as Darkyem. A first church was built in 1615. The settlement remained a village until 1724, when it received city rights by Frederick William I of Prussia. Soon afterwards, the town plan was revised with a market square and a new grid plan. An influx of immigrants followed (in 1725, 103 of the 742 registered inhabitants came from Salzburg) and craft production of leather and cloth established in the town. In the 19th century the industry had to close due to competition from more efficient industries in western Germany. Due to its location on the Angrapa River, a power station established in the watermill was already in 1880 able to produce electrical light for the town. The town was heavily damaged during fighting in World War I but rebuilt after garden city ideals following the war, with financial support from the city of Dresden. It was captured by Red Army on 22 January 1945. After World War II and the subsequent border shift, the region was placed under Soviet administration. It was renamed as Ozyorsk in 7 September 1946.

It is the first release by the group on which all four members perform together: Avey Tare (David Portner), Panda Bear (Noah Lennox), Geologist (Brian Weitz), and Deakin (Josh Dibb). In 2020, the band renamed the album to Ark because they felt the title objectified American Indians. Recording The album was recorded live in three days. Avey Tare played his guitar through an Ibanez delay rack and Boss pitch shifter/delay pedal to create a doubled, fuller sound, since he was the only one playing guitar at the time. The group also took turns processing sounds through various effects, such as a Roland SH-2 synthesizer and a vocoder. Avey and Panda Bear later recorded the vocals at Avey's house onto MiniDisc, then added in electronic sounds along with piano loops that Avey had made. Mixing of the album lasted between three and four days. In the run-up to the recording sessions, the members experienced a challenging time. After difficulties on tour and within the band, member Brian Weitz (Geologist) had decided to leave the band for one year to attend graduate school in Arizona.

It had four sequels, written in collaboration with Julie Forward Fuller and Margaret Dodson Forward, which detail the exploration of the other worlds in the Barnard System: Return to Rocheworld, Marooned on Eden, Ocean Under the Ice, and Rescued from Paradise. Plot In Rocheworld, a small group of civilian and military personnel crew carries out humanity's first manned exploration of another star system. Against the protests of General (later Senator) Beauregard Darlington Winthrop III, the mission begins under the command of Major General Virginia \\"Jinjur\\" Jones and George G. Gudunov. Winthrop however, eager to fulfill a personal vendetta against Gudunov, uses his considerable influence to get Colonel Alan Armstrong, who had hoped to be second in command just for the sake of it, on the crew with the intention of promoting him after the mission is on its way. This plan is foiled however, and the expedition proceeds on its one way mission to Barnard's Star, where planets have been discovered by Robot Probes. Using a laser-pumped light sail spacecraft known as Prometheus, the journey to their destination of Barnard's star lasts 40 years. The crew use a drug called \\"No-Die\\" which slows their aging process, whilst proportionately lowering their effective I.Q., but allowing them to arrive only a decade physically older than when they left. However, all does not go as planned, and soon a dangerous disease erupts among the crew. The ship's doctor, William Wang, is taken off No-Die, where he sacrifices himself to treat the rest of the crew. When the ship arrives at Barnard, they begin their exploration, deploying various Robot probes. David Greystroke, the ships computer engineer as well as a talented sono-video composer, creates a free fall musical and visual composition called \\"Flight\\", with Arielle Trudeau, the pilot of the Dragonfly Spaceplane, performing. A fraction of the crew, led by George, visit the double planet Rocheworld, landing a Surface Lander and Ascent Module (SLAM) on the water-free lobe, dubbed Roche (French for rock as well as the name of the French mathematician who worked on Roche limits). After exploring Roche, they again split up, and one group journeys via the space-plane Dragonfly to the other lobe, Eau (French for water), which is covered almost entirely by ocean. The crew are caught in a violent storm that causes their plane to experience a crash water- landing. The flooded propulsion systems of the space-plane are unable to provide enough thrust to break free and take off from the ocean surface. The crew decide to use the plane's lift fans as propellers to make their way to the inner pole of the double planet, where the gravitation from the other lobe of the double planet should help them to break free and allow rendezvous with the remaining crew in the lander at the zero point between the two lobes. While making this journey, the space-plane attracts the attention of one of the native species of the planet: the very intelligent, but technologically lacking, Flouwen. The Flouwen and the artificial intelligence aboard the space-plane establish communications and the two species begin to exchange cultural and scientific knowledge. The crew witness the birth of a Flouwen youngling, while one crew member, Shirley Everett, takes a ride on Clear‚óäWhite‚óäWhistle (White Whistler) a Flouwen who understands the technologically oriented humans more than the others of the pod, and who is fascinated by their technology. Unfortunately for Shirley, the Flouwen morphs into rock form while thinking, leaving her stranded in the middle of the ocean and forcing a rescue operation to be mounted. The Flouwen realize the humans are travelling to the pole and warn the humans that they are approaching a period where the configuration of the star and planets of the system allow for a phenomenon where the ocean on the water lobe of Rocheworld can partially flow to the rocky lobe, due to the change in the gravitational equipotential. They try to stop the humans from continuing into this violent event by pinning the spacecraft to the ammonia-water ocean floor with ice as ballast (water ice sinks in the less dense ammonia-water solution of the ocean). However, the humans realize that the interplanetary waterfall poses a threat to the crew remaining on Roche. Fortunately, the tidal stresses cause nearby dormant volcanoes to become active again. This melts an underwater glacier and floods the area with warm water, upon which the ice floats off the plane. The crew manages to get airborne and takes advantage of the changing equipotential to return to Roche. They rendezvous with the lander just as water is reaching it. The Epilogue is set years later, as a follow on mission arrives. This sequence was later expanded and included in the last sequel novel, Rescued from Paradise Forward's light sail propulsion system The light sail system consists of three functional parts: a powerful laser, a large focusing lens, and a giant space-sail. The idea behind the solar sail is that the laser provides a small force on the sail when the sail reflects the light. This small force provides the acceleration of the spaceship. With the ship's primary source of energy coming from the outside, it would not be limited to traveling distances that it had enough fuel for. The light used in the system was an array of a thousand laser generators, which were focused through lenses and aimed at the sail. The lasers provided up to 1,500 terawatts of power. Two different lenses were used to magnify the laser beams. The acceleration lens was 100 km in diameter and was able to accelerate the ship at 0.01g; the deceleration lens was 300 km in diameter and was able to decelerate the ship at 0.1g. Although these accelerations are relatively small, over time they result in enormous speeds. To catch the energy, Forward used a 1,000-km- diameter, circular aluminum sail. The sail resembled a flattened disk with a 300-km diameter removable center portion. When traveling to Rocheworld, the entire sail was used. When the ship needed to decelerate, the smaller sail was separated from the larger outer sail. The large sail was used as a reflecting lens, focusing light onto the smaller sail, slowing the craft. Using the light sail system, the spaceship Prometheus continued to accelerate for 20 years, traveling 2 light years' distance toward Barnard's Star before going into coast mode and traveling an additional 20 years' time at a constant speed of 0.2 c, covering the remaining 4 light years (ca. 23 trillion miles; 38 trillion km). Flouwen Flouwen (the Middle English word for 'flow') are the alien creatures in the book.1995 Review by Christian Weisgerber They are the sole intelligent inhabitants of the planet Eau, which makes up the watery half of Rocheworld. Flouwen are blob-like, happy-go-lucky aliens that spend their days surfing waves and working on difficult mathematical problems. Flouwen appear to be giant, colored jellyfish-like entities in the ammonia oceans of Eau. Like Earthly jellyfish, they are amorphous, colored blobs of jelly. Flouwen are highly intelligent, sexless, and do not appear to physically age. They are able to communicate and see in the water by means of sonar. They are also able to see outside the water by morphing their jelly bodies into crude lenses, which they use to methodically track the stars. Clear‚óäWhite‚óäWhistle, described as a Flouwen trying to \\"invent\\" physics and astronomy, discovers this technique, and later teaches the others. Flouwen are also capable of morphing themselves into a hard, rock-like substance when they feel the need to think about a difficult problem for an extended period. They do this by excreting much of their body water, thereby bringing their silica-gel-based cells closer together, which allows quicker processing of information. Flouwen can grow quite large over time. This excess bulk can be shed during a peculiar breeding ritual where large Flouwen gather in a circle and spin off pieces of themselves to create a new Flouwen. Because they are created out of indistinguishable pieces of their parents, they are born fairly intelligent. One of the aliens,Warm@Amber@Resonance, is said to be over five hundred Eau seasons in age. Warm@Amber@Resonance refers to other Flouwen that are much older than it, such as Sour#Sapphire#Coo. Flouwen possess mathematical abilities far exceeding our own. Despite their intellect, they lack any desire to make real use of it, other than to work on math problems or to study the stars; they just don't see the point in studying anything else. They do not have any concept of technology. They refer to the spaceship Dragonfly as a 'giant talking rock' or \\"Floating Rock\\". Flouwen do not appear to have a strong social structure. They tend to treat one another equally, though mathematics proficiency appears to confer a heightened social status. Roaring‚òÜHot‚òÜVermillion is described as the nominal leader of the Flouwen pod encountered in this novel, though some other Flouwen are equal to it in status. Mathematics is one of the few subjects in which Flouwen show interest and concern. While younger Flouwen seem to have large amounts of free time, their elders spend long periods of time in rock form, contemplating and solving mathematical problems. As a result, the older Flouwen often hold higher social status as a result of their perceived higher knowledge in mathematics. Although Flouwen do not seem to physically age, they reveal that it's possible that their ages are reflected in the amount of time they spend contemplating in rock form. Perhaps the actual population of the Flouwen is much larger than it appears, because there are many off working on problems. Some may never find solutions to their problems, so they will never return, thus completing their life cycle. The Flouwens' time to solve a problem is limited because they slowly weather away as time passes. Flouwen are also capable of splitting off sections of themselves which continue to function as Sentient beings. 3 of these Flouwen buds assist the humans in exploring the rest of the Barnard system in the sequels. Rocheworld shape Rocheworld is a double planet in which the two elements are close enough that they share an atmosphere. Each element is also deformed into an egg shape by the gravity of the other. James (the Christmas Bush) Rocheworld's human explorers are aided by the Dragonfly's artificial intelligence system, James. The physical extension of James is the Christmas Bush. The Christmas Bush is both a modular robot and a bush robot which both communicates through and is powered by a network of laser transceivers on its body. The Christmas Bush is similar to some recursive fractal structures where the large scale shape of the robot is repeated a number of times in progressively smaller size. A main rod divides into six smaller jointed rods which also divide into six. This is repeated again and again so that the Christmas Bush can manipulate both large and small objects. The end of each rod is where the laser transceivers are located. The Christmas Bush nickname for the robot is due to that when all the rods are fully expanded the robot has a bushy texture, and is lit up like a Christmas tree. Each rod and its children rods can separate from its parent rod and each carry a certain amount of computational power. The Bush or its pieces move by crawling while experiencing acceleration due to gravity or thrust, or by flying in low gravity environments. To fly, the smallest rods work together like the cilia of single celled organisms to provide thrust in any direction. The cilia also allow James to play audio and record sound through the bush. The crew all wear a small piece of James (referred to as an imp) near their ear, which allows them to communicate with James and the other crew members. James will always keep some portion of the imp in contact with the crew's skin to allow it to monitor their health by recording their temperature, pulse, etc. Publication history Rocheworld was first published in slightly shorter form as a serial in Analog Science Fiction and Fact magazine in December 1982 through February 1983.

The British version was published by New English Library in their \\"SF Master Series\\" in 1985. A revised and lengthened version was released in 1990 from Baen Books under the original title Rocheworld, marked \\"At Last The Complete Story!\\".Baen Books website; Rocheworld This version added several subplots which were not present in previous editions. Four sequels, written in collaboration with Forward's family members Julie Forward Fuller and Martha Dodson Forward, were published in 1993, 1994, and 1995. They followed the continuity of the 1990 edition, and introduced new characters and settings. Reception Dave Langford reviewed The Flight of the Dragonfly for White Dwarf #68, and stated that \\"It's a shame that with all this seething behind his marble brow, Forward never put across the drama and visual excitement of the events he's calculated to the eleventh decimal place.

With an elevation of above sea level, with multiple peaks, and glacial lakes on its upper eastern reaches, Mount Jukes is situated above the town of Crotty and is west of Lake Burbury. The mountain was named by Charles Gould in 1862 in honour of Professor Joseph Jukes, an English geologist who gathered evidence to part afforded support for Charles Darwin's theories of coral reefs. Jukes had visited Hobart in 1842-3 on HMS Fly. Mines It has had mines and small mining camps adjacent to the lakes, and on the northern upper slopes, near where the Mount Jukes road traverses the upper slopes of the King River Gorge.

It can be caused by a variety of conditions, and typically resolves spontaneously within 30 days. It is common in young people aged 12‚Äì20 years. Signs and symptoms =Pre-eruptive phase= The first signs of erythema nodosum are often flu-like symptoms such as a fever, cough, malaise, and aching joints. Some people also experience stiffness or swelling in the joints and weight loss. =Eruptive stage= Erythema nodosum is characterised by nodules (rounded lumps) below the skin surface, usually on the shins. These subcutaneous nodules can appear anywhere on the body, but the most common sites are the shins, arms, thighs, and torso. Each nodule typically disappears after around two weeks, though new ones may continue to form for up to six or eight weeks. A new nodule usually appears red and is hot and firm to the touch. The redness starts to fade and it gradually becomes softer and smaller until it disappears. Each nodule usually heals completely without scarring over the course of about two weeks. Joint pain and inflammation sometimes continue for several weeks or months after the nodules appear. Less common variants of erythema nodosum include: * Ulcerating forms, seen in Crohn's disease * Erythema contusiforme, when a subcutaneous hemorrhage (bleeding under the skin) occurs with an erythema nodosum lesion, causing the lesion to look like a contusion (bruise) * Erythema nodosum migrans (also known as subacute nodular migratory panniculitis), a rare form of chronic erythema nodosum characterized by asymmetrical nodules that are mildly tender and migrate over time. File:EN-TBC.PNGErythema nodosum lesion in a person with tuberculosis File:A single EN.JPGA single lesion of erythema nodosum File:Erythema Nodosum.jpgErythema nodosum in rather dark skin Causes EN is associated with a wide variety of conditions, including: ;Idiopathic In about 30‚Äì50% of cases, the cause of EN is unknown. ;Infection *Streptococcal infection which, in children, is by far the most common precipitant, *Primary infection of Tuberculosis *Mycoplasma pneumoniae *Histoplasma capsulatum *Yersinia *Epstein-Barr virus *Coccidioides immitis (Valley fever) *Cat scratch disease ;Autoimmune disorders, including *Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): about 15% of patients develop erythema nodosum. *Beh√ßet's disease *Sarcoidosis ;Pregnancy ;Medications, including *Sulfonamides *Penicillins *Bromides *Hepatitis B vaccination ;Cancer, including *Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) *Carcinoid tumours *Pancreatic cancer EN may also be due to excessive antibody production in lepromatous leprosy leading to deposition of immune complexes. There is an association with the HLA-B27 histocompatibility antigen, which is present in 65% of patients with erythema nodosum. A useful mnemonic for causes is SORE SHINS (Streptococci, OCP, Rickettsia, Eponymous (Beh√ßet), Sulfonamides, Hansen's Disease (Leprosy), IBD, NHL, Sarcoidosis.Dr Kevin McCarthy, Cork, Ireland or DIPOUT: Drugs (e.g. sulfonamides), Infections (e.g. strep), Pregnancy, OCP, Ulcerative colitis, TB Pathophysiology Erythema nodosum is probably a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to a variety of antigens. Although circulating immune complexes have been demonstrated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, they have not been found in idiopathic or uncomplicated cases. Diagnosis Erythema nodosum is diagnosed clinically. A biopsy can be taken and examined microscopically to confirm an uncertain diagnosis. Microscopic examination usually reveals a neutrophilic infiltrate surrounding capillaries that results in septal thickening, with fibrotic changes in the fat around blood vessels. A characteristic microscopic finding is radial granulomas, well-defined nodular aggregates of histiocytes surrounding a stellate cleft. Additional evaluation should be performed to determine the underlying cause of erythema nodosum. This may include a full blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), antistreptolysin-O (ASO) titer and throat culture, urinalysis, intradermal tuberculin test, and a chest x-ray. The ESR is typically high, the C-reactive protein elevated, and the blood showing an increase in white blood cells. The ESR is initially very high and falls as the nodules of erythema nodosum. The ASO titer is high in cases associated with a streptococcal throat infection. A chest X-ray should be performed to rule out pulmonary diseases, in particular sarcoidosis and L√∂fgren syndrome. Treatment Erythema nodosum is self- limiting and usually resolves itself within 3‚Äì6 weeks. A recurring form does exist, and in children, it is attributed to repeated infections with streptococcus. Treatment should focus on the underlying cause. Symptoms can be treated with bed rest, leg elevation, compressive bandages, wet dressings, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs). NSAIDs are usually more effective at the onset of EN versus with chronic disease. Potassium iodide can be used for persistent lesions whose cause remains unknown. Corticosteroids and colchicine can be used in severe refractory cases. Thalidomide has been used successfully in the treatment of Erythema nodosum leprosum, and it was approved by the U.S. FDA for this use in July 1998. According to a 2009 meta- analysis, there is some evidence of benefit for both thalidomide and clofazimine in the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum. Epidemiology Erythema nodosum is the most common form of panniculitis. It is most common in the ages of 20‚Äì30, and affects women 3‚Äì6 times more than men. Eponym The term, Subacute Migratory Panniculitis of Vilanova and Pi√±ol, was named after the two famous Catalan dermatologists who provided a brief description and explanation of the disease, Drs. Xavier Montiu Vilanova (1902-1965) and Joaquin Aguade Pi√±ol (1918-1977), in 1954, and was named in 1956.

Based on a story by Richard Conlin, the film is about a young woman reporter who blames the Pittsburgh Pirates' losing streak on their abusive manager, who begins hearing the voice of an angel promising to help the team if he changes his ways. The film was released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on October 19, 1951. Plot With baseball's Pittsburgh Pirates in last place, their combative, foul-mouthed manager Guffy McGovern (Paul Douglas) has plenty to complain about. All of this changes when, while wandering through Forbes Field in search of his good luck charm one night, Guffy is accosted by the voice of an angel (voice of unseen James Whitmore), who hints at having been a ballplayer during his earthly life. As the spokes-angel for the Heavenly Choir Nine, a celestial team of deceased ballplayers, he begins bestowing \\"miracles\\" upon the Pirates‚Äîbut only on the condition that McGovern put a moratorium on swearing and fighting. With the help of the invisible ghosts of past baseball greats, the Pirates make it into the pennant race. During a game, 8-year-old orphan Bridget White (Donna Corcoran) insists she can see the angels helping out the \\"live\\" ballplayers‚Äîunderstandably so, since it was Bridget's prayers to the Archangel Gabriel which prompted the angel to visit McGovern in the first place. Local newspaper reporter and former \\"household hints\\" writer Jennifer Paige (Janet Leigh) inadvertently transforms Bridget's angelic visions into a nationwide news story, causing McGovern no end of trouble. After a line drive hits Guffy in the head during a game, Guffy himself confirms Bridget's claims to the press. He falls into the hands of vengeful sportscaster Fred Bayles (Keenan Wynn), who has been scheming to have McGovern thrown out of baseball and persuades the Commissioner of Baseball to investigate McGovern's fitness as a manager. Complication piles upon complication until the pennant-deciding game, wherein Guffy is forced to rely exclusively upon the talents of his ballplayers‚Äînotably \\"over the hill\\" pitcher Saul Hellman (Bruce Bennett) (who, the angel has told Guffy, will be \\"signed up\\" by the Heavenly Choir team shortly). Guffy also wins over Jennifer, and they plan to adopt young Bridget. The angels themselves are never actually seen by the viewing audience, just the effects of their presence‚Äîa feather dropping, or someone being jostled from time to time. The angel who talks to Guffy never reveals who he was in life. However, this angel does reveal his presence to Bayles: When Bayles sarcastically asks \\"the little angels up there\\" if they are happy with the Pirates' win over the New York Giants, Bayles hears the angel reply \\"Oh, why don't you just shut up?\\" and the angel pulls Bayles' hat down over Bayles' face. Bayles looks up incredulously upon hearing the voice, searching for the speaker. Since the Hays Code prohibited most profanity in films at the time, the \\"swearing\\" uttered by Guffy is audio gibberish, which was made by scrambling recordings of actor Paul Douglas's voice. Cast =Cameo appearances= * Bing Crosby has a short cameo in the film, playing golf, sinking a long putt. At that time, Crosby was a part-owner (approximately 15%) of the Pirates. * Baseball greats Ty Cobb and Joe DiMaggio, along with Hollywood songwriter Harry Ruby, are \\"interviewed\\" regarding the angels. * Barbara Billingsley has an uncredited role as a hat check girl at John's Steakhouse. * Uncredited Pirates include Ralph Kiner (hitting a home run and playing first base), George Strickland, Ed Fitz Gerald and George Metkovich, as well as coaches Sam Narron and Lenny Levy.Biederman, Les. \\"The Scoreboard\\".

Although he had no background in baseball, Bruce Bennett, who portrays a veteran Pittsburgh pitcher, in real life had played football in the 1926 Rose Bowl and won a silver medal in the shot put at the 1928 Summer Olympics. Rothberg, one of the Pirate players, is played by Jeff Richards, who had been a minor-league baseball player before becoming an actor. Fred Graham, who appears as \\"Chunk,\\" had been a semi-pro ballplayer, while another member of the cast, Paul Salata, who has the role of Tony Minelli, played professional football from 1949-53. = Filming locations= The film contains extensive baseball action shots, most of which were filmed at Forbes Field, the former home of the Pittsburgh Pirates and Steelers, demolished in 1971, the year after the Pirates and Steelers moved to Three Rivers Stadium. The opening credits acknowledge \\"the kind cooperation of the Pittsburgh 'Pirates' for the use of the team and its ballpark,\\" while reminding the viewer that the story is fictional and \\"could be any baseball team, in any league, in any town in America.\\" Historians may note several distinguishing features of Forbes Field at the time. One is the \\"Kiner's Korner\\" inner fence in left field, with the 365-feet left field foul line marker observable on the outer wall, and the 335-feet sign on the inner fence. The other distance markers (376-457-436-375-300) are visible in some scenes. Other objects on the field of play at Forbes are visible from time to time, including the flagpole and batting cage near the 457 foot marker in deep left center field, and the Barney Dreyfuss monument in straightaway center field. The University of Pittsburgh's Cathedral of Learning is prominent in many shots filmed in Forbes Field. A few scenes were shot on location at Wrigley Field, conveniently sited in South Los Angeles. Well-used by film- makers of the era, the ballpark‚Äîhome to the minor league Angels from 1925 to 1957‚Äîwas named for team owner William Wrigley, Jr. when the landmark Chicago stadium was still known as Cubs Park. While Wrigley's ivy-covered outfield wall stands in nicely for that of Forbes Field, \\"Kiner's Korner\\" is conspicuous in its absence, and visible distance markers (412 feet in centre field; 345 feet in left) are inconsistent with Forbes Field's grander dimensions. Some stock footage alleged to be the Polo Grounds in New York City was actually Comiskey Park in Chicago, as evidenced by a quick glimpse of an auxiliary scoreboard reading \\"Visitors\\" and \\"White Sox\\". Box office According to MGM records the film made $1,466,000 in the US and Canada and $200,000 elsewhere. Once studio overhead was added, the film recorded a net loss of $171,000.

It has been the most commercially successful form of salsa in the last 20 years, despite criticism that it is a pale imitation of \\"real\\" salsa, often called \\"salsa dura.\\" Description and origins Salsa Rom√°ntica is a slower, lighter sounding type of salsa music that La Palabra, a Cuban musician, introduced in the mid-1980s. Salsa rom√°ntica arose at a time when classic, big-band salsa, popularized by Fania Records was taking an astounding measure on the Latin record charts, owing to the merengue boom and the rise of Latin pop. Salsa romantica is distinct from other salsa music styles because it uses a softer/quieter sounding orchestral sounds, ballads set to a slowed down salsa rhythm, and romantic lyrics (1). Because of the softer orchestra and leisurely rhythm, some have nicknamed this genre \\"limp salsa\\" (2). It has been the most commercially successful form of salsa in the last 20 years in Latin American countries, and is most popularly played in fancier dance clubs as well as radio stations (3). The best known early salsa romantica artists include: Eddie Santiago, Frankie Ruiz, Lalo Rodr√≠guez and Luis Enrique. More famous modern artists are Gilberto Santa Rosa, Marc Anthony, La India and Tito Nieves. Criticism Salsa rom√°ntica was heavily influenced by the balada style (or, pop style) of salsa, and is widely criticized by dancers due to the simple compositional style of both types. Traditional salsas give more improvisational ability to the musicians and dancers involved. Though it bears the moniker of a salsa, salsa rom√°ntica is considered by most to be inauthentic to the true spirit and style of salsa music. In Cuba, some critics refer to it as the ‚Äúwhite‚Äù style to differentiate between salsa rom√°ntica and traditional salsa. Critics have also focused on the fact that \\"true salsa\\" involved qualified musicianship alongside the intricate composition, while salsa rom√°ntica was too lyrically syrupy and musically systematic. Some say that one of the reasons salsa rom√°ntica even came about was due to the cocaine cartel's affinity for it. The cocaine cartels began to affect the tone of salsa during the 1980s, and live salsa became much more prevalent in luxury nightclubs. Dancing was still encouraged, but researchers claim that the dancing of this time period began to dwindle creatively and became much less interesting to watch. Salsa contests also began to disappear due to the lack of inspired dancers and interesting music. Though many critique this style, it was incredibly popular during this time and played on most popular radio stations. Critics of salsa rom√°ntica, especially in the late 1980s and early 1990s, called it a commercialized, watered-down form of Latin pop, in which formulaic, sentimental love ballads were simply put to an Afro-Cuban beat‚Äîleaving no room for classic salsa's brilliant musical improvisation, or for classic salsa lyrics that tell stories of daily life or provide social and political commentary.Manuel, Peter (1994). The soul of the barrio: 30 years of salsa. NACLA Report on the Americas. 28 (2). The marketing of salsa rom√°ntica singers has often been based more on their youthful sex appeal than on the quality of their music. For these reasons, the form sometimes has been derided as salsa monga (limp or flaccid salsa), as opposed to salsa gorda or salsa dura (fat or hard salsa). The form today The strict lines between salsa rom√°ntica and classic salsa have been blurring in recent years. Several performers have succeeded in blending elements of salsa rom√°ntica and more hard-driving, traditional salsa, including La India, Tito Rojas, Eddie Santiago, Anthony Cruz, Gilberto Santa Rosa, and V√≠ctor Manuelle. Jerry Rivera was the first salsero to go triple platinum with his record \\"Cuenta Conmigo\\" (\\"Count on Me\\") which was all salsa romantica. La India, Luis Enrique, Giro Lopez, Marc Anthony and V√≠ctor Manuelle are the best-known performers of salsa rom√°ntica today. However, Marc Anthony surpasses his colleagues not only in fame, but in sales as well, being the highest selling salsa artist of the past two decades. By blending elements of pop into his songs - as well as making pop versions of his salsa songs - Anthony has been able to establish a loyal fan base of Hispanics of all nationalities, as well as broaden his audience to non-Spanish speaking individuals. Young salseros gravitating to the form include Tito Rojas, Anthony Cruz, Frankie Negr√≥n, Kevin Ceballo, Charlie Cruz, and Jay Lozada. Omar Alfanno is probably the most prolific songwriter in the salsa rom√°ntica genre he was hand held into the business by Salsa Dura songwriter Johnny Ortiz. Other notable composers include Palmer Hernandez and Jorge Luis Piloto. Antonio \\"Tony\\" Moreno, Chino Rodriguez, Sergio George and Julio \\"Gunda\\" Merced are some of the most notable producers in the salsa rom√°ntica genre. Despite having many prominent artists and a large fan base, Salsa Rom√†ntica is considered, by older salsa musicians and fans, to be a sad imitation of classic salsa - salsa monga or \\"limp salsa\\". This is partially due to the fact that this form of salsa talks less about political strife and working-class concerns, and more about non-offensive things such as love and parties. Salsa er√≥tica Salsa er√≥tica (or \\"erotic salsa\\") was a short-lived offshoot of salsa rom√°ntica in the late 1980s, in which a few performers branched off into explicitly sexual lyrics. The most popular salsa er√≥tica recordings are probably \\"Ven, Dev√≥rame Otra Vez\\" (\\"Come, Devour Me Again\\") by Lalo Rodr√≠guez, in which the singer is imploring his woman for another session of sex; and \\"Desn√∫date, Mujer\\" (\\"Get Naked, Woman\\") by Frankie Ruiz, and \\"La Cita\\" (\\"The Date\\") by Galy Galiano.

M'Intosh, 21 U.S. (8 Wheat.) 543 (1823), is a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court that held that private citizens could not purchase lands from Native Americans. As the facts were recited by Chief Justice John Marshall, the successor in interest to a private purchase from the Piankeshaw attempted to maintain an action of ejectment against the holder of a federal land patent. The case is one of the most influential and well-known decisions of the Marshall Court, a fixture of the first-year curriculum in nearly all US law schools. Marshall's prosaic and eminently quotable opinion lays down the foundations of the doctrine of aboriginal title in the United States, and the related discovery doctrine. However, the vast majority of the opinion is dicta; as valid title is a basic element of the cause of action for ejectment, the holding does not extend to the validity of M'Intosh's title, much less the property rights of the Piankeshaw. Thus, all that the opinion holds with respect to aboriginal title is that it is inalienable, a principle that remains well-established law in nearly all common law jurisdictions. Citation to Johnson has been a staple of federal and state cases related to Native American land title for 200 years. Like Johnson, nearly all of those cases involve land disputes between two non-Native parties, typically one with a chain of title tracing to a federal or state government and the other with a chain of title predating US sovereignty. A similar trend can be seen in the early case law of Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. The first land dispute involving an indigenous party to reach to the Supreme Court was Cherokee Nation v. Georgia (1831). Background Thomas Johnson, one of the first Supreme Court justices, bought land from Piankeshaw Native American tribes in 1773 and 1775. The plaintiffs were lessees of Thomas Johnson's descendants, who had inherited the land. The defendant, William M'Intosh (pronounced \\"McIntosh\\"), subsequently obtained a land patent, according to the facts as Marshall accepted them, to this same land from the United States federal government. In fact, the two parcels did not overlap at all.Kades, 148 U. Pa. L. Rev. at 1092 (\\"Mapping the United Companies\\" claims alongside M'Intosh's purchases, as enumerated in the district court records, shows that the litigants' land claims did not overlap. Hence, there was no real 'case or controversy,' and M'ntosh, like another leading early Supreme Court land case, Fletcher v. Peck, appears to have been a sham.\\" (footnotes omitted)). Further, there is evidence that the parties were aware the tracts did not overlap and purposely misrepresented the facts to the court to obtain a ruling.Kades, 148 U. Pa. L. Rev. at 1093 (\\"M'Intosh did not contest a single fact alleged in the complaint, jurisdictional or otherwise. Perhaps he participated in framing the complaint, which became the stipulated facts of the case. Neither the district court nor the Supreme Court questioned any of these facts. Everyone involved, it seems, wanted a decision on the legal question of the validity of private purchases from the Native Americans.\\" (footnote omitted)). Prior history The plaintiffs brought an action for ejectment against M'Intosh in the United States District Court for the District of Illinois, contending that their chain of title was superior by virtue of Johnson's purchases. The District Court dismissed the claim on the grounds that the Piankeshaw were not able to convey the land. Opinion Marshall, writing for a unanimous court, affirmed the dismissal. Marshall begins with a lengthy discussion of history of the European discovery of the Americas and the legal foundations of the American Colonies. In particular, Marshall focuses on the manner in which each European power acquired land from the indigenous occupants. Synthesizing the law of nations, Marshall traces the outlines of the \\"discovery doctrine\\"‚Äînamely, that a European power gains radical title (also known as sovereignty) to the land it discovers. As a corollary, the \\"discovering\\" power gains the exclusive right to extinguish the \\"right of occupancy\\" of the Indigenous occupants, which otherwise survived the assumption of sovereignty. Marshall further opined that when they declared independence from Great Britain, the United States government inherited the British right of preemption over Native American lands. The legal result is that the only Native American conveyances of land which can create valid title are sales of land to the federal government.Banner, 2005, pp. 178-188. Legacy ;Law and economics At least one commentator has noted that Johnson, by holding that only the federal government could purchase Native American lands, created a system of monopsony, which avoided bidding competition between settlers and thus enabled the acquisition of Native American lands at the lowest possible cost.Kades, 148 U. Pa. L. Rev. at 1189 (\\"With its customary rule against private purchases of Native American land, reaffirmed in M'Intosh, the state prevented competitive bidding for Native American lands. It drew on a special cadre of career Native American negotiators to buy land cheaply. . . . [T]he bottom line was the bottom line: acquiring Native American lands at least cost. . . . [M]inimizing cost were not simple. . . . Threats . . . were often not credible, and so the United States pursued all the negotiating tricks . . . .\\"). ;Role in law school curriculum Prof. Stuart Banner at UCLA School of Law, writes of the case: :Johnson's continuing prominence is reinforced every year in law schools, where it is the very first case most beginning students read in their required course in Property. The best-selling property casebook calls Johnson 'the genesis of our subject' because it lays 'the foundations of landownership in the United States.' Given current understandings surrounding Indigenous law, and the role of Native Americans in America, the outcome of the case has come to be viewed with disapproval in law school. Johnson has joined Dred Scott v. Sandford and a few others to form a small canon (or maybe an anti-canon) of famous cases law students are taught to criticize. The leading casebook describes the philosophy underlying Johnson as \\"discomforting\\" and quotes with approval the recent view of a law professor that Marshall's opinion \\"was rooted in a Eurocentric view of the inferiority of the Indian people.\\" Johnson, though, might be the only member of this anti- canon that remains the law, and that is still cited as authority by lower courts several times a year.Banner, 2005, p. 11-12.

It runs from Interstate 10 near White Water to the Arizona state line, passing through the city of Twentynine Palms and along the northern boundary of the Joshua Tree National Park. Route description Signage at the eastern terminus in Parker, Arizona Southerly view of the San Jacinto Mountains, near the western terminus in Whitewater, California The route cuts across the Little San Bernardino Mountains along southern San Bernardino County. Route 62 begins at a freeway-to-freeway interchange with Interstate 10 at the eastern end of the San Gorgonio Pass northwest of Palm Springs in Riverside County. It heads due north until its intersection with SR 247 in Yucca Valley, and then it heads east through the unincorporated community of Joshua Tree and the city of Twentynine Palms. In 1970, Route 62 ended at the eastern city limit of Twentynine Palms, but it was later extended along the northern boundary of the Joshua Tree National Park to meet Arizona State Route 95 in Parker, Arizona. East of Twentynine Palms, there is a sign warning drivers that there are no services for 100 miles/160 km until reaching Vidal Junction where SR 62 meets US 95. This is one of the most desolate stretches of highway in California, and consequently, the most heavily traveled portion is between I-10 and Twentynine Palms. Travelers between the eastern Coachella Valley and the river utilize that more desolate stretch as the fastest route to the resorts of the Colorado River, accessing it via California State Route 177 in Desert Center. In 2014, the Palm Springs Desert Sun newspaper reported that a dozen marines from the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms have been killed in accidents on Highway 62 since 2007 (out of a total of 33 vehicle-related deaths among personnel at the base); the paper attributed the problem in part to the base's unusually remote location, leaving personnel few options for entertainment.Brett Kelman and Drew Schmenner, \\"Desert base, deadly highway: Since 2007, more Marines from the Twentynine Palms Marine base have died back home than in the war-torn Middle East\\", The Desert Sun, March 22, 2014. SR 62 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and west of the military base is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 62 is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System, and is recognized by Caltrans as a scenic highway for from its western terminus at I-10 to the Riverside‚ÄìSan Bernardino county line, meaning that it is a substantial section of highway passing through a \\"memorable landscape\\" with no \\"visual intrusions\\", where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community. SR 62 is designated as a Blue Star Memorial Highway from Interstate 10 to Adobe Road in Twentynine Palms. SR 62 is known as the Twentynine Palms Highway from I-10 to SR 177. California Route 62 Marker History The routing west of Twentynine Palms was added to the state highway system in phases, with the part from White Water to Morongo Valley added in 1935, and from Morongo Valley to Yucca Valley in 1959; both were designated as Route 187. From Yucca Valley to Twentynine Palms, Route 218 was added in 1961. In the 1964 state highway renumbering, SR 62 was designated from I-10 into the town of Twentynine Palms. The portion from Twentynine Palms to Arizona was added to SR 62 in 1970.

It is a remake of the 1951 film of the same name. It stars Danny Glover, Tony Danza and Christopher Lloyd, and features several future stars, including Joseph Gordon-Levitt (in the lead), Adrien Brody, Matthew McConaughey, and Neal McDonough. It was followed by two made for TV sequels, Angels in the Endzone and Angels in the Infield. It was released less than a month before the 1994 MLB Baseball Strike, which forced the league to cancel the playoffs and the World Series.  Plot  Young foster child Roger Bomman and his friend, J.P., love to sneak into baseball games of the struggling California Angels. Still in limited contact with his widowed father, Roger asks when they will be a family again. His father replies sarcastically, \\"I'd say when the Angels win the pennant.\\" Taking his father's words literally, he prays for God to help the Angels win. In a game against the Toronto Blue Jays which Roger and J.P. attend, he sees a group of angels led by Al helping the team. Although he can see them quite clearly, everyone else can only explain the seemingly impossible acts as freak occurrences. Roger's unique ability to see which players are receiving help from angels leads their skeptical manager George Knox to keep him around as a good luck charm and consultant. Due to the much-needed help, the Angels start to win games and make a surprising second-half surge to the top of their division. Roger's father permanently gives up custody of him, believing it is in Roger's best interest. As Roger laments his loss, an equally distraught J.P. accidentally reveals to antagonistic sportscaster Ranch Wilder that Roger has the ability to see angels, and that George has been winning through the advice Roger gave him. Hoping to destroy George's career in baseball due to a long-time mutual hatred between them, Ranch informs the press of this, and their owner Hank Murphy threatens to relieve George of his management responsibilities. Roger comes clean to his caretaker Maggie Nelson about his special ability, and at a press conference, they and the entire team defend George in front of the press. Moved by their faith, Murphy allows him to remain as the Angels' manager. During the final game of the season against the rival Chicago White Sox, none of the angels show up to help the team. Later on, Al appears to Roger and explains that championships must be decided without the angels' intervention. He also says that he is there to check on pitcher Mel Clark, who only has months to live due to his years of smoking and will become an angel himself. Mel struggles in the ninth inning but perseveres after encouragement from George, his team, and the fans in attendance. The Angels ultimately win the game on their own and clinch the division title and the pennant. Murphy fires Ranch because of his denigration of the team. George adopts Roger and J.P., as he wants to try to be a father. J.P. sees Al and says, \\"I knew it could happen.\\" Al flies off and says, \\"We're always watching\\".  Cast  Production Unlike the original, which focused on the Pittsburgh Pirates as the team in heavenly need, the film focuses on the California Angels, who did not exist when the original was released in 1951. The Walt Disney Company, which distributed the film, was a minority owner of the Angels at the time. The film did, however, premiere at the Pirates' home stadium at the time, Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=t2lGAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=zugMAAAAIBAJ&dq;=danny%20glover%20pittsburgh&pg;=6319%2C2844707 The premiere would be the only reference to the Pirates, due to both teams playing in separate leagues (Angels in the American League, Pirates in the National League) and the film being released three years before the start of interleague play. Both teams would finally meet head-to-head for the first time in 2002 in Anaheim. Reception The film has a rating of 33% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 27 reviews, with an average rating of 4.22/10. The site's consensus reads, \\"A queasy mishmash of poignant drama and slapstick fantasy, Angels in the Outfield strikes out as worthy family entertainment.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A\\" on an A+ to F scale. =Box office= The film opened at #4 at the North American box office, making $8,916,463 USD in its opening weekend.

It is set in the city of Manzanita, Oregon. Based on a Native American legend about a treasure buried on Neahkahnie Mountain by Spanish sailors in the 1590s, a 14-year-old girl discovers what is important in life. Production and distribution Tillamook Treasure played the film festival circuit in 2006 and 2007, and was released theatrically in 2008 as The Legend of Tillamook's Gold. The film opened in one theater in Mesa, Arizona on March 28, 2008 as a theatrical test by Maitland Primrose Group, publishers of Moving Pictures magazine, in conjunction with film festival producers Kids First! The film premiered in Tillamook, Oregon in July 2007. The film was shot almost exclusively in Tillamook County. Plot Sixteenth century Spanish sailors beach their launch on the Manzanita beach. They carry a treasure chest up Neahkahnie Mountain, leading a manacled African slave. The treasure is buried and the slave is killed and laid on top of the ground to \\"guard\\" the treasure and frighten away the local Indians. Julie (Suzanne Marie Doyon), a lonely 14-year-old girl, and her family move from California to an Oregon seaside town as a last resort after her father loses his job. Her family has trouble adjusting to their new life and Julie is forgotten and ignored, as the family adjusts to living in uncle Jimmy's (Brian Thompson) seaside home. Julie has a dramatic mystical encounter with a Roosevelt elk on the beach. The elk's fur has black hand prints on its neck. Its hooves uncover an old Spanish gold coin in the sand. The elk becomes Julie's silent, watchful guide and protector as she becomes drawn to the legend of Tillamook's gold. She seeks the wisdom and guidance of her grandfather (Max Gail) and his good friend, Standing Elk (Floyd Red Crow Westerman). The men tell Julie the legend of the Spanish treasure and also of an elk, saved from drowning by the slave who, before his death, had grasped the exhausted animal as it swam near the Spanish launch. Julie is confused because 400 years later, she is convinced that \\"her elk\\" is the same elk. Julie's desire to solve the treasure mystery becomes a passion that leads to further mystery and self-discovery. When she experiences visions of Indians, she is frightened. When she tells Grandpa and Standing Elk, the elders realize that she is having a magical experience. Grandpa and Standing Elk suspect that Julie has been chosen to find the treasure and to release the spirit of the slave. They watch and guide her on her quest.

Logical access is often needed for remote access of hardware and is often contrasted with the term \\"physical access\\", which refers to interactions (such as a lock and key) with hardware in the physical environment, where equipment is stored and used. Logical access controls enforce access control measures for systems, programs, processes, and information. The controls can be embedded within operating systems, applications, add-on security packages, or database and telecommunication management systems. The line between logical access and physical access can be blurred when physical access is controlled by software. For example, entry to a room may be controlled by a chip and PIN card and an electronic lock controlled by software. Only those in possession of an appropriate card, with an appropriate security level and with knowledge of the PIN are permitted entry to the room. On swiping the card into a card reader and entering the correct PIN code. Logical controls, also called logical access controls and technical controls, protect data and the systems, networks, and environments that protect them. In order to authenticate, authorize, or maintain accountability a variety of methodologies are used such as password protocols, devices coupled with protocols and software, encryption, firewalls, or other systems that can detect intruders and maintain security, reduce vulnerabilities and protect the data and systems from threats. Businesses, organizations and other entities use a wide spectrum of logical access controls to protect hardware from unauthorized remote access. These can include sophisticated password programs, advanced biometric security features, or any other setups that effectively identify and screen users at any administrative level. The particular logical access controls used in a given facility and hardware infrastructure partially depend on the nature of the entity that owns and administrates the hardware setup. Government logical access security is often different from business logical access security, where federal agencies may have specific guidelines for controlling logical access. Users may be required to hold security clearances or go through other screening procedures that complement secure password or biometric functions. This is all part of protecting the data kept on a specific hardware setup. Militaries and governments use logical access biometrics to protect their large and powerful networks and systems which require very high levels of security. It is essential for the large networks of police forces and militaries where it is used not only to gain access but also in six main essential applications. Without logical access control security systems highly confidential information would be at risk of exposure. There is a wide range of biometric security devices and software available for different levels of security needs. There are very large complex biometric systems for large networks that require absolute airtight security and there are less expensive systems for use in office buildings and smaller institutions.

They live in an area that now includes western Indiana and Ohio, and are closely allied with the Wea Indians. Piankeshaw villages have been reported along the White River in central Indiana, and along the Vermilion River in Illinois, near Ouiatenon.Dorothy Libby, Summary of Piankashaw Locations (1708- ca. 1763) pp. 58 - 62 The Piankashaw were living along the Vermilion river in 1743.Anthropological report on the Piankashaw History The first Peeyankih≈°ionki or Piankeshaw Village (\\"Place of the Piankashaw\\") was at the confluence of the Peeyankih≈°iaki Siipiiwi (\\"River of the Peeyankih≈°iaki/Piankashaw, i.e. Vermilion River\\") and the Waapaah≈°iki Siipiiwi (\\"white shining\\", \\"pure white\\" or \\"River over white stones, i.e. Wabash River\\") northeast of the town of Cayuga, Indiana. Sometime after the founding of the first Peeyankih≈°ionki, a group split off and moved south following the Waapaah≈°iki Siipiiwi to just above its confluence with the Embarras River. In that spot they built a village called Aciipihkahkionki / Chippekawkay / Chippecoke (\\"Place of edible Roots\\"). This name referred to the abundance of tuberous plants that grew in the area. Today the city of Vincennes, Indiana lies in the vicinity of this historic Peeyankih≈°ia village. Many of the descendants of the Peeyankih≈°ia who built this village and the village to its north are citizens of the Peoria Tribe of Oklahoma. A smaller settlement was located at the confluence of the two main arms of the Vermillion River (near Danville, Illinois). In the 18th century a third important settlement outside the historic Wabash River Valley was established along the Ahsenisiipi (\\"Rocky, Stony River; i.e. Great Miami River\\") and called Pinkwaawilenionki / Pickawillany (\\"Place of the Ash People\\") and developed into today's Piqua in western Ohio. The Piankeshaw are usually regarded as being \\"friendly\\" towards European settlers. They intermarried with French traders and were treated as equals by residents of New France in the Illinois Country. A principal Piankeshaw village was established on the Wabash River near what became Vincennes. In fact, some have suggested that the land around the Grand Rapids Hotel that existed in the 1920s was part of a Piankeshaw Summer campground. Like their French neighbors, the Piankeshaw generally sided with the Americans during the American Revolution. Although part of the Wabash Confederacy, the Piankeshaw nation took no part in the Northwest Indian War that followed the American Revolution. However, Piankeshaw suffered retaliation from U.S. colonizers for attacks made by other native tribes. President George Washington issued a proclamation forbidding harm to the Piankeshaw.Beckwith, 112 During the late 18th century, the Piankeshaw population began to decline. Many of the Piankeshaw simply left and joined other Miami tribes. After the Americans and French suffered setbacks in the Revolution, notably the disastrous LaBalme expedition, some Piankeshaw joined tribes aligned with the British. At that time, in the West, the British looked as if they would be the victors.Somes, 45 Others left during the economic depression caused by a depreciated United States currency and stagnated fur trade (due to unrest in the Northwest Indian Wars). The Piankeshaw suffered especially when 1781 brought a severe Winter followed by a Summer drought.Somes, 76 Despite overall good relations with the new United States, some Piankeshaw resented the new settlers encroaching on their territory. Vincennes residents attacked a nearby village in the 1786 Battle of the Embarras River. An exodus of Piankeshaw left the Vincennes area and moved to Terre Haute, where they joined the Wea, or moved to Kaskaskia, Illinois.Libby, pg 140 They joined with other tribes in attacking American settlers later that year, but aborted the attack after French residents pleaded for peace. By 1818, the Piankeshaw Chief Chekommia signed a treaty selling rights to much of their land to the United States. There were not enough tribal members (in the eyes of the US government authority) remaining to use it. Today The descendants of the Piankeshaw, along with the Kaskaskia and Wea, are enrolled in the Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma, a federally recognized tribe in Oklahoma.House, Office of the Law Revision Counsel.

It comprises stratified squamous epithelium, termed \\"oral epithelium\\", and an underlying connective tissue termed lamina propria. The oral cavity has sometimes been described as a mirror that reflects the health of the individual. Changes indicative of disease are seen as alterations in the oral mucosa lining the mouth, which can reveal systemic conditions, such as diabetes or vitamin deficiency, or the local effects of chronic tobacco or alcohol use. The oral mucosa tends to heal faster and with less scar formation compared to the skin. The underlying mechanism remains unknown, but research suggests that extracellular vesicles might be involved. Classification Oral mucosa can be divided into three main categories based on function and histology: *Lining mucosa, nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium, found almost everywhere else in the oral cavity, including the: **Alveolar mucosa, the lining between the buccal and labial mucosae. It is a brighter red, smooth, and shiny with many blood vessels, and is not connected to underlying tissue by rete pegs. **Buccal mucosa, the inside lining of the cheeks and floor of the mouth; part of the lining mucosa. ** Labial mucosa, the inside lining of the lips; part of the lining mucosa. * Masticatory mucosa, keratinized stratified squamous epithelium, found on the dorsum of the tongue, hard palate, and attached gingiva. *Specialized mucosa, specifically in the regions of the taste buds on lingual papillae on the dorsal surface of the tongue; contains nerve endings for general sensory reception and taste perception.University of Michigan Health System, Learning Resource Center at http://histology.med.umich.edu/node/2 Structure Schematic illustration of the layers found in keratinized oral mucosa that include a deeper lamina propria and basement membrane in-between and superficial layers of strafied squamous epithelium that include from deepest to most superficial: 1: Stratum basale 2: Stratum spinosum 3: Stratum granulosum 4: Stratum corneum Oral mucosa consists of two layers, the surface stratified squamous epithelium and the deeper lamina propria. In keratinized oral mucosa, the epithelium consists of four layers: * Stratum basale (basal layer) * Stratum spinosum (prickle layer) * Stratum granulosum (granular layer) * Stratum corneum (keratinized layer) In nonkeratinised epithelium, the two deep layers (basale and spinosum) remain the same but the outer layers are termed the intermediate and superficial layers. Depending on the region of the mouth, the epithelium may be nonkeratinized or keratinized. Nonkeratinized squamous epithelium covers the soft palate, inner lips, inner cheeks, and the floor of the mouth, and ventral surface of the tongue. Keratinized squamous epithelium is present in the gingiva and hard palate as well as areas of the dorsal surface of the tongue.Luiz Carlos Junquiera et al (2005), Basic Histology, p. 282, Keratinization is the differentiation of keratinocytes in the stratum granulosum into nonvital surface cells or squames to form the stratum corneum. The cells terminally differentiate as they migrate to the surface from the stratum basale where the progenitor cells are located to the superficial surface. Unlike keratinized epithelium, nonkeratinized epithelium normally has no superficial layers showing keratinization. Nonkeratinized epithelium may, however, readily transform into a keratinizing type in response to frictional or chemical trauma, in which case it undergoes hyperkeratinization. This change to hyperkeratinization commonly occurs on the usually nonkeratinized buccal mucosa when the linea alba forms, a white ridge of calloused tissue that extends horizontally at the level where the maxillary and mandibular teeth come together and occlude. Histologically, an excess amount of keratin is noted on the surface of the tissue, and the tissue has all the layers of an orthokeratinized tissue with its granular and keratin layers. In patients who have habits such as clenching or grinding (bruxism) their teeth, a larger area of the buccal mucosa than just the linea alba becomes hyperkeratinized. This larger white, rough, raised lesion needs to be recorded so that changes may be made in the dental treatment plan regarding the patient‚Äôs parafunctional habits.Ten Cate's Oral Histology, Nanci, Elsevier, 2013, page 285 Even keratinized tissue can undergo further level of hyperkeratinization; an increase in the amount of keratin is produced as a result of chronic physical trauma to the region. Changes such as hyperkeratinization are reversible if the source of the injury is removed, but it takes time for the keratin to be shed or lost by the tissue. Thus, to check for malignant changes, a baseline biopsy and microscopic study of any whitened tissue may be indicated, especially if in a high-risk cancer category, such with a history of tobacco or alcohol use or are HPV positive. Hyperkeratinized tissue is also associated with the heat from smoking or hot fluids on the hard palate in the form of nicotinic stomatitis.Illustrated Dental Embryology, Histology, and Anatomy, Bath-Balogh and Fehrenbach, Elsevier, 2011, page 106 The lamina propria is a fibrous connective tissue layer that consists of a network of type I and III collagen and elastin fibers in some regions. The main cells of the lamina propria are the fibroblasts, which are responsible for the production of the fibers as well as the extracellular matrix. The lamina propria, like all forms of connective tissue proper, has two layers: papillary and dense. The papillary layer is the more superficial layer of the lamina propria. It consists of loose connective tissue within the connective tissue papillae, along with blood vessels and nerve tissue. The tissue has an equal amount of fibers, cells, and intercellular substance. The dense layer is the deeper layer of the lamina propria. It consists of dense connective tissue with a large amount of fibers. Between the papillary layer and the deeper layers of the lamina propria is a capillary plexus, which provides nutrition for the all layers of the mucosa and sends capillaries into the connective tissue papillae. A submucosa may or may not be present deep in the dense layer of the lamina propria, depending on the region of the oral cavity. If present, the submucosa usually contains loose connective tissue and may also contain adipose tissue or salivary glands, as well as overlying bone or muscle within the oral cavity. The oral mucosa has no muscularis mucosae, and clearly identifying the boundary between it and the underlying tissues is difficult. Typically, regions such as the cheeks, lips, and parts of the hard palate contain submucosa (a layer of loose fatty or glandular connective tissue containing the major blood vessels and nerves supplying the mucosa). The submucosa's composition determines the flexibility of the attachment of oral mucosa to the underlying structures. In regions such as the gingiva and parts of the hard palate, oral mucosa is attached directly to the periosteum of underlying bone, with no intervening submucosa. This arrangement is called a mucoperiosteum and provides a firm, inelastic attachment. A variable number of Fordyce spots or granules are scattered throughout the nonkeratinized tissue. These are a normal variant, visible as small, yellowish bumps on the surface of the mucosa. They correspond to deposits of sebum from misplaced sebaceous glands in the submucosa that are usually associated with hair follicles. A basal lamina (basement membrane without aid of the microscope) is at the interface between the oral epithelium and lamina propria similar to the epidermis and dermis. Function Mechanical stress is continuously placed on the oral environment by actions such as eating, drinking and talking. The mouth is also subject to sudden changes in temperature and pH meaning it must be able to adapt to change quickly. The mouth is the only place in the body which provides the sensation of taste. Due to these unique physiological features, the oral mucosa must fulfil a number of distinct functions. * Protection - One of the main functions of the oral mucosa is to physically protect the underlying tissues from the mechanical forces, microbes and toxins in the mouth. Keratinised masticatory mucosa is tightly bound to the hard palate and gingivae. It accounts for 25% of all oral mucosa. It supports underlying tissues by resisting the loading forces exerted during mastication. Lining mucosa in the cheeks, lips and floor of mouth is mobile to create space when chewing and talking. During mastication, it allows food to move freely around the mouth and physically protects the underlying tissues from trauma. It accounts for 60% of oral mucosa. * Secretion - Saliva is the primary secretion of the oral mucosa. It has many functions including lubrication, pH buffering and immunity. The lubricating and antimicrobial functions of saliva are maintained mainly by resting; saliva results in a flushing effect and the clearance of oral debris and noxious agents. Saliva contains numerous antimicrobial proteins that help protect the oral ecosystem from infectious agent. The components like lysozyme, lactoferrin, salivary peroxidase, myeloperoxidase, and thiocyanate concentrations act as a defense mechanism in the saliva. Saliva is secreted from 3 pairs of major salivary glands (parotid, submandibular, sublingual) alongside many minor salivary glands. It also aids the initial chemical digestion of food as it contains the enzyme amylase, responsible for breaking carbohydrates into sugars. * Sensation - The oral mucosa is richly innervated, meaning it is a very good at sensing pain, touch, temperature and taste. A number of cranial nerves are involved in sensations in the mouth including trigeminal (V), Facial (VII), glossopharyngeal (IX) and Vagus (X) nerves. The dorsum of the tongue is covered in specialised mucosa. This contains the presence of taste buds allowing taste, and it accounts for around 15% of oral mucosa. Reflexes such as swallowing, gagging and thirst are also initiated in the mouth. * Thermal regulation - Although not significant in humans, some animals e.g. dogs rely on panting to regulate their temperature, as sweat glands are only present in their paws  Clinical significance  = _Infective_ =  Viral  The majority of viral infections affecting the oral cavity are caused by the human Herpes Virus group. Each human herpes virus may present differently within the oral cavity. They are more likely to affect immunocompromised patients such as children and the elderly. * Herpetic Gingivostomatitis: A self-limiting viral infection which is caused by Herpes Simplex Virus-1(HSV-1). It usually presents in young children and is very contagious . It is characterised by the presence of small oral blisters which break down and coalesce into ulcers * Herpes Labialis (Cold Sore):Reactivation of latent Herpes Simplex Virus-1 triggered by sunlight, stress, and hormonal changes. It is characterised by the presence of crusting blisters on the upper lip. * Chicken Pox: A type of viral infection which is caused by Varicella Zoster Virus and presents in children. Numerous itchy blisters are found on the face and body. Blisters could also be found on inner cheek and palate of the mouth. * Herpes Zoster/Shingles: Viral infection caused by reactivation of latent Varicella Zoster Virus and found in adults. Patients can present with acute pain before or after the onset of blisters. If viral reactivation occurs in the facial nerve, it can cause Ramsay-Hunt Syndrome in which patients can develop facial paralysis, blisters around the ears and on the tongue, and loss of tongue sensation. * Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease: A highly contagious viral infection which infects young children and is caused by Coxsackie Virus A16. It is characterised by presence of small blisters all over the limbs and the mouth. * Measles: A highly infectious condition which is caused by Measles virus. It most commonly presents in young children who have not been vaccinated. It is characterised by presence of white spots (Koplik's Spots) which rupture to form ulcers on the palate. *6. Papillomas and warts/ verrucae They are caused by various strains of the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) of which there are more than 100 strains but usually due to HPV types 6 and 11 (2). Papillomas are mostly spiky, finger like projections, or cauliflower head rounded lobular shaped. Usually painless and singular. Verrucae usually appear on the lips. Verrucae Vulgaris is associated with HPV types 2 and 4. HPV types 16 and 18, designated high risk due to association with cancers, do not present like this in the oral mucosa but as white patches (1). Multifocal Epithelial Hyperplasia (Heck Disease) is rare, usually familial, swellings appear in multiples and are more common to some Native American and Inuit groups. Verricuform Xanthoma, a rare lesion which may resemble papilloma, is often white due to hyperkeratosis, usually appear in 50-70 year age group, commonly on the gingivae. They may be mistaken for papilloma or verrucous leukoplakia but are benign (1).  Bacterial  * Syphilis- Bacterial infection which is usually sexually transmitted. It is caused by bacteria Treponema Pallidum and it has different types of oral presentation at different stages of the disease.  Fungal  Oral fungal infections are most commonly caused by different Candida species such as Candida Albicans, Candida Glabrata and Candida Tropicalis resulting in oral Candidiasis. There are several predisposing factors to fungal infections such as systemic disease for example Diabetes, recent antibiotics, use of steroid inhalers etc . Management includes identifying and addressing contributory factors, the use of topical/systemic anti-fungal agents, oral and denture hygiene instruction. Different presentations of oral Candidiasis include: * Pseudomembranous Candidiasis * Erythematous Candidiasis * Denture Stomatitis * Antibiotic Candidiasis * Angular Cheilitis * Median Rhomboid Glossitis * Chronic Hyperplastic Candidiasis * Chronic Mucocutaneous Candidiasis = Autoimmune = * Lichen Planus: A chronic inflammatory disease with different forms of oral presentations. The most classic appearance of Lichen Planus is the presence of white streaks in inner cheek, tongue, and gum. Desquamative Gingivitis can be seen in patients with Lichen Planus. Biopsy is done for definitive diagnosis of Lichen Planus. * Graft versus Host Disease: An autoimmune disease developed following bone marrow transplant in which its oral presentation is similar to Lichen Planus * Pemphigus Vulgaris:An autoimmune chronic disease with clinical presentation of formation of superficial and large blisters which then burst into ulcers on the skin or mucous membrane. * Mucous Membrane Pemphigoid: Autoimmune disease which affects only mucous membranes with clinical presentation of hard and rigid blisters which then rupture eventually into deep ulcers. * Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus: These present as oral discoid lesions which may be present on the inner cheek and behind the lips. White papules may also be present. = Hypersensitivity Reaction = * Lichenoid Reaction- Intra-oral lesion which shares the appearance of Lichen Planus but arises due to contact hypersensitivity to certain dental materials or drug-induced. = Traumatic = *Frictional Keratosis: This typically presents as white plaques on the oral mucosa due to mechanical trauma. When the cause of frictional keratosis is removed the white patch may resolve *Hyperplastic reactive lesions or nodular swellings These occur in the oral mucosa due to low grade inflammation or trauma (1, 2). They develop where the mucosa is subjected to chronic minor irritants, mechanical or infective (4). They most frequently occur on the buccal mucosa (inner cheek) along the occlusal line where the teeth meet and the gingivae (the mucosa which covers the gums); reactive nodules occurring here are specifically categorised as epulides instead of polyps. Also the alveolar ridge (the gum where the teeth erupt up from or where the used to be if missing) and the hard palate (roof of mouth) (1). The most common are fibrous nodules called fibroepithelial polyps and epulides (4). Other hyperplastic reactive hyperplastic lesions include those associated with dentures, and papillomas. However, they are all similar in cause and nature, the overproduction of the cells of the mucosa, primarily the epithelial cells, also fibrous myxoid and low inflamed tissue due to irritation (1). 1. Fibroepithelial Polyps are usually pale, firm to touch, and painless but further irritation can cause abrasion and then ulceration or bleeding (1). They are sometimes be called fibroma, such as leaf fibroma, a fibroepithelial polyp often occurring under a denture and appears flattened. However, they are not true benign neoplasms (denoted by suffix ~oma), which are similar in appearance but very rare in the mouth (4). 2. Epulides. The most common epulides are: a) Fibrous Epulis. These are just fibroepithelial polyps located only on the gingivae (5). b) Pyogenic Granuloma and Pregnancy Epulis are both vascular rather than fibrous epulides with more dilated blood vessels making them appear darker pink/ red in colour, and soft (2). They may develop more fibrous as they mature. The Pregnancy variant only appears in pregnancy, usually due to plaque and should resolve with better oral hygiene and at the end of the pregnancy if not (1). Pyogenic Granuloma may occur elsewhere in the mouth such as the tongue and lips (3), but are not therefore epulides. c) Giant Cell Epulis also known as Peripheral Giant Cell Granuloma, are like Fibrous Epulis and occur at the anterior interdental margin, the gum between the teeth at the front (2). They are more common in women. They are often soft round and deep red to purplish blue (1). It is important they are investigated to make are they are not true giant cell granuloma (4). 3. Papilliary Hyperplasia of the palate (1,3), or Epulis Fissaratum/ Denture-induced Hyperplasia (2,5). The cause may be unknown (1) but there is an association with ill-fitting dentures resulting in irritation to the mucosa, usually by overextended flange, and with poor denture or oral hygiene (2,4). Oral thrush can be present but is not thought to be the cause (1) = Idiopathic = * Recurrent Apthous Stomatitis- Recurrent ulceration found in the mouth with a wide variety of predisposing factors. However, the aetiology remains unclear. There are three forms of RAS: Minor, major, and herpetiform. RAS is usually found in non-smokers and those from high socioeconomic background. Neoplastic: ‚óè Oral Submucous Fibrosis: This is a condition that involves inflammation of the tissues under the surface. This may cause rigid tissues and difficulty opening the mouth. _Benign soft tissue neoplams_ 1\\\\. Peripheral nerve sheath tumours most commonly are traumatic neuromas, a reactive response to trauma (1), neurilemmoma and neurofibroma which are large growing painless tumours usually found on the tongue (3). Neurofibroma may occur as a benign solitary lesion but can present as multiple lesions associated with (Von Reckllinghausen‚Äôs Disease) neurofibromatosis (4). They can be preceded by caf√© au lait pigmentation spots on the skin, and as they grow can become very disfiguring (4). Malignant change can occur in neurofibromatosis but very rarely in single lesion presentation. Mucosal neuromas can be associated with other conditions such as Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) Syndrome and may precede thyroid cancer. (1, 4) 2\\\\. Lipoma and fibrolipoma, are tumour of adipose tissue, or fat, giving them a yellow appearance which varies according to fat content (1, 4). They are usually soft, mobile, slow growing painless and occur mostly in middle age or the elderly. 3\\\\. Granular Cell Tumour is also a tumour arising from neural cells, though it was incorrectly thought to arise from muscle cells and therefore previously called Granular Cell Myoblastoma (4), It also is slow growing large painless and occurs mostly in the tongue (1, 3). 4\\\\. Congenital Epulis, also known as Congenital Granular Cell Tumour (but not related to Granular Cell Tumour) occur mostly on the upper gum, the maxillary alveolar ridge, of newborns, predominantly females (4). Rarely, they occur elsewhere, usually the tongue. They are usually self- resolving (1). 5\\\\. Angiomas ‚Äì vascular tumours: haemangioma, lymphangioma, venus varix (2). Angiomas are difficult to classify as previously they were considered hamartomas, benign tumour-like malformations (6) but there is debate if they are developmental abnormality, true benign tumour or hamartoma, or can be either (1, 4, 5). Haemangiomas are common in the oral mucosa but can occur in other structures such as salivary glands (4), and can be congenital (from birth) or develop in childhood. Congenital lesions can resolve spontaneously (involute) but those that develop later usually continue to slowly grow. They are usually dark red-purple or blue, soft, sometimes fluctuant (5) and painless. They commonly blanch on pressure. Usually solitary, they can occur as part of syndromes such as Sturge-weber Syndrome affecting the trigeminal nerve. They are at risk of trauma with subsequent excessive bleeding, thrombosis or calcification (2). Lymphangiomas are far less common in the oral mucosa, usually appearing on the tongue, less commonly the lip at birth or in infancy (1, 2, 4). They are colourless to pale pink and may be nodular projections (1) or resemble ‚Äòfrog spawn‚Äô domes (2). They can cause macroglossia (enlargement of the tongue) (1, 4). Venous Varix, like varicose vein, usually appear in older people on the lower lip as a blue- purple lump (2). * _Malignant Neoplasms of oral mucosa- Sarcomas_ Connective tissue malignancies, sarcomas, are rare in the oral mucosa. Osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma arise in bone and cartilage, lymphoma in haematological disorders (1). The most common malignancies are carcinomas, overwhelmingly Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SSC) (4). See Oral Cancer. # Rhabdomyosarcoma are fast growing destructive swellings usually in the maxilla. It is the most common oral sarcoma in children and adolescents (1), but rare (4). # Kaposi Sarcoma is related to the Kaposi Sarcoma Herpes Virus (KSHV) or Human Herpes Virus (HHV-8) viral infection (3). Predominating on the hard palate and gingivae it develops initially as a macule ranging in colour from red, blue, purple to brown or black, becoming nodular as it grows (2, 3, 4). The lesions are highly vascular and can ulcerate and bleed easily; death is usually from opportunistic infections (1). It is usually associated with HIV /AIDS but also less commonly with immunosuppression such as organ donor recipients or prevalent in some communities such as Mediterranean Jews (1). There is no cure (4) but the lesions respond well to Highly Active Antiretroviral Treatment (HAART) drugs (2) See also * Oral mucosa tissue engineering * Junctional epithelium * Oral cancer * Salivary glands * Basal lamina * Fibroblast References External links * ‚Äì \\"Digestive System: Oral Cavity and Teeth ‚Äì lip, oral mucosa\\" * ‚Äì \\"Lip\\" * ‚Äì \\"Lip\\" * Common Dental and Oral Mucosal Disorders, Duke University at https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221658/http://pamodules.mc.duke.edu/Oral_Health/Print.asp?CourseNum=1&LessonNum;=3 Dental anatomy ","title":"Oral mucosa"},{"id":"2949868","title":"Coconut Fred's Fruit Salad Island"},{"id":"2949885","text":"Zebul may refer to: * Zebul (biblical figure), the ruler of Shechem under Abimelech in the Bible (Judges 9:28) * Jephtha's brother in Handel's oratorio Jephtha * one of the first two judges of Israel according to Pseudo-Philo (written ca. 70 AD) * the sixth of the seven heavens in Jewish mysticism - see Heaven in Judaism ","title":"Zebul"},{"id":"2949890","text":"\\"Inchworm\\", also known as \\"The Inch Worm\\", is a song originally performed by Danny Kaye in the 1952 film Hans Christian Andersen. It was written by Frank Loesser. Lyrics The song's lyrics express a carpe diem sentiment, with the singer noting that the inchworm of the title has a \\"business-like mind\\", and is blind to the beauty of the flowers it encounters: :Two and two are four :Four and four are eight :That‚Äôs all you have on your business-like mind :Two and two are four :Four and four are eight :How can you be so blind? Subsequent verses include the lines \\"Measuring the marigolds, you and your arithmetic / You‚Äôll probably go far\\" and \\"Seems to me you‚Äôd stop and see / How beautiful they are\\" Loesser wrote a counterpoint chorus that, sung by itself, has become popular as a children's song because of its arithmetical chorus: :Two and two are four :Four and four are eight :Eight and eight are sixteen :Sixteen and sixteen are thirty-two In the film, a children's chorus sings the contrapuntal \\"arithmetic\\" section over and over inside a small classroom, dolefully and by rote, while Andersen, listening just outside, gazes at an inchworm crawling on the flowers and sings the main section of the song. Loesser loved the intellectual challenge of such contrapuntal composition, which he also did in other works such as Tallahassee. Reception The composer received a fan letter (signed pseudonymously, \\"Your respectfully, a Kansas inchworm\\") which said of the song: Loesser was so touched by the letter that he placed a large advertisement in the largest newspaper in Lawrence, Kansas -- the Daily Journal World -- in thanks. His correspondent wrote again, revealing herself to be teacher Emily Preyer. Recorded versions Inchworm has been recorded by many singers, including Paul McCartney, David Bowie, Rachelle Ferrell, The Brothers Creeggan, Anne Murray, Kenny Loggins, We Five, John Lithgow, Mary Hopkin, Doris Day, Dan Zanes, Kurt Wagner and Patricia Barber. Performed instrumentally, it was a regular feature of the John Coltrane Quartet's repertoire and appears on the album Coltrane. David Bowie said the song was the inspiration behind his 1980 song \\"Ashes to Ashes\\": Use in film and television * A recording of Danny Kaye singing it was used as the underscoring for a shadow puppet segment on the Captain Kangaroo television show. * Inchworm has been performed in skits on Jim Henson's Sesame Street and The Muppet Show; the song was done twice by Charles Aznavour, once in a regular sketch, and then again with Danny Kaye and the Muppets when he was on the show. * The song was performed on the American children's television show Curiosity Shop (ABC). * In the television series Quantum Leap episode Another Mother, Al (Dean Stockwell) sang it as a lullaby. * It was used in a 1995 episode of the UK television programme BBC Horizons entitled \\"Nanotopia\\", during a segment explaining the \\"assemblers\\" of Eric Drexler. * The song was also briefly featured in the popular British schools drama Grange Hill, being sung by the school choir during rehearsals. * It was featured at the end of a fourth season episode of the show Northern Exposure. * There was also a Hebrew version of the song, sung by children and a male singer. * In 2010, twice Ivor Novello Awards-nominated band The Leisure Society performed the song for the American Laundromat Records kindie compilation, \\"Sing Me to Sleep - Indie Lullabies.\\" * The song was also sung as a children's lullaby during episode 17 of the first season of the popular TV sitcom Everybody Loves Raymond.

Biography =Early years= Edward Atkinson was born in Brookline, Massachusetts and educated in private schools. He received a Ph.D. from Dartmouth College and an LL.D. from the University of South Carolina. In the decade before the Civil War, Atkinson was a successful entrepreneur as an executive of some of the leading cotton mills of New England. Later, he was President of Boston Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Company and the Mutual Boiler Insurance Company of Boston. Atkinson married Mary Caroline Heath in 1855; they had 9 children, 7 of whom survived to adulthood.\\"Edward Atkinson Papers, 1819-1920: Guide to the Collection,\\" Massachusetts Historical Society, /www.masshist.org/ One of his sons, Robert Whitman Atkinson (1868-1934) was a musician and composer best known for composing \\"The Party at Odd Fellows Hall\\", a popular waltz of the 1890s, to words by J. Wendell Jr. In 1886 Atkinson invented an improved kitchen stove known as the \\"Aladdin cooker,\\" a slow-cooking device that used a minimal power input, akin to the principle employed by the modern crock pot.For an illustrated discussion of this device, see: \\"The Aladdin Cooker,\\" English Mechanic and World of Science, vol. 43, whole no. 1,106 (June 4, 1886), pp. 294-295. =Political activity= Atkinson fought against slavery by supporting the Free-Soil Party and the Boston Vigilance Committee, an organization that aided escaped slaves. Growing weary of compromise, he began raising money to pay for rifles and ammunition to support the insurgent guerrilla force of John Brown. In 1866, he was chosen a delegate to the national union convention held in Philadelphia, but he took no part in its deliberations. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1879. He was inspired by the ideas of Adam Smith, Richard Cobden, and John Bright, and he became a leading publicist for free trade. In many ways, he can be described as the American counterpart to Fr√©d√©ric Bastiat. He spoke out against the inflationist ideas of William Jennings Bryan and others but, unlike some, favored the total denationalization or privatization of money.David T.

By the pro-expansion paper, New York Tribune, reprinted Literary Digest, 22 (April 13, 1901). He campaigned for Grover Cleveland and participated in the formation of the Clevelandite National Democratic ticket in 1896. Atkinson was appalled by the colonialist and imperialist policies of the McKinley and Roosevelt administrations in the wake of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. He reacted by becoming a full-time activist in the American Anti-Imperialist League, and was opposed to U.S. intervention against Spain in Cuba and the Philippines.https://www.lewrockwell.com/2012/04/anthony-gregory/libertarians- who-are-pro-war/ As a vice president of that organization, Atkinson wrote to the United States Department of War for a list of soldiers serving in the Philippines so that he might send them his privately published pamphlets. Failing to receive a reply, Atkinson announced to the press that he was sending copies to Generals Lawton, Miller, and Otis, Admiral Dewey, correspondent J. F. Bass, and to Jacob Shurman and Dean Worcestrer on the Philippine Commission. On February 17, 1899, Edward Atkinson sent three pamphlets to test the right of citizens of the United States to the free use of the mail: *\\"The Cost of a National Crime,\\" detailing the American military oppression of the Filipinos and the spiraling cost of the war to American taxpayers. *\\"The Hell of War and Its Penalties\\" *\\"Criminal Aggression: By Whom Committed?\\" United States Postmaster General Charles Emory Smith ordered that the pamphlets be seized in San Francisco, declaring them \\"seditious\\". The United States Attorney General hinted that he would charge Atkinson with treason and sedition, but decided against it, as officials feared that charging him would only make the 72-year-old a martyr.Beito and Beito, 555-75 The US pro-expansion press called Atkinson a \\"latter-day copperhead\\". Atkinson seemed to enjoy the infamy, and he effusively and sarcastically thanked the Administration for calling national attention to his essays and increasing their demand in every state in the union., page 107; Boston Herald, 22 April, 23, 24, 1899; New York Times, 23 April 1899; San Francisco Call, 24 April 1899. =Death and legacy= Edward Atkinson died on December 11, 1905.

It is bounded to the south by Jackson Heights and Corona, to the north and east by Bowery Bay, and to the west by Woodside and Ditmars Steinway. The area includes LaGuardia Airport, located on the shore of Flushing Bay, and Astoria Heights (ZIP Code 11370). East Elmhurst is part of Queens Community District 3 and its ZIP Codes are 11369, 11370, and 11371. The neighborhood is patrolled by the New York City Police Department's 115th Precinct, though the airport is patrolled by the Port Authority Police Department. East Elmhurst and its southern neighbor Corona are often referred to jointly as \\"Corona/East Elmhurst\\".  Location  The boundaries of East Elmhurst, as with most other New York City neighborhoods, are imprecise and often disputed, but the name generally applies to the area directly south of LaGuardia Airport. A more expansive definition considers East Elmhurst to be bordered by the Brooklyn Queens Expressway (BQE) and 70th Street on the west, Northern Boulevard on the south, and Flushing Bay on the north and east. According to the Encyclopedia of New York City, the section west of Junction Boulevard and south of Astoria Boulevard is excluded from East Elmhurst.  History  From colonial times to the early 1900s, the area now known as East Elmhurst was a vast marsh named Trains Meadow. Urbanization at the turn of the century was creating a New York City housing shortage and urban sprawl. In 1909, Edward A. MacDougall's Queensboro Corporation bought of undeveloped land and farms to the south and christened them Jackson Heights after John C. Jackson, a descendant of one of the original Queens families and a respected Queens County entrepreneur.Marzlock, Ron. \\"Jackson Ave. and its namesake\\". Queens Chronicle. November 21, 2013. The neighborhood formerly contained an amusement area along Bowery Bay Beach (later renamed North Beach), which started operating in 1886. An amusement park called Gala Amusement Park was built by William Steinway on the Bowery Bay in what is now present-day LaGuardia Airport. In the 19th century the area used to be called Frogtown before Steinway rebuilt the area. It was home to the East Coast's first Ferris wheel and was known as the \\"Coney Island of Queens.\\" Gala Amusement Park was eventually shut down due to Prohibition. In 1929 it was razed and transformed into a private flying field named Glenn H. Curtiss Airport after the pioneer Long Island aviator, later called North Beach Airport. Starting in 1937, a Works Progress Administration project transformed North Beach Airport into LaGuardia Airport, which formally opened in 1939. The first houses were built in 1905. These residences were small frame houses located on lots, and some houses on the bay contained private beaches. The neighborhood's first commercial development came to Ditmars Boulevard during World War II. In 1929, Holmes Airport opened near the western section of East Elmhurst. Bordering St. Michaels Cemetery to the west, the airfield was also called the Grand Central Air Terminal and Grand Central Airport. Holmes Airport shut down in 1940, one year after LaGuardia Airport opened. Today, the site is part of the Bulova Corporate Center and residential homes that surround the area. Demographics Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of East Elmhurst was 23,150, an increase of 1,967 (9.3%) from the 21,183 counted in 2000.

The CL125A was produced from 1967 to 1969 with a 124 cc 4-stroke engine and four- speed transmission. It was the smallest OHC twin cylinder four-stroke that Honda made, and was the smaller sibling to the 160, 175, 350 & 450 models. In 1970, Honda released its venerable, light weight, 99 cc OHC single 2-valve upright engine. This was a direct challenge to the off-road market which was, at this time, dominated by the two-strokes. A sea wave of change was to quickly follow many of its CB, CL and SL based models. In 1973, the first CL125S was manufactured using this new motor in its design, with a larger 122 cc piston (which produced more low-end torque but little gain in power) and a slightly larger piston/rod connecting pin. That helped push the dry weight of the bike down to . This motorcycle was almost identical to the 1970 to 1973 CL100, that was really only a slight modification of the CB series produced at the same time. The modifications included; lower rear sprocket gearing, slightly more aggressive tires, shorter front fender, braced handlebar, high mount exhaust system and elimination of the tachometer.1974 Honda CL125S Scrambler Red.1974 Honda CL125S.

Guided Light Transit (GLT, ) is the name of guided bus technology and associated infrastructure designed and manufactured by Bombardier Transportation. It has been installed in two French cities: Nancy and Caen. As of 2018, only the Nancy system is in operation; the Caen system has been abandoned and now rebuilt as a conventional tramway by 2019. Both of the systems in these cities are referred to as \\"tramways on tyres\\", and in common with tram systems they use a surface guidance system and in normal operation are powered by electricity drawn from an overhead wire. However, while the vehicles are guided by a central guidance rail, they ride on rubber tyres, not on rails. There has been disagreement about whether they should be called \\"trams\\", for that reason and also because they are capable of being steered and operating independently of the guidance rail, using auxiliary diesel engines. GLT is effectively a model of guided dual-mode bus, but when GLT vehicles use a pantograph to collect current, as do those in Caen, they are not commonly considered to be trolleybuses. English transport publications generally refer to the GLT and the competing Translohr system as \\"rubber-tyred tramways\\", but rarely simply as \\"tramways\\", as they are not tramways in the conventional sense, but neither are they buses when pantograph-equipped and operating in service as designed (i.e. in electric mode). GLT is one of the few models (together with the Innovia APM) of rubber-tyred vehicles produced by Bombardier's transport division, which is otherwise focused on rail transport. Characteristics central rail embedded in the road guides GLT vehicles while they are in their \\"tram-like\\" mode. guide rail and guide wheel GLT and the similar Translohr are often described as the tram equivalent of rubber-tyred metro technology, but this is not strictly accurate; while the GLT follows a central rail, the rail does not support the vehicle, and the actual wheels which are as independent as those of a regular bus. The wheels of rubber-tyred metros, on the other hand, are bound and guided by their rails in the same way as are steel-wheeled trains. Unlike trams and Translohr vehicles, GLT vehicles have a steering wheel, though it is not used when following a guidance rail. On the GLT line in Nancy, more than one-third of the 10-km route has no guide rail, and steering is controlled entirely by the driver on those sections. The Nancy GLT system is operated by the Soci√©t√© de Transports de l'Agglom√©ration Nancienne, or STAN. With two articulation points and a total length of , GLT vehicles are shorter than most modern trams, but long compared with conventional buses. They are designed to look like trams, but they are unidirectional and have bus-like rear-view mirrors. They have 100% low floors, have 40 seats, and have standing room for as many as 105 passengers. In Caen, where the central guidance rail has been installed on all sections of the passenger-service route, the vehicles collect their power from a pantograph, returning it through the central guidance rail, and use their diesel engines and steering wheels only while travelling to and from the depot. Use of a pantograph effectively requires that a surface guidance system be used, to ensure the vehicle remains approximately centred below the overhead wire, so that its pantograph does not slip out from underneath the wire. The Caen vehicles thus cannot move laterally away from the overhead wire except when running in diesel mode (as conventional buses), and for this reason the Caen route is not commonly considered to be a trolleybus system. Nancy's fleet of 25 GLT vehicles use dual trolley poles to collect and return their electric power, in order to allow the use of existing wires constructed for use by the town's previous generation of trolleybuses and to permit operation, where desired by the transport authority, away from the guide rail. The Nancy vehicles follow a guidance rail on about 60% of the route, and thus the Nancy route uniquely is considered to be both a rubber- tyred tramway and a trolleybus line. The system was first brought into use for passenger service in February 2001, but operation was suspended from March 2001 through March 2002 while Bombardier performed upgrades to the vehicles. In Caen, the GLT fleet began operation in November 2002, incorporating the changes made to Nancy's vehicles during the upgrade. They were operated by the Compagnie des Transports de l'Agglom√©ration Caennaise under the name Twisto until 2017, when the system was shut down and replaced by a conventional tram system. Advantages Much like trams, GLT vehicles can dock with low station platforms for level boarding. While the GLT's central guidance rail is not significantly less expensive than the rails needed by regular trams, the overall system can be installed at a lower cost since existing trolleybus wires can be used without the installation of tracks, and not all new sections need have either rails or electric wires installed; even if the entire passenger route is equipped with guidance rails and wires, as in Caen, the depot need not be located immediately by the track, saving planners from having to find space for a new yard in what may be a central and high-valued area of the city. Another advantage over trams, which was particularly of interest to planners in Nancy, is that rubber tyres give significantly more traction than steel wheels, and so can be used to climb steeper hills, up to a grade or slope of 13%. The Nancy route T1 includes a section with a 13% grade. Compared to buses, the use of a guidance rail allows GLT vehicles running in parallel lanes to pass closer together than drivers could safely steer. They can also draw up to level, tram-like platforms that allow for easier boarding, and give access to passengers dependent on wheelchairs without requiring the time-consuming deployment of ramps or 'kneeling' systems. Disadvantages The GLT systems in place have experienced some mechanical problems which, though they have largely been resolved, have discouraged some other cities from adopting the technology. The vehicles have shown a tendency to move erratically when running free, and do not respond well should the driver mistakenly attempt to steer while following the guidance rail (for example, to avoid a pedestrian or animal running into the street). In addition, due to the tyres running over the same spot in the road, in both Nancy and Caen there has been significant rutting of the roadway, resulting in extensive repairs at significant cost to the operator. This could be considered to add to the already high running costs. Ride quality is also said to be poor, not much of an improvement on a bus, due to the four-wheeled design, whereas trams have bogies. Guidewheel mechanical failures have occurred, causing the trolleybus to swerve off the roadway. This is due to the high centrifugal forces exerted on the wheel when rounding corners. Due to this, a speed limit of 10 km/h is now enforced on corners. One of the main aims of the system, to achieve a lower cost per kilometre than trams, has failed. Other French tramways achieve a cost per kilometre at least 10% lower than that for the guided bus. Similarly, the cost per person of the vehicles is also noticeably higher with the guided bus than a tram. Where snowfall is an issue, this system may not be practical: since the guide rail forms the return leg of the electrical circuit, accumulation of ice and snow on the rail could cause intermittent power interruptions to the vehicle. Also, as the vehicle does not place a significant portion of its weight on the guide wheel (most of it being supported by the rubber tyres), snow packed into the flangeways or atop the rail by road traffic could lift the guide wheel off the rail, leading the vehicle to go off course. Critics of the system also point out that, unlike a conventional tramway, GLT is a proprietary system, meaning that once having installed it, a city would face difficulties in purchasing vehicles from any manufacturer other than Bombardier. A standard tramway, by contrast, can easily accommodate vehicles from multiple suppliers; Nancy's neighbour Strasbourg, for example, has chosen the Alstom Citadis tram to supplement its existing Eurotram fleet. Because of the problems encountered by cities which have purchased the Bombardier Guided Bus (one of which has demanded compensation for the costs it has had to pay for the GLT) Bombardier will not sell any more GLT systems, at least until all the issues have been resolved. Legal status GLT vehicles are legally considered buses, and they must bear number plates, rear-view mirrors and lights. Unlike trams and Translohr vehicles, GLT vehicles have a steering wheel (though it is not used when following a guidance rail), and are capable of operating independent of the guideway.

Acting career Born in New York City, Dell almost made his stage debut a few years before Dead End when he and his sister were slated for roles in The Good Earth with Alla Nazimova and Claude Rains. Dell served in the United States Merchant Marine during World War II. He appeared in numerous films as a Dead End Kid/East Side Kid/Bowery Boy. In the 1944 East Side Kids film Million Dollar Kid, Dell actually appeared as a criminal villain, pitted against the boys, who gets brought to justice in the end. Dell's most prominent stage role was in the play The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window, written by Lorraine Hansberry. The production opened on Broadway at the Longacre Theatre on October 15, 1964, and was directed by Peter Kass. Jack Blackman designed scenery, Jules Fisher designed lighting, and Fred Voelpel designed costumes. The original cast featured Dell as Sidney Brustein and Rita Moreno as Iris Parodus Brustein. The play received mixed reviews and closed on January 10, 1965. His other non-Dead End Kids/Bowery Boys films included The 300 Year Weekend (1971), Who Is Harry Kellerman and Why Is He Saying Those Terrible Things About Me? (1971), Earthquake (1974), and Framed (1975). He also appeared in The Manchu Eagle Murder Caper Mystery (1975), and The Escape Artist (1982). Dell also made several appearances on television shows during the 1960s and '70s including Ben Casey, The Fugitive, Mannix, Then Came Bronson, I Dream of Jeannie, McCloud, Sanford and Son, and Barney Miller. According to differing sources, either Don Francks or Dell Archived from the original on May 26, 2018. was the uncredited actor providing the voice of Boba Fett, a Mandalorian bounty hunter, in the Star Wars Holiday Special.

The hopeful identification of the site as the Biblical Sukkot is not confirmed by any inscription at the site. However, in Jerusalem Talmud Zeraim Shevi'it 9:2, Sukkot is referred as 'Dar øala or Tar'ellah' hence maybe deformed later into Deir Alla. Deir Alla was the first Bronze Age city excavated in Jordan. The initial expectations were of establishing a relative chronology of Palestine pottery in the transition between the Bronze Age to the Iron Age, established through meticulous stratigraphy. It was intended to span a gap between established chronologies at Jericho and Samaria.Franken 1960:386-393. The oldest sanctuary at Deir Alla dates to the Late Bronze Age;There had been earlier, but unrelated Chalcolithic inhabitants of the tell. Franken (1961:371) it was peacefully rebuilt at intervals, the floor being raised as the tell accumulated height, and the squared altar stone renewed, each new one placed atop the previous one. The final sanctuary was obliterated in a fierce fire; the blackened remains of an Egyptian jar bearing the cartouche of Queen Twosret gives a terminus post quem of c. 1200 BCE, a date consonant with other twelfth-century urban destruction in the Ancient Near East.H.J. Franken, \\"The Excavations at Deir ÷ùAllƒÅ in Jordan: 2nd Season\\" Vetus Testamentum 11.4 (October 1961), pp. 361-372. Unlike some other destroyed sites, Deir Alla's habitation continued after the disaster, without a break, into the Iron Age; the discontinuity was a cultural one, with highly developed pottery of a separate ceramic tradition post-dating the destruction. On 20 August 2010, it recorded a scorching temperature of 51.1¬∞C, the new official highest temperature in the history of Jordan. Archaeology A series of Dutch excavations sponsored by the Netherlands Organisation for the Advancement of Pure Research began in 1960, under the auspices of the department of theology, University of Leiden. These excavations continued for five seasons until 1967. The excavation made its most dramatic discovery in 1967, an ink wall inscription relating a hitherto-unknown prophecy of Balaam, who thereby becomes the first Old Testament prophet to be identified in an inscription.H. J. Franken and Ah J. Franken, Excavations at Tell Deir Alla: the Late Bronze Age Sanctuary, David Brown, 1992, At the end of the 1964 campaign, 11 clay tablets, 3 inscribed in a hitherto unknown possibly alphabetic script (Proto- Canaanite alphabet), 7 bearing only dots, and one uninscribed, were discovered. =The Balaam inscription= The 1967 excavation revealed a many- chambered structure that had also been destroyed by earthquake, during the Persian period at the site.

He was a composer, arranger, producer, and actor. He gained popularity in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Biography =Early life= Mouzon, of African, French, and Blackfoot descent, was born on November 21, 1948, in Charleston, South Carolina. He received his first musical training at Bonds-Wilson High School, and moved to New York City upon graduation. He studied drama and music at the City College of New York, as well as medicine at Manhattan Medical School. He continued receiving drum lessons from Bobby Thomas, the drummer for jazz pianist Billy Taylor. He played percussion in the 1968 Broadway show Promises, Promises, and he then worked with pianist McCoy Tyner. He spent a year as a member of the jazz fusion band, Weather Report. After that Mouzon signed as a solo artist to the Blue Note label in 1972. =Career= Mouzon's visibility increased during his tenure with guitarist Larry Coryell's Eleventh House fusion band from 1973 to 1975. Albums from this period include Introducing the Eleventh House, Level One, Mind Transplant (a solo album), and in 1977, a reconciliation recording with Coryell entitled Back Together Again. Mouzon recorded Mind Transplant in 1974 with guitarist Tommy Bolin, who had previously played on Billy Cobham's Spectrum. He recorded four R&B; albums: The Essence of Mystery (Blue Note, 1972), Funky Snakefoot (Blue Note, 1973), The Man Incognito (Blue Note, 1976) (including \\"Take Your Troubles Away\\"), and in the 1980s By All Means, which featured Herbie Hancock, Lee Ritenour, the Seawind Horns, and Freddie Hubbard. Mouzon performed with many prominent jazz-fusion musicians. In 1991, he performed with Miles Davis on the movie soundtrack album entitled Dingo. Mouzon composed the song The Blue Spot for the jazz club scene, and appeared as an actor and drummer in the Tom Hanks-directed film, That Thing You Do in 1996. Alphonse Mouzon played the role of Miles in the film The Highlife, which was exhibited at a film festival in Houston in 2003. He also can be seen with Michael Keaton and Katie Holmes in the film First Daughter, and as Ray in the movie The Dukes, along with Robert Davi, Chazz Palminteri and Peter Bogdanovich. Mouzon played with Stevie Wonder, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Carlos Santana, Patrick Moraz, Betty Davis, and Chubby Checker. Robert Plant, lead singer of Led Zeppelin, during his acceptance speech for induction into the 1995 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, listed Alphonse Mouzon as one of the band's influences from American music. In 1992, Mouzon formed Tenacious Records, and released his album The Survivor. Subsequent releases on Tenacious Records, including re-issues of earlier albums, included On Top of the World, Early Spring, By All Means, Love Fantasy, Back to Jazz, As You Wish, The Night is Still Young, The Sky is the Limit, Distant Lover, Morning Sun, and Absolute Greatest Love Songs and Ballads. The 1981 album Morning Sun was his most successful album in Southeast Asia, particularly in the Philippines. Most songs in the album, notably the title track, were extensively played on various FM and AM radio stations during that time, and are still being used in advertisements, commercials, social events, and radio news programmes in that country.

The Skylands property is within the Ramapo Mountains and it is maintained by the Skyland Association. The property is marketed with the garden as New Jersey State Botanical Garden at Skylands. The house and gardens, including formal gardens and specimen plantings, were built in the 1920s by Clarence MacKenzie Lewis, a New York City stockbroker and civil engineer. Lewis hired architect John Russell Pope to design the 44-room Tudor revival manor house. The manor is a reproduction English mansion featuring rectangular, bay and oriel windows. A nine-hole golf course once graced this property. The estate was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 28, 1990 for its significance in architecture and landscape architecture. Garden In 1966 the entire estate was bought by the State of New Jersey to form a State Botanical Garden whose settings include a Lilac Garden, Magnolia Walk, the Wild Flower Garden, the Crab Apple Vista, an all√©e of 166 trees extending almost a half-mile, and the Perennial Garden. The entire section now comprises slightly over 4,000 acres (16 km¬≤) of parkland. The Winter Garden included New Jersey's largest Jeffery pine (Pinus jeffreyi). Its east side features a weeping beech beside a century-old upright beech, as well as a Japanese umbrella pine.

In the classical novel Water Margin, Tong Guan is fictionalised as a corrupt government official and an enemy of the 108 Stars of Destiny. Life and career Tong Guan began his military career under the mentorship of a leading eunuch general of the 1080s and became one of the few eunuch generals of the Song dynasty.Ebrey, 166 Despite being a eunuch, it was written by many that Tong Guan had strong personal character and was in peak physical condition, with a long beard that was considered unusual for eunuchs. After Tong Guan gained his first victory in battle in 1104, Emperor Huizong granted him a valuable document of his own calligraphy written in his unique \\"slender gold\\" style. After Tong Guan gained a greater reputation by commanding a series of victorious battles in the northwest against the Tanguts, he became the favourite general and advisor of Emperor Huizong. In 1111, he went on a diplomatic mission to the Khitan-led Liao dynasty to the northeast, and after this his career steadily advanced. The following year, he was promoted to the top of the military command structure and by 1116 he was the first eunuch in the Song dynasty to gain entry into the top echelons of central administration as one of the chief policy-makers. Tong Guan was involved in all of the elite social gatherings of the time, as his name appeared as a guest on numerous lists for organised parties and banquets hosted by Emperor Huizong. He was also one of only ten palace eunuchs who had their biographies as painters compiled and written for the court. In the year 1118, Tong Guan suggested to Emperor Huizong that a military alliance with the Jurchens would be favourable in crushing the Liao dynasty once and for all.Ebrey, 165. Emperor Huizong agreed, despite some protest by other ministers at court. In a secret alliance and mission of envoys across the borders, Tong Guan played a leading role in the agreement that was reached between the Jurchens and the Song dynasty to divide the Liao dynasty's territory (while the Song would ultimately obtain their coveted prize: the Sixteen Prefectures). In 1120, at the age of 66, Tong Guan was put in command of an army to begin the assault on the Liao dynasty's southern capital, Yanjing. However, the campaign was halted for a time when word came to Tong Guan's camp that a revolt had broken out within the Song Empire, Fang La's rebellion in Zhejiang. His army was forced to march several hundred miles south to Zhejiang in order to suppress this rebellion. After successfully quelling this rebellion, his army marched back north but was routed in battle. Shortly after this, the Jurchens defeated the Liao dynasty at Yanjing and occupied the city. The city of Yanjing was turned over to Song forces only after a substantial payment was made to the Jurchens. Due to his losses and inability to take Yanjing, when Tong Guan returned to Kaifeng, he was forced to retire from his post as commander. Although he was earlier forced to retire, in 1124, Tong Guan was called back into military service by Emperor Huizong, who trusted no other general more than Tong Guan to head the mission across the northern border. However, in the last month of 1125, Tong Guan fled across the border back to Kaifeng to deliver the ill-fated news that the Jurchens had begun an invasion of the Song dynasty. Tong Guan was made the leader of Emperor Huizong's personal bodyguard after the emperor abdicated the throne and fled from Kaifeng. Tong Guan was later blamed for much of the disaster that befell the Song dynasty when the Jurchens conquered northern China. Emperor Huizong's successor, Emperor Qinzong, had Tong Guan executed.

The route runs along Rice Road, linking Interstate 10 (I-10) midway between the Coachella Valley and Blythe on the California‚ÄìArizona border, to SR 62 near Rice. SR 177 travels along the eastern portion of the Joshua Tree National Park; like the eastern of SR 62, it passes through some of the most desolate areas of the Mojave Desert. Route description SR 177 begins at I-10 near Desert Center and briefly travels north, intersecting with CR R2. At this intersection, SR 177 turns northeast and travels across the Mojave Desert, through the Chuckwalla Valley. It passes near the Desert Center Airport and comes near Palen Lake, a dry lake. The highway passes along the southeastern boundary of Joshua Tree National Park before turning due north and crossing the desert for several miles. SR 177 briefly turns northeast again before intersecting with SR 62 and defaulting onto SR 62 eastbound. The route is two lanes wide for its entire length. SR 177 is not part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. In 2013, SR 177 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 1,200 at the northern terminus with SR 62, and 3,700 at the southern terminus with I-10, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway. History The Metropolitan Water District built a road from Desert Center that ran north before turning east to Earp along with portions of the Colorado River Aqueduct from February 20 to August 4 in 1933. This was part of a road system that was built in order to support the construction of the aqueduct by connecting the camps that construction workers resided in during the project. This road cost $389,600 (about $ in dollars) to construct; the roads in the system were paved. SR 177 was added to the state highway system in 1972 by the California State Legislature. As of 1998, Caltrans had no plans to expand the highway, considering it to be \\"maintain only\\" through 2015.

Accessed on May 6, 2019. an American rapper and record producer also known as Extra P. and Large Pro. Based in New York City, he is known as a founding member of the underground hip hop group Main Source and as mentor and frequent collaborator of Nas. About.com ranked Large Professor at No. 13 on its Top 25 Hip-Hop Producers list.  Early life  William Paul Mitchell was born in Harlem, New York City, New York and raised in Flushing, Queens, New York, where he attended John Bowne High School.[ Large Professor Biography] at Allmusic.com  Career  Large Professor in 2007 Large Professor started making his earliest beats with two turntables, a Casio SK-1 sampler, and pause-tape cassettes before his mentor Paul C taught him how to use an E-mu SP-1200. During his pause tape phase he noted that some of his techniques were different than those of other producers. \\"I was trying to catch it from a different part of the record. I would catch it from the hi-hat when dudes were just catching it from the one kick. I would catch it from the third hi-hat and be flipping it.\\" In 1989 he joined the group Main Source, which also included Toronto natives K-Cut and Sir Scratch. In 1990 Large produced three tracks for Eric B. & Rakim's Let the Rhythm Hit 'Em, including \\"In the Ghetto\\". To make \\"In the Ghetto\\", he sampled directly off of a cassette tape of sample ideas Paul C had made for Rakim. Main Source recorded one album with Large called Breaking Atoms, which was released in 1991. It included hits such as \\"Just Hangin' Out\\", \\"Looking at the Front Door\\", and featured Nas' first public appearance on a track called \\"Live at the Barbeque\\", along with Akinyele and Joe Fatal. Large Professor now considers \\"Looking at the Front Door\\" one of the most emotional records of his career, later saying \\"That's a deep record. At that time in life, I was eighteen years old. It was a kid with a pure heart, just writing, and putting his soul out there for the world.\\" In 1992, their success allowed them to record \\"Fakin' the Funk\\", a track on the White Men Can't Jump motion-picture soundtrack. Because of business differences, Large and Main Source quietly parted ways and Large went on to sign with Geffen Records. During and after his tenure with Main Source, he worked with Pete Rock & CL Smooth, and he produced a number of tracks for Nas, Busta Rhymes, Masta Ace, The X-Ecutioners, Tragedy Khadafi, Big Daddy Kane, Mobb Deep, A Tribe Called Quest, and others during the 1990s. During this time he handled a significant amount of production on several projects for other artists. In 1993 he produced Akinyele's entire Vagina Diner album, which experienced some modest commercial success at the time of its release. Though the album did well at first, The Source later wrote an article criticizing the song \\"I Luh Huh\\", in which Akinyele considers pushing his pregnant girlfriend down the stairs as a form of abortion. The ensuing backlash for the controversial lyrics hurt the album's performance. Akinyele wrote a response in the next issue defending the song and pointing out that the violent ideas in the songs are just thoughts, and he ends the song by saying \\"Just cause I talk this shit don't get me wrong, Yo, I still luh hur.\\" Large Professor also produced \\"Keep It Rollin'\\" on A Tribe Called Quest's Midnight Marauders not long after he left Main Source. This was a major moment in his career that helped him reach a new level of credibility and exposure as a solo artist. In 1994, Large Professor produced three of the ten songs on Nas's Illmatic (\\"Halftime\\", \\"One Time 4 Your Mind\\", and \\"It Ain't Hard to Tell\\"), the most of any producer involved with the album. According to an interview with Busta Rhymes, the \\"Halftime\\" beat was originally intended for him. Though he liked the beat, he didn't end up using it and later regretted it after hearing \\"Halftime\\". While describing the making of the song in an interview Large Pro said, \\"I mean, we just wanted to put something gritty out there to the world, and those drums‚Äîthat's what it was at that time. It was that gritty, muffled out, because the Hip Hop that we grew up with‚Ä¶ We grew up with park jam tapes and things like the fidelity of these tapes.\\" He was so instrumental in the making of Illmatic that Nas wanted to give him an executive producer credit, but he refused. In 1996, Large Professor completed his debut solo album The LP for Geffen Records. It was promoted by the singles \\"The Mad Scientist\\" and \\"I Juswannachill\\". After several delays, the album was shelved and later released as a bootleg version in 2002. An official release of the album finally came out in 2009, thirteen years after its original intended release date. In 2001, Large Pro produced \\"You're da Man\\" and \\"Rewind\\" for Nas's Stillmatic album. He first played Nas the beat for \\"You're da Man\\" while Nas was working on Nastradamus a few years prior. Nas chose the beat but decided to save it for a later project. Large Professor also used the same vocal sample from the chorus on the song \\"The Man\\" for his 1st Class album.

His birth name was Pataatai but he assumed the name Horonuku - meaning landslide - after the death of his parents in a landslide in 1846. He was placed under house arrest by the Crown and forced to gift the mountains of Ruapehu, Tongariro and Ngauruhoe in 1887 for the creation of Tongariro National Park. Tongariro deed of gift between Horonuku Te Heuheu T≈´kino IV of NgƒÅti T≈´wharetoa and the Crown (1887) Horonuku's father, Mananui (Tukino II), was a famous warrior who led the tribe successfully in many wars. Mananui stood well over two metres tall and was heavily built, and was not only a formidable warrior but also a fine military tactician. He was succeeded after his death in a landslide by his son Horonuku, however, because he was at such a young age of 16 they had his brother mind the iwi, Iwikau (Tukino III), also a famous fighting chief. When Iwikau died in 1862 Horonuku succeeded his uncle as paramount chief. Although Horonuku was not renowned as a warrior he was an intelligent and far-sighted statesman who did the best for his people. During the 1860s Tuwharetoa lands in the central North Island were leased to European settlers farming sheep, but a decade later the Tuwharetoa were worried that the mountains were to be surveyed and that Europeans would break traditional tapu. Horonuku, having discussed the subject with other chiefs of his tribe, put a proposition to the government ‚Äì that the land be bequeathed to the nation as a national park, on the condition that the government should remove from the mountains the remains of their famous predecessors, including Mananui, and erect a suitable tomb. The government agreed and the deed was signed by John Ballance as Native Minister and Horonuku, in 1887. Horonuku's sons included Tureiti Te Heuheu Tukino V.

They are a part of Route 9 and the Tsuen Wan entrance is the reset point (As Route 9 is apparently a loop) of Route 9. Construction started on 11 February 1987 and the tunnels opened on 20 April 1990. They are made up of three sections, each with twin two-lane tunnels (one each way). The westerly pair passes through Smuggler's Ridge near Shing Mun Reservoir, where it gets its name from; the easterly pair passes through Needle Hill and is linked to the westerly pair by two viaducts over Lower Shing Mun Reservoir. The toll plaza and bus interchange are located outside the Tsuen Wan end of the tunnel. The tunnels lead to Cheung Pei Shan Road and connect Wo Yi Hop Interchange in Tsuen Wan, and Shing Mun Tunnel Road in the east which links Tai Wai Road and ends at Tai Po Road. The Shing Mun Tunnels are currently managed by Greater Lucky (H.K.) Company Limited. History The Shing Mun Tunnels were formally named as such on 19 May 1987, when the name was approved by the Sha Tin District Board. The tunnels were formally inaugurated by Governor David Wilson on 19 April 1990.

The remainder of jobs within the ILM is filled by the promotion or transfer of workers who have already gained entry. Internal labor markets are shielded from the competition of external labor markets (ELM).Doeringer, Peter B. & Piore Michael J. (1971). Internal Labor Markets and Manpower Analysis. Massachusetts. D.C. Heath and Company However, competition of ILM exists within the firm in the form of job promotions and pay.Pinfield, Lawrence, (1995). The Operation of Internal Labor Markets. New York. Plenum Press. The main reasons why internal labor markets were developed are as follows: Skill specificity Skill specificity has two effects important to the generation of the ILM: it increases the proportion of training costs borne by the employer, as opposed to by the trainee and it increases the absolute level of such costs.Chase, Ivan D. Vacancy Chains. Annul. Review Sociology, 1991. Companies are ever more seeking individuals with specific talents that can be an asset to their organization. Firms that require specifically trained individuals look for a stable labor force.Labor Markets: Institutional Factors, University of British Columbia - Economics, Retrieved on October 10, 2005 On the job training Many firms are willing to train internal employees for other positions.Owen, Laura. \\"History of Labor Turnover in the U.S.\\". EH.Net Encyclopedia, edited by Robert Whaples. April 30, 2004. Turnover Since they find no use in workers with experience from other places, they prefer to promote young workers and train them on-the-job. Firms want to maintain the investment afterwards; therefore they offer the employees job security and structured promotions. Due to the importance of on the job training, the promotion is often given by seniority. Also, this way of promotion encourages on the job training, since the eldest worker is not afraid that the young one replaces him. Employers benefit from this more stable relationship because they reduce the cost of training. Analysis Analysis of Internal Labor Markets concerns the causes of an organization‚Äôs (or geography‚Äôs) workforce dynamics ‚Äì attraction, development, and retention as well as the rewards that motivate them. Statistical models are often used to explain and predict outcomes because internal labor markets are a complex system of interactions between workers, company management practices and labor market dynamics.Nalbantian, Guzzo, Kieffer and Doherty, Play to Your Strengths, Managing Internal Labor Markets, McGrawHill, 2004 Customary Law Custom at the workplace is an unwritten set of rules based largely upon past practices or precedent. These rules can govern any aspect of the work relationship from discipline to compensation. Work customs appear to be the outgrowth of employment stability within the internal labor markets. Customary law is of special interest in the analysis of internal labor markets both because of the stabilizing influence which it imparts to the rules of the workplace and because the rules governing the pricing and allocation of labor within the market are particularly subject to the influence of custom. The internal labor market is composed of many facets. The first is ILMs which consist of clusters of jobs related by the skills and capacities required for their successful performance. Second, the sets of skills required within one job cluster are similar, but different from those required in other job clusters. Third, within any one job cluster, there exists a hierarchy of skills and capacities such that the demands for application of skills on certain jobs facilitate the development of further skills required for other jobs. In this hierarchy those with lower-level jobs requiring skills are usually available in the ELM and higher level jobs require capacities developed from the performance of lower-level jobs usually within the ILM. Fourth, different job levels receive different compensation; high level jobs are associated with higher levels of compensation. Finally, selection and assignment of persons to higher level jobs occurs according to the rules that describe the criteria to be used in these decisions.

It is a mobile personal server which allows a user to use Linux, ones applications and data on any computer with a USB port. The host machine‚Äôs monitor, keyboard, mouse, and Internet connection are used by the BlackDog for the duration of the session. As the system is self-contained and isolated from the host, requiring no additional installation, it is possible to make use of untrusted computers, yet using a secure system. Various hardware iterations exist, and the original developer Realm Systems closed down in 2007, being picked up by the successor Inaura, Inc.

The BlackDog was publicly available for purchase from the Project BlackDog website in September 2005 for those who wished to enter the contest or to experiment with the platform. Production ended in mid January 2006 when the contest closed. On 7 February 2006, the winners of the contest were announced for the categories: Security (the Michael Chenetz), Entertainment (Michael King), Productivity (Terry Bayne) and \\"Dogpile\\" (Paul Chandler).http://www.prnewswire.com/news- releases/realm-systems-announces-winners-in-blackdogtm-skills- contest-55225837.html On Feb 15, 2006, during the Open Source Business Conference, San Franscisco, Terry Bayne was announced the grand prize winner of the contest and received USD50,000 for his creation \\"Kibble,\\" a tool for building integration solutions between the host PC and the BlackDog device using a SOAP-based RPC mechanism to send arbitrary LUA code to be executed on the host PC from the BlackDog.http://www.tbayne.net/article.php?story=20060317144515848 At this conference, the second iteration of the BlackDog, the K9 was publicly announced. = K9 = Identified as the K9 Ultra-Mobile Server, or K9, this version was announced at the Open Source Business Conference in February 2006 with expected availability in the third quarter of 2006. However, company turbulences (see Company History below) prevented the K9 from being sold until early 2009 by Inaura, Inc. Promotional literature shows the form factor to be the same as the intermediate iD3 prototype a very thin chrome model resembling an iPod Nano, but all black with a rubberized exterior. Before Realm Systems shut down, there were working prototypes of the K9, the hardware design seemed to be finished, and the software was functional. In terms of hardware, it differed from the Original BlackDog in these aspects: * 128 MB RAM * 1GB Flash NAND Memory * 60 pin Hiroshi connector replaces MMC slot (intended for a USB connection cable, as well as custom cables to support additional peripherals) * OLED display replaces indicator LED of first version (1.1 inch display, 96x64 resolution, 4 bit grayscale Black and White) * Dimensions: H: .50‚Äù W: 2.0‚Äù L: 3.75‚Äù = iD3 = The iD3 was a variant of the K9, using the same hardware specifications, intended for corporate use with a matching management router/server identified as the iD1200. It was announced as being part of the iDentity product series and was, for instance, showcased on the Embedded Systems Conference in San Jose, CA (April 3‚Äì7, 2006).http://www.vodkronikals.com/pc-repair/realm-systems-to-showcase- identity-series-at-embedded-systems-conference.html The final Realm Systems iD3 form factor resembled a small Nokia cellphone.  Software  The software was originally based on Debian until 2008. The project switched to using Olmec Linux. = Debian GNU/Linux (pre-2008) = When plugged into a USB port of a Windows XP machine, the BlackDog initially presented itself to the host as a virtual CD-ROM drive. Via an autorun application the BlackDog then automatically launched the X Window system for Windows Xming and a software NAT router. Once those applications were running, the virtual USB CD-ROM drive disconnected, and the USB presented itself as a virtual Ethernet adapter, enabling network access. Without requiring any installations or user interactions, the user could access the contained applications and data from any Windows computer. With further configuration steps, it was possible to also run the BlackDog on Linux and Mac computers. A short Engadget review stated that \\"it runs Firefox fine, and should be great for taking your own browser, e-mail, and chat clients for use wherever \\\\\\\\[you are\\\\\\\\], though that will probably be about all this little 400MHz guy can handle.\\"https://www.engadget.com/2005/11/08/blackdog-usb-linux-pc-reviewed/ The first software version was based on Debian Sid running a 2.6.10 Kernel. It contained some sample default applications such as xterm, XBlast, and XGalaga and allowed installation of the Firefox webbrowser, an email client and other additional software available through official and community APT repositories hosted by the project.http://www.geek.com/articles/xyzcomputing/realm-systems- blackdog-portable-linux-server-20051215/ It was attempted to stimulate the creation of further applications and use cases for the BlackDog by building up a community. The project and discussion infrastructure, termed DogPound, used an installation of the project hosting software (SourceForge). A SDK with a QEMU emulator environment for Windows XP, Linux and Mac OS X was released to facilitate the creation and porting of applications to the BlackDog system. Although most of the BlackDog software was free software, the device contained some proprietary technology and intellectual property developed by Realm Systems Inc., which was later transferred to Echo Identity Systems and finally ended up belonging to Inaura Corporation. The official repository for the project disappeared in mid-February 2007 due to Realm Systems Inc. closing and was reactivated by its successor Inaura Inc. as of late-June 2007. (There does not seem to be a repository in Nov. 2011). Until sometime in 2009, Michael King (winner of the Entertainment category of the contest) maintained an independent backup of the official repositories and discussion groups as well as repositories for other developers at the now-defunct Saint Louis, MO based ArchLUG website. The official website for the project www.projectblackdog.org still appears to be up as of December 2013, but has been defaced by several \\"quick cash\\" money lenders that have compromised the site via the WordPress content management system it uses. There does not appear to be any other original content remaining other than the homepage and the advertisements for the money lending sites. = Olmec Linux (2008 onwards) = Starting in late 2007, Olmec Linux was ported to the Blackdog and K9 devices.,http://www.tbayne.net/article.php?story=20080324165018115 which is a Debian-derived Linux distribution geared for small embedded platforms such as the gumstix. When sold as part of the Inaura Inc. product offering, BlackDog/K9 was using the Olmec-based version.http://www.inaura.com/inaura- products/black-dog/  Realm Systems Corporate history  Realm Systems Inc. was founded in 2002, based in Salt Lake City, Utah, raising $8.5 million led by GMG Capital in its Round A, with CEO Rick White, describing itself as \\"provid\\\\\\\\[ing\\\\\\\\] a next generation Mobile Enterprise Platform that simplifies the delivery of applications and services to end-users across the distributed enterprise.\\"http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=13512267http://www.prnewswire.com/news- releases/realm-systems-appoints-frank-artale-as-chairman-david-mimran-joins- board-as-director-54046477.html During 2006, Realm Systems focuses on their iD3 line of products and the K9 product launch was put off indefinitely. In January 2007, two then-unidentified groups containing former Realm Systems employees and investors attempted, independently, to license or move the K9 hardware and software to a separate company to continue development and production, due to the dissolution of Realm Systems and continued developer community interest in the concept, as well as rumored successful pilot programs. One of Realm Systems' backers then posted a public foreclosure notice, and in a court-supervised foreclosure hearing a number of investors bid on the company's assets in a closed bid. As a result, all of Realm's assets, including the iD3 and K9-series hardware, their operating systems, and the enterprise management router code, were bought out by a new firm, Echo Identity Systems, which was registered as a Salt Lake City company on February 1, 2007. This company claimed to be continuing the enterprise product line, and re-used nearly all of the old Realm Systems website layout and graphics. No mention of the K9 product line was made anywhere on the Echo Identity Systems website. The former Realm Systems website redirected iD3 and BlackDog customers to a transitional support website informing about the asset change, Realm Systems closing, and that product support would be done by Echo Identity Systems (though no explanation as to the extent of the support is provided). It appears that assets were soon bought back from Echo Identity Systems to a group of investors backed by former Realm Systems employees and investors. Based on unconfirmed community reports (September 2007), it appears new developer prototypes of the K9 have been seeded to the Project BlackDog contest winners. In November 2007, the new owners emerged as Inaura Inc, with CEO and president Peter Bookman,http://www.inaura.com/about-inaura/management- team/ who is one of the original co-founders of Realm Systems. CFO of the new company is Rodney Rasmussen, who had both registered Echo Identity Systems and Inaura as a Utah company . They set up a sparse web site lacking specific product descriptions.https://web.archive.org/web/20071215003859/http://inaura.com/ Inaura Inc. describes itself as \\"formerly known as\\" Real Systems Inc.http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=13512267 and Echo Identity Systems expired as a company in June 2008. In 2008, the Aurora Inc. website was updated to provide details on the company and product. The K9 device is now being branded as the K9 Ultra Mobile Authentication Key (UMAK) and marketed as \\"solving the problem of trust within all computing environments\\". It refers to \\"the two iterations of UMAKs\\" as \\"the K9 and the BlackDog\\"http://www.inaura.com/inaura-products/ The K9 product seems to have been publicly sold since early 2009.http://fingerchip.pagesperso- orange.fr/biometrics/types/fingerprint_products_drives_flash.htm In February 2010, the company name expired \\"failing to file for renewal\\" and was only re- registered September 2011., expiring again in January 2013.

It is located on the north western corner of Yanbye Island on Combermere Bay, and is 250 miles (400 km) north-west of Yangon. It is the principal town of Kyaukpyu Township and Kyaukpyu District. The town is situated on a superb natural harbor which connects the rice trade between Calcutta and Yangon. The estimated population in 1983 was 19,456 inhabitants. The population of Kyaukpyu Urban area is 20,866 as of 2014, while Kyaukpyu Township's population is 165,352. Etymology The name Kyaukpyu (lit. \\"white rock\\") is the Burmese pronunciation. In the local Rangbre pronunciation of the natives of Kyaukpyu and in standard Arakanese, the town's name is pronounced \\"Kyaukpru\\". The old Kyaukpyu is situated 7 miles from the present town where two colossal white rocks exist. History The place where the present town is, was originally a small fishing village in the 17th Century. After the first Anglo-Burmese War, the British established Kyaukpyu in 1837 on the spot of the fishing village. In 1852, Kyaukphyu became a district city. On October 22, 2010, Cyclone Giri made landfall on the west coast of Myanmar just north of the town at category five strength. Climate Kyaukpyu has a tropical monsoon climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Am). Temperatures are very warm throughout the year, although the winter months (December‚ÄìFebruary) are somewhat milder. There is a winter dry season (December‚ÄìApril) and a summer wet season (May‚ÄìNovember). Torrential rain falls from June to August, with over falling in July alone. Demographics The town is populated with Arakanese Buddhists. There are also small Indian group, Kameins and Chins at Kyaukphru.

It is at the end of the Strand Road and looks out into the Bay of Bengal and the mouth of the Thanzit (Kyaukpyu) River. *Gant-gaw- taw, is one of the most sacred Buddhist shrine, believed to have built in the Vesali period. *Kyauk-ta-lone phaya, built by King Min-ba in the Mrauk U period, is the focal point of Kyaukpyu's Buddhist environment, beside Gant- gaw-taw shrine. ‚Ä¢ The Japan-Myanmar Relationship Pagoda, in the outskirts of the city, is popular among the city's small Japanese population. Education Teacher training college (TTC) was opened in Kyaukpyu in 1953. Now, this college is known as \\"Kyaukpyu Education College\\". In 1954, Kyaukpyu Intermediate College for Arakan, the embryo of Sittwe University was opened in Kyaukpyu. Kyaukpyu GTI was opened in 2014. Other Maurice Collis, a famous British writer, lived in Kyaukpyu in 1920s. His house, situated outskirts of Kyaukpyu is maintained as a historic building. Water ways is the main mode of transportation and traveling. There were boat accidents because of poor maintenance and lack of enforcement on regulation. Over 100 were assumed to be dead in Aung Takon 3 ferry accident of March 2015. Economy =Port= In June 2007, Asia World announced that it would be building a deep sea port on Maday Island in Kyaukphyu, Rakhine State. The port will be a transit point for goods destined for Yangon, Kolkata, and Chittagong. =Oil pipeline= In December 2008, China and Burma signed a deal to construct an oil pipeline at Kyaukphyu. On 30 November 2010, the China Development Bank and Myanmar Foreign Investment Bank signed a $2.4 billion loan deal to construct the pipeline from Kyaukphyu to Kunming in Yunnan province, China. The pipeline is expected to be completed in 2015 and capable of transporting 400,000 barrels of oil per day. These construction projects will allow China to directly obtain oil and gas from the Middle East (via the port terminal at Kyaukphyu), thereby avoiding shipping through the Malacca Straits. =Natural gas pipeline and terminal= Separately, as reported by the Financial Times in February 2013, nearly 2,000 workers are finalising close to Kyaukphyu, a major natural gas projects, the Shwe gas pipeline and onshore terminal. This terminal and pipeline are being built by South Korea's Daewoo International in a consortium with state-owned Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) and others. From May 2013, this pipeline is planned to pump about 12bn cubic metres of natural gas annually, most of which will also go to China via nearby Maday island. These oil and gas Sino- Burma pipelines projects are supervised by a Myanmar \\"Kyaukpyu Special Economic Zone\\" agency and are estimated to use about U$3bn of investments and to have the potential of creating over 200,000 jobs, while additional capital will be required to develop a port for dry containerized and bulk cargoes, as well as a railway which will link Kyaukphyu to Kunming, in Yunnan. =Kunming- Kyaukpyu Railway= The railway project would be 1,215 km long, and its design and construction are subject to a preliminary agreement between Myanmar's and China's government. In 2009, a railway link through to Jiegao in China was proposed. In 2011 the proposal was expanded to a link between Kunming and Kyaukphyu. President Thein Sein's signed a memorandum of understanding during his May 2011 visit to Beijing between Myanmar's rail transport ministry and China's state-owned Railway Engineering Corporation to build the railway.Myanmar in China's Push into the Indian Ocean , Joshy M Paul, March 14, 2016, retrieved 20 January 2017 It will also connect to Kaladan Multi- Modal Transit Transport Project via 311 km link to be completed by 2021-22, from Kyaukhtu in north to Ann in south and then south-east to Minbu. =Special Economic Zone and its impact= Myanmar government officials have stated that these massive projects will be conducted with enhanced consultation with the local population. In this respect, there has already been protests by some locals against the consequences of some of these projects, such as potential impact on fishing or land confiscations which may be conducted by authorities for these terminals and pipelines. A December 2012 report by the \\"Arakan Oil Watch\\" organization about plans to build a special economic zone near Kyaukphyu on Ramree Island in Arakan State, claimed it would \\"endanger the health of thousands of people and destroy Myanmar's second largest mangrove forest\\". The report, titled ‚ÄúDanger Zone,‚Äù states that around 40 villages would be adversely affected by the project, which would use 120 km2 of pristine coastline. End December 2015, the Myanmar government announced that it had chosen a consortium of mostly Chinese companies to develop a special economic zone and a deep-water port, as a result of a tender initiated in 2014 for an industrial park and a deep-water port to be built and operated as public-private partnerships. The selected Chinese-led consortium won over a dozen other bidders to win the development rights late last year. The six companies in the consortium include China state-owned groups Citic (finance), China Harbour Engineering, China Merchants Holdings (International), TEDA Investment Holding, Yunnan Construction Engineering Group (YNJG), and the Charoen Pokphand Group, a Thai conglomerate. CITIC and the six other investing firms will hold an 85 percent stake, with the Burmese government taking the rest. While China Harbour Engineering is a well known engineering firm for designing and building deep sea ports, the China Merchants Group, through some of its affiliates (China Merchants Holdings (International), China Merchants Group, both listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange, and China Merchants Energy Shipping) is a global operator of ports as well as of oil tanker and dry bulk ships which has been approved to absorb in 2016 another Chinese state- controlled tanker and bulk ships operator, Sinotrans Shipping. By 2025, the consortium plans to build a roughly 1,000-hectare industrial park and Myanmar's highest-capacity port, with facilities able to handle 7 million 20-foot-equivalent-units (TEU) of containerized cargo per year. Total project costs are estimated to be in the range of several billion dollars. The projects are said to lead to the creation of some 100,000 jobs. Some analysts claim that the Kyaukpyu deep-water port has a strategic dimension as part of China's Belt and Road Initiative and String of Pearls strategy. The Kyaukpyu port and Special Economic Zone (SEZ) is one of three major port and coastal development projects in Myanmar, together with the Thilawa zone near Yangon, the country's most populous and economically developed city, and the Dawei zone in the south-east, near the Thai border, all of which have attracted major financial and industrial interests.

The parasite can be Strongyloides stercoralis, Dirofilaria immitis or Ascaris which can enter the body through contact with the soil. The symptoms of L√∂ffler's syndrome include those of a parasitic infection such as irritable bowel syndrome, abdominal pain and cramping, skin rashes and fatigue. L√∂ffler's syndrome itself will cause difficulty breathing, coughing as well as a fever. Diagnosis The diagnosis of Loffler's syndrome can be challenging, as the diagnostic criteria can be vague and consistent with a multitude of diseases or conditions. The disease's developmental trajectory is mostly unknown. Upon examination of symptoms, a doctor will likely request a chest x-ray looking for migratory pulmonary infiltrate, and blood testing, to confirm a diagnosis. Symptoms tend to be brief, but can range from mild to severe and include: fever, vomiting, increased respirations or difficulty breathing, cough, wheeze, and rash. Symptoms typically follow an exposure to allergens or certain drugs, and last approximately two weeks. Eosinophilia is the main feature of diagnostic criteria for Loffler's syndrome. Eosinophils are white blood cells that fight infection by destroying foreign substances in the body. This increase is determined through a blood test called a complete blood count, or CBC. A result of over 500 cells/mcL (cells per microliter of blood) is considered elevated. The normal range for eosinophils is less than 350 cells/mcL. Prevention While the outcomes of this syndrome have never lead to death the symptoms can last anywhere from 2 to 4 weeks after the parasite enters the body. Prevention of this syndrome is education-based, consisting of educating individuals on proper handwashing techniques, as well as how to correctly dispose of feces. Epidemiology This syndrome can be found anywhere however, it is abnormally prevalent in Tropical areas, showing higher prevalence in men than women.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK534850/ This syndrome is also exceedingly common in the warm damp parts of the world. The syndrome is also more likely to be contracted by small children since they spend an increased amount of time outside in the dirt. While it is still a mystery why the prevalence is higher in Indians, the warm damp environment is a perfect place for the parasites to grow and thrive. The epidemiological aspect of L√∂ffler's syndrome isn't well known since there have been minimal statistics reported on the topic. History In 1909 a man named H. French first described the condition. Then in 1932 Wilhelm L√∂ffler[1] drew attention to the disease in cases of eosinophilic pneumonia caused by the parasites Ascaris lumbricoides, [2] Strongyloides stercoralis and the hookworms Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus. Finally in 1943 the condition was called Tropical eosinophilia by RJ Weingarten, and later officially named L√∂ffler's syndrome. The most well-known case of L√∂ffler's syndrome was in a young boy from Louisiana. He arrived at the hospital reporting a high fever after three days, as well as having rapid breathing. ‚ÄùHe was hospitalized and treated with supplemental oxygen, intravenous methylprednisolone, and nebulized albuterol.‚Äù The boy's symptoms quickly subsided and upon further investigation it was discovered that the boy worked caring for pigs. A test was then performed on the pigs' fecal matter and surrounding soil; it contained the parasite that had caused the boy's ailment. Another incident again involved a young boy who had suffered from vomiting and a fever for a span of 3 months. When the doctors finally took an echocardiograph of the child they discovered that the ‚Äúpatient‚Äôs admission blood count showed leukocytosis with an abnormally elevated level of peripheral eosinophils.‚Äù The child was then diagnosed with L√∂ffler's endocarditis, and immediately began immunosuppressive therapy to decline the eosinophilic count. Although L√∂ffler only described eosinophilic pneumonia in the context of infection, many authors give the term \\"L√∂ffler's syndrome\\" to any form of acute onset pulmonary eosinophilia no matter what the underlying cause. If the cause is unknown, it is specified and called \\"simple pulmonary eosinophilia\\". Cardiac damage caused by the damaging effects of eosinophil granule proteins (ex. major basic protein) is known as Loeffler endocarditis and can be caused by idiopathic eosinophilia or eosinophilia in response to parasitic infection.

Carnival Destiny went into dry dock in Trieste, Italy in 2013 to be refitted and renamed Carnival Sunshine. The refitting, which was completed in May 2013, was delayed by a month to install new back-up generator systems. Layout The propulsion system consists of six thruster units, three forward and three aft, each with variable-pitch propellers and 1760-kW motors. The electricity for the motors is provided by diesel generators. Following a multimillion-dollar refurbishment in 2005, Carnival Destiny featured three pools, a variety of dining options, lounges, nightclubs, a casino and a spa. Carnival Destiny received more modifications in 2010, including a movie screen on the Lido deck and cabin renovations. On 6 March 2012, Carnival announced that Destiny would undergo a US$155-million dollar refit, and renaming of the ship as Carnival Sunshine. The ship was re-launched on 5 May 2013. The refit included a racing themed waterpark with one of the biggest slides in Carnival's fleet.

He was a leader of the Irish Catholic political community. He is best known for his service, from 1911 until 1921 as the private secretary of U.S. President Woodrow Wilson. Background Tumulty was born on May 5, 1879 in Jersey City, New Jersey to middle-class Catholic parents Philip and Alicia (Feehan) Tumulty. He attended St. Bridget's School, and graduated from Saint Peter's College, New Jersey in 1901. Tumulty was active in Democratic state politics in New Jersey, serving in the New Jersey General Assembly in 1907-1910. Career As a state legislator, Tumulty acted as an adviser to Woodrow Wilson in his 1910 gubernatorial campaign. He then served as Wilson's private secretary in 1911, when Wilson was Governor of New Jersey, and in 1913-1921 when Wilson was President of the United States. This position would in later years become the White House Chief of Staff. During his time as Wilson's secretary, Tumulty filled many different roles including press secretary, public relations manager, campaign organizer for the Catholic and Irish vote, and adviser for minor patronage appointments. His relationship with Wilson was nearly terminated over his opposition to Wilson's marriage in December 1915 to Edith Wilson only a few months after the death of his first wife. Although Wilson declined Tumulty's offer to resign, their relationship was never again as close.quod.lib.umich.edu Following Wilson's reelection in 1916, the president yielded to anti-Catholic sentiment from Edith Wilson and Wilson's adviser Col. Edward M. House and dismissed Tumulty. Though he was ultimately reinstated after intervention by his former student David Lawrence, Tumulty's relationship with Edith Wilson remained frosty. Wilson left office in March 1921. Though his influence in Washington was greatly diminished thereafter, Tumulty remained in the city as a practicing attorney until his death 33 years later. Hiss Case involvement Tumulty and Wilson, c.1917 In August‚ÄìSeptember 1948, Tumulty was one of many prominent lawyers who advised Alger Hiss on whether to file a defamation suit against Whittaker Chambers after Chambers stated on NBC Radio's Meet the Press that Hiss had been a Communist. On August 31, 1948, Hiss wrote to his lifelong friend and fellow Harvard lawyer William L. Marbury, Jr.: > I am planning a suit for libel or defamation... The number of volunteer > helpers is considerable: Freddy Pride of Dwight, Harris, Koegel & Casking > (the offshoot of young Charles Hughes' firm), Fred Eaton of Shearman and > Sterling, Eddie Miller of Mr. Dulles' firm, Marshall McDuffie, now no longer > a lawyer; in Washington Joe Tumulty, Charlie Fahy, Alex Hawes, John Ferguson > (Mr. Ballantine's son-in-law) and others‚Äìbut the real job is get general > overall counsel and that fortunately is now settled, but we must move > swiftly as so far the committee with its large investigating staff and > considerable resources has been able to seize the initiative continuously > and regularly. Everyone has been most helpful... Views October 20, 1919, Newspaper headline showing Tumulty and his family in New Jersey. Left to right; Miss Grace, Mr. Joseph Tumulty, Misses Catherine and Mary Phillip and Joseph, Jr., Mrs. Tumulty and Miss Alicia. A \\"conservative progressive\\" in his own words, Tumulty was a proponent of women's suffrage and war-time censorship, and was a supporter of A. Mitchell Palmer's deportation of Red (Communist) aliens in 1919. Wilson's absence from active-day-to-day executive leadership in 1919-1920 during the negotiations at Versailles, and his later severe stroke and illness meant that a significant share of the work of the White House was done by Tumulty and Edith Wilson, who continued to lobby against him. Tumulty's support of Palmer, and of \\"wet\\" presidential candidate James M. Cox, ultimately led to his final break with Wilson. In his approach to politics, Tumulty was a believer in the power of the state to tackle inequities in American society. This was demonstrated in June 1919 when (at a time of great industrial unrest in the United States) Tumulty had recommended to Wilson that he call on Congress to advocate reforms that met the needs of working people. These included such reforms as a federal employment agency, federal housing, old-age pensions, a federal minimum wage, equal pay, a profit-sharing plan, and health insurance. Wilson failed, however, to encourage Congress to enact the kinds of measures advocated by Tumulty, although nearly all of his proposals would eventually be realized under the New Deal program of future Democratic president Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Personal and death Tumulty died on April 9, 1954, in Olney, Maryland. He is buried in St. Mary's Catholic Cemetery in Rockville, Maryland. Works Tumulty published a memoir, Woodrow Wilson As I Know Him (1921). The book enraged Wilson, who made it known that his former private secretary would never again be admitted into his presence or inner circle. References Further reading * Blum, John Morton.

His works include Karma Incorporated and Emily Edison from publisher Viper Comics, Astronaut Dad, and a comic book adaptation of Antigone with frequent collaborator artist Tom Kurzanski. He writes a regular comic feature for D Magazine called Souvenir of Dallas with artist Paul Milligan. David is a contributor to the Smart Pop Series from BenBella Books. He is the co-host and co-producer of Fanboy Radio's Indie Show, that showcases independent and small press comics. David lives in Arlington, Texas with his daughter Kennedy.  Career  David Hopkins first professional writing was after college in 2002. Aja Jones asked him to write a stage play for her theatre troupe to be performed at the University of Texas at Arlington. The only performance of \\"Space to Occupy\\" was on September 14, 2002. Immediately afterwards, Hopkins began writing comics. The first year, Hopkins wrote a five issue series The Insight. Set in Dallas, Hopkins used extensive photo references from actual locations in the city. (He would later do this for Karma Incorporated, which also takes place in Dallas.) Over the course of two years, there were two different artists attached to the project, which never came together and remains unpublished. In June 2003, Hopkins wrote a 144-page graphic novel Astronaut Dad‚Äîa fictional story about three astronaut families living in Houston, set in 1963. Hopkins cites this work as his \\"most personally satisfying\\". It is set to be published by Silent Devil Productions. Later that year, encouraged by the Isotope Awards, Hopkins self-published a mini-comic \\"Some Other Day\\" with artist Brian Kelly. In 2004, Hopkins' first published work was a short story in Viper Comics Dead@17: Rough Cut. Creator Josh Howard invited him to contribute to this anthology. Afterwards, he also wrote short stories for Western Tales of Terror, Silent Forest Television Parody Special, and Dead@17: Rough Cut Volume 2. At Comic Con International in 2005, Viper Comics released Hopkins first series Karma Incorporated, illustrated by Tom Kurzanski and colored by Marlena Hall. In addition to the standard blue cover of issue one, a red exclusive variant cover was printed as part of the Diamond Distributors exclusives for that year. A second series was approved, but never completed. Hopkins wrote Emily Edison, which was published by Viper Comics in 2006, and illustrated by Brock Rizy. It was released as a trade paperback. That summer, Rizy and Hopkins went on a month-long book tour to promote the release through California, Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas.

It is unusual among Dungeons & Dragons modules in that it encourages a non-violent approach (mainly parleying and true role- playing tactics) to achieving the module's goals. It is set in an old English milieu on Sybarate Isle in the Hold of the Sea Princes. Plot summary In Beyond the Crystal Cave, the player characters are hired to rescue a recently eloped couple that has fled into the Cave of Echoes. The heroes must solve the mystery of the Crystal Cave to enter Porpherio's Garden, a magical place located on the island of Sybarate where it is summer all year long. Experience points are gained by dealing with encounters verbally and intelligently, rather than through unnecessary violence. Publication history Beyond the Crystal Cave was written by British designers Dave J. Browne, Tom Kirby, and Graeme Morris, and published by TSR in 1983 as a thirty two page booklet with an outer folder. In 2005, Kenzer and Company published a HackMaster module based on the adventure named Porpher's Enchanted Garden. It was originally solicited as Yonder Crystal Caverns, but was changed due to substantial lateness in gaining authorisation from Wizards of the Coast. The new version required less talking and more action, making it more typical of the game system. The module was hacked by James Butler, a freelance writer from the United Kingdom. In 2011, Wizards of the Coast updated the module for 4th Edition and added combat situations for their Encounters line of pre-made adventures. Reception Doug Cowie reviewed Beyond the Crystal Cave favorably for Imagine magazine. He liked the clear layout, lucid descriptions and good maps and found it a module that tries to emphasize diplomacy and intelligence over force and is \\"more successful than most in achieving this aim\\". Cowie thought that it is possible to go through the adventure \\"without drawing a sword\\" and that the main setting, Porpherio's Garden, is \\"highly original and well thought out\\". His only criticism was that some of the denizens of the garden are too prone to random attack, but he felt that was a minor point, easily altered by the DM. Overall, according to Cowie, UK1 is a \\"refreshing change\\" which \\"gives the talkative sort of character a place in the limelight all too often filled by the brutish fighter or the powerful MU\\". He concluded the review by calling it \\"a good package\\" and suggested readers should \\"try it for a relaxing change\\". Receiving 9 out of 10 overall, the module was positively reviewed in issue No. 48 of White Dwarf magazine. The reviewer, Jim Bambra, noted that Beyond the Crystal Cave was \\"an interesting and thought-provoking adventure\\" more appropriate for characters level 3-6. Bambra mentioned that players would be treated to a lot of interesting encounters and puzzles after reaching Porpherio's Garden, and felt that the authors have sought to reward thoughtful solutions to dilemmas rather than hack-and-slash ones. He noted how the authors set out to discourage players from attacking everything in sight, concluding that this module \\"makes a refreshing change from the more normal combat orientated adventure for its emphasis is very much on role-playing and problem solving\\". Lawrence Schick, in his 1991 book Heroic Worlds felt that the UK series of modules \\"are typically heavier on atmosphere than their American-designed counterparts, though they do like to use those ridiculous monsters from the Fiend Folio.\\" Reviews Fantasy Gamer #1 (1983) References Greyhawk modules ","title":"Beyond the Crystal Cave"},{"id":"2950105","text":"Lighthouse was destroyed. Round Island is a small, uninhabited island in the Mississippi Sound, south of Pascagoula, Mississippi, U.S.A. The island is a coastal preserve, situated in Jackson County and managed by the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources. The relatively isolated terrain--consisting of slash pine forest, interior marsh, and sandy beach--provides feeding, resting, and wintering habitat for migratory birds, including the brown pelican, white pelican, and cormorants. A number of rare or endangered species, including the Ruellia noctiflora, are found there. In 1849, Round Island was used as a staging area by Venezuelan adventurer Narciso L√≥pez for a filibustering expedition to liberate Cuba. The expedition involved three chartered ships and as many as 600 men. However, US president Zachary Taylor, who had renounced filibustering as a valid means of U.S. expansion, took steps against L√≥pez and ordered his ships blockaded and seized. After six weeks, all the volunteers had been talked into leaving Round Island. The island had a lighthouse as early as 1833. The original wooden structure was replaced in 1859 with a brick lighthouse at at the southern tip of the island.Historic Light Station Information: Round Island Light Retrieved 2013-08-01 In 1998, the lighthouse was toppled by Hurricane Georges. In 2005, reconstruction of the lighthouse was in progress, but the structure was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina. Hurricane Katrina damaged Round Island, cutting channels partly or completely through from east to west.

The Acfas was founded in 1923 as the Association canadienne-fran√ßaise pour l'avancement des sciences (French-Canadian Association for the Advancement of Science). Its name was changed in 2001 to the Association francophone pour le savoir. Despite the name change, Acfas retained the acronym by which it has become known. The first president was L√©o Pariseau. The current president (2017) is Fr√©d√©ric Bouchard. The association played an important role in building Francophone Quebec's scholarly community, supporting the growth of an intellectual milieu outside the formal boundaries of the Catholic Church. Among its founders were prominent French-Canadian intellectual such as Brother Marie-Victorin, the father of biology in francophone Quebec, and the radiologist . Today Acfas is best known for the scholarly prizes it awards annually and for its yearly conference of French- language learned societies in Canada, which is hosted by a different university each year, usually in Quebec. The Jacques Rousseau Award is an award given by ACFAS to an individual or group who develop bridges between scientific disciplines. The award is named for Jacques Rousseau who was both a botanist and an anthropologist. He was a former secretary of ACFAS.

Its primary component is ethyl alcohol (70% v/v), and is used by wetting one's hands thoroughly with the product, then briskly rubbing one's hands together until dry. Purell was acquired by Johnson & Johnson in 2006, then reacquired by GOJO in 2010. That year, PURELL Green Certified Instant Hand Sanitzer became the first hand sanitizer to meet EcoLogo CCD-170 standards. In 2020, some of Purell's claims, including that it kills \\"99.99% of most common germs\\", have been met with regulatory warning to desist the claim. During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, GOJO faced unprecedented demand for Purell products due to its reputation as a leading name-brand for hand sanitizer. Starting immediately as cases began to rise in the United States, Purell products ran out-of-stock and remained largely unavailable to the general public, with new shipments being prioritized to medical and professional customers. Products still remain mostly out-of-stock via retail channels as of July 2020, despite GOJO producing more than twice the amount of hand sanitizer in 2020 than in 2019.https://www.al.com/coronavirus/2020/05/when-will-hand-sanitizer-return- to-store-shelves.html GOJO has stated it is currently investing in further strategies to source ingredients and substantially increase manufacturing space for use by mid-2021.  Ownership and distribution Pfizer acquired the exclusive rights to distribute Purell in the consumer market from GOJO Industries in 2004, and on June 26, 2006, Johnson & Johnson announced its acquisition of the Pfizer Consumer Healthcare division, which includes the Purell brand. In 2010, GOJO Industries bought the brand back from Johnson & Johnson. Health risks and claims Purell purposely adds an unpleasant bitter taste to its product to make it undesirable to drink and to discourage ingestion. In the 24 years Purell has been in business, the accidental or intentional ingestion of its products has been rare. The Chicago Tribune reported that children have become inebriated by ingesting Purell. One child's ingestion of the hand sanitizer caused her blood alcohol level to reach 0.218%; Purell contains 70% ethyl alcohol, while other hand sanitizers contain isopropanol which would likely have been fatal in the same dose. The product packaging recommends that the product be \\"kept out of the reach of children\\". Purell has been claimed to \\"[kill] more than 99.99% of most common germs that may cause illness in a healthcare setting, including MRSA & VRE.\\" However, in January 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Food and Drug Administration issued a warning to Purell's maker, GOJO Industries, to stop its claims that the product is effective at eliminating diseases because there are no peer- reviewed, published clinical studies demonstrating the company's claims. The product is flammable, which is mentioned in the product label. Besides ethyl alcohol, it contains water, isopropyl alcohol, glycerin, carbomer, fragrance, aminomethyl propanol, propylene glycol, isopropyl myristate, and tocopheryl acetate.

He is perhaps best remembered for his design of the ideal city of Sforzinda, the first ideal city plan of the Renaissance. Biography Antonio di Pietro Averlino was born c. 1400 in Florence where he probably trained as a craftsman. Sources suggest that he worked in Florence under the Italian painter, architect, and biographer Lorenzo Ghiberti, who gave him his more famous name ‚ÄúFilarete‚Äù which means ‚Äúa lover of virtue‚Äù. In the mid 15th century, Filarete was expelled from Rome after being accused of attempting to steal the head of John the Baptist and he moved to Venice and then eventually to Milan. There he became a ducal engineer and worked on a variety of architectural projects for the next fifteen years. According to his biographer, Vasari, Filarete died in Rome c. 1469.'Il Filarete.' International Dictionary of Architects and Architecture. St. James Press, 1993. Reproduced in Biography Resource Center. Farmington Hills, Mich.: Gale, 2009. http://0-galenet.galegroup.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/servlet/BioRC Works Electrotype) of Pisanello's medal marking the 1439 visit to Florence of John VIII Palaiologos, Byzantine Emperor, 1425 to 1448 =Bronze doors of Old St. Peter's Basilica= A commission granted by Pope Eugene IV meant that Filarete, over the course of twelve years, cast the bronze central doors for Old St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, which were completed in 1445.Ghiberti's great bronze doors for the Baptistery of Florence preceded this. In the following century, Filarete's doors were preserved when Old St Peter's was demolished and they were later reinstalled in the new St. Peter's Basilica. Although they were created during the Renaissance, the doors have distinct Byzantine influences and seem tied to the Medieval era. Some critics have noted that the doors offer a glimpse into the mind of Filarete, claiming that they show his ‚Äúmind of medieval complexity crammed full of exciting but not quite assimilated classical learning‚Äù.Roeder, Helen. 'The Borders of Filarete's Bronze Doors to St. Peters'. Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, Vol. 10, (1947), pp. 150-153. =Architectural works= Sforza Castle in Milan Plan of Sforzinda In Milan Filarete built the Ospedale Maggiore (c. 1456), the overall form of which was rationally planned as a cross within a square, with the hospital church at the center of the plan. Some of the surviving sections of the much-rebuilt structure show the Gothic detail of Milan's Quattrocento craft traditions, which are at odds with Filarete's design all'antica or \\"after the Antique\\".Murray 1963. Filarete also worked on the Castello Sforzesco or Sforza Castle and on the Duomo di Milano or Milan Cathedral. =Filarete's treatise on architecture and the ideal city of Sforzinda= Filarete completed his substantial book on architecture sometime around 1464, which he referred to as his Libro architettonico (\\"Architectonic book\\"). Neither he nor his immediate contemporaries ever referred to it as a Trattato (\\"Treatise\\"), though it is usually now called such. The Libro, which comprises twenty-five volumes, enjoyed a fairly wide circulation in manuscript form during the Renaissance. The most well known and best preserved copy of the Libro is a profusely illustrated manuscript known as the Codex Magliabechiano (probably drafted c. 1465; now held in the archives of the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Firenze). The fact that the Codex Magliabechiano is dedicated to Piero de' Medici and was conserved in Florence suggests that Filarete was well regarded in his native Florence despite his loyalty to Milan. The book, which is written as a fictional narrative, consists principally of a detailed account of the technical aspects of architecture (e.g., site and material selection, drawing, construction methods, and so on) and a sustained polemic against the Gothic style of Northern Italy, which Filarete calls the \\"barbarous modern style.\\" Filarete argues instead for the use of classical Roman models. The most famous part of his book is his plan for Sforzinda, an ideal city named after Francesco Sforza, then Duke of Milan. Although Sforzinda was never built, certain aspects of its design are described in considerable detail. The basic layout of the city is an eight-point star, created by overlaying two squares so that all the corners were equidistant. This shape is then inscribed within a perfect circular moat. This shape is iconographic and probably ties to Filarete‚Äôs interest in magic and astrology.Kostof, Spiro. The City Shaped: Urban Patterns and Meanings. London: Thames and Hudson Ltd. 1991. Consistent with Quattrocento or fifteenth century notions concerning the talismanic power of geometry and the crucial importance of astrology, Filarete provides, in addition to pragmatic advice on materials, construction, and fortifications, notes on how to propitiate celestial harmony within Sforzinda. His architectonical drawings and even more his allegorical drawings traced on the margins of the Codex Magliabechianus - such as the Allegory of Vertue and the Allegory of the Reason and Will - Filarete shows a remarkable possession of classical sources, maybe known also through the advice of his friend Francesco Filelfo da Tolentino, the main humanist then at the court of Milan.P. Coen, \\"La allegoria della Virt√π di Antonio Averlino, detto il Filarete\\" in Le due Rome del Quattrocento, ed. S. Rossi and S. Valeri, Rome, 1994; P. Coen, Il problema della Ragione e della Volont√†: il contributo di un'allegoria di Antonio Averlino, detto il Filarete\\", in Arte Lombarda, 2000 In terms of planning, each of the outer points of the star had towers, while the inner angles had gates. Each of the gates was an outlet of radial avenues that each passed through a market square, dedicated to certain goods. All the avenues finally converged in a large square which was centrally located. The town contained three squares ‚Äì one for the prince‚Äôs palace, one for the cathedral, and one for the market. Because the Renaissance was much taken with the idea of the canal town, in Filarete's Sforzinda every other street had a canal for cargo transport.Kostof, 1991. The canal system also connected with the river, and thus the outside world, for the import and export of goods. The city also contained many buildings, including parishes and separate schools for boys and girls. An example of a building that appears in the treatise is Filarete‚Äôs House of Vice and Virtue, a ten-storey structure with a brothel on the bottom and an academy of learning on the higher levels. Filarete did much study on representation of Vices and Virtues, and there are suggestions that his radial design for the city was inspired by St. Augustine‚Äôs Earthly City, whose circular shape was divided into sections, each of which had its own Vice and Virtue.Lang, S. 'The Ideal City from Plato to Howard', Architectural Review 112. Aug. 1952, pp 95-96 The design of Sforzinda may have been in part a direct response to the Italian cities of the Medieval period, whose growth did not necessarily depend on city planning as such, which meant they could be difficult to navigate.Madanipour, Ali. Designing the City of Reason: Foundation and Frameworks. New York: Routledge, 2007 In part, the Renaissance humanist interest in classical texts may have stimulated preoccupations with geometry in city layouts, as for example, in Plato's description of Atlantis. Filarete‚Äôs ideal plan was meant to reflect on society ‚Äì where a perfect city form would be the image of a perfect society, an idea that was typical of the humanist views prevalent during the High Renaissance.Kostof, 1991, 1991. The Renaissance ideal city implied the centralized power of a prince in its organization, an idea following closely on the heels of Dante‚Äôs that ‚ÄúThe human race is at its best under a monarch.‚ÄùAlighieri, Dante. De Monarchia, c. 1312 Thus it could be argued that the Renaissance ideal city form was tensioned between the perceived need for a centralized power and the potential reality of tyranny. Influence on architecture and urbanism Filarete's plan of Sforzinda was the first ideal city plan of the Renaissance and his thorough organization of its layout embodied a greater level of conscious city planning than anyone before him. Despite the many references to medieval symbolism incorporated into Sforzinda's design, the city's principles became the archetype for the humanist city during the High Renaissance. The treatise gained interest from many important leaders such as Giangaleazzo Sforza and Piero de' Medici and later when Francesco di Giorgio and Leonardo da Vinci began to plan their ideal cities they borrowed ideas from Filarete.\\"Il Filarete.\\" International Dictionary of Architects and Architecture. St. James Press, 1993. Reproduced in Biography Resource Center. Farmington Hills, Mich.: Gale, 2009. http://0-galenet.galegroup.com.ilsprod.lib.neu.edu/servlet/BioRC Although it was never built, Sforzinda served as an inspiration for many future city plans. For example, in the 16th century, Renaissance military engineers and architects combined Filarete's ideal city schemes with defensive fortifications deriving from a more sociopolitical agenda. This notion of combining the ideal and the fortified city became widely disseminated throughout Europe and beyond.Kostof, 1991. Notes References * Mumford, Lewis. 1961.

Officially, SR 83 runs from the Chino Valley Freeway (State Route 71) in Chino Hills north to the San Bernardino Freeway (Interstate 10) in Upland. Euclid Avenue then continues north through Upland to the unincorporated community of San Antonio Heights. Euclid Avenue passes through several historic districts. A segment of the road is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Route description Route 83 is a major north-south arterial serving the cities and communities of Western San Bernardino County. Known as Euclid Avenue for its entire 14-mile (23 km) length, the route begins at its southern terminus at the Chino Valley Freeway (State Route 71) and traverses the communities of Chino, Ontario, and Upland before reaching its northern terminus at the San Bernardino Freeway (Interstate 10). Euclid Avenue, as a city street in Upland, and later a county road in unincorporated San Bernardino County, then continues north into the unincorporated community of San Antonio Heights and provides direct access to Mount Baldy. North of the Pomona Freeway (State Route 60), Route 83 follows an expanded right of way with six lanes of traffic and a wide landscaped median. Through the communities of Ontario, and Upland, the route traverses several designated historic districts, with craftsman homes and civic buildings dating from the late 19th century lining either side of the street. South of the Pomona Freeway (State Route 60), Route 83 assumes the characteristics of a rural highway, narrowing to two lanes while passing through what was traditionally agricultural land. SR 83 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. History The segment of Euclid Avenue from Philadelphia Street in Ontario north to 24th Street in Upland was added to the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district in 2005. The historic district includes a Madonna of the Trail monument, one contributing site, one contributing structure, and three contributing objects over a . Originally, SR 83 extended north from I-10 to the Foothill Freeway (State Route 210) in Upland, but the state relinquished that segment and turned it over to local control. There has never been any direct connection from Euclid Avenue to the Foothill Freeway (State Route 210) in Upland. During the planning stages for the construction of the Foothill Freeway through the area, Upland residents (in conjunction with the residents of other communities along the route) successfully petitioned the State and local governments to require Caltrans to construct the new freeway 'below grade', i.e. build the road surface of the freeway below the elevation of the surrounding terrain. Furthermore, due to concerns of existing traffic volume, noise, etc. along major thoroughfares, such as Euclid Avenue, many Upland residents who lived along or near Euclid Avenue did not want a fully functional interchange at the junction between the new freeway and the street as it was anticipated that doing so would increase traffic and noise, thereby undermining the aesthetic qualities of the street and negatively affecting the residents' \\"quality of life\\". Thus, at the intersection of SR 83 and SR 210, there are no on/offramps or associated improvements like traffic lights - direct access between the highways is not possible. Instead, on both sides of the Euclid Avenue overpass there are two wide landscaped areas that provide a visual (and to a lesser extent, acoustic) buffer between the street and the freeway passing below . The landscaped area also serves to provide continuity with the landscaped segments of the street to the north and south of the intersection.

The race and appearance of Jesus has been a topic of discussion since the days of early Christianity. Various theories about the race of Jesus have been proposed and debated.Racializing Jesus: Race, Ideology and the Formation of Modern Biblical Scholarship by Shawn Kelley 2002 pages 70-73 By the Middle Ages, a number of documents, generally of unknown or questionable origin, had been composed and were circulating with details of the appearance of Jesus. Now these documents are mostly considered forgeries.The Oxford companion to the Bible 1993 page 41Making Sense of the New Testament by Craig L. Blomberg 2004 pages 3-4Pontius Pilate: portraits of a Roman governor by Warren Carter 2003 pages 6-9 A wide range of depictions have appeared over the two millennia since Jesus's death, often influenced by cultural settings, political circumstances and theological contexts. The depiction of Jesus in art of the first Christian centuries gradually standardized his appearance with a short beard. These images are often based on second- or third-hand interpretations of spurious sources, and are generally historically inaccurate. By the 19th century, theories that Jesus was non-Semitic were being developed, with writers suggesting he was variously white, black, Indian, or some other race. However, as in other cases of the assignment of race to biblical individuals, these claims have been mostly based on cultural stereotypes, ethnocentrism, and societal trends rather than on scientific analysis or historical method. Historical appearance Research on ancient skeletons in Palestine suggests that Judeans of the time were biologically closer to Iraqi Jews than to any other contemporary population, and thus in terms of physical appearance the average Judean of the time would have likely had dark brown to black hair, olive skin, and brown eyes. Judean men of the time period were on average about in height. Scholars have also suggested that it is likely Jesus had short hair and a beard, in accordance with Jewish practices of the time and the appearance of philosophers. The earliest depictions of Jesus from the Roman catacombs depict him as free of facial hair. Historians have speculated over how Jesus' ascetic and itinerant lifestyle and work as a carpenter, with the manual labor and exposure to the elements that entailed, affected his appearance. It has been suggested that Jesus likely had a lean appearance. Biblical references =The Old Testament= Old Testament references interpreted by Christians as being about a coming messiah have been used to form conjectures about the appearance of Jesus. Isaiah 53:2 refers to the scourged messiah with \\"no beauty that we should desire him\\" and Psalm 45:2‚Äì3 describes him as \\"fairer than the children of men\\", these passages are often interpreted as his physical description.The Cross of Christ by John R.

Barton ISBN pages 132‚Äì133The Content and the Setting of the Gospel Tradition by Mark Harding, Alanna Nobbs 2010 pages 281‚Äì282 but this appearance is considered to refer to Jesus in majestic, transfigured form. In the Book of Revelation The Book of Revelation includes John's vision of the Son of Man: This vision is usually considered to refer to Jesus in heavenly form, not his appearance during his earthly life.Revelation by William C. Pender 1998 pages 14‚Äì16Revelation 1‚Äì11 by John MacArthur, Jr. ISBN pages 37‚Äì39 Literary traditions =Early Church to the Middle Ages= Christ Pantocrator in a Roman mosaic in the church of Santa Pudenziana, Rome, c. 400‚Äì410 AD during the Western Roman Empire Despite the lack of direct biblical or historical references, from the 2nd century onward various theories about the appearance of Jesus were advanced, but early on these focused more on his physical appearance than on race or ancestry. Larger arguments of this kind have been debated for centuries. Justin Martyr argued for the genealogy of Jesus in the biological Davidic line from Mary, as well as from his non- biological father Joseph.The Life of Jesus, Critically Examined by David Friedrich Strauss 2010 pages 114-116 But this only implies a general Jewish ancestry, acknowledged generally by authors. The focus of many early sources was on the physical unattractiveness of Jesus rather than his beauty. The 2nd century anti-Christian philosopher Celsus wrote that Jesus was \\"ugly and small\\"Robert E. Van Voorst, Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence, Eerdmans Publishing, 2000, p.66. and similar descriptions are presented in a number of other sources as discussed extensively by Robert Eisler,Eisler, Robert. The Messiah Jesus and John the Baptist. London: Methuen & Co. Ltd., 1931. who in turn often quotes from Ernst von Dobsch√ºtz' monumental Christusbilder.Dobsch√ºtz, Ernst von, Christusbilder: Untersuchungen zur christlichen Legende, Leipzig, 1899. Tertullian states that Jesus's outward form was despised, that he had an ignoble appearance, and the slander he suffered proved the 'abject condition' of his body.The Catholic Encyclopedia, http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0315.htm , Tertullian, On the Flesh of Christ, 9. According to Irenaeus, he was a weak and inglorious manThe Catholic Encyclopedia, http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103.htm , Irenaeus, 'Adversus haereses,' IV.XXXIII.12., and in the Acts of Peter he is described as small and ugly to the ignorant. Andrew of Crete relates that Christ was bent or even crooked and in the Acts of John he is described as bald-headed and small with no good looks.Barnstone, Willis. 'The Acts of John ‚Äì Christ's Earthly Appearance,' in The Other Bible. New York, NY: HarperCollins Publishers, 1984, p. 417. As quoted by Eisler, both Hierosolymitanus and John of Damascus claim that \\"the Jew Josephus\\" described Jesus as having had connate eyebrows with goodly eyes and being long-faced, crooked and well- grown. In a letter of certain bishops to the Emperor Theophilus, Jesus's height is described as three cubits (four foot six), which was also the opinion of Ephrem Syrus (320‚Äì379 AD), \\"God took human form and appeared in the form of three human ells (cubits); he came down to us small of stature.\\" Theodore of Mopsuestia likewise claimed that the appearance of Christ was smaller than that of the children of Jacob (Israel). In the apocryphal Lentulus letter, Jesus is described as having had a reddish complexion, matching Muslim traditions in this respect. Jesus's prediction that he would be taunted \\"Physician, heal yourself\\"Luke 4:23. may suggest that Jesus was indeed physically deformed ('crooked' or hunch-backed), as claimed in the early Christian texts listed above. Justin Martyr, Tertullian, and Ambrose considered lack of physical attractiveness in Jesus as fulfilling the messianic prophecy Suffering Servant narrative of Isaiah 53. The more mainstream, theological perspective, as expressed by Church Fathers Jerome and Augustine of Hippo, argued that Jesus must have been ideally beautiful in face and body. For Augustine he was \\"beautiful as a child, beautiful on earth, beautiful in heaven\\".St. Augustin the Writings Against the Manicheans and Against the Donatists by St Augustine, Philip Schaff 2005 page 29 These theological arguments were further extended in the 13th century by Thomas Aquinas in his Summa Theologiae based on his analysis of the perfection of Christ, reasoning that Jesus must have embodied every possible human perfection.Summa Theologica, Volume 4 (Part III, First Section) by St Thomas Aquinas 2007 pp. 2060-2062Thomas Aquinas: theologian of the Christian life by Nicholas M. Healy 2003 pages 98-101 By the Middle Ages a number of documents, generally of unknown or questionable origin, had been composed and were circulating with details of the appearance of Jesus, as described below. Around the 9th century, Epiphanius Monachus referred to a tall angelic figure, which has at times been interpreted as Christ, but scholars consider it an unlikely reference to Jesus.The revelation of Elchasai by Gerard P. Luttikhuizen 1985 page 121 Other spurious references include the Archko Volume and the letter of Pontius Pilate to Tiberius Caesar, the descriptions in which were most likely composed in the Middle Ages. The Letter of Lentulus, a forged letter supposedly written by Publius Lentulus, the Governor of Judea, to the Roman Senate, according to most scholars was composed to compensate for the lack of any physical description of Jesus in the Bible. Also in the 14th century Nicephorus Callistus quoted an unnamed antique source that described Jesus as tall and beautiful with fair, wavy hair, but his account was most likely without basis and was inspired by the prevailing artistic images of Jesus.Jesus by Hartmut Miethe, Hilde Heyduck-Huth, Taylor & Francis page 168 =Quranic and Muslim traditions= Quranic and hadith traditions such as Sahih Bukhari as well as tafsir have given an oral depiction of what Jesus looked like, although some accounts do not match, such as Jesus being both curly haired and straight-haired. The hadith refer to Muhammad's account of the Night Journey, when he was taken up to heaven by the angel Gabriel (Jibra'il), where he saw Jesus and other prophets. Most versions of this say that \\"Jesus had curly hair and a reddish complexion\\". Others say his face was flushed as if he just had a bath (\\"a reddish man with many freckles on his face as if he had just come from a bath\\"Neal Robinson, Christ in Islam and Christianity, SUNY Press, 1990, p.94.F. E. Peters, Reader on Classical Islam, Princeton University Press, 1993, p.189.). In another account from Bukhari Jesus is seen in a dream near the Kaaba, as \\"a man of a wheatish complexion with straight hair. I asked who it was. They said: This is the Messiah, son of Mary\\".Bukhari, Kitab al-Fitn, ch. 27. However, other narrations give variations in the color. Salim ibn Abd-Allah reports from his father Abdullah ibn Umar that the prophet \\"did not say that Jesus was of red complexion\\", rather he was \\"a man of brown complexion and lank hair\\".Bukhari, Kitabul Ahadlth al-Anbiya, Hadith 3185. In contrast Abd Allah ibn Abbas says that Jesus was of \\"moderate complexion inclined to the red and white colors and of lank hair.\\"Bukhari, Kitabul Bad' al-Khalq, Hadlth 3000. According to Hanafi Madhab contradictions in hadith may be resolved through multiple methods, one being the number of times a narration has been made and the number of chain of narrations and the character of those in the chain of narration or the narrator him or herself. There are four hadiths in Bukhari stating Jesus had a brown complexion and three hadiths in Imam Muslim. However, the most prominent narrator is from Salim ibn Abdullah ibn Umar, descendant of Caliph Umar, with a chain of narration that stated: \\"a man of brown complexion and lank hair\\".Bukhari, Kitabul Ahadlth al-Anbiya, Hadith 3185. These variations have been explained in various ways, and have been co-opted to make assertions about race. For example, Ana Echevarr√≠a notes that medieval Spanish writer Jim√©nez de Rada in his Historia arabum chooses a version to emphasise that Jesus is whiter than Muhammad, quoting the Ibn Abbas version: \\"I saw Jesus, a man of medium height and moderate complexion inclined to the red and white colours and of lank hair\\". Echevarr√≠a comments that \\"Moses and Jesus are portrayed as specimens of a completely different 'ethnic type', fair and blond; 'ethnic' or 'racial' differences between them and Muhammad are thus highlighted.\\"Ana Echevarr√≠a, \\"Eschatology Or Biography? Alfonso X, Muhammad's Ladder And A Jewish Go-Between\\", in Cynthia Robinson & Leyla Rouhi (eds), Under the Influence: Questioning the Comparative in Medieval Castile, Brill, Boston, 2005, p.140. More references needed to prove ethnic/racial difference, none of the hadith state anything about racial difference of Moses has never been made in the Qura'n or hadith. Furthermore, most accounts of hadith state that Moses was of dark complexion, i.e. Sahih Bukhari Volume 4, Book 55, Number 607, Sahih Bukhari Volume 4, Book 55, Number 648, Sahih Bukhari Volume 4, Book 55, Number 650. There is almost universal agreement that Moses was of dark complexion by 6th century Hijazi standards. Emergence of racial theories According to the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke, Jesus was a descendant of King David. One argument against this is the contradiction in Jesus's genealogies: Matthew says he is descended from Solomon, and Luke says he is descended from Nathan, Solomon and Nathan being brothers. John of Damascus taught that there is no contradiction, for Nathan wed Solomon's wife after Solomon died in accordance with yibbum (the mitzvah that a man must marry his brother's childless widow).Exposition of the Orthodox Faith, chapter XIII Colin Kidd, in his book The Forging of Races, argues that the assignment of race to biblical individuals has been a mostly subjective practice based on cultural stereotypes and societal trends rather than on scientific methods. Kidd reviews a number of theories about the race of Jesus, including a white Aryan Jesus and a black African Jesus. In his book Racializing Jesus, Shawn Kelley states that the assignment of a specific race to Jesus has been a cultural phenomenon emanating from the higher levels of intellectual circles within societies, and he draws parallels between the different approaches within different settings.Racializing Jesus: Race, Ideology and the Formation of Modern Biblical Scholarship by Shawn Kelley 2002 pages ii-xi Cain Hope Felder has argued that New Testament passages such as Galatians 3:28 express a universalism that goes beyond race, ethnicity or even religion.Stony the Road We Trod by Cain Hope Felder 1991 page 139 Jesus with Nicodemus, by Tanner, 1899 By the 19th century, theories that Jesus was of the Aryan race, and in particular of Nordic appearance, were developed and later appealed to advocates of the new racial antisemitism, who wanted nothing Jewish about Jesus. Houston Stewart Chamberlain posited Jesus was of Amorite-Germanic extraction. Hans Jonas, New York Review of Books, 1981 The Amorites were actually a Semitic people.Who Were the Amorites?, by Alfred Haldar, 1971, Brill ArchiveSemitic Studies, Volume 1 , by Alan Kaye, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 1991, p.867The Semitic Languages , by Stefan Weninger, Walter de Gruyter, 23 December 2011, p.361 Madison Grant claimed Jesus for the Nordic race.The Aryan Jesus: Christian theologians and the Bible in Nazi Germany by Susannah Heschel 2008 page 32Louis P. Masur The challenge of American history 1999, p. 319 This found its most extreme form in the Nazi theology of Positive Christianity. Scholars supporting the radical Aryan view also argued that being a Jew by religion was distinguishable from being a Jew by race or ethnicity.The Symbolic Jesus: Historical Scholarship, Judaism and the Construction of Contemporary Identity by William Edward Arnal 2005 pages 46-47 These theories usually also include the reasoning that Jesus was Aryan because Galilee was supposedly a non-Jewish region speaking an unknown Indo-European language, but this has not gained scholarly acceptance - Galilee had a significant non-Jewish minority, but these spoke various local Semitic languages.Jesus and the origins of Christianity by Maurice Goguel, New York, Harper, 1960 page 255 Godfrey Higgins suggested in his book Anacalypsis (1836) that Jesus was a dark, brown-skinned Indo-Aryan from North India. In 1906, a German writer named Theodor Plange wrote a book titled Christ-an Indian? in which he argued that Jesus was an Indian and that the Christian gospel had originated in India.Jan A. B. Jongeneel Jesus Christ in world history 2009, pp.202-203 By the 20th century, theories had also been proposed that Jesus was black, but not necessarily a descendant of any specific African ethnicity, based on the argument that the ancient Israelites, as a group, were in whole or part originally a black people.\\"The Black Christ\\" Chapter 25 of The Blackwell Companion to Jesus edited by Delbert Burkett 2010 pages 410-420 Martin Luther King Jr. was a proponent of the \\"Black Christ\\" movement and identified the struggle of Jesus against the authorities of the time with the struggle of African Americans in the southern parts of the United States, as he questioned why the white church leaders did not voice concern for racial equality. For some, this blackness was due to Jesus's identification with black people, not the color of his skin, while others such as Albert Cleage argued that Jesus was ethnically black.Christology from the margins by Thomas Bohache 2009 page 69 A study on the 2001 BBC series Son of God attempted to determine what Jesus's race and appearance may have been. Assuming Jesus to be a Galilean Semite, the study concluded in conjunction with Mark Goodacre that his skin would have been \\"olive-coloured\\" and \\"swarthy\\"‚Äîthese results were criticised by some media outlets for being \\"dismissive\\" and \\"dumbed down\\". In academic studies, beyond generally agreeing that \\"Jesus was Jewish\\",Amy-Jill Levine in The Historical Jesus in Context edited by Amy-Jill Levine et al. Princeton Univ Press page 10 there are no contemporary depictions of Jesus that can be used to determine his appearance. BBC reconstruction In 2001, a new attempt was made to discover what the true race and face of Jesus might have been, and documented in the Son of God documentary series. The study, sponsored by the BBC, France 3 and Discovery Channel, used one of three 1st- century Jewish skulls from a leading department of forensic science in Israel. A face was constructed using forensic anthropology by Richard Neave, a retired medical artist from the Unit of Art in Medicine at the University of Manchester. The face that Neave constructed suggested that Jesus would have had a broad face and large nose, and differed significantly from the traditional depictions of Jesus in renaissance art. Additional information about Jesus's skin color and hair was provided by Mark Goodacre, a senior lecturer at the Department of Theology and Religion at the University of Birmingham. Using 3rd-century images from a synagogue‚Äîthe earliest pictures of Jewish people‚ÄîGoodacre proposed that Jesus's skin color would have been darker and swarthier than his traditional Western image. He also suggested that he would have had short, curly hair and a short cropped beard. The First Epistle to the Corinthians, where Paul the Apostle states that it is \\"disgraceful\\" for a man to have long hair,1 Corinthians 11:14. King James Version: Oxford Standard (1769) was cited as support for this, the argument being that as Paul allegedly knew many of the disciples and members of Jesus's family, it is unlikely that he would have written such a thing had Jesus had long hair. Although not literally the face of Jesus, the result of the study determined that Jesus's skin would have been more olive-colored than white or black, and that he would have most likely looked like a typical Galilean Semite of his day. Among the points made was that the Bible records that Jesus's disciple Judas had to point him out to those arresting him. The implied argument is that if Jesus's physical appearance had differed markedly from his disciples, then he would have been relatively easy to identify. James H. Charlesworth states Jesus' face was \\"most likely dark brown and sun-tanned\\", and his stature \\"may have been between four feet five and four feet seven \\".  What Did Jesus Look Like?  In 2018 historian Joan Taylor published What Did Jesus Look Like? that traced back through time from the European Jesus of western art to Jesus himself. Using the work of Israeli anthropologist Yossi Nagar on the physical characteristics of bones of Jews dating to the time of Jesus, which show similarities to Iraqi Jews of today, Taylor concluded that Jesus had honey/olive skin, brown eyes and black hair. As for the honey/olive description, Taylor writes that his skin was \\"a darker hue consistent with the skin tone of people of the Middle East\\" (p.163). Taylor thinks that the BBC reconstruction is \\"quite speculative\\" because reconstruction of cartilage (noses, etc) is guesswork. Acheiropoieta and reported visions During the Middle Ages, a number of legendary images of Jesus began to appear, at times perhaps constructed to validate the styles of depiction of that period, e.g. the image of Edessa. The Veil of Veronica was accompanied by a narrative about the Passion of Jesus. A number of descriptions of Jesus have been reported by saints and mystics who claim they have seen Jesus in a vision. Reports of such visions are more common among Roman Catholics than other Christian denominations.Michael Freze, 1993, Voices, Visions, and Apparitions, OSV Publishing page 91 By the 20th century, some reports of miraculous images of Jesus began to receive significant attention, e.g. Secondo Pia's photograph of the Shroud of Turin, one of the most controversial artifacts in history. During its May 2010 exposition the shroud and its photograph of what some authors consider the face of Jesus were visited by over 2 million people.Arthur Barnes, 2003 Holy Shroud of Turin Kessinger Press pages 2-9William Meacham, The Authentication of the Turin Shroud:An Issue in Archaeological Epistemology, Current Anthropology, Volume 24, No 3, June 1983Zenit, May 5, 2010 Another 20th-century depiction of Jesus, namely the Divine Mercy image is based on Faustina Kowalska's reported vision, which she described in her diary as a pattern that was then painted by artists. The depiction is now widely used among Catholics, and has over 100 million followers worldwide.Catherine M. Odell, 1998, Faustina: Apostle of Divine Mercy OSV Press page 165Am With You Always by Benedict Groeschel 2010 page 548 Artistic portrayals The oldest surviving Christ Pantocrator icon, 6th century, Saint Catherine's Monastery, Egypt.God's human face: the Christ-icon by Christoph Schoenborn 1994 page 154Sinai and the Monastery of St. Catherine by John Galey 1986 page 92 Despite the lack of biblical references or historical records, for two millennia a wide range of depictions of Jesus have appeared, often influenced by cultural settings, political circumstances and theological contexts.Teaching Christianity: a world religions approach by Clive Erricker 1987 page 44 As in other Christian art, the earliest depictions date to the late second or early 3rd century, and are primarily found in Rome.The New Westminster Dictionary of Church History by Robert Benedetto 2006 pages 51-53 In these early depictions, Jesus is usually shown as a youthful figure without a beard and with curly hair, sometimes with different features from the other men in the scenes, e.g. his disciples or the Romans. However bearded depictions also appear from very early on, perhaps drawing on an existing stereotype from the Greek world of the appearance of the many itinerant charismatic philosophers. Although some images exist at the synagogue at Dura-Europos, and such images may have been common, Judaism in theory forbade images, and its influence on the depictions of Jesus remains unknown. Christian depictions of the 3rd and 4th centuries typically focused on New Testament scenes of healings and other miracles. Following the conversion of Constantine in the 4th century, Christian art found many wealthy donors and flourished. In this period Jesus began to have more mature features, and was shown with a beard. A new development at this time was the depiction of Jesus without a narrative context, but just as a figure by himself. By the 5th century depictions of the Passion began to appear, perhaps reflecting a change in the theological focus of the early Church. The 6th century Rabbula Gospels include some of the earliest images of the crucifixion and resurrection. By the 6th century the bearded depiction of Jesus had become standard, both in the East and the West. These depictions with reddish brown hair parted in the middle and with almond shaped eyes showed consistency for several centuries. At this time various legends were developed to attempt to validate the styles of depiction, e.g. the image of Edessa and later the Veil of Veronica. The Byzantine Iconoclasm acted as a barrier to developments in the East, but by the 9th century art was again permitted. The Transfiguration of Jesus was a major theme in the East and every Eastern Orthodox monk who took up iconography had to start his craft by producing the icon of the Transfiguration.The image of God the Father in Orthodox theology and iconography by Steven Bigham 1995 pages 226-227 Whereas Western depictions aim for proportion, the abolition of perspective and alterations in the size and proportion of an image in Eastern icons aim to reach beyond man's earthly dwellings.Archimandrite Vasileios of Stavronikita, \\"Icons as Liturgical Analogies\\" in Hymn of entry: liturgy and life in the Orthodox church 1997 pages 81-90 The representation of the race of Jesus has been influenced by cultural settings.Jesus: the complete guide by Leslie Houlden 2006 082648011X pages 63-100 A Chinese illustration, Beijing, 1879 The 13th century witnessed a turning point in the portrayal of the powerful Kyrios image of Jesus as a wonder worker in the West, as the Franciscans began to emphasize the humility of Jesus both at his birth and his death via the Nativity scene as well as the crucifixion.The image of St Francis by Rosalind B.

Empereur, Eduardo Fern√°ndez 2006 pages 3-5Philippines by Lily Rose R. Tope, Detch P. Nonan-Mercado 2005 page 109 The Renaissance brought forth a number of artistic masters who focused on the depictions of Jesus and after Giotto, Fra Angelico and others systematically developed uncluttered images that focused on the depiction of Jesus with an ideal human beauty. Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper which is considered the first work of High Renaissance art due to its high level of harmony became well known for depicting Jesus surrounded by varying emotions of the individual apostles at the announcement of the betrayal.Experiencing Art Around Us by Thomas Buser 2005 pages 382-383Leonardo da Vinci, the Last Supper: a Cosmic Drama and an Act of Redemption by Michael Ladwein 2006 pages 27 and 60 Objections to depictions of Jesus have appeared, e.g. in 1850 John Everett Millais was attacked for his painting Christ in the House of His Parents because it was \\"painful\\" to see \\"the youthful Saviour\\" depicted as \\"a red-headed Jew boy\\". The first cinematic portrayal of Jesus was in the 1897 film La Passion du Christ produced in Paris, which lasted five minutes.The Challenge of the Silver Screen (Studies in Religion and the Arts) ISBN By Freek L. Bakker 2009 page 1Encyclopedia of early cinema by Richard Abel2005 page 518 Thereafter cinematic portrayals have continued to show Jesus with a beard in the standard western depiction that resembles Renaissance images.The Blackwell Companion to Jesus edited by Delbert Burkett 2010 page 526 More recent artistic and cinematic portrayals have also made an effort to characterize Jesus as an ancient Middle Eastern resident. In the 2004 movie, The Passion of the Christ, Jesus was portrayed by Jim Caviezel who wore a prosthetic nose during filming and had his blue eyes digitally changed to brown to give him a more Middle Eastern appearance. According to designer Miles Teves, who created the prosthesis: \\"Mel (Gibson) wanted to make the actor playing Jesus, James Caviezel, look more ethnically Middle Eastern, and it was decided that we could do it best by changing the shape of his nose.\\"James Caviezel was given a prosthetic nose and a raised hairline.

He lived most of his life in S√£o Paulo, except for his studies in Paris in his early twenties. Brecheret's work combines techniques of European modernist sculpture with references to his native country through the physical characteristics of his human forms and visual motifs drawn from Brazilian folk art. Many of his subjects are figures from the Bible or classical mythology. Biography Brecheret was one of the first Brazilian modernists to achieve success. In 1921 his sculpture Eve was acquired by the S√£o Paulo city hall. In 1922 his work was exhibited in the foyer of the Municipal Theatre during the Week of Modern Art (Semana de Arte Moderna).

It was a precursor to the Honda Rebel series of motorcycles. The bike had a air-cooled parallel twin-cylinder engine. It was equipped with electric start and electronic ignition. Models included the CM400A (Automatic), CM400C (Custom), CM400E (Economy) and CM400T (Touring). The CM400C was produced only in 1981 making it one of the more rare model types. The Honda CM series all generally resembled the older-style flat-seat bikes from the 1960s and 1970s, with the exception of a slightly raised passenger area seat and small plastic fairings for the battery and electrical. These are \\"standard\\" style motorcycles but do have some elements of the cruiser (stepped seat, increased fork angle, extra chrome). The CM400 series includes only a speedometer and three indicator lights (neutral, oil pressure, high beam) with a tachometer for the C and T models. The E (economy) model had wire wheels and drum brakes, while the others had Comstar wheels and a front disc/rear drum braking setup. While not particularly powerful, the CM400's handling makes it a suitable starter bike. Many engine components are common with the Honda CB400T models from the same year. The parallel twin engine has three valves per cylinder (two intake, one exhaust) and a five-speed manual or two-speed automatic transmission. In 1982, the CM engine was bored out to a engine and the series was renamed CM450 In the 1984 film Purple Rain, Prince, in the role of The Kid, rode a customized Honda CM400 and he is also seen with it on the cover to the soundtrack of the same name.

The 133rd episode overall, it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on October 19, 2005. In the episode, Stan and Cartman accidentally destroy a dam, causing the town of Beaverton to be destroyed. People thought that the dam's destruction was caused by global warming, causing panic and mayhem around Colorado and across the country. The episode was co-written by series co- creator Trey Parker and Kenny Hotz. It parodies the 2004 film The Day After Tomorrow, and also general responses to Hurricane Katrina, particularly the various ad hoc explanations for the increased level of suffering from the hurricane and its aftermath. Plot Stan and Cartman are playing in a boat that Cartman claims is his uncle's when Cartman dares Stan to drive the boat, claiming he will take the blame if trouble arises. However, as Stan does not know how to drive a boat, they crash into the world's largest beaver dam, flooding the town of Beaverton. Cartman reveals that he lied about the boat belonging to his uncle and convinces Stan to try to hide their involvement by maintaining complete silence about the incident. Meanwhile, the flood has a worse outcome than Stan expected. The people of Beaverton are in a state of disaster. Nobody tries to help the situation; instead, everybody would rather figure out who is to blame. At a conference at the Governor's office with top Colorado scientists and government officials, they all declare that the disaster is the result of global warming. At first, it is determined the full effects will take place on \\"the day after tomorrow\\". However, some scientists suddenly burst in and state that it has been proven that the disaster will take place \\"two days before the day after tomorrow\\". The declaration of the scientists causes mass hysteria, and everybody runs from \\"global warming\\". Most of the South Park people crowd in the community center. Randy authoritatively states that global warming is causing an ice age outside that would kill them if they left. Stan admits to Kyle that he and Cartman were the cause of the Beaverton flood (although Stan takes most of the blame). The trio then set off to rescue the people by boat. The attempt is a disaster in itself, as they wind up crashing into an oil refinery, compounding the problems of the stranded people who now must deal with drowning and fire. Meanwhile, Randy, Gerald, and Stephen brave the supposed ice age to find their sons. Dressed in heavy arctic mountaineering gear despite the mild weather, the trio quickly collapse in the street due to heat exhaustion and dehydration, but mistake their symptoms as the \\"last stages of hypothermia.\\" Escaping to the roof of the flooded and burning refinery, the boys are rescued by an Army helicopter and fly back to South Park where the Army declares that Crab People, not global warming, are responsible for breaking the dam. In exasperation, Stan finally admits that he broke the dam, but one of the townspeople incorrectly interprets his admission as a lesson to stop obsessing over who to blame while ignoring the problem. The townspeople all begin to declare, \\"I broke the dam\\", with Cartman joining in knowing that he won't get in trouble now, while Stan tries unsuccessfully to explain that he literally did it, with a boat. Stan gets frustrated and finally just says, \\"Oh, fuck it!\\" Cultural references This episode parodies the response to Hurricane Katrina, particularly the various ad hoc explanations for the increased level of suffering from the hurricane and its aftermath. In addition, the episode parodies the misplaced anger and unwillingness to negotiate between all the parties in the Katrina relief effort, the distorted media coverage that occurred during the hurricane's aftermath, and the Houston mass evacuation during Hurricane Rita. For instance, when the people conclude that George Bush was the cause of the beaver dam being broken, someone says \\"George Bush doesn't care about beavers!\\" in a parody of Kanye West's quote, \\"George Bush doesn't care about black people.\\" In addition, during the evacuation, only white people are rescued, while a black man can be seen left stranded. This references the accusations of selectively racist rescue efforts and media coverage during the Hurricane Katrina crisis. \\"Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow\\" also parodies the 2004 film The Day After Tomorrow, and general responses to global warming. For instance, the scene where Stan calls his father on the phone while the water level rises is a reference to a similar scene in The Day After Tomorrow where Sam calls his father while trying to outlast the fatal coldness. Several other scenes from the film are parodied in the episode. The final scene where everyone says \\"I broke the dam\\" is a reference to the 1960 film Spartacus where the title character comes forward as Spartacus, and the slave-crowd all claim to be Spartacus in an effort to protect him. The scene in which Cartman confronts Kyle over his \\"Jew gold\\", in the flooded fuel factory, is a reference to the final scene of the 1976 film Marathon Man, in which a fugitive Nazi war criminal confronts a detective who has taken his diamonds, stolen from Holocaust victims, and is preventing the Nazi from cashing in on them.

Population: 36,000 (1970). History Kyshtym was established by the Demidovs in 1757 around two factories for production of cast iron and steel. The city emblem shows the Kyshtym Manor House, a Palladian residence of Nikita Demidov Jr. According to Herbert Hoover, a small iron industry had existed there \\"for one hundred and fifty years\\", which produced a secret process for generating sheet iron \\"unusually resistant to rust.\\" The process \\"consisted of alternately heating the sheets and sweeping them when hot with a wet pine-bough. The effect was to create a coating of iron oxide which was rust-resistant.\\" Baron Meller-Zakomelsky's Kyshtym estate became of interest to foreign capital, after the 1905 Russian Revolution and subsequent depression. A British consortium around Charles Leslie brought in the mining entrepreneur Leslie Urquhart, investing in Russian oil and minerals. In 1908 Leslie became Chairman of the Kyshtym Corporation, for mining. In 1910, Hoover's American company became involved. The copper, iron and steel industry associated with mining in the area was modernized. Copper production, using pyritic smelting, eventually reached 25,000,000 pounds a year. The corporate situation was already complex, when the American interests became involved, because of tensions between the British interests, which were related by cross-holdings. In 1911 Alfred Chester Beatty visited Kyshtym, on behalf of the American interests. By 1912 the future direction was set for investment in the Urals, with Beatty and Urquhart allied, and the British group around Leslie excluded. Kyshtym was granted town status in 1934. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with twelve rural localities, incorporated as the Town of Kyshtym‚Äîan administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts.Resolution #161 As a municipal division, the Town of Kyshtym is incorporated as Kyshtymsky Urban Okrug. Nuclear disaster Kyshtym is near the Ozyorsk nuclear complex, also known as \\"Mayak\\" (\\"lighthouse\\" in Russian), where on September 29, 1957, a violent explosion involving dry nitrate and acetate salts in a waste tank containing highly radioactive waste, contaminated an area of more than 15,000 square kilometers (Ozyorsk was the town built around the Mayak combine, but it was a closed city, which was not marked on maps, thus making Kyshtym the nearest town to the location of the disaster). The explosion resulted from a failure of the cooling system of the tank.\\"Kyshtym accident\\" TED Case Studies: An Online Journal American University There was a release of 740 PBq of fission products, approximately 10% of which was dispersed into the atmosphere.Jones (2007) Windscale and Kyshtym: a double anniversary Journal of Environmental radioactivity 99:1-6 Cerium-144 and Zirconium-95 (both relatively short lived isotopes with a half life of 285 and 64 days respectively) made up 91% of the release.

The global fallout of Sr-90 was about 2 kBq/m¬≤. An area measuring 17 km¬≤ was contaminated by about 100 MBq Sr-90/m¬≤. There were 270,000 inhabitants of the area.

Performing Arts Reading Room, Library of Congress. Gussie Lord Davis (December 3, 1863 ‚Äì October 18, 1899) was an American songwriter born in Dayton, Ohio. Davis was one of America's earliest successful African-American music artists, the first black songwriter to become famous on Tin Pan Alley as a composer of popular music. Early life Gussie Davis received musical training at the Nelson Musical College in Cincinnati, Ohio, where his application was rejected due to his color. Instead, he worked as a janitor at a low wage in exchange for private lessons. His first song was published in 1880, \\"We Sat Beneath the Maple on the Hill\\"; Davis published it himself, paying a local printer $20, and sold enough copies to make his money back plus a little more. He continued his songwriting efforts with increasing success, publishing many songs and attracting attention, including that of Cincinnati publisher and would-be lyricist, George Propheter. Career Cover of sheet music for one of Davis' songs In 1886, when Propheter branched out his business to New York and Tin Pan Alley, Davis went with him. He worked steadily, performing as well as writing songs, and making a name for himself. By 1895, he was sufficiently well known to be selected to compete in a contest sponsored by the New York World to find the ten best songwriters in the nation; he placed second with his song, \\"Send Back the Picture and the Ring\\", and won a prize of $500 in gold. He performed as a pianist in venues such as Bergen Star Concerts and toured with minstrel groups including his own Davis Operatic and Plantation Minstrels. Davis wrote a variety of musical forms, including sentimental ballads, comic minstrel songs, art songs, and choral music. He was best known in his own time for his \\"tear- jerkers\\". One of these was \\"Fatal Wedding\\" (1893), his first national hit; Davis composed the music, a waltz, while the words are credited to William H. Windom, a well-known ballad singer. Another tear-jerker was \\"In the Baggage Coach Ahead\\", Davis's most commercially successful composition, selling over a million copies. The success of \\"In the Baggage Coach\\" was fueled by the popular female vaudeville singer, Imogene Comer, who made it part of her regular repertoire. Death An April 1899 article in The Freeman reported that Davis had purchased a home in Whitestone, New York and that he was recovering from a serious illness. In August of that year, press releases indicated he would appear in A Hot Old Time in Dixie, going on the road in the coming season; this musical farce was Davis's property with Tom McIntosh. On October 18, 1899, Davis died at home in Whitestone. At the time of his death, Gussie Davis had published more than three hundred songs and certainly left more in manuscript.

Line signaling is responsible for off-hook, ringing signal, answer, ground start, on-hook unidirectional supervision messaging in each direction from calling party to called party and vice versa. After an off-hook, line signaling initiates register signaling to accomplish the exchange of telephone numbers of called party and in more modern line-signaling protocols, the calling party as well. While register signaling occurs, line signaling remains quiescent unless the calling party goes on-hook or an abnormal cessation of the call occurs, such as due to equipment malfunction or shutdown or due to network outage upstream in that call-attempt's series of spanned trunks. Line signaling can be conveyed in a single DS0 channel of a trunk. In modern PCM telecommunications, line signaling is represented by the ABCD bits in DS0 #16 of an E1 or a selected DS0 within a T1. Line signaling can also be conveyed within the channels being supervised, as in the original T1 scheme which used one out of every eight bits for supervision, or with robbed bits of a superframe format, or as in-band signaling, e.g. as in L1 signaling where 2280 Hz tone pulses are used.

His father held a professorship at the Berlin Frederick William University since 1889 and had become a notable member of the German Physical Society (DPG); his children grew up in the wealthy environment of the Grunewald mansions colony. Having obtained his Abitur degree in 1911, Erwin Planck pursued a career as an officer in the German Army. In World War I, he soon found himself a prisoner of the French forces in 1914. Planck returned to Germany in 1917 and was active on the General Staff. Here he first met Major Kurt von Schleicher, the beginning of a lifelong friendship. After the war, Major Schleicher became head of the political department in the newly established Ministry of the Reichswehr and in 1920 appointed Planck his assistant. In January 1924 Schleicher sent him as a liaison officer to the Reich Chancellery, where Planck also became a government official after he left the Reichswehr armed forces in 1926. Upon the downfall of the Br√ºning government in 1932, he became a deputy minister under Chancellor Franz von Papen, and retained this post when Schleicher himself was appointed Reich Chancellor in December. Planck contributed to Schleicher's Querfront to gain Nazi support for his government, though to no avail. After Schleicher resigned and Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor on 30 January 1933, Planck immediately resigned office and, put in temporary retirement, went abroad to East Asia for a year. Shortly after he came back to Germany, Kurt von Schleicher and his wife were shot at their Babelsberg home by members of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) in the Night of the Long Knives on 30 June 1934. Planck tried in vain to get an explanation for his friend's murder. He also held several conspirative talks with Reichswehr General Werner von Fritsch which, however, did not lead to any conclusion. In 1936, Planck changed career paths and went into business, becoming a leading employee at the Otto Wolff corporate group, a large conglomerate in Cologne. In 1939, he took over leadership of the Berlin branch office. In August 1939, on the eve of World War II, a group including Prussian Finance Minister Johannes Popitz, Planck, and Reichsbank president Hjalmar Schacht approached General Georg Thomas, head of the Defence Economy and Armament Office asking him to thwart the outbreak of the forthcoming Invasion of Poland. Thomas agreed to write a memorandum to his superior, OKW Chief Wilhelm Keitel, in which he stated that a war against Poland would set off a world war that Germany could not win owing to massive supply problems. However, Keitel tried to allay Thomas's fears by telling him that Hitler was planning no such war. In 1940, Planck, Popitz, Ulrich von Hassell and General Ludwig Beck drafted a \\"Provisional Constitution\\" on the assumption that the forthcoming attack on the Western Front would overthrow Hitler's regime. Even afterwards, Planck stayed in the conservative resistance circles around Carl Friedrich Goerdeler and was involved in the preparations for the 20 July plot. This led to his arrest on 23 July 1944, after which he was taken to the Gestapo headquarters at the Reichssicherheitshauptamt (RSHA). Erwin Planck was sentenced to death in a show trial at the \\"People's Court\\" (Volksgerichtshof) on 23 October. Planck was executed by hanging on 23 January 1945 at Pl√∂tzensee Prison in Berlin.J√ºrgen Heideking, American Intelligence And The German Resistance: A Documentary History, Westview Press, 1998, p. 361.

The Organization of American Historians (OAH), formerly known as the Mississippi Valley Historical Association, is the largest professional society dedicated to the teaching and study of American history. OAH's members in the U.S. and abroad include college and university professors; historians, students; precollegiate teachers; archivists, museum curators, and other public historians; and a variety of scholars employed in government and the private sector. The OAH publishes the Journal of American History. Among its various programs, OAH conducts an annual meeting each spring, and has a robust roster on its OAH Distinguished Lecturership Program. The organization's mission is to promote excellence in the scholarship, teaching, and presentation of American history, and encourage wide discussion of historical questions and equitable treatment of all practitioners of history. Membership is open to all who wish to support its mission. In 2010 its individual membership is approximately 8,000 and its institutional membership approximately 1,250.

The Raintree House is a Greek Revival style brick house. The house gets its name from two large raintrees (Koelreuteria paniculata), which stand on the property. Built by William Moffett Millen c. 1845, it is an excellent example of the Georgian house plan favored by well-to-do farmers in southern Indiana and the Upland South in the mid-nineteenth century.Katherine Roberts, Description and History of Indiana University's Raintree House for Nomination of the Property to the National Register of Historic Places, March, 2003, p 1.

History and background The Mississippi Valley Historical Association was formed on October 17 and 18, 1907 at a meeting in Lincoln, Nebraska, of seven historical societies of the Mississippi Valley. The organization, devoted to studying the Mississippi Valley region, began a tradition of holding an annual meeting each year, and began quarterly publication in 1914 of the Mississippi Valley Historical Review. As the scholarly emphasis of the organization and its journal developed and spread over time, its initial emphasis on the Mississippi Valley came under sharp challenge from members who wanted a better title and a wider scope. Ray Billington identifies the four issues that caused bitter quarrelling: the desire to use the association's prestige to fight for liberal reforms, to change the association's name to represent a national scope, to democratize its oligarchical structure, and to take a firm stand against racial discrimination in terms of hotels and meeting cities. The reformers were successful in the mail ballot and the Mississippi Valley Historical Review was renamed the Journal of American History and the organization, correspondingly was renamed the Organization of American Historians.William D.

He is also a prize-winning gardener, having developed and patented a totally black rose, the Death by Midnight. He released a solo album, It's a Smalls World, in the mid 1970s, and also played in the Christian rock band Lambsblood in the late 1980s before rejoining Spinal Tap for their reunion tour in 1992.French, This Is Spinal Tap, p. 199 During this period, he also worked briefly for his father's business. After the band broke up in 1992, Derek became employed as a \\"floater\\" in an elementary school, with such duties as a crossing guard and straightening library books. According to the 2007 short film Spinal Tap, it is revealed that Derek checked into rehab to be treated for an addiction to the internet. A solo album, Smalls Change (Meditations Upon Ageing), was announced in early 2018, including collaborations from many prominent rock musicians. Sources for character The character appears in part to be a satire of Lemmy from Mot√∂rhead, who wore a similar mutton chop beard. However, his onstage mannerisms resemble those of fellow bass player Steve Dawson from the band Saxon, with whom Shearer went on the road before filming This Is Spinal Tap.French, This Is Spinal Tap, p. 243 \\"Harry Shearer came on tour with us in '82\\", confirmed singer Biff Byford. \\"The guy he based his character on was our old bass player Steve Dawson ‚Äì the moustache, the pointing to the audience.\\" In the film, Smalls can be seen wearing both a Shrewsbury Town football shirt and a West Ham baseball cap.\\"How many football references are there in Spinal Tap?\\" The Guardian, 10 April 2003 Jethro Tull singer Ian Anderson has claimed that the name was derived from \\"Derek Small\\", which appears in the liner notes of the band's albums Thick as a Brick and A Passion Play.

The name originated from large number of crows (Kraai in Afrikaans) that nest in the region. Beginnings In 1869 sub- division of farm land started in the area. In 1876 a railway station was formed called \\"Kraaifontein Junction\\". In 1877 formal town development started. The first school was established on 20 January 1908. The Dutch reformed church was founded in 1948. In the same year Kraaifontein got its own local authority. In 1954 the \\"Volkskerk van Afrika (Translated- The nation's church of Africa)\\" was founded with Appollis,BJE, being the first preacher. On 16 September 1957, it became a municipality under the first Mayor JP Rossouw. Today It is located in the Cape Town's northern suburbs and flanks the N1 towards Paarl and Worcester to the north. It comprises several residential areas, namely Windsor Park, Scottsville, Peerless Park, Eikendal, Scottsdene, Bloekombos, Wallacedene, Belmont Park, Bonny Brook, and Uitzicht. Libraries are funded and owned by the City of Cape Town Metropolitan municipality. These libraries are Kraaifontein Public Library, Scottsdene Public Library, and Eikendal Public Library. High Schools in the area are Monument Park, Eben D√∂nges, Bloekombos, Masibambane Secondary School, Simonsberg Primary School http://www.masibambaness.co.za Scottsdene High School, Scottsville High School and Bernadino Heights High School. Areas Kraaifontein, encompassing the areas of Northpine, Scottsdene,Scottsville, Wallacedene, Eikendal and Bloekombos, was once a separate municipality before the restructuring of all South African municipalities during the late 90s. These areas, however, are listed as separate suburbs by the City of Cape Town for planning and statistical purposes. Forming part of the City of Cape Town Metropolitan Municipality, it is located in its Subcouncil 2 Area, Bergdal. Coat of arms The Kraaifontein municipal council assumed a coat of arms, registered it with the Cape Provincial Administration in June 1964,Cape of Good Hope Official Gazette 3245 (26 June 1964). had it granted by the provincial administrator in March 1967,Cape of Good Hope Official Gazette 3391 (3 March 1967). and registered it at the Bureau of Heraldry in September 1969.http://www.national.archsrch.gov.za The arms, designed by Schalk Pienaar, were: Argent, a chevron Gules between in chief two heraldic fountains and in base a bunch of grapes leaved proper (in layman's terms: a silver shield displaying, from top to bottom, two discs divided into wavy white and blue stripes, a red chevron, and a bunch of grapes). The crest was a parson-crow, and the motto Non auro sed virtute. Together the crow (kraai) and the fountains (fonteine) were a pun on the name of the town.

The series debuted in 1987 as a coin-operated arcade game titled Contra, which was followed by the release of Super Contra in 1988 and several sequels produced for various home platforms. The arcade version of Contra was released in February 1987, a few months after the Iran‚ÄìContra affair was made public. While it is unclear whether the game was deliberately named after the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, the ending theme of the original game was titled , after the adversaries of the real-life Contras. Gameplay The majority of the Contra games are side-scrolling shoot-'em-ups where the player takes control of an armed commando who must fight all sorts of extraterrestrial monsters and other kinds of futuristic menaces. In addition to the side-scrolling stages, the original Contra (among others) also features \\"pseudo-3D perspective\\" levels where the player must move towards the background in order to progress, while subsequent titles, such as Super Contra and Contra III: The Alien Wars, feature overhead stages as well. Only the Appaloosa-developed installments in the series, Contra: Legacy of War and C The Contra Adventure, as well as Neo Contra, deviated from the series' mainly side-scrolling perspective (although C: The Contra Adventure does feature two side-scrolling stages). Contra: Shattered Soldier, while maintaining the side- view perspective of the 2D games, features fully polygonal 3D graphics. Almost every game in the series, with only a few exceptions (such as the MSX2 version of Contra, C The Contra Adventure or Operation C for the Game Boy, which were single-player only), allows two players to play the game simultaneously. The main power-ups in the series are falcon-shaped letter icons which will replace the player's default weapon with a new one, such as a Laser Gun or a Spread Gun. There are also power-ups that are actually auxiliary items like the Barrier (which provides temporary invincibility) or the Rapid Bullets (which increases the firing speed of the player's current weapon) in the original Contra, as well as weapons such as the Mega Shell in the arcade version of Super Contra and the Bombs in Contra III and Contra: Hard Corps, that are used to destroy all on-screen enemies. The original arcade version of Contra used the falcon icons for all of its weapons except the Laser Gun and the Fire Ball weapon, while in the arcade version of Super Contra, no Falcon icons were used. Contra: Shattered Soldier and Neo Contra both deviate from this tradition by having set weapon configurations instead. Most of the Contra games have the player begin the game with only a set number of lives (three in most console games). If the player gets hit once, they will lose a life along with any weapon they currently possess in some games. Because of this, the Contra series is notorious for being extremely difficult. Even in the original arcade versions, most of the games only give limited chances to continue before forcing the player to start all over. Extra lives are usually obtained in most games when the player reaches certain scores. The NES version of the original Contra used the Konami Code (previously featured in the NES version of Gradius) to start the game with thirty lives instead of the usual three. Most of the subsequent console games in the series only featured these extra lives codes in their Japanese releases, such as Contra Spirits (the Japanese version of Contra III) and Contra: Hard Corps. Games =Original games= * Contra (Arcade, NES, MSX2, DOS, C64, CPC, ZX) (1987) *:Contra is the first game in the series. Many of the series' conventions such as power-ups, two- player cooperative gameplay and the character's light mobility (including somersaults) were already present in this game. The game is composed of traditional side-view stages that scroll either vertically or horizontally, as well as \\"3D view\\" stages in which the player moves towards the backgrounds. The NES version is different from the arcade version and has longer stages and numerous other modifications. In Japan, the Famicom version uses the VRC2 chip, which allowed for additional background animation and cut-scenes not included in its North American and European NES counterparts. An MSX2 version was also produced that is drastically different from the other two versions. Several computer versions were done outside Japan, by Ocean in Europe for the C64, CPC and ZX, and by Banana Software in North America for DOS based PCs. * Super Contra (Arcade, NES, DOS, Amiga) (1988) *: Super Contra replaces the 3D view stages from the original with top-view stages similar to those in Commando or Ikari Warriors. Features unique to the arcade version includes upgradeable weapons and the ability to control the character's jumping height. The NES version (retitled Super C for its North American version) has three new stages and a new final boss, but lacks the upgradable weapons from the arcade game. Unlimited Software created DOS and Amiga conversions for the North American market, based on the arcade original. * Operation C (Game Boy) (1991) *: Operation C is the first Contra game made specifically for a portable platform. Featuring gameplay similar to the NES version of Super C, Operation C also first introduced the \\"homing gun\\" power-up. * Contra III: The Alien Wars (SNES, Game Boy, Game Boy Advance) (1992) *: The series' first entry for a 16-bit game console, Contra III allows the player's character to climb into walls or railings and carry two weapons that can be switched back and forth, as well as smart bombs that kill all on-screen enemies. Many of the stages and bosses made use of the system's Mode 7 graphic effects, including a bike riding stage that ends in a midair battle with the main character riding missiles. The player is now required to rotate their character in the top-view stages to move along with the scenery. Two heavily modified portable ports were produced; a port for the original Game Boy, simply titled Contra: The Alien Wars; and a later Game Boy Advance port, titled Contra Advance: The Alien Wars EX, which replaced the top view stages with levels from Contra: Hard Corps. * Contra Force (NES) (1992) *: Contra Force combines the run and gun style of the Contra series with a power-up system similar to Gradius. The game is notable for being the first Contra to feature selectable characters with their unique weapon configurations. Contra Force lacks the alien invaders and futuristic environment of previous installments, as the game centers around an elite task force fighting human terrorists in a present-day setting. The game was actually planned as an unrelated game in Japan as Arc Hound, but was never officially released there, nor in Europe. * Contra: Hard Corps (Mega Drive/Genesis) (1994) *: The first Contra game for a Sega platform. Hard Corps also contains selectable characters with unique weapons and abilities and introduces an in-game storyline with branching paths that alter the ending. * Contra: Legacy of War (PlayStation, Sega Saturn) (1996) *: The first of two Contra titles developed by Appaloosa Interactive, as well as the first attempt to convert the Contra gameplay to 3D and the first game in the series to be played in an isometric perspective. It was originally sold with a pair of anaglyph glasses. It is the first console Contra game to be released in the PAL region with no changes. A Japanese release of Legacy of War was planned, but canceled. * C The Contra Adventure (PlayStation) (1998) *: The second Contra game developed by Appaloosa. The gameplay is composed of several side- scrolling and 3D stages, as well as a single overhead stage. It's the only console game in the series to lack a multiplayer mode. C: The Contra Adventure was only released in North America, with no Japanese nor European versions. * Contra: Shattered Soldier (PlayStation 2) (2002) *: Features 2D side-scrolling gameplay with fully polygonal 3D graphics. The player now has a fixed weapon configuration, allowing the character to use one of three weapons. The player can also charge their weapon for a more powerful shot. The game grades the player's performance on each stage and only allows the good ending to those with an above-average rank. * Neo Contra (PlayStation 2) (2004) *: Most of the game is played in an isometric perspective, but portions are side-scrolling or overhead-behind. The player can now select their weapon configurations, which includes a weapon that locks onto airborne enemies. * Contra 4 (Nintendo DS) (2007) *: Developed by WayForward Technologies, the gameplay is displayed on two screens and the player's character now has a grappling hook that latches onto railings. The gameplay system is modeled after Contra III: The Alien Wars, with upgradeable weapons similar to Super Contra. It also features the return of the 3D view \\"tunnel\\" stages from the original Contra. The game has never been released in Europe. * Contra ReBirth (downloadable for Wii) (2009) *: Developed by M2 and published by Konami for WiiWare, this 2D side-scrolling game was released in May 2009 in Japan and features Bill Rizer and Genbei Yagyu from Neo Contra fighting off an alien invasion. It features hand-drawn sprite-based visuals, and has two unlockable characters as well as an unlockable \\"nightmare mode.\\" With the announcement of the closure of the Nintendo Wii Shop Channel in 2018, and discontinued in 2019, this game is no longer available for purchase or re-download. * Contra: The War of the Worlds (mobile) (2009) *: A mobile game developed by Konami's Chinese division. In this game the player fights alien intruders on the Moon. * Hard Corps: Uprising (downloadable for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360) (2011) *: The game was developed by Arc System Works and is the first Contra game without the \\"Contra\\" brand name in the title. It became available on Xbox Live Arcade on February 16, 2011, and was released on the PlayStation Network on March 15, 2011. It is a prequel to the original Contra. The player will play the role of Colonel Bahamut, the main antagonist from Contra: Hard Corps. Although the game was released with only two different characters to choose from (like most Contra games), Konami has released additional characters via DLC. * Contra: Evolution (Arcade, Android, iPhone, iPad) (2010) *: A remake of the original Contra was released in China on mobile phones (2010), based on an arcade version that would actually be released later (2011) and later ported to iOS systems in 2013. It features updated graphics, new characters to choose from, pay-to-play credits to buy extra lives, and bonus stages. * Contra 3D (Pachislot) *: Contra 3D is a pachislot game based on the Contra series and was released in Japan in 2013. * Neo Contra (Slot Machine) (Pachislot) *: Neo Contra (Slot Machine) is a Slot Machine game based on Neo Contra and was released in America in 2014. * Contra: Return (mobile) *: A free-to-play mobile game developed by Tencent and Konami and is exclusive to China in 2017. Its American release date is unknown, at the moment the game is under testing. At the time of the Chinese release, it was nominated for \\"Best Sound Design in a Casual/Social Game\\" and \\"Best Music in a Casual/Social Game\\" at the 16th Annual Game Audio Network Guild Awards. * Contra: Rogue Corps :Developed by Toylogic and published by Konami, Contra: Rogue Corps is a top-down isometric view run and gun game, taking place years after Contra III: The Alien Wars (1992), for release on September 24, 2019 for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. =Re-releases= The original arcade versions of Contra and Super Contra were ported to several computer platforms in North America and Europe during the late 1980s and 1990s. In North America, the original Contra and Super Contra (as Super C) were ported to DOS. A version of Super C was also released for the Amiga. Contra was released for the DOS, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum in Europe under the Gryzor title. As software emulation became more widespread, the classic Contra games, both arcade and console installments, are being made available in numerous formats such as downloadable game services like the Wii's Virtual Console and Xbox Live Arcade, video game compilations, stand-alone re-releases and even as unlockable games in newer installments. Mobile Phone versions have been produced as well. For more information, see each individual game page. =Cancelled games= *Contra Spirits and Super Contra (Sega CD and NEC TurboGrafx-CD) (Cancelled) *Contra Spirits 64 (Nintendo 64) (Cancelled) *: Originally announced in early 1997, this Nintendo 64 incarnation of the series was to be developed by Konami Computer Entertainment Osaka, but was later cancelled when the development team disbanded. *Contra (Nintendo GameCube) (Nintendo GameCube) (Cancelled) *: In 2002, a European division of Konami announced its development, but unwisely kept ‚Äúeverything‚Äù from the public. When nothing else turned up beyond this, a response from Konami basically unknown summed up its cancellation.https://spong.com/article/3176/Contra- announced-for-GameCube *The Definitive Contra (Nintendo GameCube) (Cancelled)http://www.ajworld.net/contra.html *Contra 3DS (Nintendo 3DS) (Cancelled)http://www.videogamecountdown.com/detail/Nintendo-3DS/Contra-3DS =In other media= * Contra is one of the video games featured in the manga titled Rock'n Game Boy, by Shigeto Ikehara and Published by Comic BomBom from October 1989 to December 1991. * Blades of Steel (Family Computer) - during the second intermission, either a video game will appear for Player One to play or a Konami ad will appear featuring a bear shooting the puck into a net mouthing the words \\"Nice Shot!\\" The video game is actually an advertisement for Contra and other Konami games. * Battlantis (Arcade) - Emperor Demon Gyaba appears as a major alien boss in a stage. * Konami Wai Wai World (Family Computer, Cell Phone) - although released a month before the Famicom version of Contra, the final boss theme in the game is the same one used in the original Contra. * Wai Wai World 2: SOS!! Parsley J≈ç (Family Computer, Wii U VC) - Bill Rizer appears as a playable character among other Konami characters. * Snatcher - in the English-language Mega-CD/Sega CD version, two characters masquerading as Bill and Lance appear at a Konami-themed costume party held in the Outer Heaven show pub. They are replaced by Light and Pastel from the TwinBee series in the PlayStation and Sega Saturn versions. However, in these versions, an ad for a Contra film is shown on a large monitor on a building in the Altamila (Alton Plaza) shopping center. * TwinBee PARADISE in Donburi Shima (PC) - Sheena, Brad Fang and Ray Poward from Contra: Hard Corps make a brief cameo in Wai Wai Arcade. * Nano Breaker (PlayStation 2) - Jaguar from Neo Contra appears as a hidden character. * Best Student Council - in the Konami-produced anime television series, Pucchan's other hand puppet friend in episode 19 is named after Lance Bean, a nod to the Contra character. * Power Pro Kun Pocket 8 (Nintendo DS) - one of the minigames is a Contra parody. * Silent Hill: Shattered Memories - late in the game, the player explores a movie theater which features several Konami arcade machines in the lobby, including the original Contra. * Rocket Knight - the ending, when playing as Gold Sparkster, features Bill Rizer shooting the Spread Gun at Gold Sparkster as he flies across the sky while saying his trademark line, \\"It's time for revenge\\". * Robot Chicken - an episode called \\"Catch Me If You Kangaroo Jack\\" spoofed the Contra video game segment. * Project X Zone 2 - one of Xiaomu's counterattack quotes is, \\"It's time for revenge. Let's attack aggressively!\\" * One of the video game characters in episode 2 from Spaceballs: The Animated Series, resembles Bill and Lance from Contra. While talking about Raccoon City, he is killed with a gunshot to the head by a character resembling Agent 47. Plot =Protagonists= The original Contra, and its initial sequels (Super Contra and Contra III: The Alien Wars) are set in the 27th century, and center around two commandos named Bill Rizer and Lance Bean, who are members of a special guerrilla task force codenamed \\"Contra\\" repeatedly sent to thwart an army of alien invaders seeking to destroy the Earth. Bill Rizer was named Nintendo Powers 17th favourite video game hero, due to his aptitude with saving the world. Some of the Contra games released after Contra III have deviated from this premise, such as Contra Force (which was set in the present day) and Contra: Hard Corps (which featured new heroes following the events of Contra III, as well as a human antagonist). However, the original Contra protagonist of Bill Rizer would not return in another game until Contra: Shattered Soldier, which brought back Bill Rizer (now a convicted war criminal) to fight against his former partner Lance, who has become a terrorist leader. Neo Contra also brought back Bill Rizer, however the character in this installment is revealed to be a clone of the original Bill, as the game is set in 4444, almost 1,800 years after Bill's last appearance in Shattered Soldier. Contra 4 brought back the original team of Bill and Lance by setting itself as a direct sequel to Contra III set before the events of Hard Corps and Shattered Soldier. ReBirth may be set in 2633, despite the fact that it takes place in an alternate timeline separate from the main series' original continuity. Hard Corps: Uprising is another prequel set twenty years before the events of the original Contra, which follows Bahamut, who was the villain in Hard Corps, as the protagonist. However, the developers said he could be a different person who only shares the same name. =Continuity differences= While the original Japanese version of the early Contra games (specifically the original Contra, Super Contra and Operation C), were set in the 27th century (in the years 2633, 2634, and 2635 in that order), the American versions of these games omitted this detail and the instruction manuals for these versions implied that the series was set during the present day. Contra III: The Alien Wars retains its futuristic setting of 2636 for its American release, but the identities of the two player characters, Bill Rizer and Lance Bean (the heroes from the previous installments), were changed to their descendants \\"Jimbo\\" and \\"Sully\\" in order to retain the continuity of the previous localizations. The American (and European) version of Contra: Shattered Soldier was the first Contra game overseas to follow the same continuity as its Japanese counterpart. \\"Mad Dog\\" and \\"Scorpion\\", originally the nicknames given to Bill and Lance in the NES versions of Contra and Super C, were made into separate characters in Contra 4. The enemy characters of the earlier games were also named differently in the American versions. Particularly \\"Red Falcon\\", originally the name of the terrorist army that was fought by the main characters in the first game (the Red Falcon Organization), became the name of the actual alien entity leader; thus \\"Red Falcon\\" became the name of the final boss fought at the end of Contra in which players fight both his alien body form and his heart. In Japan, these are intended to be two different entities: Emperor Demon Dragon God Java and Emperor Demon Evil Heart Gomera Mosking, respectively. The final boss of Super Contra (or the third to last boss in the NES Super C) and Contra III; is named Emperor Demon Gyaba in the original Japanese versions. Often mistaken as Red Falcon, his American name is referred to as Jagger Froid in the Super C instruction manual. The American Super C instruction manual also illustrates a common \\"running\\" alien enemy from its final stage as Red Falcon. The alien entity leader known as Red Falcon does not appear as an enemy in the Super Contra or Super C games. The antagonist of the Game Boy game Operation C, originally a nameless hostile nation seeking to develop alien-based weapons in the Japanese version, was changed to \\"Black Viper\\", another alien invader (the alien cell the player must destroy after thwarting the final security system is presumably Black Viper itself). In Contra 4, the final boss is actually Black Viper itself, who takes a form similar to Gyaba in the other games. Regional differences =Probotector= When Konami released the NES version of the original Contra in the PAL region (Europe and Australia) they modified the game by replacing the original main characters and most of the human enemies with robotic counterparts, retitling the game Probotector (a portmanteau of \\"Robot\\" and \\"Protector\\"), the latter move done probably to avoid any association with the Iran‚ÄìContra affair (the reason for which Super Contra's American title was shortened to Super C). The title referred to the two robotic soldiers, RD-008 and RC-011, who replaced Bill and Lance in this version. This was presumably done due to the German Federal Agency BPjM, which prohibited the sale and advertisement of media deemed too violent to children, including \\"content which glorifies war\\". While the original arcade games, as well as a few computer conversions under the Gryzor title, were released unchanged in Europe, subsequent console installments of the Contra series were released under the Probotector title in Europe. The original Probotector was followed by Probotector II: Return of the Evil Forces for the NES (originally Super C) and Super Probotector: Alien Rebels for the SNES (Contra III: The Alien Wars). The Contra games for the Game Boy (Operation C and the Game Boy version of Alien Wars) and Mega Drive (Contra: Hard Corps) were also released as Probotector titles in Europe. The series would revert to the Contra title in Europe beginning with Contra: Legacy of War for the PlayStation, retaining the human characters. However, Probotector II and Super Probotector were still released for the Wii Virtual Console in Europe and Australia like their original releases, with no \\"uncensored\\" versions available. Although Contra 4 was not released in Europe, the \\"Probotector\\" character appears in the game as a hidden character. Reception By the end of 1996, the Contra series had accumulated combined sales of over 4 million units worldwide.

In addition to playing the drums with the group, Chambers sings backing vocals (lead vocals on the song \\"Fast or Slow (The Law's the Law)\\", the B-side of the singles \\"2000 Miles\\" and \\"Show Me\\", which he also wrote) and plays percussion. He was part of the original band line-up which also included Chrissie Hynde (vocals/guitar), James Honeyman-Scott (guitar/vocals/keyboards) and Pete Farndon (bass guitar/vocals). Hynde and Chambers are the only two surviving original members, and he has served two separate tenures with the group. Career Prior to joining the as yet unnamed Pretenders, Chambers played with James Honeyman-Scott in Cheeks, a band led by former Mott the Hoople keyboardist Verden Allen. At the time Chambers joined the yet unnamed band in 1978, he was working as a driving instructor in Tufnell Park, London where he had got a job with the British School of Motoring \\"because it came with a car so I could get about\\" and because of that he found where Jim and Pete were living and then replaced Jerry Mackleduff on drums (Uncut, 1999). At Chambers's first rehearsal with the group, Hynde recalled: \\"We plugged in and started playing \\"Precious\\", and I remember clearly, I had to turn around and face the wall, I was laughing so hard, because as soon as Martin started playing with us, I knew this was it. We had the band.\\" (Uncut, 1999). Martin also recalled the rehearsal \\"We knew it straight away. We just locked in.\\" (Rhino Entertainment Company, 2006). In the Autumn of 1981, The Pretenders cancelled their US+Canada Tour as Chambers had cut his hand, and the injury was so bad that he couldn‚Äôt play for a number of weeks. The band decided to postpone the tour rather than replace Chambers. Chambers proved to be a versatile drummer within the group, with a hard- hitting style that is evident on songs such as \\"Middle of the Road\\". Guitarist Adam Seymour has acknowledged that \\"there's a definite thing going on in the rhythm between Chrissie's guitar and Martin's drums that you would need a scientific equation to explain. Martin kind of pulls back on the beat while Chrissie's pushing it forward.\\" (Rhino Entertainment Company, 2006). Chambers' first tenure with the group lasted from mid-1978 until the mid-1980s. Coping with the death of bandmates Honeyman-Scott and Farndon proved difficult, and his consequent lack of enthusiasm resulted in his departure from the group during the Get Close sessions. According to Hynde, \\"I felt his playing had deteriorated. I think he was still very traumatized by [the loss of] Pete and Jimmy.\\" (Uncut, 1999) Martin concurred, admitting \\"I wasn't really into it to be honest.\\" Chambers rejoined the group in 1994 during the sessions for Last of the Independents, and has been with the group ever since (Uncut, 1999). When he rejoined, Seymour recalled \\"When Martin sat down, it began to feel like a real band.\\" Martin summed up his reunion with the group, saying: \\"at the end of the day [Chrissie] asked me back because no one could make it work quite like we did.\\" (Rhino Entertainment Company, 2006) Hynde concurred, saying: \\"I missed him terribly. ... Both he and I were floundering‚Äîand probably not playing well‚Äîand I needed someone to kick me in the ass and inspire me. We went through one song and it was the same buzz as when we first played together. No one has that swing and feel.\\" (Hot Press, 1994). In late 2008, The Pretenders released the album Break Up the Concrete with Chambers being replaced by Jim Keltner, although Chambers remained an official member and played with the band on live dates. In addition to playing with the Pretenders, Chambers also plays in the band Miss World fronted by songwriter Jonathan Perkins, who had worked with artists such as XTC and Original Mirrors. In late September and early October 2009, Chambers sat in on drums for the seven Mott the Hoople reunion shows (2 in Monmouth and 5 at Hammersmith Odeon) alongside former Cheeks bandmate Verden Allen due to the illness of Dale Griffin who had loaned Chambers his kit for his first live show in 1967 at St. Mary's Church Hall, Ross on Wye, Herefordshire.

After a number of second-team appearances the previous year, Mirza made his first- class debut in Worcestershire's drawn game against Pakistan A at New Road in July 1997.

It is based on the 2000 book of the same name written by James Bradley and Ron Powers about the 1945 Battle of Iwo Jima, the five Marines and one Navy corpsman who were involved in raising the flag on Iwo Jima, and the aftereffects of that event on their lives. Until June 23, 2016, Bradley's father John Bradley, Navy corpsman, was misidentified as being one of the figures who raised the second flag, and incorrectly depicted on the memorial as the third bronze statue from the base of the flagstaff with the 32-foot (9.8-m) bronze statues of the other five flag-raisers on the monument.USMC Statement on Marine Corps Flag Raisers , Office of U.S. Marine Corps Communication, 23 June 2016 The film is taken from the American viewpoint of the Battle of Iwo Jima, while its companion film, Letters from Iwo Jima, which Eastwood also directed, is from the Japanese viewpoint of the battle. Although it was a box office failure, only grossing $65.9 million against a $90 million budget, the film received favorable reviews from critics. The companion film Letters from Iwo Jima was released in Japan on December 9, 2006, and in the United States on December 20, 2006, two months after the release of Flags of Our Fathers on October 20, 2006. Plot As three US servicemen ‚Äì Marine Private First Class Ira Hayes, Private First Class Rene Gagnon, and Navy Corpsman John \\"Doc\\" Bradley ‚Äì are feted as heroes in a war bond drive, they reflect on their experiences via flashback. After training at Camp Tarawa in Hawaii, the 28th Marine Regiment 5th Marine Division sails to invade Iwo Jima. The Navy bombards suspected Japanese positions for three days. Sergeant Mike Strank is put in charge of Second Platoon. The next day, February 19, 1945, the Marines land in Higgins boats and LVTs. The beaches are silent and Private First Class Ralph \\"Iggy\\" Ignatowski wonders if the defenders are all dead before Japanese heavy artillery and machine guns open fire on the advancing Marines and the Navy ships. Casualties are heavy, but the beaches are secured. Two days later, the Marines attack Mount Suribachi under a rain of Japanese artillery and machine gun fire, as the Navy bombards the mountain. Doc saves the lives of several Marines under fire, which later earns him the Navy Cross. The mountain is eventually secured. On February 23, the platoon under command of Sergeant Hank Hansen reaches the top of Mount Suribachi and hoists the United States flag to cheers from the beaches and the ships. Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal, who witnesses the flag raising as he lands on the beach, requests the flag for himself. Colonel Chandler Johnson decides his 2nd Battalion deserves the flag more. Rene is sent up with Second Platoon to replace the first flag with a second one for Forrestal to take. Mike, Doc, Ira, Rene, and two other Marines (Corporal Harlon Block and Private First Class Franklin Sousley) are photographed by Joe Rosenthal as they raise the second flag. On March 1, the Second Platoon is ambushed from a Japanese machine gun nest. During the fight over the nest, Mike is hit by a U.S. Navy shell and dies from his wounds. Later that day, Hank is shot in the chest and dies, and Harlon is killed by machine gun fire. Two nights later, while Doc is helping a wounded Marine, Iggy is abducted by Japanese troops and dragged into a tunnel. Doc finds his viciously mangled body a few days later. On March 21, Franklin is killed by machine gun fire and dies in Ira's arms. Of the eight men in the squad, only three are left: Doc, Ira, and Rene. A few days after Franklin's death, Doc is wounded by artillery fire while trying to save a fellow corpsman. He survives and is sent back home. On March 26, the battle ends and the U.S. Marines are victorious. After the battle, the press gets hold of Rosenthal's photograph. It is a huge morale booster and becomes famous. Rene is asked to name the six men in the photo; he identifies himself, Mike, Doc, and Franklin, but misidentifies Harlon as Hank. Rene eventually names Ira as the sixth man, even after Ira threatens to kill him for doing so. Doc, Ira, and Rene are sent home as part of the seventh bond tour. When they arrive to a hero's welcome in Washington, DC, Doc notices that Hank's mother is on the list of mothers of the dead flag raisers. Ira angrily denounces the bond drive as a farce. The men are reprimanded by Bud Gerber of the Treasury Department, who tells them that the country cannot afford the war and if the bond drive fails, the U.S. will abandon the Pacific and their sacrifices will be for nothing. The three agree not to tell anyone that Hank was not in the photograph. As the three are sent around the country to raise money and make speeches, Ira is guilt-ridden, faces discrimination as a Native American, and descends into alcoholism. After he throws up one night in front of General Alexander Vandegrift, commandant of the Marine Corps, he is sent back to his unit and the bond drive continues without him. After the war, the three survivors return to their homes. Ira still struggles with alcoholism and is never able to escape his unwanted fame. One day after being released from jail, he hitchhikes over 1,300 miles to Texas to see Harlon Block's family. He tells Harlon's father that his son was indeed at the base of the flag in the photograph. In 1954, the USMC War Memorial is dedicated and the three flag raisers see each other one last time. In 1955, Ira dies of exposure after a night of drinking. That same year, Doc drives to the town where Iggy's mother lives to tell her how Iggy died, though it is implied that he does not tell her the truth. Rene attempts a business career, but finds that the opportunities and offers he received during the bond drive are rescinded. He spends the rest of his life as a janitor. Doc, by contrast, is successful, buying a funeral home. In 1994, on his deathbed, he tells his story to his son, James, and in a final flashback to 1945, the men swim in the ocean after raising the flags.

Producer Steven Spielberg brought William Broyles to write the first drafts of the script, before director Clint Eastwood brought Paul Haggis to rewrite. In the process of reading about the Japanese perspective of the war, in particular General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, Eastwood decided to film a companion piece with Letters from Iwo Jima, which was shot entirely in Japanese. Bradley Cooper auditioned for one of the leading roles. Flags of Our Fathers was shot in the course of 58 days. Jared Leto was originally cast as Rene Gagnon but had to back out due to a tour commitment with his band, Thirty Seconds to Mars. Flags of Our Fathers cost $55 million, although it was originally budgeted at $80 million. Variety subsequently downgraded the price tag to $55 million. Although the film is taken from the American viewpoint of the battle, it was filmed almost entirely in Iceland and Southern California, with a few scenes shot in Chicago. Shooting ended early 2006, before production for Letters from Iwo Jima began in March 2006. Release =Critical reception= On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 73% based on 196 reviews, with an average rating of 7.01/10. The site's consensus states: \\"Flags of Our Fathers is both a fascinating look at heroism, both earned and manufactured, and a well-filmed salute to the men who fought at the battle of Iwo Jima.\\" On Metacritic, the film scored a 79 out of 100 based on 39 reviews, indicating \\"Generally favorable reviews.\\" The film made the top-10 list of the National Board of Review. Eastwood also earned a Golden Globe nomination for directing. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards ‚Äî for Best Sound (John T. Reitz, David E. Campbell, Gregg Rudloff, and Walt Martin) and Sound Editing. Film critic Richard Roeper said, \\"Clint Eastwood's Flags of Our Fathers stands with the Oscar-winning Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby as an American masterpiece. It is a searing and powerful work from a 76-year-old artist who remains at the top of his game... [and] Flags of Our Fathers is a patriotic film in that it honors those who fought in the Pacific, but it is also patriotic because it questions the official version of the truth, and reminds us that superheroes exist only in comic books and cartoon movies.\\" =Top ten lists= Flags of Our Fathers was listed on numerous critics' top ten lists for 2006. * 1st ‚Äì Kenneth Turan, Los Angeles Times (tied with Letters from Iwo Jima) * 1st ‚Äì Michael Wilmington, Chicago Tribune * 1st ‚Äì Kirk Honeycutt, The Hollywood Reporter * 1st ‚Äì Stephen Hunter, The Washington Post * 2nd ‚Äì Scott Foundas, L.A.

Its companion film Letters From Iwo Jima was more profitable with a box office run of $71 million on a budget of $19 million. =Spike Lee controversy= At the 2008 Cannes Film Festival, director Spike Lee, who was making Miracle at St. Anna, about an all-black U.S. division fighting in Italy during World War II, criticized director Clint Eastwood for not depicting black Marines in Flags of Our Fathers.Eliot (2009), p.322-323 Citing historical accuracy, Eastwood responded that his film was specifically about the Marines who raised the flag on Mount Suribachi at Iwo Jima, pointing out that while black Marines did fight at Iwo Jima, the U.S. military was segregated during World War II, and none of the men who raised the flag were black. Eastwood believed Lee was using the comments to promote Miracle at St. Anna and angrily said that Lee should \\"shut his face\\". Lee responded that Eastwood was acting like an \\"angry old man\\", and argued that despite making two Iwo Jima films back to back, Letters from Iwo Jima and Flags of Our Fathers, \\"there was not one black Marine in both of those films\\". Contrary to Lee's claims, however, black Marines (including an all-black unit) are seen in several scenes during which the mission is outlined, as well as during the initial landings, when a wounded black Marine is carried away. During the end credits, historical photographs taken during the Battle of Iwo Jima show black Marines. Although black Marines fought in the battle, they were restricted to auxiliary roles, such as ammunition supply, and were not involved in the battle's major assaults; they did, however, take part in defensive actions. According to Alexander M. Bielakowski and Raffaele Ruggeri, \\"Half a million African Americans served overseas during World War II, almost all in segregated second-line units.\\"\\"African American Troops in World War II\\". Alexander M. Bielakowski, Raffaele Ruggeri (2005). p.4. The number of African Americans killed in action was 708.Michael Clodfelter.

Spielberg later intervened between the two directors, after which Lee sent a copy of a film on which he was working to Eastwood for a private screening as a seeming token of apology.

The Waverley route of the North British Railway runs down the dale, and the Catrail, or Picts' Dyke, crosses its head. Liddesdale was also a historic district of Scotland, bordering Teviotdale to the east, Annandale to the west and Tweeddale to the north, with the English county of Cumberland across the border to the south. The area which was in the Sheriffdom of Roxburgh and later became part of the County of Roxburgh, one of the counties of Scotland. The main reorganisation took place during the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, this Act established a uniform system of county councils and town councils in Scotland and restructured many of Scotland‚Äôs counties. (See: History of local government in the United Kingdom) Liddesdale is sometimes considered to form the northern end of the Maiden Way Roman road. At one time the points of vantage on the river and its affluents were occupied by freebooters' peel towers, but many of them have disappeared and the remainder are in decay. Larriston Tower belonged to the Elliots, Mangerton, now little more than a site, to the Armstrongs and Park to \\"Little Jock Elliot\\", the outlaw who nearly killed Bothwell in an encounter in 1566. Hollows Tower, Johnnie Armstrong's peel, is in good condition; it is on the A7, about south of Langholm. Ettleton cemetery, near Newcastleton The chief point of interest in the valley, however, is Hermitage Castle, a massive H-shaped fortress of enormous strength, one of the oldest surviving castles in Scotland. It stands on a hill overlooking Hermitage Water, a tributary of the Liddel. It was built in 1244 by Nicholas de Soulis, and was captured by the English in David II's reign. It was retaken by Sir William Douglas, who received a grant of it from the king. In 1492 Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus, exchanged it for Bothwell Castle on the Clyde with Patrick Hepburn, 1st Earl of Bothwell. It finally passed to the Duke of Buccleuch, under whose care further ruin was arrested. It was here that Sir Alexander Ramsay of Dalhousie was starved to death by Sir William Douglas in 1342, and that James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, was visited by Mary, Queen of Scots, after the assault referred to previously. To the east of the castle is Ninestane Rig, a hill high, long and broad. Here it is said that William de Soulis, hated for oppression and cruelty, was (in 1320) boiled by his vassals in a copper cauldron, which was supported on two of the nine stones which composed the \\"Druidical\\" circle that gave the ridge its name. Only five of the stones remain. James Telfer (1802-1862), the writer of ballads, who was born in the parish of Southdean (pronounced Soudan), was for several years schoolmaster of Saughtree, near the head of the valley. The castle of the lairds of Liddesdale stood near the junction of Hermitage Water and the Liddel, and around it grew up the village of Newcastleton.

Shute, 499 U.S. 585 (1991), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that United States federal courts will enforce forum selection clauses so long as the clause is not unreasonably burdensome to the party seeking to escape it.. Background The plaintiffs, Eulala and Russel Shute, were passengers on a cruise ship operated by the defendant, Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. The Shutes had bought tickets in Washington and signed a contract, with a forum selection clause mandating that injured parties would sue in Florida, to the exclusion of all other jurisdictions. The plaintiffs boarded the cruise ship in California, and one was injured in international waters off the coast of Mexico. The plaintiffs then filed a lawsuit in Washington, in violation of the contract clause. The defendant sought summary judgment based on: # the forum selection clause, and # a lack of minimum contacts between the defendant and the forum state The trial court dismissed based solely on the lack of sufficient contacts. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed because the cruise line had reached into Washington via advertising, and held that but for the defendant's solicitation, there would be no cause of action. The Court of Appeals also held that forum selection clause was void because of unequal bargaining power between the parties, and because it would be an undue hardship for the Shutes to have to go all the way to Florida to sue. This decision was appealed to the Supreme Court based on that court's Admiralty jurisdiction. Opinion of the Court The Court, in an opinion by Justice Blackmun, held that forum selection clauses were generally enforceable in federal courts so long as they are \\"fundamentally fair\\", and that therefore the Shutes were held to the contract printed on the back of their ticket. The Court noted that Florida is not a random jurisdiction - Carnival is headquartered there and does much business there, and Washington does not necessarily make sense in the context of an accident off the coast of Mexico on a ship that left from California. The hardship on the plaintiffs mattered little, as they had bought the ticket, and no one forced them to go on a cruise. On the other hand, it made sense for the cruise industry, which carries passengers from all over, to have a single forum for lawsuits. The cruise line will thereby avoid defending itself in many different courts, which will save money, which the Court believes will translate to cheaper tickets. =Dissent= Justice Stevens filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Marshall. Justice Stevens had several reasons for dissenting, including objections to contracts of adhesion created by parties who have unequal bargaining power, the fact that the notice of the forum selection clause was not made available to the purchaser until after payment was tendered and a lack of an opportunity for refunds at the point when the forum selection clause was disclosed. Justice Stevens attached a copy of the original ticket to his dissent to show how only the most meticulous passenger would notice the clause and that notice might be in contention.

In September 1981, Campbell became the 16th person in San Francisco to be diagnosed with Kaposi's sarcoma, when that was a proxy for an AIDS diagnosis. He was the first to come out publicly as a person with what came to be known as AIDS, writing a regular column in the San Francisco Sentinel, syndicated nationwide, describing his experiences Via the Online Searchable Obituary Database of the GLBT Historical Society and posting photos of his KS lesions to help other San Franciscans know what to look for,Interview with Helen Schietinger, nurse coordinator of UCSF's first AIDS clinic, on January 30, 1995, by Sally Smith Hughes ‚Äî in as well as helping write the first San Francisco safer sex manual.Interview with Helen Schietinger, nurse coordinator of UCSF's first AIDS clinic, on January 30, 1995, by Sally Smith Hughes ‚Äî in He rapidly became one of the leading activists co-founding People With AIDS San Francisco in 1982 and then, the following year, with HIV+ men from across the U.S., he co-wrote the Denver Principles, the defining manifesto of the People With AIDS Self-Empowerment Movement. Appearing on the cover of Newsweek and being interviewed on national news reports, Via the Online Searchable Obituary Database of the GLBT Historical Society Campbell raised the national profile of the AIDS crisis among heterosexuals and provided a recognizable face of the epidemic for affected communities. He also lobbied Margaret Heckler, Secretary of Health and Human Services in the Reagan administration over both practical issues and stigmatising medical practices affecting people with AIDS. He also continued to campaign for LGBT+ rights, speaking outside the 1984 Democratic National Convention a month before his death from cryptosporidiosis.  Before the AIDS crisis  Born in Georgia in 1952 and raised in Tacoma, Washington, Bobbi Campbell earned a degree in nursing from the University of Washington and volunteered at The Seattle Counseling Services for Sexual Minorities, the first gay-run counseling service for gay people in the country, while being politically active in Seattle during the city's initial wave of gay liberation in the 1970s. He lived communally in Capitol Hill with other gay male activists at what was known informally as the \\"East John Street Gay Men's Collective\\", described by his former lover Tom Richards as \\"a notorious and famous house with colorful and smart people.\\"Mentioned in an interview with Tom Richards by Charlie Fuchs and Larry Knopp of the Northwest Lesbian and Gay History Museum Project in July 2000, cited in a footnote from page 299 of Atkins's book Gay Seattle: Stories of Exile and Belonging. Campbell moved from Seattle to San Francisco in 1975, getting a job in a hospital near The Castro and immersing himself in the political and social life of the community, which had become a center for the LGBT community over the previous few years. By 1981, he had enrolled in a training program at University of California, San Francisco, to become an adult health nurse practitioner, with a view to focusing on healthcare in the gay and lesbian community. Cited in Wright (2013), Am J Pub Health.  Diagnosis and local activism  Starting with a case of shingles in February 1981, Audio embedded in: Bobbi Campbell suffered a succession of unusual illnesses, including leukopenia later that summer. After hiking the Pinnacles National Monument with his boyfriend in September that year, he noticed on his feet lesions of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), then thought of as a rare cancer of elderly Jewish men but with alarming numbers of cases appearing in California and New York City and now known to be closely associated with AIDS. He was formally diagnosed as having KS by dermatologist Marcus Conant on October 8, 1981. This would become Conant's first diagnosis of a patient with what would become known as AIDS; Campbell brought Conant a rose every year to commemorate the anniversary of his diagnosis. While the New York Native was printing several stories about the \\"gay cancer\\" beginning to make its way round the city, with detailed medical writing by Lawrence D. Mass, a gay physician and psychiatrist, the San Francisco gay press largely ignored the nascent epidemic. Campbell's interest in educational outreach and professional interest in gay sexual health combined to inspire him to raise awareness himself. As a result, in October 1981, the same month he was diagnosed, Campbell put pictures of his KS lesions in the window of the Star Pharmacy at 498 Castro Street, urging men with similar lesions to seek medical attention. In doing so, he created and displayed San Francisco's first AIDS poster. After speaking with Randy Alfred, a friend and editor of the San Francisco Sentinel, Campbell agreed to write a column \\"to demystify the AIDS story\\". In his first article, on December 10, 1981, he proclaimed himself to be the \\"KS Poster Boy\\" (later \\"AIDS Poster Boy\\"), becoming the first person in the US to publicly disclose that he was suffering from \\"gay cancer\\", writing: This article turned into a regular column in the Sentinel ‚Äî and syndicated in newspapers serving the LGBT community nationwide ‚Äî describing his experiences. On January 10, 1982, Campbell was interviewed by Alfred for The Gay Life program on KSAN-FM, with doctors Marcus Conant and Paul Volberding; the interview has been archived by the GLBT Historical Society.The GLBT Historical Society's \\"Gayback Machine \\" search does not produce persistent URLs, but searching for \\"Bobbi Campbell\\" in 1981 will bring up the appropriate episode, dated 1982-01-10 and captioned \\"Marcus Conant, M.D. and Paul Volberding, M.D., U.C. San Francisco Medical School; Bobbi Campbell, Kaposi's Sarcoma cancer patient.\\" It is also available offline as Reel 118, Box 16 from Randy Alfred subject files and sound recordings, collection 1991-24, GLBT Historical Society. Campbell joined the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence at the time of the health crisis in early 1982; in his \\"sister\\" persona as Sister Florence Nightmare RN, he co-authored the first San Francisco safer sex manual, Play Fair!, written in plain sex-positive language, using humor to leaven practical advice. The Sisters were early awareness and fundraisers for the oncoming AIDS pandemic and continue to raise awareness of sexual health; many Orders regularly pass out condoms and participate in events to educate people on sexual health issues. In February 1982, on the invitation of Conant and Volberding, Campbell and Dan Turner, who had just himself been diagnosed with KS, attended what turned out to be the founding meeting of the KS/AIDS Foundation, which later became the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, of which Campbell then served on the board. Campbell also became involved with the Shanti Project (which moved from its original focus, supporting people with terminal cancer, to help provide emotional support to people diagnosed with AIDS coming to terms with death)Interview with Michael Helquist, journalist of the early AIDS epidemic in San Francisco, on March 24, 1995, by Sally Smith Hughes ‚Äî in Interview with Helen Schietinger, nurse coordinator of UCSF's first AIDS clinic, on January 30, 1995, by Sally Smith Hughes ‚Äî in and persuaded reluctant physicians to allow him to meet and counsel AIDS patients at Conant's KS clinic.  The People With AIDS Movement  In 1982, Campbell and Turner convened a meeting that spawned People With AIDS San Francisco, founding the \\"People With AIDS Self-Empowerment Movement\\" or PWA Movement, rapidly followed by Michael Callen and Richard Berkowitz, authors of How to Have Sex in an Epidemic, in New York City. As well as arguing that people with AIDS should expect to participate actively in the response to the AIDS crisis, the PWA Movement rejected the terms \\"AIDS victim\\" and \\"AIDS patient,\\" as Campbell explained in interviews, for example: With other members of People With AIDS San Francisco, Campbell organized the first candlelight march to bring attention to the plight of people with AIDS and to remember those who had died of AIDS. On May 2, 1983, they marched behind a banner of \\"Fighting for our lives\\" for the first time, drawing around 10,000 people. On May 23, 1983, People With AIDS San Francisco voted to send Campbell and Turner to the Fifth National Lesbian and Gay Health Conference, at which the Second National AIDS Forum would be held. Campbell and his colleagues' push to persuade service organizations to sponsor gay men with AIDS to attend the Conference was a key moment in the People With AIDS Self-Empowerment Movement. Michael Callen subsequently wrote that, despite a growing sense of being patronised, it had not occurred to the AIDS-diagnosed New Yorkers to \\"be anything more than the passive recipients of the genuine care and concern\\"; once people with AIDS realised they could advocate for themselves, lessons learned from the feminist and the civil rights movement helped with a more-widespread acceptance of the notion of self-empowerment. The national PWA movement came fully together when Campbell took charge of a discussion where, with Callen, Turner and others,Those in attendance included: * From San Francisco: Bobbi Campbell, Dan Turner (1948‚Äì90), Bobby Reynolds (died 1987) and Michael Helquist representing his recently-deceased partner Mark Feldman * From New York City: Phil Lanzaratta (died 1986), Michael Callen (1955‚Äì93), Richard Berkowitz, Artie Felson, Bill Burke, Bob Cecchi (1942‚Äì91), Matthew Sarner M.S.W., Tom Nasrallah * From Los Angeles: Gar Traynor Plus \\"someone named Elbert from Kansas City by way of Houston; and one individual from Denver whose name we unfortunately cannot recall\\". (See \\"Remembering Bobbi Campbell\\" from The Daily Seyahatname and \\"A History of the PWA Self-Empowerment Movement\\" by Callen and Turner.) he drafted the Denver Principles, the defining manifesto of the PWA Movement, which, again, start with the rejection of the terms \\"victim\\" and \\"patient.\\" Campbell and the San Franciscans had different thoughts on the origin (etiology) of AIDS from Callen and the New Yorkers ‚Äî Campbell described as \\"crazy\\" the idea that AIDS was caused by promiscuity, a perspective espoused by Callen and Berkowitz (and their physician Joseph Sonnabend) at the time Linked from ‚Äî and the Denver Principles represent a \\"careful synthesis\\" of these two positions:As Joe Wright explained in footnote 63 to his 2013 article in American Journal of Public Health: \\"For example, the 'recommendations for all people' would have been easy points of agreement; the last of the 'recommendations for people with AIDS,' on sexual ethics, underlines their agreements about safe sex but without delving into the language of 'promiscuity' or its rebuttals; and the second recommendation for health care providers appears to be a gentle assertion of Callen's concerns about etiology, while the third likely reflects Campbell's own approach to how to be a clinician, and would have been the sort of instruction a progressive nursing educator might have given at the time.\\" The activists ‚Äî in an echo of the Lavender Menace radical feminists storming the NOW convention stage in 1970 ‚Äî decided to storm the stage of the closing session of the Second National AIDS Forum in order to present the Denver Principles. As each of the 11 men read out one of the 11 statements, they did so with the \\"Fighting for our lives\\" banner behind them, from the San Francisco march earlier that month; these words became the slogan of the PWA Movement. After the conference, Campbell flew to New York with Callen, Berkowitz and Artie Felson, organizing and planning for local and national PWA organizations on the plane. On arrival, they organized a PWA organization in the city despite initial opposition from the Gay Men's Health Crisis. They also planned a national PWA organization which opened in New York City in June 1984. PWA-New York went on to create the first safer sex poster to appear in a gay bathhouse in the city. In June 1984, the annual San Francisco's Gay Freedom Day Parade was dedicated for the first time to people with AIDS. Dykes on Bikes have led the parade since the mid-1970s and People With AIDS followed immediately behind.  Wider activism  Initially, there was very little coverage of the AIDS crisis outside the gay community ‚Äî while 1982 saw 800 reported cases and 350 AIDS-related deaths in the USA, there were only 6 stories about AIDS on major network news and print media up to May 1983 included little coverage beyond the gay press and the San Francisco Chronicle ‚Äî Lawrence Altman, medical writer at The New York Times had a piece refused in 1981, and Jerry Bishop, a science writer at The Wall Street Journal, had a piece on AIDS refused by his editor in early 1982, whereas the Chronicle hired Randy Shilts to report on AIDS full-time in 1982. Campbell and Conant featured in the earliest nationally-broadcast news reports on the \\"gay cancer\\" on June 12, 1982, where Barry Petersen interviewed Campbell, Larry Kramer and James Curran, who led the CDC taskforce, for CBS News. After being criticized for omitting any coverage of a Madison Square Garden benefit in April 1983, The New York Times increased its coverage of AIDS, setting the tone for an increase across print media. One of the most high-profile early pieces introducing AIDS to the heterosexual community was the cover article of the August 8, 1983, edition of Newsweek, showing Campbell and his lover Bobby Hilliard and headlined \\"EPIDEMIC: The Mysterious and Deadly Disease Called AIDS May Be the Public Health Threat of the Century. How Did it Start? Can it Be Stopped?\\" ‚Äî only the second time an openly gay man had appeared on the cover of a mass-market news magazine, albeit with Hilliard identified as Campbell's \\"friend.\\" The following week, with Callen, Berkowitz, Felson and Turner, he met with Margaret Heckler, Secretary of Health and Human Services in the Reagan administration. They found Heckler to be receptive to suggestions and, when Campbell pushed the issue of delays in people with AIDS's claims for Social Security, she promised to raise it with her counterpart at the Social Security Administration. At the first Clinical Nursing Conference on AIDS, in Washington, D.C. on October 7, 1983, Campbell presented a poster session, \\"dressed for the part\\" in white pants and a lab coat. The poster session was designed to help clinicians and nurses understand the message of the Denver Principles, about respect for people with AIDS, rather than considering them as \\"victims.\\" While at the conference, he attended a talk by an infection control nurse at the National Institutes of Health where he discovered the agency's \\"maximum awareness\\" policy recommended the use of electric green \\"AIDS Precaution\\" tags on AIDS patients' rooms, blood tubes and laundry. With Artie Felson, he shouted his disgust at the \\"creepy\\" policy from the back of the room and arranged an impromptu meeting of the National Association of People With AIDS, where they decided to pay visit to Heckler at her office in Bethesda, Maryland. They spoke with Shelley Lengel, a spokesperson for the new National AIDS Helpline, however Lengel did not call them back with further information about the policy. In January 1984, when Dan White, the assassin of gay San Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone, was due to be paroled, Campbell and Hilliard stood outside Soledad State Prison. As White had been transported to Los Angeles for fear of retributive attacks, attendant media had little to cover beyond Campbell with a sign reading \\"Dan White's homophobia is more deadly than AIDS,\\" bringing further national attention to the health crisis. Later that year, Campbell traveled with Angie Lewis to New Orleans for the annual convention of the American Nursing Association in June, where they gave a 45-minute or hour-long presentation ‚Äî possibly a plenary session ‚Äî about AIDS and HIV, having been invited at the last minute; Lewis suggested this may have been because the ANA were unsure about hosting the session.Interview with Angie Lewis, nurse educator in the San Francisco AIDS epidemic, on June 29, 1995, by Sally Smith Hughes ‚Äî in Campbell gave one of his last speeches at the National March for Lesbian and Gay Rights when the 1984 Democratic National Convention was held in San Francisco in July. He was introduced as a feminist, a registered Democrat and a Person With AIDS; he had served as a board director of the National AIDS Foundation and on the steering committee of the Federation of AIDS-related Organizations, founded the National Association of People With AIDS and testified in front of Congressional subcommittees. Campbell told the crowd that he had hugged his boyfriend on the cover of Newsweek, and then kissed Hilliard on stage \\"to show Middle America that gay love is beautiful,\\" criticizing the Christian right for using scripture to justify their homophobia. After criticising the lack of progress being made by the Reagan administration, he held 15 seconds of silence for the 2,000 who had died of AIDS at that point \\"and [for] those who will die before this is over,\\" before laying out a series of concerns for politicians to address ‚Äî including increased funding for both research and support services and a warning of the potential for discrimination with the advent of a test for HTLV-3 (now known as HIV) ‚Äî and appealing to all candidates in the upcoming elections to meet with people with AIDS. Two weeks later, Campbell appeared on CBS Evening News in a live satellite interview with Dan Rather. While the rumors and fear of AIDS had reached a mainstream audience, the facts had not yet, so Campbell was placed in a glass booth, with technicians refusing to come near him to wire up microphones for the interview.  Death and legacy  NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt in front of the Washington Monument A few days after the DNC speech, another case of shingles left scars across his head; within weeks he was hospitalized with cryptosporidiosis and subsequently cryptococcal meningitis. At noon on August 15, 1984, exactly a month after his DNC speech and after 2 days on life support in intensive care, Campbell died at San Francisco General Hospital when his blood pressure dropped rapidly. His parents and his partner Bobby Hilliard were by his side. Campbell was 32 years old and had lived for over 3¬Ω years with AIDS. Two days later, the city closed Castro Street for Campbell's funeral cort√®ge, where 1,000 people gathered to remember Campbell. A \\"reverential chant\\" by the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence was followed by several speeches, including Conant and Hilliard as well as Campbell's parents and local performers (including Lea DeLaria and Holly Near) and an audio recording of Paul Boneberg introducing Campbell at the National March for Lesbian and Gay Rights a month earlier. In his August 23 obituary in the Bay Area Reporter, Allen White described the event as \\"exactly what should be expected to remember a hero in a crisis.\\" The Gay Life radio show on KSAN-FM, presented by Randy Alfred, Campbell's editor at the Sentinel, covered his memorial across two weeks, on September 16 and 23, 1984. His body was taken back to Washington state and interred at New Tacoma Cemetery in Tacoma, Washington. Campbell had kept a journal throughout his life; Angie Lewis arranged for the journal to be donated to the UCSF Archives and Special Collections. The 1985 Lesbian/Gay Freedom Day Parade was dedicated to Campbell, \\"for the work he did as a Person With AIDS, and as a symbol for all of us who continue to fight against the threat that AIDS poses to our survival.\\" In 2015, the group \\"Let's Kick ASS‚ÄîAIDS Survivor Syndrome\\" were looking to have a commemorative plaque erected at the site of the Star Pharmacy (now a Walgreens), where Campbell first put up images of his KS lesions. Bobbi Campbell is memorialized on 4 separate panels of the NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt. In the 1993 docudrama TV movie And the Band Played On, adapted from Randy Shilts's book of the same name about the early days of the AIDS crisis, Campbell was played by Donal Logue. Campbell was portrayed by Kevin McHale in the 2017 docudrama miniseries When We Rise written by Dustin Lance Black to chronicle the gay rights movement. The name \\"Bobbi Campbell\\" and the names of several other key figures of the time were featured in the American Mock Trial Association's 2007‚Äì08 National Case Problem, albeit in a fictional case, unrelated to Campbell's life.

Frank Aiken was commander and P√°draig Quinn was the quartermaster general. John McCoy was Adjutant General for the division. After McCoy was shot and captured by British Crown forces in 1921, Se√°n F. Quinn, P√°draig's brother, took over the position. At the outbreak of the Civil War, the Fourth Northern Division was neutral and in control of the Dundalk military barracks after the British Army vacated it on 13 April 1922. Aiken was in Dublin with Richard Mulcahy (Chief of Staff of the IRA until the split), arguing against the Free State taking military action against a large anti-treaty IRA force which had taken over the Four Courts. Mulcahy ordered Aiken back to Dundalk. On 4 July, Aiken wrote to Mulcahy stating the Fourth Northern Division would stay neutral, called for an end to the fighting and for the removal of the Oath of Allegiance from the Treaty because \\"you have the simple national abhorrence of swearing allegiance to a foreign king and allowing part of the Nation to be ruled by people who have a sworn loyalty to that king.\\"Eoin Neeson.

The following day Mulcahy's men came as friends to Dundalk and captured Aiken's barracks through a breach of faith, and Aiken and his officers and men were imprisoned in Dundalk jail. On 27 July, John McCoy led a small unit that attacked Dundalk, breached the prison wall with dynamite, and in fifteen minutes captured the garrison of 300 men and arms for 400. There no casualties during the jail break. A number of escaping divisional members were recaptured by Free State forces, including John McCoy of Mullaghbawn, who had been shot and captured by British Crown forces in 1921, and who had been a brigadier in the barracks before the Free State troops took command. On 23 April 1923, Aiken was elected chief-of-Staff of the IRA. An Army Council, composed of Aiken, Pilkington and Tom Barry, was named. Se√°n F. Quinn succeeded him as officer commanding the Fourth Northern Division. On 27 April, Aiken issued a Suspension of Offensives command that all offensive operations should be suspended from noon on 30 April. This marked the end of the civil war.

Parismina is about halfway between Tortuguero and Lim√≥n on the Tortuguero canals. There is no road to Parismina; it is accessible only by boat or plane and while some cars and motorcycles exist within the village, the paved surface is the runway. Parismina is part of the Canton of Siquirres in the Lim√≥n Province. Eco- tourism and sport fishing are the foundation of the village economy. The residents of Parismina have a unique culture which includes a local dialect, many Caribbean traditions and cuisine and a traditional Rastafarian influence.  Facilities  At least three whole guest houses/hotels and a few restaurants and bars are available in the town of Parismina. A number of high end fishing lodges specializing in tarpon and snook are located short boat rides away and provide the villagers with their main source of income. Residents benefit from a health care center which operates two days a week, a police station and both a primary and secondary education schools. Parismina enjoys a public water system with safe drinking water and sanitation. Most houses have electricity installed and most streets have lights. No banks or post office are to be found in the village. As such, residents and tourists alike make the trip to Siquirres occasionally to carry out administrative and financial duties.  Sea turtles  Four species of sea turtles nest on the beaches at Parismina. Several of these are hovering on the brink of extinction, particularly the leatherback sea turtle. A large number of leatherbacks and green sea turtles nest in the black sand dunes of the beaches near Parismina; hawksbill turtles are occasionally found and loggerheads have been reported, but are rarely seen. While the turtles used to be hunted as a food source by inhabitants, a recent increase in poaching has been seriously threatening the population. In April 2001, local residents along with the Costa Rican Coast Guard, initiated Asociaci√≥n Salvemos las Tortugas de Parismina, or Save the Turtles of Parismina (ASTOP). A community-based, non profit, conservation organization dedicated to protecting sea turtles and their eggs from poaching while initiating sustainable development and providing a viable alternative economy to poaching in the village. Prior to the formation of ASTOP, 98% of the green turtles were killed for their meat and 98% of all three species of turtles' nests were poached on Parismina beach. Since the project started, poaching has decreased to 38%. In addition to saving 10,000 neonates annually, ASTOP economically supports approximately one third of the village.

Family Eudokia was the daughter of Inger. Her mother was of the Martinakoi family and a distant relative of the imperial family, as a close niece of Michael II and a distant niece of emperor Heraclius and his second wife and niece Martina.Cyril Mango, \\"Eudocia Ingerina, the Normans, and the Macedonian Dynasty,\\" Zbornik Radova Vizantolo≈°kog Instituta, XIV-XV, 1973, 17-27. According to a later alternative reconstruction by Christian Settipani, she would be the daughter of Inger Martinakios, logothete, son of Anastasios Martinakios, a Byzantine noble fl. 817 and officer in 819, deceased after 821, and wife, a sister of emperor Michael II, and grandson of Theophylactos Martinakios, son of Martinakes, grandson of Martinos and great-grandson of Andreas, nephew of empress Martina, niece and second wife of emperor Heraclius. Life Because her family was iconoclastic, the Empress Mother Theodora strongly disapproved of them. About 855 Eudokia became the mistress of Theodora's son, Michael III, who thus incurred the anger of his mother and the powerful minister Theoktistos. Unable to risk a major scandal by leaving his wife, Michael married Eudokia to his friend Basil but continued his relationship with her. Basil was compensated with the emperor's sister Thekla as his own mistress. Eudokia gave birth to a son, Leo, in September 866 and another, Stephen, in November 867. They were officially Basil's children, but this paternity was questioned, apparently even by Basil himself. The strange promotion of Basil to co-emperor in May 867 lends support to the great probability that at least Leo was actually Michael III's illegitimate son. The parentage of Eudokia's younger children is not a subject of dispute, as Michael III was murdered in September 867. A decade into Basil's reign, Eudokia became involved with another man, whom the emperor ordered to be tonsured as monk. In 882, she selected Theophano as wife for her son Leo, and died shortly afterwards. Children Eudokia and Basil officially had six children: * Leo VI (19 September 866 ‚Äì 11 May 912), who succeeded as emperor and according to the majority view of scholars was a son of Michael III. * Stephen I of Constantinople (November 867 ‚Äì 18 May 893), patriarch of Constantinople, who according to the majority view of scholars was a son of Michael III. * Alexander (c. 870 ‚Äì 6 June 913), who succeeded as emperor in 912. *Anna (d. 905/12 or after).

He was one of the dominant political figures in late fifteenth-century Ireland, rivalled in influence only by his son-in-law, the \\"Great\\" Earl of Kildare. Career FitzEustace was the eldest son of Sir Edward FitzEustace of Castlemartin, County Kildare, Lord Deputy of Ireland, and his wife Alicia. He belonged to one of the most prominent of the \\"Old English\\" families of the Pale, which had several branches. He was called to the Bar in England in about 1454, and soon afterwards became Chief Clerk to the Court of King's Bench. He was appointed Lord Chancellor of Ireland and Lord Treasurer of Ireland by King Edward IV of England in 1474 and was elevated to the Irish peerage as Baron Portlester in 1462. In the latter year he was accused of treason, but defended himself with such vigour that the charges were dropped: similar charges made against him in 1470 were not pursued.Otway-Ruthven, A.J. History of Medieval Ireland Barnes and Noble Reissue 1993 p. 389 In 1474 he was a founder member of the Brotherhood of Saint George, a short -lived military order charged with the defence of the Pale, the only part of Ireland which was under secure English rule. In 1478 when his son-in-law, Gerald FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare was replaced as Lord Deputy of Ireland by Lord Grey, Portlester organised a campaign of non-co-operation with the new Deputy. When Grey ordered him to hand over the Great Seal of Ireland, Portlester refused point blank, thus making the conduct of official business impossible. The King went to considerable lengths to support Grey. He ordered Thomas Archbold, the Master of the Royal Mint in Ireland, to strike a new Great Seal, declaring that the Seal held by Portlester was annulled, and that all acts passed under it were utterly void; but these efforts were to no avail. So effective was the campaign of obstruction that after a few months Lord Grey was forced to return to England.Otway-Ruthven p.398 Portlester was reappointed Chancellor by Henry VII, but later removed because of his part in the crowning of the pretender, Lambert Simnel, as King Edward VI of England, on 24 May 1487. This coronation took place in Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin, Ireland. Nearly every noble and Prince in Ireland took part in the ceremony. Simnel invaded England with an Irish army which was crushed at the Battle of Stoke.

Family He was married three times.Gilbert p.53 His wives were: *Elizabeth Brune, daughter of John Brune *Joan (or Jenet) Bellew of Bellewstown, widow of Christopher Plunket, 2nd Baron Killeen, whom he married in 1463 *Margaret (or Marguerite) d'Artois, granddaughter and heiress of the Gascon-born knight Sir Jenico d'Artois, and widow of Sir John Dowdall, whom he married sometime after 1467. This marriage brought him a considerable increase in his landholdings, since Margaret through her mother Jane Serjeant was heiress to half of the lands of Castleknock, County Dublin, although her right to hold the lands was disputed by the Barnewall family. He had issue by all of his wives, but it is uncertain which wife was the actual mother of each particular child.Gilbert p.53 His only legitimate son, Richard, died young. His daughters were: *Alice, or Alison, married Gerald FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare.Ball, F.

The barony became extinct on his death in 1496, but his nephew Thomas, son of his brother Richard, was created Viscount Baltinglass in 1541. Sir Maurice Eustace, a wealthy and influential member of the FitzEustace clan who became Lord Chancellor of Ireland, accepted the title Baron Portlester at the Restoration of Charles II, but then changed his mind, apparently because, like Rowland, he had no legitimate son to succeed him. Reputation Elrington Ball regarded him as perhaps the most important Irish political figure during his 40-year career, more influential even than his son-in-law, the \\"Great Earl of Kildare.\\" Memorial There is a memorial to him and his third wife Margaret d'Artois in St. Audoen's Church, Dublin, erected by him in gratitude for his preservation from shipwreck near the site.

It is located six nautical miles (7 mi, 11 km) south of the central business district of West Palm Beach, Florida. This airport is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011‚Äì2015, which categorized it as a reliever airport. It is also commonly referred to as the Lantana Airport. History =1940s= The land the airport was to be built on was donated to Palm Beach County by philanthropic- minded families under the condition that the land be dedicated to serving the public. Recognizing the growing presence of aircraft in Florida and realizing that the number of aircraft would soon overwhelm local fields, the county decided to build an airport on the land. Prior to the United States entry into World War II, the Office of Civilian Defense was responsible for preparing for threats to the United States. They determined that this location would be an ideal location for planes conducting off-shore patrols for Axis submarines that had been moving along the Florida coast. The U.S. government reached an agreement with the County whereby the county would dredge and prepare the land and the U.S. government would build the airfield. The airfield was built with a parallel taxiway and ample ramp space. The first plane to land on the field was on August 20, 1941. On December 1, 1941, the Civil Air Patrol was formed and Lantana was one of three airfields chosen to host a unit, Coastal Patrol Base 3. In addition, the Army Air Forces Antisubmarine Command stationed the 17th Antisubmarine Squadron at the airport during the early months of the war. The 17th AS flew overflights of the Florida coast as well as over the Gulf of Mexico and the Florida Straits patrolling for U-boats until January 1943 when the unit moved to Key West. When the Army Air Forces left, the CAP unit was transferred from Morrison Field (later to become Palm Beach International Airport) to Lantana for the remainder of the War. =1950s= The Civil Air Patrol continued to use Lantana throughout the 1950s and the field served as the Group 5 Headquarters. A Search Unit for the United States Customs Service was also based at the field. Through World War II, the War Department had leased exclusive use of the field. Following the cessation of hostilities, the field transitioned to civilian use. A flight school was opened at the field while the number of civilian flights grew to 115,000 per year. On one occasion over 20 DC-3s and 36 Beechcraft Model 18 aircraft were counted. =1960s= The 1960s saw a decline in usage at the airport from its heyday in the 50s. The county was reluctant to enter into long-term leases with fixed-base operators and by 1964, only one remained at the airport. In the meantime, Palm Beach International was opened to all general aviation and Boca Raton Airport became operational, accepting aircraft that formerly used Lantana. In early 1969, a VOR system was installed at the airport. =1970s= With an increasing number of executive jets using the airport from the late 60s into the 70s, local residents pushed the county into passing a noise ordinance banning jet aircraft from the airport. The airport was degrading with aging facilities in need of repair and upgrade. In an effort to remain competitive, the county applied for and received federal aid for ramp and infrastructure improvements, including landscaping. A VASI system was installed on runways 10/28 and 16/34 in 1973. =1980s= The airport was expanded in the 80s with the air right-of-way for runway 10 being contributed by aviation enthusiasts and the right-of-way for runway 28 obtained through court action. A roadblock to the airport being designated as a reliever airport was the volume of water supply to the airport. It was determined to be insufficient to meet Fire Department needs in the event of an air crash at the airport. Operations remained flat at the airport despite a 60% increase in tied-down aircraft. =1990s= With the improved facilities, a number of businesses moved into the airport. Two air-charter operations were based at the field and a glider company operated from the field from Thanksgiving through Memorial Day. The field was also the only field between Stuart and Fort Lauderdale to allow banner towing advertising business. The airport had functioned as a jump-off point for flights into the Caribbean, particularly The Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands. The increase of drug-trafficking curtailed Caribbean flights starting the mid-90s. On June 23, 1996, the flight crew of a Carnival Airlines Boeing 727 mistook Palm Beach County Airport for Palm Beach International Airport which is about five miles to the north of Palm Beach County and also has a major east-west runway. The landing gear of the 727 were already down when an Air Traffic Controller alerted the Captain that they were on approach to the wrong airport.Faa Asking: How Did Jetliner Almost Land A Wrong Airport? =2010s= After the inauguration of President Trump in January 2017 and his visits to nearby Mar-a-Lago, the airport indicated that due to the security restriction it had to shut down three weekends in February 2017. This affected its operations and the business of about two dozen affiliated businesses. A banner flying company indicated loss of contracts of US$40,000 after three closings and a helicopter company relocated at an estimated financial loss of US$440,000 per year.  Facilities and aircraft  Palm Beach County Park Airport covers an area of 304 acres (123 ha) at an elevation of 14 feet (4 m) above mean sea level. It has three runways laid out in a triangle, all of which have an asphalt surface and a PAPI system: Runway 5/23 is 3,256 by 75 feet (992 x 23 m); Runway 16/34 is 3,421 by 100 feet (1,043 x 30 m); Runway 10/28 is 3,489 by 75 feet (1,063 x 23 m). The airport does not have a control tower. The maximum aircraft weight for Lantana is 12,500 pounds (5,670 kg) although the runways are rated for 30,000 pounds (13,600 kg) per wheel. Local ordinances also prohibit jet aircraft from using the field. For the 12-month period ending May 21, 2010, the airport had 122,270 aircraft operations, an average of 334 per day: 99% general aviation and 1% air taxi. At that time there were 257 aircraft based at this airport: 71% single-engine, 18% multi-engine, <1% jet, 9% helicopter, and 1% glider. The airport has one fixed-base operator, Galaxy Aviation. Three flight training schools are also located at the airport- Aamro Aviation, Palm Beach Flight Training and Skywalker Aviation. The Palm Beach County Park Airport is owned by Palm Beach County and operated by the Palm Beach County Airport Department. The airport is on the west side of Lake Osborne.

In its various forms, it has specified a calorie intake between 330 and 1500 kcal per day. Food is principally in liquid form as meal replacement products or bars sold as part of the diet. While there is some evidence that these types of diets result in short term weight loss, there is little evidence of long term benefit. The diet achieved popularity in the 1980s following its commercial launch in the USA in 1980 and the UK in 1984. Following the deaths of several dieters it was revised under pressure from the FDA. The UK National Health Service states that anybody following a diet of less than 600 kcal/day should be under medical supervision. It was initially used in hospital weight loss programs. Since 2015 the company that makes the product is Cambridge Nutritional Foods Limited. There are concerns regarding the cost due to the fact that people must buy at least two weeks of product at a time. The diet is specifically not recommended by the American Academy of Family Physicians. it was renamed \\"the 1:1 diet\\", and has a calorie content of between 440 and 1500 kcal per day.  Versions  There are different versions of this diet in the US and the UK. Development and reception The Cambridge Diet was developed in 1960s by Alan Howard at Cambridge University, England. It was launched as a commercial product in the United States in 1980. The Diet was very popular in America but was also the subject of some controversy. It later came under scrutiny from regulators and health authorities after potential health concerns were raised. In the UK, the Cambridge Diet was launched in 1984. In 1987 a UK government Health Department report was critical of evidence submitted by Cambridge Nutrition - the working group responsible were not convinced by claims that the Cambridge Diet achieved protein sparing as well as conventional calorie restricted diets, and were concerned about conservation of lean tissue during dieting. The Cambridge Diet is categorized as a very-low-calorie diet, and as a fad diet. Most of the meal replacement products sold as part of the diet are manufactured in the UK and include shakes, meal replacement bars, soups and smoothies. In the early 1980s there were six documented deaths of people following the Cambridge liquid diet. Initially the diet started with a calorie intake of 330 calories/day, but under pressure from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration this was raised to 800 calories/day in the early 1980s. In 1985 Cambridge Diet Plan paid a six figure sum to settle a case brought by the family of a 31 year old woman who had died while following the Cambridge Diet. The FDA stated that eight such deaths were \\"potentially linked\\" to the Cambridge diet. The diet has also been known as the Cambridge Weight Plan, and in 2019 it was renamed the \\"1:1 diet\\". It has 6 variants which specify a calorie intake of between 440 and 1500 kcal per day. the very-low calorie phase of the diet consists of 3 serving per day of meal-replacement liquid with a macronutrient composition of 43 g of protein, 42 g of carbohydrate and 8 g of fat, supplemented with micronutrients. The British Dietetic Association list the possible adverse side effects as including \\"bad breath, a dry mouth, tiredness, dizziness, insomnia, nausea and constipation\\", and say that any person eating fewer than 600 kcal per day should be medically supervised.

They helped define the gloom-heavy thrash sound attributed to groups like His Hero is Gone and Tragedy by combining a dynamic, eerie open chord dissonace with a down-tuned power-chord-laden heaviness. Along with Tragedy, the group relocated to Portland, Oregon in the early 2000s. History In early 1997, Dave Atchison and Brad Boatright formed the band, along with guitarist Jeff Andrews, bassist Jason Piercey, and vocalist Marshall Perdue. This initial lineup would be short lived, with guitarist John Wilkerson replacing Andrews. As a five piece in this lineup they embarked on the first of many tours, taking them through the Eastern United States. Following this tour, Perdue left the band, with Boatright and Wilkerson taking over vocal duties. In this lineup the band recorded their first 7\\" EP, \\"Fragments Of A Fallen Sky\\", released by Clean Plate Records in 1998. During the band's first nationwide tour, Piercey left the band, resulting in the tour being completed without a bass player. In 1998, bassist Billy Davis joined the band, and they recorded the \\"Life and Death\\" EP for Davis's own Partners In Crime Records. After Davis's departure in 1999, Ryan Teetzen, of the Fort Smith, Arkansas band Burned Up Bled Dry, joined on bass, playing on their first two 12\\" LPs (Concrete And Steel 12\\", Silence 12\\") on the then unnamed Feral Ward Records- formerly The Great American Steak Religion. In 2001, Davis, who had relocated to Portland, OR to form Tragedy with members of the recently disbanded His Hero Is Gone re-joined From Ashes Rise. After the recording of the songs for a split 12\\" with Sweden's Victims, released on Havoc Records in 2003, the band signed with Jade Tree, and began writing the songs that would make up the Nightmares LP. Drawing on obscure hardcore bands from Scandinavia and Japan, Discharge's venerated D-beat, and crust punk From Ashes Rise helped bring an aggressive sound to Jade Tree. In 2004, Davis would depart again, and prior to tours of North America and Europe, was replaced by Derek Willman. The band then split up in Fall 2005 after doing a tour with the legendary UK band, the Subhumans. On October 12, 2009 a reunion show at the Satyricon in Portland, OR for February 21, 2010 was announced via the band's MySpace blog. Following this concert and the release of \\"Live Hell\\" in March, the band subsequently became active once again, playing shows in Montreal,QC, Los Angeles, CA as well as Maryland Deathfest in Baltimore, MD and the Punk Illegal Festival in Munkedal, Sweden. In numerous interviews in early 2010 members of the band hinted that there would be new material recorded, and in January 2012 the band recorded two songs- \\"Rejoice The End\\" and \\"Rage Of Sanity\\" for a two-song 7\\" EP to be released on Greg Anderson's Southern Lord Records. On December 25, 2011, guitarist/vocalist Brad Boatright launched his own recording label, Audiosiege Media, which is a division of Moshpit Tragedy Records.

The characters live in a world of anthropomorphic animals who live like humans. There are also running gags in the games such as Professor Quack eating a certain blueprint which shows how a gadget works (see below) and Monkey Penny's karate belt, which appears on the packaging boxes but is not shown in actual gameplay (although the belt appears in the bonus ending from Operation Ozone and is sometimes shown in animations that play during credits). Many of the game's names and plot elements are spoofs of the James Bond and Get Smart series. Many random puns are thrown in throughout the games to create a whimsical and humorous environment. Summary Spy Fox (voiced by Bob Zenk in Dry Cereal and Cheese Chase and Mike Madeoy in the other three games) works for a spy agency called SPY Corps. His cohorts include Monkey Penny (his secretarial assistant), Professor Quack (creator of the SPY Corps gadgets), the SPY Corps Chief, and the four-armed, four-sleeved 'tracking bug', Walter Wireless. There are three adventure games in the series: *Spy Fox in: Dry Cereal (1997) *Spy Fox in: Some Assembly Required (1999) *Spy Fox in: Operation Ozone (2001) Two arcade games also exist starring Spy Fox: *Spy Fox in: Cheese Chase (March 31, 1998) *Spy Fox in: Hold the Mustard (September 21, 1999) The Spy Fox games each contain several different game paths randomly determined when the player starts a new game. Each path has its own challenges, which some players find more challenging than others. The main protagonist of the games, Spy Fox, uses a variety of gadgets to complete his missions. Each game has a bonus ending wherein the player can catch the villain. The bonus ending is accessible only if the player clicks an option at the right moment. When running with ScummVM, these games can be played on different operating systems, including Windows, Mac and Linux. Nearly a decade after its initial release, the first installment of the Spy Fox trilogy was ported to the Nintendo Wii in 2008, but its availability was significantly limited by legal problems concerning the port's development. In 2014, the whole Spy Fox series was released on Steam, along with the entirety of the Humongous Entertainment game library. Availability * For Steam the games were released individually, bundled together in the \\"Spy Fox Complete Pack\\" and packaged with all Humongous Entertainment games in the \\"Humongous Entertainment Complete Pack\\". * Spy Fox in: Cheese Chase was released for Windows and Macintosh on a compilation CD titled \\"Super Duper Arcade 1\\", along with Pajama Sam's Sock Works, Freddi Fish and Luther's Water Worries and Putt-Putt and Pep's Balloon-O-Rama. * Spy Fox in: Hold the Mustard was released for Windows and Macintosh on a compilation CD titled \\"Super Duper Arcade 2\\", along with Pajama Sam's Lost & Found, Freddi Fish and Luther's Maze Madness and Putt-Putt and Pep's Dog on a Stick * Humongous Entertainment released a CD titled \\"Humongous Entertainment Triple Treat 3\\", which included Spy Fox in: Cheese Chase, Freddi Fish 2: The Case of the Haunted Schoolhouse and Backyard Baseball. * Encore Software released a compilation CD titled \\"Fun & Skills Pack 1st & 2nd Grade\\", which included Spy Fox in \\"Dry Cereal\\", Carmen Sandiego: Junior Detective and Crayola Magic 3D Coloring. * Encore Software released a compilation CD titled \\"Fun & Skills Pack 1st & 2nd Grade 3.0\\", which included Spy Fox in \\"Dry Cereal\\", Schoolhouse Rock!, Carmen Sandiego: Junior Detective and Crayola Make a Masterpiece.https://www.amazon.com/Fun-Skills-Pack-1st-Grade/dp/B00005NQBE Characters =Series= *Spy Fox - Spy Fox is suave, sophisticated, ever- cool and on top of things, even when the going gets a little tough. He relies on his wits and various spy gadgets, supplied to him by Quack, found at the Mobile Command Center. *Monkey Penny - Spy Fox's simian partner who is stationed at the Spy Corps Mobile Command Center. She sometimes contacts Spy Fox via his Spy Watch. She can also be called using the Spy Watch (although she gets irritated if Spy Fox uses the watch while he's inside the Mobile Command Center). Her name is a parody of Miss Moneypenny from the James Bond franchise. *Professor Quack - A duck at the Mobile Command Center working on spy gadgets. He'll explain to Spy Fox how each gadget works when the player clicks on them in the Spy Gadget vending machine. He has a habit of eating the gadget's blueprints after explaining the gadget's functions to the player. Quack is a parody of Q from the James Bond franchise. =Dry Cereal= *Howard Hugh Heifer Udderly III - The cow president and CEO of Amalgamated Moo Juice Incorporated has been cownapped and left dangling under a pool of piranhas until Spy Fox saves him by freezing the pool. Mr. Udderly is the only one who knows the extent of William the Kid's deranged plan. His name is based on those of Howard Hughes and Hugh Hefner, and the word \\"heifer\\". *William the Kid - The villain of the first game, he is the CEO of the Nectar of the Goats (N.O.G.) Corporation, and plans on ridding the world of cow's milk and replacing it with goat's milk using his Milky Weapon of Destruction. His name pays homage to notorious outlaw Billy the Kid. *Russian Blue - She's William the Kid's right hand woman. Her life's passion is the tango, and she can't resist one. She owns and operates the swank ocean liner, the SS Deadweight. She later appears as the main villainess in Spy Fox in Cheese Chase. =Some Assembly Required= *Napoleon LeRoach - Villain of the second game and leader of the Society of Meaningless Evil, Larceny, Lying and Yelling, (S.M.E.L.L.Y.). LeRoach‚Äôs evil plot is to use his Giant Evil Dogbot to take over the world. His agenda stems from the fact that he has been laughed at and scorned for his size (and the fact was not tall enough to ride a certain ride at the fair). He is a parody of Napoleon Bonaparte. *Giant Evil Dogbot - Created by the S.M.E.L.L.Y. Toy Division and maximized to a ratio of 1,000 to 1. This villainous weapon posed as a centerpiece at the World‚Äôs Fair. The Chateau LeRoach restaurant is located in its collar. Seen in a short cameo as trash in an unnamed evil organization's lair in Spy Fox 3: \\"Operation Ozone\\". *Chief - The chief of Spy Corps who meets Spy Fox after he escapes from the ski shack and again when he presents Spy Fox with the Grand Golden Family Approved Fortified Supreme Certificate of Excellence for landing Napoleon LeRoach in Spy Jail. He also appears in Spy Fox 3: \\"Operation Ozone\\". =Operation Ozone= *Poodles Galore - The Queen of Cosmetics and Spy Fox‚Äôs evil nemesis of the third game. Poodles is not satisfied with being the cosmetics queen of the whole town, she wants to control the entire sunscreen market using her aerosol spraying hairspray space station to deplete the ozone layer in order to sell her new product SPF: 2001. Her name is a parody of Bond girl Pussy Galore. *Plato Pushpin - The scientist that Galore has forced to build the hairspray satellite of destruction using illegal chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). He is the only one with the knowledge to stop the hairspray satellite with his best invention, the Congeal Pill. Galore caught him in the act of trying to finish the Congeal Pill, and took him hostage, turning him into a bowling pin in an intent to bowl him to death, only to have Spy Fox save him by using the special SPY Bowling Ball.

In simple terms, a stamping press is the modern day equivalent of a hammer and anvil. The difference is that a stamping press uses precision-made male and female dies to dictate the shape of the final product. Components A press has a bolster plate, and a ram. Presses come in various types of frame configurations, C-Frame where the front & left and right sides are open. Straight Side or H-Frame for stronger higher tonnage applications. It is very important to size the press and tonnage based on the type of applications, blanking, forming, progressive or transfer. Strong consideration should be given to avoiding off-center load conditions to prevent premature wear to the press. 440 ton Progressive Die Stamping Press =Bolster Plate= The bolster plate is mounted on top of the press bed and is a large block of metal upon which the bottom portion of a die is clamped; the bolster plate is stationary. Large presses (like the ones used in the automotive industry) may be equipped with die cushions integrated in the bolster plate to apply blank holder or counter draw forces. This is necessary when a single acting press is used for deep drawing. The ram / slide is the moving or reciprocating member that the upper die is mounted to. Ram or Slide guidance is a critical element to assure long die life between die maintenance. Different types of slide guides are available, 4 point V-Gibs or 6 point square gibs on smaller presses and 8 point full length slide guides on larger straight side frame presses. With the dies and material be fed into the die between the bolster and slide, good press designs must account for plastic deformation, other wise known as deflection when frame design and loads are considered. =Ram / Slide= The vertical motion of the slide acts like a hammer to an anvil. The most common Mechanical Presses use an eccentric drive to move the press's ram slide, length of stroke or slide travel depends on the crankshaft or eccentric, whereas hydraulic cylinders are used in hydraulic presses. The nature of drive system determines the force progression during the ram's stroke. Mechanical presses have a full tonnage rating point above BDC / Bottom Dead Center, normal full tonnage rating points are .187\\", .25\\" & .5\\". Hence a mechanical press has a tonnage curve and should be operated within the press capacity limits. Link Motion mechanical is yet another option, this provides a slide slow down near BDC / bottom dead center for soft touch tooling. This link feature can improve die life and reduce reverse-snap thru tonnage for blanking operations. On the contrary, Hydraulic Presses do not have a tonnage curve and can produce full tonnage at any point in the stroke. The trade off is speed, a mechanical press is much faster when compared to hydraulic. On the other hand, Hydraulic Presses are much more practical for deep forming or drawing or parts or when dwell time at the bottom is desired. Another classification is single- acting presses versus double- (seldom triple) acting presses. Single-acting presses have one single ram. Double-acting presses have a subdivided ram, to manage, for example, blank holding (to avoid wrinkles) with one ram segment and the forming operation with the second ram segment. I-PRESS AB PLUS Full Featured Safe Press & Automation Controller =Other Components & Controls= Typically, presses are electronically linked (with a programmable logic controller) to an automatic feeder which feeds metal raw material through the die. The raw material is fed into the automatic feeder after it has been unrolled from a coil and put through a straightener. A tonnage monitor may be provided to observe the amount of force used for each stroke.

SpA. History Derbi's origins began with a little bicycle workshop in the village of Mollet near Barcelona, founded in 1922 by Sime√≥ Rabasa i Singla. The focus remained the repair and hire of bicycles until May 1944 when Rabasa formed a limited liability company named Bicycletas Rabasa with the aim of moving into manufacturing bicycles. The venture proved very successful and in 1946, supported by its profits, work began on a motorised version. More moped than motorcycle, this first model, the 48cc SRS included plunger rear suspension, and a motorcycle type gas tank and exhaust system. The SRS proved so successful it prompted a change in the company's direction, and on November 7, 1950, the company changed its name to the Nacional Motor SA. Just prior to this, at that summer's Barcelona Trade Fair, the company unveiled its first real motorcycle, the Derbi 250. 1972 Derbi 50 cc First win in 1968 with Barry Smith at TT race, Derbi successfully competed in Grand Prix motorcycle racing, winning 50cc world championships in 1969, 1970 and 1972. When the 50cc class was increased to an 80cc displacement in 1984, Derbi would claim four consecutive world championships between 1986 and 1989, before the class was discontinued in Grand Prix competition. The firm also experienced racing success in 125cc Grand Prix competitions, winning world championships in 1971, 1972, 1988, 2008 and 2010. The Derbi RSA 125 earned 405 points in the constructor's championship in the 125cc class. The 405 points in 2010 are second only to Aprilia which earned 410 points in 2007.

He was raised to the rank of Monsignor on 27 June 1938.http://www.ofiaich.ie/media/uploads/the_archive_of_the_archdiocese_of_armagh.pdf Episcopal Ministry =Meath= On 25 April 1942, he was appointed Coadjutor bishop of Meath and Titular bishop of Binda. D'Alton received his episcopal consecration on the following 29 June from Cardinal Joseph MacRory, with Bishops Edward Mulhern and William MacNeely serving as co-consecrators, in the chapel of St. Patrick's College. He succeeded Thomas Mulvany as Bishop of Meath on 16 June 1943. =Armagh= D'Alton was named Archbishop of Armagh and thus Primate of All Ireland on 13 June 1946, and was created Cardinal Priest of S. Agata dei Goti by Pope Pius XII in the consistory of 12 January 1953. A cardinal elector in the 1958 papal conclave. He gave a hint of the difficulties involved in that papal conclave and achieving unanimity in the voting.http://www.todayscatholicworld.com/1958-conclave-eng.pdf He was a member of the Central Preparatory Commission of the Second Vatican Council but lived long enough to attend only the Council's first session in 1962. One highlight of his time in Armagh was the Patrician Year Celebrations in 1961, marked by the Irish Catholic hierarchy as the 1500th anniversary of the death of St. Patrick and as such an opportunity to promote the \\"spiritual empire\\" created by the Irish Catholic church in the wider anglophone world. D'Alton wrote a pastoral letter to mark the occasion.https://lxoa.wordpress.com/2011/08/08/patrician-year-1961-cardinal- daltons-pastoral-letter/ Cardinal D'Alton was seen to be more ecumenical in outlook than other members of the Irish hierarchy. He tried to broker talks between the Irish Free State and the United Kingdom to ease the tensions between both countries, even going so far as to address the situation regarding the Irish ports, but to little avail. In 1952 he became the first member of the Irish Hierarchy to receive an honorary degree from Queen's University, Belfast, when he was conferred with a Doctorate in Literature. He already possessed a doctorate in divinity so this degree was a recognition of his earlier works such as Horace and His Age: A Study in Historical Background (1917), Roman Literary Theory and Criticism: A Study in Tendencies (1931), and Selections from St. John Chrysostom (1940). He died from a heart attack in DublinTIME Magazine. Milestones 8 February 1963 at age 80, and was buried on the grounds of St Patrick's Cathedral.

It is the third game in the Postal series, being the sequel to Postal 2, telling the story of the Postal Dude's adventures in a town named Catharsis, following directly from the ending of the second game in which the town of Paradise was destroyed by a nuclear bomb. Postal III was released for Microsoft Windows in December 2011. Ports for OS X, Linux, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 were announced, but ultimately canceled.The Source Engine On Postal III Is Still Coming To Linux Phoronix, February 13, 2011 (Article by Michael Larabel) Gameplay Postal III, like Postal 2 before it, changes up the perspective, this time acting as a third person shooter as opposed to first person. The core of the gameplay is more linear and story-centric as opposed to the open-world of 2, with mission-based objectives pushing the plot along. However, it retains the same sense of wild abandon action and combat the series is noted for. There are two paths the player can follow depending on actions performed in the game, as well as how far the player's Karma Meter reaches; if the player wantonly attacks and kills innocent people, the Karma Meter will be affected, changing from yellow to red and guaranteeing the player goes down the \\"bad path,\\" where the plot and missions therein change accordingly and ending with a text statement asking the player if he/she is \\"disappointed\\" that they didn't get to \\"waste them yourself?\\", telling them instead to take the \\"good path\\", which will allow the player to see the story through to its logical conclusion.  Plot  Postal III includes performances by a wide array of minor celebrities, including Ron Jeremy, Jennifer Walcott, and Randy Jones. The game also contains characters depicting Uwe Boll (director of the 2007 Postal film),PC Gamer review Sergei Mavrodi, Osama bin Laden and Hugo Ch√°vez. In Postal III, the Postal Dude emigrates to Paradise's sister town of Catharsis as he previously blew up Paradise with a nuclear bomb. Due to the economic meltdown, the Dude drives into town and becomes stranded because he can not afford a tank of gas. He must then find work and do various odd jobs to escape the town. Through the course of the game, the player can choose one of two paths: the \\"bad path\\", which includes joining in on the schemes of Mayor Chomo and Uncle Dave, or the \\"good path\\", which involves the Dude joining the Catharsis Police force. The game plays out in a fairly linear and cinematic way, although the player's actions affect the outcome of the story and the game. Although the \\"good path\\" is more difficult to play, it offers more story line and a longer campaign. There are three endings to the game as Postal Dude must escape from the impending Venezuelan invasion with Hugo Ch√°vez leading the charge. *Evil Ending: Escaping Carthasis by the skin of his teeth and leaving Chomo, Dave and Bin Laden at the mercy of Hockey Moms, Postal Dude winds up at the mercy of the law enforcement, who are quick to give him and his dog the death penalty for his slaughter. His appeal to heaven completely fails and Postal Dude is sent to hell. *Neutral Ending: Postal Dude succeeds in escaping Carthasis without resorting to murder or delivering swift justice and meets Jennifer \\"Jen\\" Walcott who tries to hijack his car but winds up marrying him instead and enjoying a honeymoon in Peru. He wins the lottery and has a bestselling book which details his personal view of the exploits in Postal 2 as Champ bites on the groin of the talk show host. *Good Ending: Saving the world from Hugo Ch√°vez, Postal Dude become one of the most popular yet controversial heroes of American history. He winds up becoming the President of the United States with Jen Wallcott as his wife and head of Secret Service who winds up annoying both sides of the political spectrum. As he moves into the White House, a certain nuclear button sparks the inner psychopath within. Regardless of the endings, the Postal Dude's final words are \\"I regret nothing!\\"  Release  A representative promoting the game at IgroMir 2010 The game was set to be released through the digital distribution platform Steam on December 20, 2011. However, the main release was delayed; some users were able to obtain the game through the GameFly storefront. The game formally released on December 21.  Reception  Postal III received \\"generally unfavorable\\" reviews, according to review aggregator website Metacritic. GameSpot gave the game 3/10, while Game Informer also lambasted the game, giving it a score of 1/10 and saying that \\"the people behind Postal III don‚Äôt have the writing ability to back up their gutter-dwelling mouths. As it turns out, they also don‚Äôt have the design or programming chops to create a stable game. This makes it one of a handful of games to ever receive such a low score.\\" In a much more positive review, QJ.Net stated that the game was \\"one of the most interestingly written, psychotic and harmful games I've ever played\\" and that the developers had \\"ended up with a product that looks good, sounds great and is often funny\\", but also complained that their \\"experience was marred with constant crashing and a lot of graphical glitches\\" as well as complaining that it often comes off as \\"mean spirited and lacking in heart\\". Original Gamer also gave a positive review, giving the game a rating of 7.5, deciding that it was \\"a good game, just not a great one\\". The reviewer praised its storyline, wide variety of weapons, and creativity while deriding the game's \\"linear level design and gameplay\\" and complaining that it takes \\"a while to get to the meat of the title\\". It also called out the game's use of good and bad paths, which he believed unfairly favoured the good path, deciding that the game \\"punishes you for being bad, by being bad itself\\". That said, it concluded by saying that the \\"fun is there in Postal 3, you just have to work a little for it.\\" = Developer reactions = In an interview about a month after release, Vince Desi, the head of Running with Scissors admitted that the \\"fan reaction has been mixed\\" to Postal III, as well as stating that most of the complaints centered around the game having \\"too many bugs.\\" Desi acknowledged that it was hard for him to hear from \\"diehard fans and hearing their complaints\\", but did however emphasize that the developers have been \\"making updates to fix a lot of the problems\\" as well as stating that people who purchased the game at that time would have a \\"much better experience.\\" He also commented that while Running with Scissors had \\"designed a very big challenging game with great variety\\", their development team and publisher \\"were under tremendous pressure and decided to release a different game, something that they could deliver.\\" He did however note that he was \\"glad that the publisher has tried very hard to make the necessary improvements\\" following the game's initial reception. He also commented that they were committed to making \\"sure that gamers get the best value they deserve\\" from Postal III. On August 25, 2012 developer and Postal franchise owner Running with Scissors removed Postal III from their store, stating that it was \\"in the best interest of the Postal Community\\" and encouraged gamers to instead purchase their earlier titles, stating that they are \\"a far superior product for a lot less money\\". This came after revelations that Running with Scissors' relationship with Akella had broken down and that they no longer had any real involvement with the future development of Postal III. Running with Scissors explained the situation by stating that Postal III \\"was licensed to a Russian publisher and developer who were supposed to produce the game to our design, with a much bigger team and budget than we had for Postal 2. Even taking those facts into account, it didn't work out very well. It was a mistake and one we will not repeat.\\" They also added that \\"after the disaster that was Postal III due to the mistake of outsourcing it, we have decided to make the next game 100% in house.\\"POSTAL 2 COMPLETE - Steam Greenlight - Frequently asked Questions A later interview with Running with Scissors employee Jon Merchant further clarified the situation, with him stating that \\"Akella had vastly more resources than we had for Postal 2, so it seemed reasonable at the time they could produce a game that was at least equal to the game we made inhouse. Things started out well but I think they got hit pretty hard by the economic problems of 2007-8, and it all started to go downhill from there. The final product was very far removed from our original design, and horribly broken.\\" He also commented that \\"the game is a broken mess and should not be sold. We stopped selling the game ourselves some time ago when it became apparent that neither us or the community would get the SDK tools. We don't regard it as the third POSTAL game, just a dodgy spin off that should never have happened.\\"Running with Scissors Interview, Our EXCLUSIVE interview with RWS! Vince Desi summarized the situation in a 2013 interview by saying that \\"some deals work, some don‚Äôt, PIII failed for many reasons. Worst of all we lost control of the project and that was the beginning of the shitfest. Historically we had a great relationship with Akella, our Russian publisher, and for the record the folks there were good people and I consider them my friends regardless of the fiasco PIII ... Again, it is a testimony to POSTAL fans around the world who have shown their loyal support beyond all odds and hurdles that allows us to keep on going.\\"Q&A; INTERVIEW: RUNNING WITH SCISSORS INC. CEO VINCE DESI. In Postal 2: Paradise Lost, a 2015 expansion for Postal 2 developed by Running With Scissors, the events of Postal III were retconned as being part of a dream sequence the Postal Dude had; he accidentally crashed his car into a stop sign and entered an 11-year coma from the trauma.

He studied at St. Patrick's College, Armagh and at Maynooth and was ordained to the priesthood on 13 September 1885. http://www.catholic- hierarchy.org/bishop/bmacrory.html His first appointment was as the first president of St. Patrick's Academy, Dungannon from 1886-87. MacRory went on to teach Scripture and Modern Theology at St Mary's College, Oscott in England until 1889, at which stage he was appointed Professor of Scripture and Oriental Languages at his alma mater of Maynooth College. He was a founder member of the editorial team behind the creation of the Irish Ecclesiastical Review in 1902 and was appointed Vice-President of Maynooth in 1912. Bishop of Down and Connor On 9 August 1915 MacRory was appointed Bishop of Down and Connor by Pope Benedict XV and received his episcopal consecration on 14 November from Michael Cardinal Logue. He chose as his episcopal motto Fortis in Fide (\\"Strong in Faith\\"). From 1917-18 he was one of the four clerical members of the Irish Convention and said, in a letter to the Rector of the Pontifical Irish College that he was attending in order to oppose partition \\"with all his heart.\\" He was one of the delegates who backed the option of full Dominion status for Ireland.

Cardinal MacRory presided over the 31st International Eucharistic Congress, which was held in Dublin from 20-26 June 1932 and which was a highpoint for the Catholic Church in the newly created Irish Free State, which was a dominion within the British Empire. He also exercised occasional additional roles by virtue of being a Cardinal; he was, for example, the papal legate at the 1933 laying of the foundation stone of Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral, in the North of England, and the following year travelled to Australia as legate to the National Eucharistic Congress. https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/12147194 He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 1939 papal conclave, which selected Pope Pius XII. MacRory was a strenuous opponent of the Partition of Ireland.\\"St. Patrick's Successor\\", time.com, 12 October 1942. In late 1931, MacRory made the following statement: > \\"The Protestant Church in Ireland ‚Äì and the same is true of the Protestant > Church anywhere ‚Äì is not only not the rightful representative of the early > Irish Church, but it is not even a part of the Church of Christ.

Many of the Brigade's members were blessed by the Archbishop of Tuam before sailing to Spain from Galway. In 1940, during World War II, he voiced strong objections to proposals for conscription in Northern Ireland, which, in the event, did not come to pass. See Conscription in the United Kingdom.

It is known as cardiac asthma because the symptoms mimic ordinary asthma (bronchial asthma). One study found that patients with cardiac asthma represented one third of congestive heart failure in elderly patients. Depending on severity, it may be classified as a medical emergency, as it can be a symptom of acute heart failure leading to the buildup of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) as well as within and around the airways. The distinction between bronchial asthma and cardiac asthma is especially important because some treatments for bronchial asthma, including inhalers, may worsen cardiac asthma or cause severe heart arrhythmias. Bronchial asthma, in contrast, is caused by the inflammation and narrowing of pulmonary airways, causing the characteristic breathing difficulties. Bronchial asthma has nothing to do with fluid in the lungs or heart disease, or even the heart failure associated with cardiac asthma.

The westernmost 4.85 miles (west of West 32nd Avenue), named the Gratigny Parkway (or simply, the Gratigny), is a limited access all-electronic toll road maintained by the Miami-Dade Expressway Authority (totalling to two gantries of $0.47 each for SunPass users and $0.94 each for toll-by-plate users); the easternmost is a surface street (Northwest 119th Street) also known as Gratigny Road. Despite its relatively short length, SR 924 is a major east-west artery in northern Miami-Dade County. Route description The road begins at the national southern terminus of Interstate 75 at the Palmetto Expressway at the border between Miami Lakes and Hialeah. The road heads east as an eight lane expressway through Hialeah's residential areas and through the first of two $0.47 toll gantries ($0.94 for toll-by-plate users).Open Road Tolling SR 924 Retrieved 25 June 2010 Following the gantry, the expressway has its first interchange with NW 57th Avenue/Red Road, giving access to Opa-locka Airport just north of the toll road. SR 924 then curves southeast, leaving Hialeah and heading towards the second $.47 toll gantry ($0.94 for toll-by- plate users) in Opa-locka, followed by an interchange with SR 953 before the expressway ends at NW 32nd Avenue, becoming NW 119th Street, a divided surface street heading due east. The road then becomes a mix of commercial and residential areas as it crosses SR 9, then reaching North Miami, intersecting with U.S. Route 441/SR 7, followed by Interstate 95, becoming a residential street before ending at SR 909. Tolls The tolls on the expressway portion of SR 924 are all electronic, and does not accept cash. Payment is done either via SunPass transponders or via toll-by-plate billing, the latter of which attracts a higher cost. Two toll gantries are located along the expressway portion of the road, each charging $0.47 for SunPass users and $0.94 for Toll By Plate users. The eastern toll gantry is placed at the location of the former toll plaza which closed in 2010 when cash collection ended. As of June 8, 2018, it costs $0.94 to travel the entire expressway portion via SunPass and $1.88 via Toll By Plate. All motorists are charged at least one toll for using the road; there are no \\"free sections\\" as existed prior to the electronic toll conversion in 2010. History Despite appearances, the Gratigny Parkway isn‚Äôt an outgrowth of an attempt to extend I-75 to connect with I-95. Initial plans for the Gratigny were devised in the 1960s, when planners had hoped to route I-75 along the Tamiami Trail and the then-under construction \\"east-west Expressway\\" that opened (in 1969) as SR 836 and eventually became known as the Dolphin Expressway. When plans for the major north-south Interstate changed so it would be routed along Alligator Alley instead, the proposed Opa-locka Expressway was intended to be Miami-Dade County's second full east-west throughway.History of Gratigny Expressway The Opa-locka Expressway was never intended to terminate at I-95, but merge with a surface street within a few blocks of it instead. Funding issues caused the Florida Department of Transportation to mothball its construction plans for over a decade, but when the plan was revived, the changing demographics of the neighborhoods impacted by construction (an area with a predominantly white population in the 1960s became an area with a predominantly African-American and Hispanic population in the 1980s). In 1982, racial politics killed the portion of the Opa-locka Expressway that was planned for east of Northwest 32nd Avenue, and the proposed new expressway received a new name: the Gratigny Parkway. Faced with rising construction costs in 1982, FDOT officials told the North Dade Chamber of Commerce that the Gratigny Parkway would be built as a toll road; and in the following year, the construction project was given a green light. In 1984, increased opposition almost derailed construction of the expressway again, but this time the resistance came from residents of Miami Lakes and Hialeah. Both communities didn't want any expressways to be built, even to the point of Hialeah amending its city charter to oppose all expressway construction within its city limits. Yet at that point, FDOT had already purchased 90% of the land needed for construction of the Gratigny Parkway - and it was determined to get it built. After a compromise that deleted one interchange with a major surface street (Ludlam Road/Northwest 67th Avenue), construction finally began in 1987. The Gratigny Parkway opened to traffic in January 1992. At the time, no signs indicated the name of the toll road: they merely showed the SR 924 designation that it shared with Gratigny Road to the east. In 1997, the newly established Miami-Dade Expressway Authority took over the operation from FDOT. New TOLL shields (with the MDX logo underneath them) made their appearance along the expressway but not the surface road to the east of 32nd Ave; the corner of Northwest 119th Street at 32nd Ave has an MDX \\"end 924\\" sign for the eastbound drivers, while on the other side of 32nd Ave an FDOT \\"east SR 924\\" sign greets people who wish to continue eastward on the surface street. In 1998, the expressway section of SR 924 was designated as the Marlins Expressway by the state of Florida to honor the Florida Marlins' 1997 World Series victory. On June 7, 2010, the tolled section of SR 924 ceased collecting cash tolls and went completely electronic, with SunPass users paying the same rate as before, but those without SunPass have to utilize the toll-by-plate program, which adds a 15 cent surcharge to every gantry they pass.Chardy, Alfonso. \\"Cash tolls on Miami-Dade expressways will soon be electronic\\".

In geometry, a Wythoff construction, named after mathematician Willem Abraham Wythoff, is a method for constructing a uniform polyhedron or plane tiling. It is often referred to as Wythoff's kaleidoscopic construction.  Construction process  The method is based on the idea of tiling a sphere, with spherical triangles ‚Äì see Schwarz triangles. This construction arranges three mirrors at the sides of a triangle, like in a kaleidoscope. However, different from a kaleidoscope, the mirrors are not parallel, but intersect at a single point. They therefore enclose a spherical triangle on the surface of any sphere centered on that point and repeated reflections produce a multitude of copies of the triangle. If the angles of the spherical triangle are chosen appropriately, the triangles will tile the sphere, one or more times. If one places a vertex at a suitable point inside the spherical triangle enclosed by the mirrors, it is possible to ensure that the reflections of that point produce a uniform polyhedron. For a spherical triangle ABC we have four possibilities which will produce a uniform polyhedron: # A vertex is placed at the point A. This produces a polyhedron with Wythoff symbol ab c, where a equals œÄ divided by the angle of the triangle at A, and similarly for b and c. # A vertex is placed at a point on line AB so that it bisects the angle at C. This produces a polyhedron with Wythoff symbol a bc. # A vertex is placed so that it is on the incenter of ABC. This produces a polyhedron with Wythoff symbol a b c. # The vertex is at a point such that, when it is rotated around any of the triangle's corners by twice the angle at that point, it is displaced by the same distance for every angle. Only even-numbered reflections of the original vertex are used. The polyhedron has the Wythoff symbol a b c. The process in general also applies for higher-dimensional regular polytopes, including the 4-dimensional uniform 4-polytopes. { class=wikitable width=650px + Examples 240px 240px The hexagonal prism is constructed from both the (6 2 2) and (3 2 2) families. 200px200px The truncated square tiling is constructed by two different symmetry positions in the (4 4 2) family. }  Non-Wythoffian constructions  Uniform polytopes that cannot be created through a Wythoff mirror construction are called non- Wythoffian. They generally can be derived from Wythoffian forms either by alternation (deletion of alternate vertices) or by insertion of alternating layers of partial figures. Both of these types of figures will contain rotational symmetry. Sometimes snub forms are considered Wythoffian, even though they can only be constructed by the alternation of omnitruncated forms. { class=wikitable width=500px + Examples 240px The hexagonal antiprism is constructed by an alternation of a dodecagonal prism. 240px The elongated triangular tiling is constructed by a layering of square tiling and triangular tiling rows. 240px The great dirhombicosidodecahedron is the only non-Wythoffian uniform polyhedron. }  See also  * Wythoff symbol - a symbol for the Wythoff construction of uniform polyhedra and uniform tilings. * Coxeter-Dynkin diagram - a generalized symbol for the Wythoff construction of uniform polytopes and honeycombs.

The town is part of the Frankfurt Rhein-Main urban area. Owing to its advantageous location for both scenery and transport on the edge of the Frankfurt Rhine Main Region, K√∂nigstein is a favourite residential town. Neighbouring places are Kronberg im Taunus, Glash√ºtten, Schwalbach am Taunus, Bad Soden am Taunus and Kelkheim.  Geography  = Neighbouring communities = K√∂nigstein borders ‚Äì from northwest to east ‚Äì on the communities of Glash√ºtten, Schmitten, Oberursel, and Kronberg (all four in the Hochtaunuskreis), and from southeast to southwest on Schwalbach, Bad Soden and Kelkheim (all three in the Main-Taunus-Kreis). = Constituent communities = Besides the main town, which bears the same name as the whole, K√∂nigstein has three outlying centres: Falkenstein, Mammolshain and Schneidhain. Since 2001, Falkenstein has borne the designation (health spa) independently of the town's status as such.  History  Shrouded in legend, the town's founding date is unknown. The name 'K√∂nigstein' means 'King stone'. The local legend states that King Chlodwig (466-511), founded the town after building a castle on a hill as well as a chapel. K√∂nigstein had its first documentary mention in 1215, making it likelier that the castle was built around the 12th century for the town's ‚Äì and the Frankfurt-Cologne commercial road's ‚Äì security. Also in that time came the town's first lords, the Counts of N√ºrings, but they were supplanted in 1239 by the Lords of Hagen-M√ºnzenberg into whose ownership the castle went as an Imperial fief. The Lords of Hagen-M√ºnzenberg were in turn followed by the Lords of Bolanden-Falkenstein from 1255 to 1418, under whose rule K√∂nigstein was granted town rights in 1313. The Lords of Bolanden- Falkenstein were succeeded by the Lords of Eppstein, who were themselves followed by the Counts of Stolberg in 1535. It was they who introduced the Reformation to the area. By 1581, K√∂nigstein belonged to the Electorate of Mainz, which had incorporated the old County through a legal dispute. Early in the 17th century, in connection with the Counterreformation, the castle was remodelled into a mighty fortress, but this newer military stronghold met its end in the French Revolutionary Wars when the French blew it up in 1796, although this may have been unintentional. (Local legend has it that gunpowder was hidden in the castle's well, and a spark from a careless French soldier's pipe started the explosion). In 1803, K√∂nigstein passed to the Principality of Nassau-Usingen, which itself later merged with Nassau-Weilburg to form the Duchy of Nassau. By 1866 it was in Prussian hands, and since 1945, it has been part of Hesse. The three constituent communities mentioned herein were amalgamated with K√∂nigstein as part of Hesse's municipal reforms in 1972. K√∂nigstein enjoyed an economic upswing from less wealthy times when the coldwater spa first opened in 1851. It reached its high point just before the First World War broke out. The designation was granted in 1935, and is still borne by the town, and now also independently by the constituent community of Falkenstein. = Jewish health resort and summer residence of the Frankfurt Jews = K√∂nigstein was regarded as a \\"Jewish spa\\" ‚Äì this was especially in the era of National Socialism a topic. The city became famous as \\"Jewish spa\\" mainly due to the high proportions of Jewish guests (for example Otto Klemperer, Kurt Hahn, Carl Sternheim, Botho Graef, Reinhold Lepsius), who stayed in the internationally famous sanitarium Dr. Kohnstamm (the name stuck even after the death of the founder Oskar Kohnstamm in 1917) and Hotel Cahn, which offered kosher food. For these reasons, K√∂nigstein was an attractive city to visit for a day trip for many Jews in Frankfurt. K√∂nigstein became even more easily accessible from Frankfurt am Main in 1902, when the railway between K√∂nigstein and Frankfurt was built. K√∂nigstein was also the residence of prominent Jewish citizens (for example Mathilde Hannah von Rothschild, Sigmund Kohn-Speyer, L. Albert Hahn, Hermann Wronker, Albert Katzenellenbogen, Julius Blau, Max Neisser, Adolf Sabor, Selmar Spier, the family of Richard Musgrave), who in turn brought their friends and guests there. The poet Stefan George, e.g., initially often visited his school friend Oskar Kohnstamm, and then after Kohnstamm's death in 1917 and the sale of Kohnstamm's sanatorium, moved to K√∂nigstein to be near his sister, Anna George. In her apartment he received members of the George circle for which special rooms had been rented. These include for example the poet Ernst Morwitz, with whom he went for long walks. George's and Kohnstamm's honored school friend Karl Wolfskehl had contacts to the Sanatorium Dr. Amelung, whose director had been a friend of Oskar Kohnstamm. After Kohnstamm's death in 1917 until 1938 the owner of the renowned Kohnstamm sanatorium was Carl Frankl (also Jewish). Carl was a brother of the famous World War I fighter pilot Wilhelm Frankl (his brother Wilhelm had converted from Judaism to Christianity in order to marry his high school sweetheart). While in 1937, 24 hotels, hostels and guest houses still refused to do so and accepted Jewish guests, the following year, in 1938, all 54 hotels, hostels and guest houses in K√∂nigstein complied with Nazi law and added the following sentence to their advertisements: \\"All the guest houses are run Jew-free.\\" K√∂nigstein's mayor in 1938 commented on the reputation of K√∂nigstein as Jewish spa town in the context of public discussions of a suggested continued existence with the Jewish name kept of the Sanatorium Dr. Kohnstamm instead of the Aryanization preferred by the mayor himself, that (should the name be kept) \\"the reputation of K√∂nigstein as ‚ÄòJews' resort' would yet again be cemented in an irreparable way\\". Even after the Holocaust famous people of Jewish descent settled in K√∂nigstein. Thus, e.g. Max Dessoir moved here for his retirement (he had lived there once before previously in the 'Sanatorium Amelung'), as did Hedwig Fischer (n√©e Landshoff), the wife of publisher Samuel Fischer. Both Hedwig Fischer and Max Dessoir spent the rest of their lives in K√∂nigstein. Paulette Goddard, Charlie Chaplin's wife, was a famous visitor of K√∂nigstein after World War II.  Politics  Represented on town council are the CDU, the SPD, the FDP and the Greens, as well as the ALK (), a citizens' coalition. At the moment, K√∂nigstein is governed by an informal alliance of CDU/FDP/SPD and Greens. = Coat of arms = K√∂nigstein's civic coat of arms was conferred in 1907. It is based on a town seal from 1535. The towers stand for the old Imperial Castle (). The Lords of Bolanden- Falkenstein are remembered in the red and gold field in the upper right (upper left heraldically speaking), as are the Counts of N√ºrings in the black lion, and indeed the Lords of Eppstein in the three chevrons.  Economy  = Purchasing power = K√∂nigstein has an extraordinarily high level of purchasing power. In 2010, their purchasing power index was of 191 percent (compared to the national average of 100 percent) and with that the highest in Germany. = Transport = LINT 41 railcar underneath K√∂nigstein Castle heading for Frankfurt K√∂nigstein is advantageously placed for driving. By way of Federal Highways () B8 and B455, which meet in town at a roundabout, Autobahnen A 66 (Frankfurt-H√∂chst interchange), A 661 (Oberursel interchange) and A 3 (Niedernhausen interchange) can be reached in a matter of minutes. K√∂nigstein's advantageous placement, however, brings problems, too. Rush hour traffic, both in the morning and evening, regularly results in heavy traffic jams on the way into the roundabout. The nearest airport is Frankfurt International Airport. By way of the K√∂nigstein Railway ( ‚Äì FKE) and bus routes connecting the towns to the S-Bahn stations at Bad Soden (S 3) and Kronberg (S 4), K√∂nigstein is connected to Frankfurt Central Station and the whole railway network run by the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund (Rhine-Main Transport Association, RMV), and it has at its disposal stations in K√∂nigstein (main town) and Schneidhain. The Frankfurt-K√∂nigstein Railway accepts the as fare as far as K√∂nigstein im Taunus station, but the RMV only accepts it for fare area 5000 (Frankfurt am Main without the airport). = Established businesses = K√∂nigstein im Taunus is an attractive place for business. The citizens' above-average buying power is a boon to local retail businesses, the range of which is correspondingly great. Furthermore, there are quite a few independent business and personnel consultants, often former managers from industry. Through the takeover of the well known German personnel consultancy Hofmann Herbold & Partner, K√∂nigstein was for years headquarters to the biggest international executive search firm Korn/Ferry. Several spinoffs brought into being by former Korn/Ferry employees are still in business in town now. The Commerzbank maintains a large training and conference centre at the edge of town, which is also available to third parties. The Deutsche Bank also has one between Falkenstein and Kronberg.

Moreover, early in the year, and in the summer, further events also take place there: (\\"Knights' Tournament\\"), (\\"Theatre at the Castle\\"), as well as various musical and film events. Since 2005 also a series of concerts called (\\"Middle Ages rock the castle\\"). As a new open-air highlight, from 2006, the (\\"K√∂nigstein Castle Festival Games\\") will be held, bringing to the stage a multi-faceted cultural programme in the unique atmosphere of the ruins: ambitious concerts and operatic and musical productions with large casts under the open sky. As well, business in the outlying communities is shaped by many festivals and activities. = Clubs = Hotel Kempinski in K√∂nigstein-Falkenstein The (\\"Knights of K√∂nigstein\\") have committed themselves to the Middle Ages and since 1998 have been staging a yearly Knights' Tournament with a mediaeval market at K√∂nigstein's picturesque castle ruins. The local young people who do this are supported in this endeavour by the club (\\"Town Watch\\"). Furthermore, each of K√∂nigstein's constituent communities has its own sport or football club. The biggest in the whole town is , offering volleyball, judo, gymnastics, athletics, (a kind of dancing popular in Germany involving dancers in old, often 18th-century, military uniforms), and football, and having more than 800 members. The most successful football club is the (a fusion of and ), whose first team has been plying for many years in the top of the Regional Upper League (). Moreover, the club has at its disposal 21 youth teams. Also, the SG ( or \\"playing community\\") Schneidhain and FC Mammolshain play Football (soccer) in K√∂nigstein, both, however, at lower levels. From 5 to 16 June 2006, on the occasion of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the Brazilian National Team made its home at the Kempinski Hotel in Falkenstein, a five-star hotel originally built as an officers' retreat for Kaiser Wilhelm. The team trained at the \\"Altk√∂nigblick\\" sport ground, usual facility. The K√∂nigstein Fanfare Corps () won the in R√∂demis in 2005 and the Solothurner Marching Parade, in which the K√∂nigstein Fanfare Corps was the first foreign club to participate. K√∂nigstein also has, from singing clubs to a mandolin club, a karate and tennis club, and a volunteer fire brigade in every constituent community, more than 100 clubs. = Buildings = Villa Andreae The rear view of the Besides the town's landmark, the K√∂nigstein Castle ruins, other buildings are worth seeing, such as the historic Old Town with its Old Town Hall (Rathaus), and Falkenstein Castle, and the Old Town also found there. Also of interest is the , located at the top of a small wooded hill. Built in 1891 by Frankfurt Banker Albert Andreae de Neufville, it was transformed into a boarding school (Sch√ºlerheim) in the post-war years (1957‚Äì1987).Villa Andreae Thoroughly restored, it became famous as J√ºrgen Schneider's headquarters from 1987 until his multi-billion-Deutsche-Mark bankruptcy in 1994.Udo Frank, Beate Thorn: Pal√§ste, Pleiten, Peanuts.

K√∂nigstein is likewise well known for its idyllic Old Town. Its exclusive residential areas (also in Falkenstein) are mainly marked by Art Nouveau and its -influenced offshoots as well as 1960s Chic (bungalows). Lot sizes, however, are not comparable to those in other towns owing to new town planning and the building plans following therefrom. = Museums = The Castle and Town Museum () is found at the historic Old Town Hall ()  Education  = Schools = There are in K√∂nigstein various schools, among them three Gymnasien: the state Taunusgymnasium (formerly Taunusschule), the private St. Angela Schule and the private Bischof-Neumann-Schule.

Bishop Maximilian Kaller ‚Äì who was the first bishop with special authority over ethnic Germans who had been driven out of lost German territories at the end of the Second World War ‚Äì appointed philosophy professor Erich Kleineidam to the new institution in late May 1947 as a Professor. In 1948, he also became head of the seminary, and in 1949 Rector of the K√∂nigstein Philosophical-Theological College. Besides Kleineidam, others who taught at the ecclesiastical university were Anton Janko, Philipp Sch√§fer and Leo Scheffczyk. Among well known graduates were Karl Gabriel, Johannes Gr√ºndel and Gerhard Pieschl. The college produced 417 priests. It was dissolved on 15 February 1978.  Literature  For three years, from 1970 until his death in 1973, the writer and journalist Herbert Kranz (born 4 October 1891 in Nordhausen; died 30 August 1973 in Braunschweig) lived here. The book (\\"K√∂nigstein im Taunus: History and Art\\") by Beate Gro√ümann-Hofmann and Hans-Curt K√∂ster (K√∂nigstein im Taunus 2010 ) offers a detailed outline of the town's history, its castle and its outlying communities. It also includes a detailed catalogue of many buildings and objects worthy of protection. Also of importance is the book (\\"Jews in K√∂nigstein\\") by Heinz Sturm-Godramstein (). The former town archivist's documentation first appeared in 1983 and was reissued in 1998 almost unchanged.  Sundry  = Health = There is in K√∂nigstein a comprehensive offering of health services. Besides the baths, there are various clinics, among them a migraine clinic, a special clinic for psychosomatic illnesses, a heart clinic and a neurological clinic. The two spas of K√∂nigstein and Falkenstein have recently formed the entrance portal to Germany's first climatic healing park (). = Famous Personalities = * Adelheid-Marie of Anhalt-Dessau (1833 ‚Äì 1916) * Max Dessoir (1867‚Äì1947) psychologist and art historian * Franz Halder (1884‚Äì1972) Wehrmacht general * Eduard Maurer (1886‚Äì1969) chemist and metallurgist (developed V2A stainless steel) * Herbert Karl Ludwig Kranz (1891‚Äì1973) writer * Walter Christaller (1893‚Äì1969) geographer * Eugen Kogon (1903‚Äì1987) political scientist, writer, Antifascist * Richard Musgrave (1910‚Äì2007) economist * Leo Cardinal Scheffczyk (1920‚Äì2005) * J√ºrgen Schneider (1934‚Äì ) building speculator * Volker Reiche (1944‚Äì ) comic strip artist * Birgit Friedmann (1960‚Äì ) athlete * Christoph Neubronner (1960‚Äì ) jazz pianist * Hans Zimmer (1957‚Äì ) film composer and Oscar winner * Father Werenfried van Straaten (1913‚Äì2003) called \\"Speckpater\\" (\\"Bacon Father\\"); founder of the international relief organization Aid to the Church in Need * Michael Gross (1964‚Äì ) Swimmer, three-time Olympic gold medal winner * Eva Pfaff (1961‚Äì ) tennis player * Charly K√∂rbel (1954‚Äì ) soccer player * J√ºrgen Hardt (1963‚Äì ) German Politician, Christian Democratic Union member of the Bundestag  References  History and Coat of arms have their own sources.

The name derives from the two Greek words, 'aster' (star) and 'phil' (lover), and the Latin word 'stella' meaning star. Thus Astrophil is the star lover, and Stella is his star. Sidney partly nativized the key features of his Italian model Petrarch, including an ongoing but partly obscure narrative, the philosophical trappings of the poet in relation to love and desire, and musings on the art of poetic creation. Sidney also adopts the Petrarchan rhyme scheme, though he uses it with such freedom that fifteen variants are employed.Cooper, Sherod M., The Sonnets of Astrophil and Stella: A Stylistic Study (The Hague: Mouton, 1968), 64. Some have suggested that the love represented in the sequence may be a literal one as Sidney evidently connects Astrophil to himself and Stella to Lady Penelope Devereux, afterward Lady Rich. Sidney and Lady Penelope had been betrothed when the latter was a child. For some reason the match was broken off, and Lady Penelope married Lord Rich, with whom she lived for a while most unhappily. She is thought to be the Penelope Rich, the wife of Robert Rich, 3rd Baronet. Payne and Hunter suggest that modern criticism, though not explicitly rejecting this connection, leans more towards the viewpoint that writers happily create a poetic persona, artificial and distinct from themselves.Renaissance Literature: An Anthology edited by Michael Payne and John Hunter (London: Blackwell, 2003), 500. Publishing history Many of the poems were circulated in manuscript form before the first edition was printed by Thomas Newman in 1591, five years after Sidney's death. This edition included ten of Sidney's songs, a preface by Thomas Nashe and verses from other poets including Thomas Campion, Samuel Daniel and the Earl of Oxford.Sir Philip Sidney, 168-9. The text was allegedly copied down by a man in the employ of one of Sidney's associates, thus it was full of errors and misreadings that eventually led to Sidney's friends ensuring that the unsold copies were impounded.Sir Philip Sidney, 168. Newman printed a second version later in the year, and though the text was more accurate it was still flawed. The version of Astrophil and Stella commonly used is found in the folio of the 1598 version of Sidney's Arcadia. Though still not completely free from error, this was prepared under the supervision of his sister the Countess of Pembroke and is considered the most authoritative text available. All known versions of Astrophil and Stella have the poems in the same order, making it almost certain that Sidney determined their sequence. Astrophel vs. Astrophil The Oxford University Press collection of Sidney's major works has this to say about the title: > There is no evidence that the title is authorial. It derives from the first > printed text, the unauthorized quarto edition published by Thomas Newman > (1591). Newman may also have been responsible for the consistent practice in > early printings of calling the lover persona 'Astrophel'. Ringler emended to > 'Astrophil' on the grounds of etymological correctness, since the name is > presumably based on Greek aster philein, and means 'lover of a star' (with > stella meaning 'star'); the 'phil' element alluding also, no doubt, to > Sidney's Christian name.Duncan-Jones, Katherine, ed., Sir Philip Sidney: The > Major Works including \\"Astrophil and Stella\\" (Oxford: Oxford University > Press, 1989), 357  Selected sonnets  > 1 Loving in truth, and fain in verse my love to show, That she (dear She) > might take some pleasure of my pain, Pleasure might cause her read, reading > might make her know, Knowledge might pity win, and pity grace obtain, I > sought fit words to paint the blackest face of woe: Studying inventions > fine, her wits to entertain, Oft turning others' leaves, to see if thence > would flow Some fresh and fruitful showers upon my sun-burnt brain.

The Venezuelan government claimed that it had taught 1.5 million Venezuelans to read, but the study found that \\"only 1.1m were illiterate to begin with\\" and that the illiteracy reduction of less than 100,000 can be attributed to adults that were elderly and died. Previous reports had claimed that the eradication of illiteracy had been UNESCO-verified. In October 2006, Venezuelan Education Minister Arist√≥bulo Ist√∫riz clarified that Venezuela had not received a UNESCO certification because the organisation does not certify literacy programs. \\"Venezuela is a sovereign nation, Venezuela declares itself Illiteracy-Free Territory,\\" affirmed the minister.

Charles de Lorraine, 4th Duke of Guise and 3rd Prince of Joinville (20 August 1571 ‚Äì 30 September 1640), was the son of Henry I, Duke of Guise and Catherine of Cleves, and succeeded his father as Duke of Guise in 1588. Initially part of the Catholic league, he pledged his support for Henry IV of France and was made Admiral of the Levant by Louis XIII of France. After siding with the Queen Mother, Marie de' Medici, against Cardinal Richelieu, he fled to Italy with his family where he died in 1640. Biography He was born in Joinville, the son of Henry I, Duke of Guise and Catherine of Cleves. Originally styled the Chevalier de Guise, he succeeded as Duke of Chevreuse upon the death of his great-uncle Charles of Guise, Cardinal of Lorraine, a title he later resigned to his brother Claude. After his father's assassination in 1588, Charles succeeded him as Duke of Guise, but was kept in prison in Tours for three years, escaping in 1591. While the Catholic League had great hopes for him, and considered placing him on the throne, he declared his support for Henry IV of France in 1594, for which Henry paid him four million livres and made him Governor of Provence. On 17 February 1596, Charles captured Marseille from the League, restoring it to the French crown. During the reign of Louis XIII, Charles was created Grand Master of France and Admiral of the Levant. Falling into disfavor with Cardinal Richelieu for siding with Marie de' Medici, he withdrew to Italy in 1631. His wife and younger children joined him in Florence, where the family was protected by the House of Medici. His sons Fran√ßois and Charles Louis died in Italy during these years of exile. Duke Charles himself died in Cuna in 1640. His widow and children (among them Marie, Mademoiselle de Guise) were permitted to return to France in 1643. Family On 6 January 1611 he married Henriette Catherine of Joyeuse (8 January 1585 ‚Äì 25 February 1656). They had: * Fran√ßois (3 April 1612 ‚Äì 7 December 1639), Prince of Joinville, who died in Florence during the family's exile and was buried in the church of San Lorenzo and later reinterred at Joinville.

The program provides free and ongoing higher (college and graduate level) education to the two million adult Venezuelans. Mission Sucre was originally referred to as El Plan Extraordinario Mariscal Antonio Jos√© de Sucre, shortened as Misi√≥n Sucre. Named after the 18th century independence leader Antonio Jos√© de Sucre, Mission Sucre establishes as a strategy the mass education and graduation of university professionals in three years, as opposed to the traditionally mandated five or more years. The mission is thus an attempt to popularize, reform, and expand Venezuelan higher education beyond its traditional role of educating the children of a proportion of Venezuelans that can pay for collateral costs involved while studying in a college or university, due to uneven geographically distributed high education institutes (transportation expenses, housing). The program is thus geared especially towards economically excluded high school students and the poorest and most marginalized segments of society, providing an opportunity for all people desiring a higher education. In this mission, certain matters and subjects, such as foreign languages, are mostly left out of the curriculum. The program functions mostly at the margins of the Venezuelan tertiary education system, although several key institutions, such as Simon Bolivar University, have endorsed the program. For example, thousands of non-traditional, mostly low income students are currently undergoing training to become licensed physicians in a unique and accelerated curriculum. Mission Sucre imparts tertiary education; other educational missions include Mission Robinson (for instructing the illiterate) and Mission Ribas (for obtaining secondary studies, classes, and graduation certificates).  Objectives  The objectives of Mission Sucre are officially stated as follows: 'To harness institutional synergy and community participation to guarantee access to university education for all undergraduates and to transform the condition of those excluded from the subsystem of higher education. To combine a vision of social justice with the strategic character of higher education for sustainable all-round human development, national sovereignty and the construction of a democratic and participatory society, for which purpose it is indispensable to guarantee the participation of the whole society in the making, transformation, diffusion and creative exploitation of knowledge and deeds.'  Origins of mass higher education  In the last decades of the 20th century, the Venezuelan government prior to the Ch√°vez administration was steadily renouncing its support in areas involving education; specifically, it decreased support for tertiary education for the poor. In fact, government funding and investment in higher education in Venezuela between 1989 and 1998 saw a marked downward trend. Ch√°vez became president in 1999. The trend marked the government's desire to reduce resources and state support for education while furthering the project of privatization of higher education, as per the doctrines of the Washington Consensus and neoliberalism. This brought consequences such as a large accumulated \\"social debt\\" (the sum tabulation of governmental neglect of a given area, such as the total of all funds that could have been spent on education, but instead were spent elsewhere), because the number of university matriculations stagnated, resulting in the exclusion of students originating from Venezuela's poorest sectors. Numerous studies agree that entrance to higher education predisposes students from any background to eventually earn greater incomes, both of the population of the cities and to students originating from elite private schools. On a par with this phenomenon, the tertiary education turning out official governmental managers reduced its participation in the education of private (corporate) management. From 1999, the National Government has dedicated efforts to strengthen the Venezuelan educational system, for which it has been indispensable to rescue the initiative of the State as a guarantor of high quality educational opportunities for all. With respect to the access to higher education, the National Government has achieved an expansion in matriculations to the Institutes and Schools and in good part to the Experimental National Universities, in a joint work with the authorities and the established communities of these institutions. In addition, starting from the beginning of Ch√°vez's presidential mandate in 1999, five new universities have been founded. These universities are: Experimental National University of Yaracuy (created by decree in the government of Rafael Caldera and opened under the Ch√°vez presidency); Maritime University of the Caribbean; National Experimental University of the Armed Forces (UNEFA); Experimental National University of South of the Lake (that is, south of Lake Maracaibo) and the Bolivarian University of Venezuela. Also, four new University Institutes of Technology have been created; these are: the IUT of Bol√≠var State, the IUT of Apure State, the IUT of Barinas State and the IUT in la Fr√≠a T√°chira State. These institutions give new opportunities for study for the enormous number of college graduates who return to lower levels of education, and in addition they respond to the necessity to transform the system of tertiary education, in terms of geographic distribution, based on the construction of the Territorial Balance designed in the manner of the Economic and Social Plan of Development 2001‚Äì2007. Nevertheless, this effort remains far short of meeting overall demand, such is the extent of the social debt accumulated by previous administrations' neglect of popularized higher education. There are around 500,000 bachelor's degree holders who remain excluded from professional tertiary education.

It lies within the City of Charles Sturt. The postcode of Woodville is 5011. Woodville is bound by Cheltenham Parade to the west, Torrens Road to the north, Port Road to the south and Park Street to the east, excluding the area of Cheltenham Park Racecourse. History Woodville was one of the first areas to be settled by European migrants in the mid-19th century, many establishing dairy farms in the vicinity. By 1853 Woodville consisted of 24 houses, a forge and a wheelwright‚Äôs shop. The Woodville Post Office opened around March 1856. It has many fine examples of colonial and federation architecture and was considered to be a genteel area. Many European migrants settled in Woodville and the surrounds after World War II. It was a busy local centre in the 1950s and 1960s when General Motors Holden had a car manufacturing plant in the nearby suburb of Cheltenham and because of its proximity to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Woodville South. Woodville Road was the hub of local activity with numerous commercial businesses. During the 1980s and 1990s, Woodville and its surrounds became home to many Vietnamese refugees from the Vietnam War. Decline set in in the 1980s upon the closure of the Cheltenham plant of General Motors Holden. Woodville became a depressed suburb, particularly during the 1990s. Since then, Woodville is undergoing a revival and many are now seeking residence in Woodville because of its architecture. Woodville Road, although not as a lively as it once was, is starting to develop a personality again. Woodville's inhabitants are still multiethnic. It was previously the home of the semi-professional Australian rules football team Woodville Football Club, which competed in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL). Woodville merged with the West Torrens Football Club to form the Woodville-West Torrens Eagles in 1991. Suburbs adjacent to Woodville: Woodville Gardens, Woodville Park, Woodville West. The local zone high school is Woodville High School. In 2005, the Woodville Warriors won the ABL (Australian Basketball League) championship, which is South Australia's state league. This was their first championship since 2000. Demographics In the 2016 Census, there were 1,999 people in Woodville, of which 49.2% were male and 50.8% were female. The median age was 39, compared to a median of 40 for the State of South Australia. 3.2% of the population was over 85%, compared to 2.7% for South Australia and 2.1% for Australia. 23.2% of residents had completed study at a university or tertiary institution, compared to a State average of 16.2.

The most common responses for religion in the 2016 census were No Religion 27.3%, Catholic 26.8%, Not stated 8.4%, Anglican 6.1% and Eastern Orthodox 5.7%. Christianity was the largest religious group reported overall (53.4%). Heritage St Clair, was built in 1840 as a residence for John Newman. Woodville has two items listed as State Heritage Places. St Margaret's Anglican Church, located at 789-791 Port Road, was dedicated in 1856 and is constructed of picked limestone. The structure is dominated by a rectangular tower and the church contains stained glass windows which honour local pioneers. A lych-gate, which is also heritage listed, was built in 1919 as a memorial to Woodville men who served in World War One. The church is significant as one of several 'village' churches built within the Adelaide districts between 1836 and 1860, as well as its representation of the development of the early Anglican Church within South Australia. The Brocas Museum, located on Woodville Road, is the former residence of John Newman, a shipping agent, and Henry Fletcher. The heritage significance of the Brocas includes its representation of the scale and style of residence built by the Adelaide gentry in what was at the time a semi-rural district. Significant parts of Woodville have been declared a Historic Conservation Zone which includes the adjacent suburb of Woodville Park. The Zone contains a number of buildings of local heritage significance, including the Mareeba Hospital and former Nurses Home at 19-21 Belmore Terrace, the former Woodville Private Hospital building at 2 Jelley Street, currently a nursing home, former Council chambers at 765 Port Road, the Woodville Town Hall and Council chambers, the original school building and gates of Woodville High School, as well as several private residences and former residences on Woodville Road, Torrens Road, Stanley Street and Belmore Terrace. A number of homes within Woodville are listed as contributory items to the Historic Conservation Zone within the City of Charles Sturt's Development Plan. These include houses within Beaufort Street, Belmore Terrace, Florence Street, Harvey Street, Hughes Street, Norman Street, Park Street, Russell terrace, Stanley Street, The Grove and Woodville Road. Woodville contained a number of other significant buildings which have since been demolished. These included St Clair, the homestead by John Bristow Hughes in 1854. Under Hughes' ownership, St Clair became one of the largest mansions in Adelaide at that time. Hughes added an underground kitchen, a second storey, and the entire ground floor was converted into a ballroom. The home was demolished and replaced by the St Clair Recreation Centre, which is itself local heritage listed on account of being South Australia's first major youth centre and indoor sports stadium and its modernist architecture. Places of worship St Margaret's Anglican Church on the corner of Port Road and Woodville Road represents one of the finest examples of early village churches within the Adelaide districts, dedicated in 1856. The Ukrainian Catholic Church ‚ÄòSaints Volodymyr and Olha Church‚Äô, is located on Woodville Road and was constructed in 1963 by the local Ukrainian community. The building is listed as a Local Heritage Place. The Woodville Christadelphian Hall is located on Aberfeldy Avenue. References Further reading *Hardy, M.

Synopsis  Weyer disagreed with certain contemporaries about the justification of witch-hunting. Weyer believed that most, probably all, cases of alleged witchcraft resulted from delusions of the alleged witch, rather than actual, voluntary cooperation with spiritual evil. In brief, Weyer claimed that cases of alleged witchcraft were psychological rather than supernatural in origin.Stuart Clark, Thinking with demons: the idea of witchcraft in early modern Europe (Oxford University Press, 1999; ), pp. 198 - 202 The book contains a famous appendix also circulated independently as the Pseudomonarchia Daemonum, a listing of the names and titles of infernal spirits, and the powers alleged to be wielded by each of them. Weyer relates that his source for this intelligence was a book called Liber officiorum spirituum, seu liber dictus Empto Salomonis, de principibus et regibus demoniorum (\\"The book of the offices of spirits, or the book called Empto, by Solomon, about the princes and kings of demons).Joseph H. Peterson, The lesser key of Solomon: lemegeton clavicula Salomonis (Weiser, 2001; ), pp. xiii - xiv Weyer's reason for presenting this material was not to instruct his readers in diabolism, but rather to \\"expose to all men\\" the pretensions of those who claimed to be able to work magic, men who \\"are not embarrassed to boast that they are mages, and their oddness, deceptions, vanity, folly, fakery, madness, absence of mind, and obvious lies, to put their hallucinations into the bright light of day.\\"qui se magos jactitare non erubescunt, curiositas, pr√¶stigi√¶, vanitas, dolus, impostur√¶, deliria, mens elusa, & manifesta mendacia, quinimo non ferend√¶ blasphemi√¶, omnium mortalium, qui in medi√¶ lucis splendore hallucinari nolint....

Named for the German chemists Fritz Arndt (1885-1969) and Bernd Eistert (1902-1978), the method entails treating an acid chlorides with diazomethane. It is a popular method of producing Œ≤-amino acids from Œ±-amino acids. Conditions Aside from the acid chloride substrate, three reagents are required: diazomethane, water, and a metal catalyst. Each has been well investigated. The diazomethane is required in excess so as to react with the HCl formed previously. Not taking diazomethane in excess results in HCl reacting with the diazoketone to form chloromethyl ketone and N2. Mild conditions allow this reaction to take place while not affecting complex or reducible groups in the reactant-acid. The reaction requires the presence of a nucleophile (water). A metal catalyst is required. Usually Ag2O is chosen but other metals and even light effect the reaction. :Arndt-Eistert reaction with ketene intermediate. =Variants= The preparation of the beta- amino acid from phenylalanine illustrates the Arndt‚ÄìEistert synthesis carried out with the Newman‚ÄìBeal modification, which involves the inclusion of triethylamine in the diazomethane solution Either triethylamine or a second equivalent of diazomethane will scavenge HCl, avoiding the formation of Œ±-chloromethylketone side-products. Diazomethane is the traditional reagent, but analogues can also be applied. Diazomethane is toxic and potentially violently explosive, which has led to safer alternative procedures, For example, diazo(trimethylsilyl)methane has been demonstrated. Acid anhydrides can be used in place of acid chloride. The reaction yields a 1:1 mixture of the homologated acid and the corresponding methyl ester. This method can also be used with primary diazoalkanes, to produce secondary Œ±-diazo ketones. However, there are many limitations. Primary diazoalkanes undergo azo coupling to form azines; thus the reaction conditions must be altered such that acid chloride is added to a solution of diazoalkane and triethylamine at low temperature. In addition, primary diazoalkanes are very reactive, incompatible with acidic functionalities, and will react with activated alkenes including unsaturated carbonyls to give 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition products. An alternative to the Arndt‚ÄìEistert reaction is the Kowalski ester homologation, which also involves the generation of a carbene equivalent but avoids diazomethane. Reaction mechanism The acid chloride suffers attack by diazomethane with loss of HCl. The alpha-diazoketone (RC(O)CHN2) product undergoes the metal-catalyzed Wolff rearrangement to form a ketene, which hydrates to the acid. The rearrangement leaves untouched the stereochemistry at the carbon alpha to the acid chloride. :Homologation of N-boc-phenylalanine Historical readings See also *Curtius rearrangement *Kowalski ester homologation *Lossen rearrangement *Nierenstein reaction *Wolff rearrangement References Rearrangement reactions Carbon- carbon bond forming reactions Name reactions Homologation reactions ","title":"Arndt‚ÄìEistert reaction"},{"id":"2950880","text":"Dirk Skreber's Untitled (Train) (courtesy Frank Cohen Collection) Dirk Skreber, (b. 1961 L√ºbeck, Germany) is a contemporary artist who lives and works in New York City.

Background Metafluid dynamics was an effort to connect the ephemeral and statistical nature of quantum mechanical objects with the temporary and statistical, but yet stable, nature of \\"structures\\" in turbulent flows; that work was published as a research thesis (Marmanis 1993). The works that influenced its conception were Albert Einstein's insistence on a causal interpretation of quantum mechanics, De Broglie's mechanical models, and related work along these lines. The literature on the subject of aether models was discovered by the author upon completion of the theory's core ideas during the academic years 1994 and 1995. History The term \\"metafluid dynamics\\" appeared for the first time in a conference talk delivered in the \\"International Symposium on Theoretical and Computational Fluid Dynamics\\" at Florida State University on November 7, 1996. =Initial publications= The theory was published, in the Physics of Fluids under the title Analogy between the Navier-Stokes and Maxwell's equations: Application to Turbulence (Marmanis 1998). A year later, the theory was presented in more detail in the thesis entitled Analogy between the Electromagnetic and Hydrodynamic Equations: Application to Turbulence (Marmanis 1999). This paper attempted to introduce an ontological connection between turbulent motion as described by the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations and dynamics of the electromagnetic field as described by Maxwell's equations. The paper observed that the electromagnetic field is non-linear when expressed in terms of the electromagnetic potentials‚Äîyet Maxwell's equations are linear due to the original modeling of charge and current. It should be stressed that this ontological interpretation was never previously published, although several fluid models have been presented as early as 1890, for the same purpose. The last article by the same author, namely, \\"Turbulence, electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics: A common perspective\\" was published in the book Photon: Old problems in light of new ideas (Dvoeglazov 2000). The metafluid dynamics was not created by trial-and- error of mechanical models of aether and is not an analogy that was revived; a juxtaposition of the fields that are involved in earlier models and those that are involved in the metafluid dynamics suffices as a proof. For historical references, see, the comprehensive book by Whittaker (1951). =Later publications= Since that time there have been several other publications that relate directly or indirectly to the metafluid dynamics: *In 1999, R.M. Kirby, H. Marmanis and D.H. Laidlaw presented the first visualizations of turbulent charge‚Äîthe analog of the electric charge in electromagnetism‚Äîin a conference paper entitled \\"Visualizing Multivalued Data from 2D Incompressible Flows Using Concepts from Painting\\". *In 2000, A. C. R. Mendes, W. Oliveira and F.I. Takakura presented hydrodynamic turbulence as a constrained system from the point of view of metafluid dynamics in \\"Turbulence as a constrained system\\". This is the first Lagrangian description of metafluid dynamics that the author is aware of. *In 2001, G. Rousseaux discussed the question of completeness for Maxwell's equations in Les √©quations de Maxwell sont-elles incompl√®tes? and the position of the metafluid dynamics on that matter. *In 2002, G. Rousseaux and √â. Guyon presented a review of the metafluid dynamics in the paper \\"√Ä propos d‚Äôune analogie entre la m√©canique des fluides et l‚Äô√©lectromagn√©tisme\\". *In 2003, A. C. R. Mendes, C. Neves, W. Oliveira and F.I. Takakura presented the metafluid dynamics as a gauge field theory. *In 2003, L. Saul presented a kinetic theory of a space-time model that is endowed with spin. In that context, by following the analogy that forms the core of metafluid dynamics, the author shows how to derive (to first order) Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism and Schr√∂dinger's equation for the electron. *In 2004, D. B«éleanu presented the metafluid dynamics as a constrained system within fractional Riemann-Liouville derivatives. *In 2005, A. C. R. Mendes, C. Neves, W. Oliveira and F.I. Takakura applied the Dirac quantization condition to the metafluid dynamics on NC spaces. *In 2005, D. B«éleanu published the Metafluid dynamics and Hamilton-Jacobi formalism and the existence of the hidden gauge symmetry was analyzed. The main point of this work is that the obtained results are in agreement with those of the Faddeev-Jackiw approach. *In 2005, Z. Akdeniz, P. Vignolo and M.P. Tosi published the paper \\"Shell structure in the density profile of a rotating gas of spin-polarized fermions\\". The authors of that paper study a Fermi gas of spin-polarized charged particles in a uniform magnetic field, under conditions such that the Coulomb interactions can be neglected, can be mapped into a rotating Fermi gas of neutral atomic particles in a state of complete spin polarization, where the atom‚Äìatom interactions are negligible on account of the Pauli principle suppressing s-wave scattering. The interesting part here is that the authors invoke the metafluid dynamics correspondence to establish the map. References *B«éleanu D.

Today, the two words are used interchangeably. The word bequeath is a verb form for the act of making a bequest. Etymology Bequest comes from Old English becwethan, \\"to declare or express in words\\" ‚Äî cf. \\"quoth\\".  Interpreting bequests  Part of the process of probate involves interpreting the instructions in a will. Some wordings that define the scope of a bequest have specific interpretations. \\"All the estate I own\\" would involve all of the decedent's possessions at the moment of death.Law.com, Law Dictionary: all the estate I own A conditional request is a bequest that will be granted only if a particular event has occurred by the time of its operation. For example, a testator might write in the will that \\"Mary will receive the house held in trust if she is married\\" or \\"if she has children,\\" etc. An executory request is a bequest that will be granted only if a particular event occurs in the future. For example, a testator might write in the will that \\"Mary will receive the house held in trust set when she marries\\" or \\"when she has children\\". In some jurisdictions, a bequest can also be a deferred payment, as held in Wolder v. Commissioner, which will impact its tax status.  Explaining bequests  In microeconomics theorists have engaged the issue of bequest from the perspective of consumption theory, in which they seek to explain the phenomenon in terms of a bequest motive.  Examples  =Oudh bequest= The Oudh Bequest is a waqf which led to the gradual transfer of more than six million rupees from the Indian kingdom of Oudh (Awadh) to the Shia holy cities of Najaf and Karbala between 1850 and 1903. The bequest first reached the cities in 1850. It was distributed by two mujtahids, one from each city. The British later gradually took over the bequest and its distribution; according to scholars, they intended to use it as a \\"power lever\\" to influence Iranian ulama and Shia. =United States=  For the recipient  In order to calculate a taxpayer's income tax obligation, the gross income of the taxpayer must be determined. Under Section 61 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code gross income is \\"all income from whatever source derived\\". On its face, the receipt of a bequest would seemingly fall within gross income and thus be subject to tax. However, in other sections of the code, exceptions are made for a variety of things that do not need to be included in gross income. Section 102(a) of the Code makes an exception for bequests stating that \\"Gross income does not include the value of property acquired by gift, bequest, or inheritance.\\" In general this means that the value or amount of the bequest does not need to be included in a taxpayer's gross income. This rule is not exclusive, however, and there are some exceptions under Section 102(b) of the code where the amount of value must be included. There is great debate about whether or not bequests should be included in gross income and subject to income taxes, however there has been some type of exclusion for bequests in every Federal Income Tax Act.Samuel A. Donaldson (2007). Federal Income Taxation of Individuals: Cases, Problems and Materials, 2nd Edition, St. Paul: Thomson/West, 93  For the donor  One reason that the recipient of a bequest is usually not taxed on the bequest is because the donor may be taxed on it. Donors of bequests may be taxed through other mechanisms such as federal wealth transfer taxes. Wealth Transfer taxes, however, are usually imposed against only the very wealthy.

The main road which runs through Barnhartvale is Barnhartvale Road. Todd Road and Pratt Road are the main accesses through the subdivided western portion of Barnhartvale. History Barnhartvale was originally referred to as Campbell Creek or Campbell's Creek until 1909. It is now named after Peter Barnhart, who was the conductor on the first CPR train through Kamloops. He moved to Campbell Creek and opened a post office and in 1909 the name was changed to Barnhart Vale Post to the annoyance of locals. In 1978 the spelling was formally changed to one word, Barnhartvale. 1865 marks the beginning of the written history of the area later named Barnhartvale. That was the year that James Todd and Lew Campbell, the first two pioneers, arrived. The next settlers in the region were John and William McLeod in 1879. A major road in the area is named after the Robert and Henry Pratt families who occupied the bulk of the valley after 1890.

Known as the Ocean City Expressway, the state highway runs from U.S. Route 50 (US 50) near Whaleyville to MD 528 in Ocean City. MD 90 is a two-lane expressway that provides one of the main access routes to Ocean City, especially the northern part of the resort town, and thus sees heavy seasonal traffic. The highway was constructed from Ocean City starting in 1970. The state highway was opened west to MD 589 in 1972 and to US 113 in 1975. MD 90 was completed west to US 50 in 1976. Route description View east along MD 90 at MD 589 in Ocean Pines MD 90 begins at a partial directional interchange with US 50 (Ocean Gateway) east of Whaleyville. There is no access from westbound MD 90 to eastbound US 50 or from westbound US 50 to eastbound MD 90. MD 90 heads east as a two-lane undivided freeway with rumble strips within the painted median. Headlight use is required at all times. After passing under MD 346 (Old Ocean City Boulevard) with no access, the state highway crosses over Church Branch. MD 90 crosses over the Snow Hill Line of the Maryland and Delaware Railroad before reaching a partial cloverleaf interchange with US 113 (Worcester Highway). After passing over MD 575 (Worcester Highway), the old alignment of US 113, with no access, the state highway becomes divided with a narrow guardrail median barrier. MD 90 continues east through Ocean Pines, where the highway has a diamond interchange with MD 589 (Racetrack Road) and passes over Ocean Parkway within that community. The median barrier ends and the state highway becomes an undivided highway again immediately before crossing the St. Martin River on a long bridge. A median returns right after the bridge ends at Isle of Wight, where MD 90 has an at-grade signalized intersection with St. Martins Neck Road and the entrance to Isle of Wight Nature Park. MD 90 becomes undivided again for the Assawoman Bay Bridge over the Assawoman Bay. After that bridge, the state highway expands to four lanes with a Jersey barrier for a short distance before its terminal intersection with MD 528 (Coastal Highway) at 62nd Street in the Midtown section of Ocean City. MD 90 serves as an access route to the northern part of Ocean City and sees heavy traffic in the summer months. The route is also designated as a hurricane evacuation route out of Ocean City in which contraflow lane reversal can be used for a quicker evacuation. MD 90 is a part of the main National Highway System for its entire length. History MD 90 westbound past eastern terminus at MD 528 in Ocean City Construction on MD 90 began in 1970 with the construction of the bridges over the St. Martin River and Assawoman Bay, which were completed in 1970 and 1971, respectively. The state highway was completed and opened between MD 528 and MD 589 in 1972. Construction west to US 113 commenced in 1973 and west to US 50 in 1974. MD 90 was extended west to US 113, which at the time followed today's MD 575, in 1975. The state highway was completed when the highway opened between US 50 and US 113 in 1976. MD 90's present interchange with US 113 was constructed in 1976. However, the interchange remained unused until US 113 was relocated as a four-lane divided highway from Berlin north past MD 90 in 2000. The interchange ramp with MD 575 was closed and removed shortly after the new interchange opened. In 2009, Mayor Rick Meehan of Ocean City pushed for dualization of the MD 90 bridge, stating that it \\"is the quicker way in and out of town, especially if you look at all the development that has taken place along the Route 50 corridor.\\" He also stated that dualization is good for the route for evacuation purposes.

Her film recounts the Fifth Party Rally of the Nazi Party, which occurred in Nuremberg from 30 August to 3 September 1933. The film is of great historic interest because it shows Adolf Hitler and Ernst R√∂hm on close and intimate terms, before R√∂hm was shot on the orders of Hitler during the Night of the Long Knives on 1 July 1934. As he then sought to erase R√∂hm from German history, all known copies of the film were destroyed on Hitler's orders, and it was considered lost until a copy turned up in the 1980s in East Germany. The form of the film is very similar to her later and much more expansive film of the 1934 rally, Triumph of the Will. Der Sieg des Glaubens is Nazi propaganda for the Nazi Party, which funded and promoted the film, which celebrates the victory of the Nazis in achieving power when Hitler assumed the role of Chancellor of Germany in January 1933. Synopsis Ernst R√∂hm, Sturmabteilung (SA) Chief of Staff, with Hitler in August 1933. The following year, R√∂hm was shot on Hitler's orders, after he refused to commit suicide, in the Night of the Long Knives purge of 1934. Rudolf Hess in 1933 Like her Nazi propaganda films of 1935, the short Tag der Freiheit: Unsere Wehrmacht (Day of Freedom: Our Armed Forces) and the classic propaganda feature Triumph of the Will, Der Sieg des Glaubens documents a Nazi Party rally, the Fifth NSDAP Congress, in a straight chronological format. It has no voiceover or commentary. The activities captured include the welcoming of foreign diplomats and other party members and politicians - such as Franz von Papen - at the Nuremberg train station; Adolf Hitler's arrival at the airport and his meeting with important party members such as Joseph Goebbels and Hermann G√∂ring; massive Sturmabteilung (SA, colloquially known as \\"Brownshirts\\") parades; and Hitler's speech on the assumption of power by the party, and the tenth anniversary of the German National Socialist movement. The events shown are in roughly chronological order, starting with the arrival of Hitler in Nuremberg and the welcome given by the Nuremberg Gauleiter, Julius Streicher. Rudolf Hess is shown sitting next to Hitler, and the Fuhrer passes him a bunch of flowers given to him by admirers. Hitler is also shown in several cameos with Ernst R√∂hm, then leader of the SA. The welcome includes a speech from a senior official of the Italian National Fascist Party, Arturo Marpicati, with conveyed greetings from Benito Mussolini. It is followed by the rally on the vast parade ground recently built by Albert Speer, and includes a shot of a Zeppelin airship floating by, complete with swastika on the tailfin. There is also a separate rally of Hitler Youth, with an introduction by Baldur von Schirach. There follows a march past in the streets of the old city, with the party leaders receiving the salutes of the massed goosestepping ranks of the SA and the SS. Familiar faces include Hermann G√∂ring and a brief cameo appearance of Heinrich Himmler, who would be the star of Riefenstahl's next propaganda film, The Triumph of the Will, after his and G≈çring's successful efforts incite Hitler to massacre the leadership of the SA. Marching troops feature again in the final sequences in the main parade ground, with tributes to the fallen from Hitler and R√∂hm, and various flag ceremonies which appear to have quasi-religious significance to the members of the party. The shots of marching feet and legs has an almost hypnotic effect on the viewer, well parodied by a later British wartime short which matches the time of the marching to the popular song \\"The Lambeth Walk\\". Ernst R√∂hm Ernst R√∂hm, head of the SA and, at the time, the second most powerful man within the Nazi Party, is prominent in The Victory of Faith. In less than a year, during the Night of the Long Knives, R√∂hm and many of his lieutenants would be executed under Hitler's orders. Hitler personally roused R√∂hm from his bed at his lakeside hotel when he arrested him for alleged treason in devising a plot against Hitler, a trumped up charge created by Himmler, G√∂ring and Reinhard Heydrich. All references to R√∂hm were ordered to be erased from German history, which included the destruction of all known copies of the film in 1934, probably on Hitler's order.Hitler: Ascent, 1889-1939, by Volker Ullrich, Vintage Publishing, p=532. The 1935 film Triumph of the Will was produced to replace it but differs in that the upper hierarchy of the Party, \\"Hitler's paladins\\",Kershaw, Ian. The 'Hitler Myth': Image ad Reality in the Third Reich Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1987. pp.69-70 (n56). do not receive nearly as much attention in the later film as they did in the earlier one. (This film can also be viewed on the Internet Archive.)Triumph of the Will, Triumph des Willens, Internet Archive Relation to Triumph of the Will Riefenstahl's next propaganda film, Triumph of the Will, which documented the next year's party rally, follows a similar script, which is evident when one sees both films side by side. For example, the city of Nuremberg scenes - down to the shot of a cat that is included in a car-driving sequence in both films. There are panning shots across the roofs of the old town, showing the city awakening before the rally starts in earnest. The camera angles and editing that made Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will a ground-breaking film are already demonstrated in The Victory of Faith. Furthermore, Herbert Windt reused much of the musical score for this film in the later one, which he also scored. Hitler congratulates Leni Riefenstahl in 1934 Preservation status After the war, it was assumed that all copies had been destroyed, including Riefenstahl's personal copy, making it a lost film. In the 1980s, a copy turned up in the German Democratic Republic's film archives.

Easterly. Dan Rice (January 23, 1823 - February 22, 1900) was an American entertainer of many talents, most famously as a clown, who was pre-eminent before the American Civil War. During the height of his career, Rice was a household name. Dan Rice was also an innovator, as he coined the terms \\"One Horse Show\\" and \\"Greatest Show\\" whilst becoming the pacesetter for the popularization of the barrel-style \\"French\\" cuff. He was a leading personality in the new American \\"pop culture\\", brought on by the technological changes of the Industrial Revolution and resultant mass culture.David Carlyon. Dan Rice: The Most Famous Man You've Never Heard Of Rice became so popular he ran for President of the United States in 1868. With changes in circus venues and popular culture after the Civil War, his legendary talents under the big top have gradually slipped into almost total historical obscurity such that in 2001, biographer David Carlyon called him \\"the most famous man you've never heard of\\". Biography Dan Rice informational sign in Girard Borough, PA Born Daniel McLaren in New York City, Rice gained 19th century fame with many talents, most of which involved him gallivanting around as a clown figure in circuses. In addition to his 'clowning' talents, he was an animal trainer, songwriter, commentator, political humorist, strong man, actor, director, producer, dancer, and politician. He ran for Senate, Congress, and President of the United States -- dropping out of each race. Rice's uncle was a ringmaster for the Howes & TurnerWho's Who in the American Circus: Sturtevant's List of Circuses 1724‚Äì1849 circus, organized in Salem, New York, in 1826. According to Rice himself, this was the first American circus to feature the canvas top that became so iconic. He traveled with this circus for 'several years' as a youngster.The Indianapolis Journal, The Sunday Journal, 10 May 1903. Rice changed the circus into what it is today by combining animals, acrobats and clowns. His first break came in 1841, when he got a job of presenting a pig named Sybil who could do many tricks, including the ability to tell time. From there he moved on to singing and dancing, and got caught up briefly in the popularity of the 'negro song', singing in blackface. Gaining fame and popularity, he changed styles once again; he starred in various parodies of works by William Shakespeare, including that of \\"Dan Rice's Version of Othello\\" and \\"Dan Rice's Multifarious Account of Shakespeare's Hamlet\\". He would perform these with various songs and dialects. \\"Rice was not simply funnier than other clowns; he was different, mingling jokes, solemn thoughts, civic observations, and songs.\\" During the 1847‚Äì48 season he was working with the circus of Gilbert R. Spalding.William L. Slout, Olympians of the Sawdust Circle: A Biographical Dictionary of the 19th-Century American Circus, The Borgo Press (1998) via ‚Äì Google Books p. 281 Expanding his horizons, he went into producing his own shows, and often had more than one tour going on at the same time. He wanted to move on from his frivolous clowning, and reinvented himself into a gentleman. He started to take up politics and would often have Democratic undertones in his shows. He was then regarded as not only a multi- talented performer, but a smart and noble man who was to be admired. He won the affection of many newspapers and publicists, including those of a then unknown Mark Twain and Walt Whitman. Mark Twain paid him homage in his description of a circus in Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and it is likely a boyhood Twain actually saw Rice perform when his circus came to Hannibal for a show. His shows became more famous than any of the other shows touring at the time, including that of rival, Phineas Taylor Barnum. During the 19th century, his name was synonymous with theater. He reinvented the theater into a vaudevillian style before there was vaudeville. He was very patriotic, later influencing the likes of George M. Cohan. He was also one of the main models for \\"Uncle Sam\\". He died almost penniless in 1900 and is buried in the Old First Methodist Church cemetery in West Long Branch, New Jersey. His fame is still celebrated to this day. The small town of Girard, Pennsylvania has a three-day festival dedicated to Dan Rice called \\"Dan Rice Days\\". He had a home in Girard and lived there for many years. Expressions Dan Rice in his later years A number of popular expressions came into being around Dan Rice. * Rice campaigned for Zachary Taylor as president, inviting him to campaign on the circus bandwagon, whence the expression \\"to jump on the bandwagon\\". * Early in his career, Rice was down on his luck and only had one horse (in early circuses the core show was a horse show). His competitors mocked him, saying it was a \\"one horse show\\" as a derogatory. Rice was able to turn the expression around by putting on a good show, and it became famously attached to him for the rest of his life. * The rallying cry of \\"Hey, Rube!\\" ‚Äì later transformed into a noun ‚Äì originated in New Orleans in 1848 when a member of Rice's troupe was attacked by a mob and he yelled to his friend Reuben, \\"Hey, Rube!\\". The phrase is most commonly known today in the circus world as a \\"Hey, Rube\\" meaning \\"come help in this fight\\". * Decades before other circuses used the phrase, an Arkansas paper praised Rice's as \\"The Greatest Show on Earth.\\" See also *G.

In libraries, art galleries, museums and archives, an accession number is a unique identifier assigned to, and achieving initial control of, each acquisition. Assignment of accession numbers typically occurs at the point of accessioning or cataloging. The term is something of a misnomer, because the form accession numbers take is often alpha-numeric.Witt, B.S., Whittfield, J.C., Stepansky, A.J.

In libraries, this numbering system is usually in addition to the library classification number (or alphanumeric code) and to the ISBN or International Standard Book Number assigned by publishers. Accession numbers are also used in botany, by institutions with living collections like arboreta, botanic gardens, etc., to identify plants or groups of plants that are of the same taxon, are of the same propagule type (or treatment), were received from the same source, were received at the same time.Jebb, Matthew (1998) Cataloguing and Record keeping for Plant Collections Retrieved from http://www.botanicgardens.ie/educ/accnosho.pdf Herbaria and other botanic institutions collecting non living material also use accession numbers.

In addition, departments or art classifications within the collection or museum may reserve sections of numbers. For example, objects identified by the numbers 11.000 through 11.999 may indicate objects obtained by the museum in 1911; the first 300 numbers might be used to indicate American art, while the next fifty (11.301‚Äì350) might be used for African art.

Juazeiro do Norte is best known as the base of the charismatic priest and politician Padre C√≠cero (C√≠cero Rom√£o Batista) (1844-1934). A pilgrimage in his honour takes place every November, attracting thousands of followers. The city is served by Orlando Bezerra de Menezes Airport. Juazeiro do Norte is connected to the nearby city of Crato by a commuter rail line called the Cariri Metro that opened in 2009‚Äì2010. History Juazeiro do Norte was initially a district of the nearby city of Crato, until a young Padre C√≠cero Rom√£o Batista decided to stay as a cleric in the village. Padre C√≠cero was then responsible for the independence and emancipation of the city. Because of the so-called \\"milagre de Juazeiro\\" (\\"miracle in Juazeiro\\", when Padre C√≠cero gave the sacred host to the religious sister Maria de Ara√∫jo, the host became blood), the priest was associated with mystical characteristics and began to be venerated by the people as a saint. Today the city is the second largest in the state and a reference in the Northeast region thanks to the priest.

Portrayed by Julie Goodyear, the character first appeared on screen during the episode airing on Monday 25 May 1966. Appearing over 25 years, Bet became a Coronation Street icon. Bet first appeared back in May 1966, but did not become a regular until four and half years later in December 1970. In October 1995, Goodyear made a permanent departure after on- screen Bet was unable to pay her debts and fled Weatherfield. She returned in June 2002 in what was intended to be a permanent return for the character. However, Goodyear quit after just two weeks in what was put down to the exhausting work schedule. The following year, Goodyear returned temporarily in a storyline that accommodated the return of Beverley Callard as Liz McDonald. She last appeared in November 2003. She was initially made a barmaid at the Rovers Return Inn and later became the landlady. Bet likes to dress in a way she considers glamorous and has a fondness for leopard print clothes and a beehive hairstyle. This iconic appearance became the inspiration for Freddie Mercury's drag character in the music video for I Want To Break Free by rock band Queen. Storylines Bet was born to parents Patrick and Mary Lynch. Her father left when she was six months old, and Bet received a strict Roman Catholic upbringing by her mother, but that did not stop her becoming Miss Weatherfield in 1955. When she was sixteen, she met a man named Joe Mason at a party, who was twelve years older than her. After learning Bet was pregnant, Joe left and she gave birth to a baby boy called Martin but her mother insisted that the Downes family adopted him. Bet arrives in Weatherfield in 1966 when working at the PVC factory. She has an affair with her boss John Benjamin and gives Lucille Hewitt (Jennifer Moss) a black eye, because of her jealousy at Lucille's speed of welding. She leaves a few weeks later but returns to Coronation Street in 1970 when she bumps into Irma Barlow (Sandra Gough), remembering her from when she worked with her at the factory four years earlier. Later in the year, Bet becomes a junior barmaid in the Rovers Return Inn, appointed by Billy Walker (Ken Farrington). She has numerous relationships with many people, including well-known Street residents such as Len Fairclough (Peter Adamson) and Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs). In April 1975, Bet receives news that her 19-year-old son Martin (who she gave up for adoption when he was a baby) had died in a car crash in Northern Ireland, where he had been serving as a soldier. She also finds out that he tracked her down, but was disgusted by her overt sexual nature and left without telling her who he was. When Annie Walker (Doris Speed) retires in 1983 after 46 years as landlady of The Rovers Return, her son, Billy, takes over the license of The Rovers Return. He is involved in various dodgy dealings and screws up frequently. He is the landlord for less than a year; he gets in trouble with the brewery and the tenancy is purchased back by Newton & Ridley. The brewery decides to appoint a manager rather than sell the licence. Sarah Ridley appoints Bet manager after receiving a petition from many of the Street's residents who nominate her for the role. Bet is flabbergasted, but ecstatic. She moves out of the corner shop flat into The Rovers in January 1985. Bet is involved in a fire at The Rovers in 1986, but is saved by Kevin Webster (Michael Le Vell). The place is gutted but eventually refurbished and she moves back in a few weeks later. When the tenancy of The Rovers is being sold by the brewery in 1987, Bet can't raise the money to buy it. Club owner Alec Gilroy (Roy Barraclough) offers her a loan but she can't pay him back so flees to Spain for a few weeks. Alec manages to track her down to bring her back, and then proposes to her. They later get married. The marriage goes better than expected, and Bet falls pregnant in 1988 at the age of 48 (more than 30 years after giving birth to Martin), only to lose the baby in an early miscarriage. In January 1990, Alec meets his daughter, Sandra Arden (Kathy Jameson), for the first time in 20 years and he meets Sandra's husband Tim and daughter Vicky (Helen Warburton). On Sandra's birthday, Bet overhears Sandra telling Tim she wants nothing to do with Alec. Bet breaks the news to Alec, but he refuses to believe it until Sandra tells him. Bet visits Sandra and talks to her, persuading to give Alec a chance and after thinking, Sandra agrees. In 1991, days after the death of Alec's former wife, Sandra and Tim are killed in a car crash and Vicky (now played by Chloe Newsome) stays with Bet and Alec, who later become her legal guardians. Alec gets a job on a cruise and wants to sell the tenancy of The Rovers back to the brewer but Bet doesn't want to leave her pub so Alec goes alone. Bet becomes manager of The Rovers and continues to run the pub for the next five years alone. In October 1995, when the brewery decide to sell The Rovers again, Bet can't come up with the large sum they demand. She tries asking some of her neighbours, especially close friend Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox), and step-granddaughter Vicky to borrow some money; but both refuse. Vicky, however, does offer to buy Bet a house instead after telling Bet she‚Äôs been like a mother to her but Bet is upset and throws everyone out of the pub. After falling a taxi, she speaks to Don Brennan (Geoffrey Hinsliff) and he is the only one who knows she is going as she won‚Äôt tell her lodger and barmaid Raquel (Sarah Lancashire) as she loves her but Raquel would fall apart. She then leaves in the back of a taxi in her iconic leopard-skin outfit, not knowing where to go next. Bet does not return for Betty Turpin's (Betty Driver) wedding to Billy Williams (Frank Mills) later that week, although before she left she gave her something blue. She later sends a Christmas card to Betty and Raquel and congratulates them on their recent marriages. Bet eventually heads to Tenerife where she spends a few happy years before returning to England. Alec returned to Weatherfield shortly after she left and has been working for the Duckworths as they took over the pub. While in Tenerife, she meets a man called Bruce and they become lovers. Bruce owns a boat on which the two would spend many happy days together. When he dies suddenly, the boat is left to Bet and she returns to England in 1999, visiting Brighton to make amends with Vicky and sells the boat to invest in Vicky's wine bar. Bet reappears in Coronation Street in June 2002 for Betty's retirement party, which delights her. Bet reveals that she has made up with Vicky and has been running different pubs across the country for the last seven years, before finally settling in Brighton. Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls) asks Bet to stay with her for the next two weeks but when Rita visits, wanting to make amends for not loaning her the money to buy the Rovers, Bet and Rita argue as Bet tells Rita that all she does is run The Kabin, which she only has as a result of Len's death. Rita is offended and tells her that she should leave as she is now bitter but it is later revealed that Bet returned so she could testify against a former lover who stole money from her. Mike and Audrey go to the court to give Bet support but she loses the case and leaves Weatherfield again without saying goodbye. In November 2003, Bet crosses paths with Liz McDonald (Beverley Callard) in Blackpool. Bet gets involved in Liz's problems as her husband Jim (Charles Lawson) has escaped from prison and is on the run. Bet is also due to marry former Brewery boss Cecil Newton (George Baker), but this does not happen, as he dies of a heart attack. Bet returns to Brighton with Liz, where she continues to run a bar. Creation =Background= Information about the character first surfaced to the public on 2 June 1966, when the Heywood Advertiser ran the story that Coronation Street was going through 'a little facelift' and the character of Bet Lynch was to be introduced. The publication that gave a little background to the character prior to appearing onscreen said: \\"Julie aged 22 has been working for a model sometime, but has also been on the files at Granada. When it was decided to inject more life into the series, she was offered the part as Bet, a typical Lancashire mill girl, who will be working at the new factory which is opening in 'the Street'.\\" The character then first appears in 1966 (as presumed) as a factory worker who gives Lucille Hewitt (Jennifer Moss) a black eye. She quickly departs with the explanation she has moved away (actress Patricia Phoenix was also rumoured to have told Goodyear to return to the programme when she gained a little more acting experience). Bet returns in 1970, when she shares a flat with Irma Barlow (Sandra Gough), who put a down payment on it with the help of Len Fairclough (Peter Adamson) and Ray Langton (Neville Buswell). Bet begins work as a barmaid at the Rover's Return. The earlier incident with Lucille is not mentioned again and the two became good friends. =Casting= Actress Julie Goodyear was offered the supporting role of Bet Lynch for a period of six weeks by Lucy Clayton, which she took without hesitation. Goodyear was convinced that she would continue in the role on a permanent basis and was shocked when they let her go at the end of her originally contracted period. When Goodyear filmed a part for a drama series called Family at War, the director June Howson complimented her and said she was impressed. Howson later went on to produce Coronation Street and offered Goodyear a six-month contract to reprise her role as Bet, which she took up. She then became a permanent cast member. In March 2010 it was reported on Digital Spy that Bet was set to make a comeback in an attempt by the newly appointed Phil Collinson producer to try to restore the show to its 'golden days'.Goodyear to return in 'Corrie' shake-up ‚Äì Coronation Street News ‚Äì Soaps. Digital Spy (14 March 2010). Retrieved on 2012-01-28. However this was denied the following day by Coronation Street bosses. A spokesperson said \\"At the moment there are no plans for Bet to return.

Retrieved on 2012-01-28. Following the death of actress Betty Driver in October 2011, there was speculation about Goodyear reprising her role for a one-off episode for the character Betty Williams' funeral, but the rumours ultimately proved to be groundless as Bet did not make an appearance.'Coronation Street' Julie Goodyear 'wants to return for Betty funeral' ‚Äì Coronation Street News ‚Äì Soaps. Digital Spy (25 October 2011). Retrieved on 2012-01-28. In April 2018, in an interview with the Daily Star, then producer Kate Oates suggested that Bet could still return to the show if the story fitted. Development =Personality and identity= Goodyear described her character as \\"busty, raunchy, voluptuous; a woman who knew how to flirt and manipulate, and give as good as she got. But she was also vulnerable. Unlucky in love, she could cry. A waxwork of Bet Lynch at the Madame Tussauds in Blackpool Rejected by those who got nearest to her, she could hurt\\" and noted that it was this mix that viewers got hooked on. She has been described as having a feisty personality and has learned through the hard knocks in her life how to fight her corner, a survivor, somewhat wary of men, she can get her teeth into most things then gives as good as she gets. =Appearance= The character has had some well-known looks and styles throughout her time on the show, many have made her instantly recognisable. Goodyear spoke about how her appearance was shaped in the character's early days, stating: \\"In the early days I never stopped researching the character of Bet on the streets of Salford with Tony Warren, and every time we went out, we would see a Bet at the market shopping, and either Tony or I would say 'Look at that silver mac/hairdo/earrings.' You could see Bet's everywhere and we took inspiration from each of them. Bet was based on women we saw in real life. As time went by people said 'too much', 'too over-the-top even for Bet', but Tony and I always knew it wasn't, and Bet's fan mail proved us right.\\" She has also said that Bet was always dressed in a 'common as muck way'. Goodyear has stated on different occasions that she would research the typical salary her character would be on for her barmaid job, as she wanted her character only to appear in outfits that she could realistically afford. This was to make her character credible and believable. This was where the leopard skin style of clothing came from because it was considered naughty, racy and very sexy in her character's early days and was deemed very affordable, staying true to her character. As actress Julie Goodyear got older, Bet's physical appearance matured. No longer the one to wear miniskirts and wear her hair long, she adopted a somewhat infamous wardrobe in that many of her outfits were leopard skin print, which to this day is one of Bet's defining attributes. During the 1970s, Goodyear instructed makeup to style her hair in to her trade mark beehive hair style. She either wore her hair down during the 1970s or the beehive or various styles. A few years later she asked for a hair piece to be styled into a beehive, then pinning it over her own hair. When Bet married Alec, Goodyear decided to wear short curly wigs; she would do some scenes with her in long hair. She continued to use short wigs until 1992 when she brought her much loved famous trade mark beehive back. As Goodyear's hair turned white, she also started to bleach her hair and style it in a beehive fashion. In a survey published in the Manchester Evening News in April 2007, Bet's beehive was voted the worst haircut in soap history.\\"Hair-raising truth about Coronation Street\\", Manchester Evening News. Retrieved on 2007-10-30. In the early years of her beehive hairdo, Goodyear would have her real hair combed back and she sprayed a large amount of hair lacquer onto it, though after a few years she received a false hairpiece to keep up the image onscreen. Her appearance was also the inspiration for Freddie Mercury's drag character in the music video for I Want To Break Free, by rock band Queen. Reception Inside Soap magazine readers voted Bet as soaps 'Greatest ever Landlady.' In Dorothy Catherine Anger's book \\"Other worlds: society seen through soap opera\\" she brands Bet a \\"tarty woman\\" who has the ability to \\"attract men like bees to honey\\".

It is headquartered in Vientiane. History Founded in 1971, the Lao Brewery Company was at that time a joint-venture between French and Lao businessmen. It took up production in 1973 with a capacity of 3 million litres per year. The company, then called Brasseries et Glaci√®res du Laos (BGL), marketed Bi√®re Larue for the local market and \\"33\\" export for export (to countries in Indochina). With the establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Laos in 1975, the company was nationalised and obtained the status of a state-owned enterprise. It marketed its beer first under the Bi√®re Lao, brand then (early 1995) as Beerlao. Their brand \\"33\\" export was marketed till 1990, and Bi√®re Larue until 1995. In the wake of the 1986 economic reform program, which initiated a transition from central planning to a market economy and the launching of the New Economic Mechanism (NEM), the LBC in 1993 entered into a joint venture: 49% Lao government-owned with 51% foreign investment (Loxley: 25.5% and Italian: 25.5%) with a production capacity of 20 million litres per year and employing 300 workers. In 2002, the foreign investors withdrew their shares from LBC, and the Lao government regained total control of the company. Subsequently, Carlsberg and TCC, a Thai company which was Carlsberg's partner in Thailand, each acquired a 25% share in LBC. The remaining shares are still held by the government of Laos. The maximum capacity at that time was 60 million litres. In 2005, the company increased its annual production capacity to 85 million litres, and in 2007 to 160 million litres. It now has about 500 employees. Recently, a new factory was opened in Pakse with a capacity of 100 million litres per year. In 2005, ownership changed once again with the Lao government still owning 50% and the remaining 50% owned by Carlsberg. In 2017, the Lao government own 29%. All machinery is imported from Europe. The company processes locally grown rice and imports malted barley from France and Belgium, and hops and yeast from Germany.

ICs consist of miniaturized electronic components built into an electrical network on a monolithic semiconductor substrate by photolithography. IC design can be divided into the broad categories of digital and analog IC design. Digital IC design is to produce components such as microprocessors, FPGAs, memories (RAM, ROM, and flash) and digital ASICs. Digital design focuses on logical correctness, maximizing circuit density, and placing circuits so that clock and timing signals are routed efficiently. Analog IC design also has specializations in power IC design and RF IC design. Analog IC design is used in the design of op-amps, linear regulators, phase locked loops, oscillators and active filters. Analog design is more concerned with the physics of the semiconductor devices such as gain, matching, power dissipation, and resistance. Fidelity of analog signal amplification and filtering is usually critical and as a result, analog ICs use larger area active devices than digital designs and are usually less dense in circuitry. Modern ICs are enormously complicated. An average desktop computer chip, as of 2015, has over 1 billion transistors. The rules for what can and cannot be manufactured are also extremely complex. Common IC processes of 2015 have more than 500 rules. Furthermore, since the manufacturing process itself is not completely predictable, designers must account for its statistical nature. The complexity of modern IC design, as well as market pressure to produce designs rapidly, has led to the extensive use of automated design tools in the IC design process. In short, the design of an IC using EDA software is the design, test, and verification of the instructions that the IC is to carry out. An integrated circuit some times called chip or micro chip is a semi conductor which thousands of millions of tiny resistors, capacitors, and transistors are fabricated. An IC can function as an amplifier, oscillator, timer, counter, computer memory or micro processor.  Fundamentals  Integrated circuit design involves the creation of electronic components, such as transistors, resistors, capacitors and the interconnect of these components onto a piece of semiconductor, typically silicon. A method to isolate the individual components formed in the substrate is necessary since the substrate silicon is conductive and often forms an active region of the individual components. The two common methods are p-n junction isolation and dielectric isolation. Attention must be given to power dissipation of transistors and interconnect resistances and current density of the interconnect, contacts and vias since ICs contain very tiny devices compared to discrete components, where such concerns are less of an issue. Electromigration in metallic interconnect and ESD damage to the tiny components are also of concern. Finally, the physical layout of certain circuit subblocks is typically critical, in order to achieve the desired speed of operation, to segregate noisy portions of an IC from quiet portions, to balance the effects of heat generation across the IC, or to facilitate the placement of connections to circuitry outside the IC. =Design steps= Major steps in the IC design flow A typical IC design cycle involves several steps: # System Specification ## Feasibility study and die size estimate ## Function analysis # Architectural or System Level Design #Logic Design ## Analogue Design, Simulation & Layout ## Digital Design & Simulation ## System Simulation & Verification # Circuit Design ##Digital design synthesis ##Design For Test and Automatic test pattern generation ##Design for manufacturability (IC) # Physical Design ##Floorplanning ##Place and Route ##Parasitic Extraction #Physical Verification & Signoff ##Static timing ##Co- simulation and timing # Mask data preparation (Layout Post Processing) ##Chip finishing with Tape out ##Reticle layout ##Layout-to-mask preparation # Wafer fabrication # Packaging #Die test ##Post silicon validation and integration ## Device characterization ## Tweak (if necessary) # Chip Deployment ##Datasheet generation (of usually a Portable Document Format (PDF) file) ## Ramp up ## Production ## Yield Analysis / Warranty Analysis Reliability (semiconductor) ##Failure analysis on any returns ## Plan for next generation chip using production information if possible Roughly saying, digital IC design can be divided into three parts. *Electronic system-level design: This step creates the user functional specification. The user may use a variety of languages and tools to create this description. Examples include a C/C++ model, SystemC, SystemVerilog Transaction Level Models, Simulink and MATLAB. *RTL design: This step converts the user specification (what the user wants the chip to do) into a register transfer level (RTL) description. The RTL describes the exact behavior of the digital circuits on the chip, as well as the interconnections to inputs and outputs. *Physical design: This step takes the RTL, and a library of available logic gates, and creates a chip design. This involves figuring out which gates to use, defining places for them, and wiring them together. Note that the second step, RTL design, is responsible for the chip doing the right thing. The third step, physical design, does not affect the functionality at all (if done correctly) but determines how fast the chip operates and how much it costs. Design lifecycle The integrated circuit (IC) development process starts with defining product requirements, progresses through architectural definition, implementation, bringup and finally production. The various phases of the integrated circuit development process are described below. Although the phases are presented here in a straightforward fashion, in reality there is iteration and these steps may occur multiple times. =Requirements= Before an architecture can be defined some high level product goals must be defined. The requirements are usually generated by a cross functional team that addresses market opportunity, customer needs, feasibility and much more. This phase should result in a product requirements document. =Architecture= The architecture defines the fundamental structure, goals and principles of the product. It defines high level concepts and the intrinsic value proposition of the product. Architecture teams take into account many variables and interface with many groups. People creating the architecture generally have a significant amount of experience dealing with systems in the area for which the architecture is being created. The work product of the architecture phase is an architectural specification. =Micro-architecture= The micro-architecture is a step closer to the hardware. It implements the architecture and defines specific mechanisms and structures for achieving that implementation. The result of the micro-architecture phase is a micro-architecture specification which describes the methods used to implement the architecture. =Implementation= In the implementation phase the design itself is created using the micro- architectural specification as the starting point. This involves low level definition and partitioning, writing code, entering schematics and verification. This phase ends with a design reaching tapeout. =Bringup= After a design is created, taped-out and manufactured, actual hardware, 'first silicon', is received which is taken into the lab where it goes through bringup. Bringup is the process of powering, testing and characterizing the design in the lab. Numerous tests are performed starting from very simple tests such as ensuring that the device will power on to much more complicated tests which try to stress the part in various ways. The result of the bringup phase is documentation of characterization data (how well the part performs to spec) and errata (unexpected behavior). =Productization= Productization is the task of taking a design from engineering into mass production manufacturing. Although a design may have successfully met the specifications of the product in the lab during the bringup phase there are many challenges that product engineers face when trying to mass-produce those designs. The IC must be ramped up to production volumes with an acceptable yield. The goal of the productization phase is to reach mass production volumes at an acceptable cost. =Sustaining= Once a design is mature and has reached mass production it must be sustained. The process must be continually monitored and problems dealt with quickly to avoid a significant impact on production volumes. The goal of sustaining is to maintain production volumes and continually reduce costs until the product reaches end of life.  Design process  = Microarchitecture and system-level design = The initial chip design process begins with system-level design and microarchitecture planning. Within IC design companies, management and often analytics will draft a proposal for a design team to start the design of a new chip to fit into an industry segment. Upper-level designers will meet at this stage to decide how the chip will operate functionally. This step is where an IC's functionality and design are decided. IC designers will map out the functional requirements, verification testbenches, and testing methodologies for the whole project, and will then turn the preliminary design into a system-level specification that can be simulated with simple models using languages like C++ and MATLAB and emulation tools. For pure and new designs, the system design stage is where an Instruction set and operation is planned out, and in most chips existing instruction sets are modified for newer functionality. Design at this stage is often statements such as encodes in the MP3 format or implements IEEE floating-point arithmetic. At later stages in the design process, each of these innocent looking statements expands to hundreds of pages of textual documentation. = RTL design = Upon agreement of a system design, RTL designers then implement the functional models in a hardware description language like Verilog, SystemVerilog, or VHDL. Using digital design components like adders, shifters, and state machines as well as computer architecture concepts like pipelining, superscalar execution, and branch prediction, RTL designers will break a functional description into hardware models of components on the chip working together. Each of the simple statements described in the system design can easily turn into thousands of lines of RTL code, which is why it is extremely difficult to verify that the RTL will do the right thing in all the possible cases that the user may throw at it. To reduce the number of functionality bugs, a separate hardware verification group will take the RTL and design testbenches and systems to check that the RTL actually is performing the same steps under many different conditions, classified as the domain of functional verification. Many techniques are used, none of them perfect but all of them useful - extensive logic simulation, formal methods, hardware emulation, lint-like code checking, code coverage, and so on. A tiny error here can make the whole chip useless, or worse. The famous Pentium FDIV bug caused the results of a division to be wrong by at most 61 parts per million, in cases that occurred very infrequently. No one even noticed it until the chip had been in production for months. Yet Intel was forced to offer to replace, for free, every chip sold until they could fix the bug, at a cost of $475 million (US). = Physical design = Physical design steps within the digital design flow RTL is only a behavioral model of the actual functionality of what the chip is supposed to operate under. It has no link to a physical aspect of how the chip would operate in real life at the materials, physics, and electrical engineering side. For this reason, the next step in the IC design process, physical design stage, is to map the RTL into actual geometric representations of all electronics devices, such as capacitors, resistors, logic gates, and transistors that will go on the chip. The main steps of physical design are listed below. In practice there is not a straightforward progression - considerable iteration is required to ensure all objectives are met simultaneously. This is a difficult problem in its own right, called design closure. *Logic synthesis: The RTL is mapped into a gate- level netlist in the target technology of the chip. *Floorplanning: The RTL of the chip is assigned to gross regions of the chip, input/output (I/O) pins are assigned and large objects (arrays, cores, etc.) are placed. *Placement: The gates in the netlist are assigned to nonoverlapping locations on the die area. *Logic/placement refinement: Iterative logical and placement transformations to close performance and power constraints. *Clock insertion: Clock signal wiring is (commonly, clock trees) introduced into the design. *Routing: The wires that connect the gates in the netlist are added. *Postwiring optimization: Performance (timing closure), noise (signal integrity), and yield (Design for manufacturability) violations are removed. *Design for manufacturability: The design is modified, where possible, to make it as easy and efficient as possible to produce. This is achieved by adding extra vias or adding dummy metal/diffusion/poly layers wherever possible while complying to the design rules set by the foundry. *Final checking: Since errors are expensive, time consuming and hard to spot, extensive error checking is the rule, making sure the mapping to logic was done correctly, and checking that the manufacturing rules were followed faithfully. *Chip finishing with Tapeout and mask generation: the design data is turned into photomasks in mask data preparation.  Analog design  Before the advent of the microprocessor and software based design tools, analog ICs were designed using hand calculations and process kit parts. These ICs were low complexity circuits, for example, op-amps, usually involving no more than ten transistors and few connections. An iterative trial-and-error process and \\"overengineering\\" of device size was often necessary to achieve a manufacturable IC. Reuse of proven designs allowed progressively more complicated ICs to be built upon prior knowledge. When inexpensive computer processing became available in the 1970s, computer programs were written to simulate circuit designs with greater accuracy than practical by hand calculation. The first circuit simulator for analog ICs was called SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuits Emphasis). Computerized circuit simulation tools enable greater IC design complexity than hand calculations can achieve, making the design of analog ASICs practical. As many functional constraints must be considered in analog design, manual design is still widespread today. As a result, modern design flows for analog circuits are characterized by two different design styles ‚Äì top-down and bottom-up. The top-down design style makes use of optimization-based tools similar to conventional digital flows. Bottom-up procedures re-use ‚Äúexpert knowledge‚Äù with the result of solutions previously conceived and captured in a procedural description, imitating an expert‚Äôs decision. An example are cell generators, such as PCells. =Coping with variability= A challenge most critical to analog IC design involves the variability of the individual devices built on the semiconductor chip. Unlike board-level circuit design which permits the designer to select devices that have each been tested and binned according to value, the device values on an IC can vary widely which are uncontrollable by the designer. For example, some IC resistors can vary ¬±20% and Œ≤ of an integrated BJT can vary from 20 to 100. In the latest CMOS processes, Œ≤ of vertical PNP transistors can even go below 1. To add to the design challenge, device properties often vary between each processed semiconductor wafer. Device properties can even vary significantly across each individual IC due to doping gradients. The underlying cause of this variability is that many semiconductor devices are highly sensitive to uncontrollable random variances in the process. Slight changes to the amount of diffusion time, uneven doping levels, etc. can have large effects on device properties. Some design techniques used to reduce the effects of the device variation are: * Using the ratios of resistors, which do match closely, rather than absolute resistor value. * Using devices with matched geometrical shapes so they have matched variations. * Making devices large so that statistical variations becomes an insignificant fraction of the overall device property. * Segmenting large devices, such as resistors, into parts and interweaving them to cancel variations. * Using common centroid device layout to cancel variations in devices which must match closely (such as the transistor differential pair of an op amp).

A towed array sonar is a system of hydrophones towed behind a submarine or a surface ship on a cable. Trailing the hydrophones behind the vessel, on a cable that can be kilometres long, keeps the array's sensors away from the ship's own noise sources, greatly improving its signal-to-noise ratio, and hence the effectiveness of detecting and tracking faint contacts, such as quiet, low noise-emitting submarine threats, or seismic signals. A towed array offers superior resolution and range compared with hull mounted sonar. It also covers the baffles, the blind spot of hull mounted sonar. However, effective use of the system limits a vessel's speed and care must be taken to protect the cable from damage. History During World War I, a towed sonar array known as the \\"Electric Eel\\" was developed by Harvey Hayes, a U.S. Navy physicist. This system is believed to be the first towed sonar array design. It employed two cables, each with a dozen hydrophones attached. The project was discontinued after the war. The U.S. Navy resumed development of towed array technology during the 1960s in response to the development of nuclear-powered submarines by the Soviet Union. Current use of towed arrays On surface ships, towed array cables are normally stored in drums, then spooled out behind the vessel when in use. U.S. Navy submarines typically store towed arrays inside an outboard tube, mounted along the vessel's hull, with an opening on the starboard tail. . There is also equipment located in a ballast tank (free flood area) while the cabinet used to operate the system is inside the submarine. Hydrophones in a towed array system are placed at specific distances along the cable, the end elements far enough apart to gain a basic ability to triangulate on a sound source. Similarly, various elements are angled up or down , giving an ability to triangulate an estimated vertical depth of target. Alternatively three or more arrays are used to aid in depth detection. On the first few hundred meters from the ship's propeller there are usually no hydrophones, because their effectiveness would be reduced by noise (cavitation and hull flow noises), vibration and turbulence generated by the propulsion--which would repeat the same problems of ship-mounted arrays. Surveillance Towed Array Sensor Systems used by surface ships have a sonar array mounted on a cable, which pulls a depth-adjustable remote operated vehicle (ROV). Another weighted cable may trail from the ROV connector, dropping the towed array to a lower depth. Long seismic streamers have intermediate paravanes along their length which can be used to adjust the depth of the array in real time. Changing an ROV's depth allows a towed array to be deployed in different thermal layers, giving a surface anti-submarine warfare (ASW) vessel a view above and below the layer. This compensates for density and temperature differences, which duct sound above or below a thermal layer by reflection. By dropping the array's 'tail' below the layer, a surface ASW platform can better detect a quiet, submerged contact hiding in cold water below a warm upper layer. A submarine can likewise monitor surface combatants by floating the tail of its array above a thermal layer while lurking below. Akula's towed array is stored in a teardrop shaped container mounted on top of the vertical fin The array's hydrophones can be used to detect sound sources, but the real value of the array is that the signal processing technique of beamforming and Fourier analysis can be used not only to calculate the distance and the direction of a sound source, but also to identify the type of ship by the distinctive, acoustic signature of its machinery noises. For this, the relative positions of the hydrophones need to be known, usually possible only when the cable is in a straight line (stable), or when a self-sensing system (see strain gauges) or GPS or other methods embedded in the cable, and reporting relative position of hydrophone elements, is used to monitor the shape of the array and correct for curvature. =Use in geophysics= Towed array systems are also used by the oil and gas industry for seismic exploration of geological formations under the sea bed. The systems used are similar in concept to the naval ones, but are typically longer and with more streamers in a given array (6 or more in some cases). Typical hydrophone spacing along each streamer is on the order of two meters, and each streamer may be up to 10 km long. Sometimes streamers are flown at different heights, to give a so-called 3D array. =Limitations= Effective use of the towed array system requires a vessel to maintain a straight, level course over a data sampling interval. Maneuvering, or changing course, disturbs the array and interrupts the sampled data stream. These periods of instability are closely tested during sea trials and known by the crew's officers and enlisted sonar experts. Modern systems compensate by constantly self-measuring the relative positions of the array, element to element, reporting back data that can be automatically corrected for curvatures by computers as part of the beamforming maths processing. A ship must also limit its overall top speed while a towed array is deployed. Hydrodynamic drag increases as a square function of velocity, and could tear the cable or damage its mooring hardware. Furthermore, a minimum speed may have to be established depending on the buoyancy of the towed array. The array could also be damaged by contact with the seafloor or if the vessel operates astern propulsion, or can even be damaged if it bends too tightly. = Large eddy break-up = When F noise causes a problem around a towed acoustic array, a large eddy break-up or LEBU device may be deployed in order to reduce the disruption. The LEBU includes two identical circumferential airfoils and two flat flanges. The flanges secure the device to a coupling on the towed acoustic array. This is helpful when using sonar or echo sounding.

The airport is on the Pacific Coast, south of San Francisco. History The Half Moon Bay Airport is about 20 miles south of San Francisco. It was built by the California State Highway Department for the U.S. Army in 1942 as an auxiliary airfield for Salinas Army Air Base. Known as Half Moon Bay Flight Strip, the airport supported Salinas AAF's ground support mission to train light observation and reconnaissance squadrons. These were light aircraft and fighters modified with camera equipment. Salinas Army Air base also had the mission of conducting coastal patrols. As such, the airfield would have been garrisoned by a detachment of the 301st Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron. With the reorganization of the Army Air Forces that took place in the first quarter of 1944, the site was transferred to Air Technical Service Command and garrisoned by its own unit, the 4159th Army Air Forces Base Unit (Air Base). The mission of this unit was to operate the airfield for emergency landings, transient aircraft, and training missions. Other than refueling aircraft, no aircraft services would have been available. On 1 June 1945 the War Department issued a five-year permit to the U.S. Navy to operate the Site as \\"Outlying Field, Half Moon Bay\\". Half Moon Bay field became an outlying field for Naval Air Station Moffett Field, to furnish facilities for utility aircraft providing target towing service for the Anti-Aircraft Training Center, Point Montara, California. San Mateo County acquired the airport from the Navy in 1947. It is an important business, transportation and emergency service asset to the community. Facilities Half Moon Bay Airport, facing west Half Moon Bay Airport covers at an elevation of 66 feet (20 m). Its asphalt/concrete runway, 12/30, is 5,000 by 150 feet (1,524 x 46 m). Half Moon Bay Airport provides a variety of emergency service and response functions including: Air ambulance and Medevac flights; law enforcement and homeland security patrols; Coast Guard sea-rescue operations; and use as a disaster relief staging site for the airlifting of emergency supplies in the event that roads are closed during a disaster or emergency. Half Moon Bay Airport is home to about 80 aircraft and several related businesses. The airport is self-funded through airport user and business fees, and receives no money from the county's general fund. In the year ending September 11, 2008 the airport had 60,150 aircraft operations, average 164 per day: 99.8% general aviation and 0.2% air taxi. 40 aircraft were then based at the airport: 93% single-engine, 5% multi-engine and 3% helicopter. Pacific Coast Dream Machines The airport hosts an annual benefit event in April, Pacific Coast Dream Machines, which features aircraft and automobiles. December 2015 Airport renaming (Eddie Andreini Sr. Airfield) On December 8, 2015 the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors renamed the airfield at the Half Moon Bay Airport the Eddie Andreini Sr. Airfield to commemorate the many accomplishments and contributions that Eddie Andreini Sr. made to San Mateo County. Andreini had been a leader of the San Mateo County aviation community for many years, learning to fly at the Half Moon Bay Airport in 1953, performing in countless air shows around the world for almost 50 years before he died in 2014 at the age of 77 in an air show crash. The airshow pilot was an avid volunteer in the Half Moon Bay community, is credited for much of the success of the Pacific Coast Dream Machines - Half Moon Bay event and will always be remembered for gracing the skies over the coast with his air show tricks to the delight of residents and visitors. The International Council of Air Shows awarded Andreini the Sword of Excellence Award, the highest honor an air show pilot can receive in 2004 and inducted him into the Air Show Hall of Fame in 2013 for his outstanding performances and generosity in mentoring younger air show pilots.

This post may have also been named \\"Russell City Army Air Field\\" for the unincorporated area outside of the Hayward city limits where it was located. The airfield was assigned to the United States Army Air Forces Fourth Air Force. After the war the airport was declared surplus. In April 1947 the War Assets Administration quitclaimed the airfield, comprising some and related buildings and equipment, to the City of Hayward. The airfield was then renamed Hayward Municipal Airport. The California Air National Guard moved onto land adjoining the airport in 1949. Initially it was the home of the 61st Fighter Wing which included the 194th Fighter Squadron on June 25, 1948. The 61st Fighter Wing was re-designated as the 144th Fighter Bomber Wing on November 1, 1950. The wing also consisted of the 192nd Fighter Squadron at Reno, Nevada and the 191st Fighter Squadron at Salt Lake City, Utah. The North American P-51D Mustang and later the P-51H were flown from 1948 until October 31, 1954. During its early years with the P-51D/H, the unit earned prominence as one of the Air Force's most respected aerial gunnery competitors. In June 1953, while still flying the P-51, the unit qualified for the first all-jet, worldwide gunnery meet. Using borrowed F-86A Sabre jets, the 144th, which represented the Air National Guard, placed fifth in competition. This unit later relocated to Fresno Air Terminal and is now the 144th Fighter Wing of the California Air National Guard at Fresno Air National Guard Base. On April 3, 1955 the 129th Air Resupply Squadron was established at Hayward and equipped with Curtiss C-46D Commandos in the Summer 1955 supplemented by Grumman SA-16A Albatrosses in 1958. The C-46Ds were phased out 1 November 1958, and the unit was redesignated as the 129th Troop Carrier Squadron (Medium). A control tower was built in 1960 and on January 20, 1962, the unit reached Group status with federal recognition of the 129th Troop Carrier Group. On May 1, 1980 the remaining California Air National Guard units at Hayward were reassigned to Naval Air Station Moffett Field near San Jose. Today, this unit is the 129th Rescue Wing at Moffett Federal Airfield.  Facilities The airport covers 543 acres (220 ha) at an elevation of 52 feet (16 m). It has two asphalt runways: 10R/28L is 5,694 by 150 feet (1,736 x 46 m) and 10L/28R is 3,107 by 75 feet (947 x 23 m). It has one helipad, H1, 110 by 110 feet (34 x 34 m). In the year ending October 14, 2010 the airport had 86,069 aircraft operations, average 235 per day: 98% general aviation and 2% air taxi. 368 aircraft were then based at the airport: 82% single-engine, 11% multi-engine, 4% jet, and 3% helicopter. Hayward Executive Airport is home to the Northern California division of Ameriflight as of September 15, 2012. The airport plans to build a new administration building. The offices are now in the five-story control tower built in 1961, with Federal Aviation Administration offices in the top three floors. The new administration building will be next to the control tower and will be a bit under 5,000 square feet. It was expected to cost $2.88 million. Work was expected to begin in May 2013 and end in March 2014. Gallery File:HU-16 129th ACG California ANG 1960s.jpgA U.S. Air Force Grumman HU-16 Albatross amphibian with its crew.

Members of the Vienna Circle of logical positivists held many meetings at the caf√© before and after World War I. A well known story is that when Victor Adler objected to Count Berchtold, foreign minister of Austria-Hungary, that war would provoke revolution in Russia, even if not in the Habsburg monarchy, he replied: \\"And who will lead this revolution? Perhaps Mr. Bronstein (Leon Trotsky) sitting over there at the Cafe Central?\\"A. J. P. Taylor, in The Struggle for Mastery in Europe 1848-1918 (1980) The caf√© closed at the end of World War II.

When, for instance, some public improvement results in raising the value of a piece of private land, and the owner is thereby bettered through no merit of his own, he gains by the betterment, and many economists and politicians have sought to arrange, by taxation or otherwise, that the increased value shall come into the pocket of the public rather than into the owner's. A betterment tax would be assessed in order to divert from the owner of the property the profit thus accruing unearned to him. The whole problem is one of the incidence of taxation and the question of land values, and various applications of the principle of betterment have been tried in the United States and in England, raising considerable controversy from time to time.  Prevention of real- estate bubbles  Preventing Real Estate Bubbles Germany managed to prevent a real-estate bubble when all others have experienced it thanks to its 10 years at length and 50% at valuation real-estate betterment tax: the German Betterment-Tax Law. Speculators are the main driver of real-estate bubbles. They borrow fiat money from the banks and invest it whenever they think the market can still go up. There's no effective limitation on how much money they can borrow or on how much the banks can lend them. This is a clear example of how prices are detached from actual need for the underlying asset. Speculators typically invest when the market is low, thus holding down the speculators for the entire duration of the economic cycle, of at typically 10 years, forces them to pay interest on that money throughout that period and further during the following up-cycle i.e. at least 15 years altogether. This impediment keeps the real-estate market stable at affordable prices.

D√≠az was taken by ambulance to Los Angeles County General Hospital, where he died shortly afterwards without regaining consciousness. The hospital's autopsy showed that he was inebriated from a party the previous night and had a fracture at the base of his skull. This might have been caused by repeated falls or an automobile accident. The cause of his death remains a mystery to this day. However, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) was quick to arrest 17 Mexican-American youths as suspects. Despite insufficient evidence, the young men were held in prison, without bail, on charges of murder. The trial ended on January 13, 1943, under the supervision of Judge Charles W. Fricke. 12 of the defendants were convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to serve time in San Quentin Prison. The defendants were Jack Melendez, Victor Thompson, Angel Padilla, John Y. Matuz, Ysmael Parra (Smiles), Henry Leyva, Gus Zamora, Manuel Reyes, Robert Telles, Manuel Delgado, Jose Ruiz (Chepe), and Henry Ynostroza. The rest of the suspects were charged with lesser offenses and incarcerated in the Los Angeles County Jail. The convictions were reversed on appeal in 1944. The case is considered a precursor to the Zoot Suit Riots of 1943. Sleepy Lagoon was a reservoir beside the Los Angeles River that was frequented by Mexican-Americans. Its name came from the popular song \\"Sleepy Lagoon\\", which was recorded in 1942 by big band leader and trumpeter Harry James.Sleepy Lagoon Website The reservoir was located near the city of Maywood at approximately what is now 5400 Lindbergh Lane, in Bell, California. The current address has also been given as approximately 5500 Slauson Avenue. Background Beginning in the early 1930s and exacerbated by the Great Depression, approximately 1 million Mexican immigrants and native-born Americans of Mexican descent were forced to leave the United States for Mexico during Mexican Repatriation. Repatriation occurred across many different states, with an estimated 75,000 people forced from Southern California to Mexico during this period, an estimated 60% of whom were U.S. Citizens. In February 1942, the U.S. government interned Japanese Americans from the West Coast, after classifying them as security threats following the United States' entry into World War II. It is now recognized that racial discrimination on the part of white California residents and officials contributed strongly to these injustices. As society mobilized for war, thousands of Mexican citizens under the Bracero program arrived to Los Angeles for agricultural jobs, as did hundreds of thousands of Black southerners during the Second Great Migration to the city for defense- related jobs such as munitions factories and shipyards. The rapid influx of laborers from Mexico and defense workers of ethnic backgrounds from all across the country into Los Angeles heightened racial tensions in the city. A grand jury, headed by E. Duran Ayres, was appointed by the Los Angeles City Council to investigate an alleged \\"Mexican crime wave\\". Death The morning of August 2, 1942, Jos√© Gallardo D√≠az was found unconscious and later died in the hospital. The autopsy revealed that D√≠az was intoxicated and had blunt head trauma, but ultimately they could not determine a cause of death.Sleepy Lagoon Defense Committee Records (Collection 107). UCLA Library Special Collections, Charles E. Young Research Library, UCLA. Despite the unclear cause of death, 20-year-old Henry Leyvas and 24 members of what the media termed \\"the 38th Street gang\\" were arrested for allegedly murdering D√≠az. They suspected that rival Pachuco gang fights were the cause of D√≠az's death. In response to the alleged murder, the media began a campaign calling for action against \\"zoot suiters\\". On August 10, police conducted a roundup of 600 Latinos who were charged with suspicion of assault, armed robbery, and related offenses; 175 were eventually held for various crimes. Criminal trial The resulting criminal trial is now generally viewed as lacking in the fundamental requirements of due process. Seventeen Latino youths were indicted on the murder charges and placed on trial. The courtroom was small and, during the trial, the defendants were not allowed to sit near, or to communicate with, their attorneys. None of those charged were permitted to change their clothes during the trial by order of Judge Fricke at the request of the district attorney on the grounds that the jury should see the defendants in the zoot suits that were \\"obviously\\" worn only by \\"hoodlums\\". Every time a name was mentioned by a witness or the district attorney, regardless of how damning the statement was, the named defendant was required to stand up.Sleepy Laggon and the Sailor Riots of 1943 La Noche Triste Judge Fricke also permitted the chief of the Foreign Relations Bureau of the Los Angeles sheriff's office, E. Duran Ayres, to testify as an \\"expert witness\\" that Mexicans as a community had a \\"blood-thirst\\" and a \\"biological predisposition\\" to crime and killing, citing the culture of human sacrifice practiced by their Aztec ancestors. Activist involvement The Sleepy Lagoon Defense Committee (SLDC) was a community organization made up of Los Angeles community members and activists who came together to support the defendants. The SLDC was also known as The Citizens' Committee for the Defense of Mexican-American Youth. The committee was labeled a Communist front organization by the California state legislature's Joint Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities chaired by Jack Tenney. Actor Anthony Quinn writes that he began raising money for the defense after his mother urged him to \\"remember the eggs\\" they had been given by a mother of one of the accused defendants during a time of poverty. He writes of enlisting the help of Orson Welles and Eleanor Roosevelt, and being branded a communist as a result, almost costing him his career.One Man Tango, Anthony Quinn (c) 1995 Harper Collins, pg. 16-17. Some SLDC members included: Alice McGrath, Josefina Fierro de Bright, Josefa Fierro, Maria Alvez, Luisa Moreno, Dorothy Healey, LaRue McCormick, Lupe Leyvas, Henry Leyvas, Doc Johnson, Frank Lopez, Bert Corona, and Gray Bemis. The SLDC's mission was to mount a civil rights crusade so that these 12 Mexican-American defendants could have an unbiased trial. The SLDC utilized their contacts with influential community members to promote their cause and for fund-raising purposes to be able to support their cause. After Judge Fricke's verdict in January, the Mexican-American youths were imprisoned without evidence and because they were \\"Mexican and dangerous\\", ipso facto. The Mexican American community was outraged and several attorneys challenged Judge Fricke's decisions: George Shibley, Robert Kenny, Clore Ware, Ben Margolis, John McTernan, Carey McWilliams, and several others. Together they hoped to remind the European American society that minorities had the right to testify in court and have impartial jury trials. McWilliams noted that a few months earlier over 120,000 Japanese Americans were detained and interned in detention camps, and later argued that there were common links between the Japanese-American internment and the anti-Mexican response in the Sleepy Lagoon case. From 1943 through 1944, the state anti-Communist Tenney Committee subpoenaed and investigated the members of the Defense Committee in an attempt to uncover Communist ties.Encyclopedia of Minorities in U.S.A Politics: Hispanic Americans and ... By Jeffrey D. Schultz page 518 Reversal In October 1944, the state Court of Appeals unanimously decided the evidence was not sufficient to sustain a guilty verdict. It reversed the 12 defendants' convictions in People v Zammora 66 Cal.App.2d 166. The appeals court also criticized the trial judge for his bias in and mishandling of the case.Eduardo Obreg√≥n Pag√°n, Murder at the Sleepy Lagoon: Zoot Suits, Race, and Riot in Wartime LA (Univ of North Carolina Press, 2003) p 207-8 Cultural references The 1979 play Zoot Suit and the 1981 movie of the same name are loosely based on events surrounding the murder trial.

(2007). Implementing E-Governance Using OECD Model(Modified) and Gartner Model (Modified) Upon Agriculture of Bangladesh. IEEE. 1-4244-1551-9/07. Through e-governance, government services are made available to citizens in a convenient, efficient, and transparent manner. The three main target groups that can be distinguished in governance concepts are government, citizens, and businesses/interest groups. In e-governance, there are no distinct boundaries.Garson, D.G. (2006). Public Information Technology and E-Governance. Sudbury, MA: Jones and Bartlett Publishers.  Distinction from e-government  Although the two terms are often used interchangeably, there is a difference between e-governance and e-government. E-government refers to the use of the ICTs in public administration which, when combined with organizational change and new skills, are intended to improve public services and democratic processes and to strengthen support to the public. However, e-government has no provision for governance of ICTs. The governance of ICTs typically requires a substantial increase in regulation and policy-making capabilities, as well as additional expertise and opinion-shaping processes among various social stakeholders. The perspective of e-governance is \\"the use of the technologies that both help to govern and have to be governed\\".Rossel, Pierre, and Matthias Finger. \\"Conceptualizing e-Governance.\\" Management (2007) : 399‚Äì407. The central goal of e-governance is to reach the beneficiary and to ensure that their service needs are met. Ideally, the government will automatically recognize the importance of achieving this goal in order to maximize its efficiency. Furthermore, e-government uses one-way communication protocol whereas e-governance uses two-way communication protocol. Establishing the identity of the end beneficiary is a challenge in all citizen-centric services. Statistical information published by governments and global bodies do not always reveal the facts. The best form of e-governance cuts down on the unwanted interference of too many layers while delivering governmental services. It depends on good infrastructural setup with the support of local processes and parameters for governments to reach their citizens or end beneficiaries. A budget for planning, development, and growth can be derived from well laid out e-governance systems. The relevance of BI Analytics has brought forth a paradigm shift in assimilating and visualizing huge chunks of data in near real-time manner. The pivot of all good decision- making systems is correct, up-to-date and compliant data. Governments not only want the transformation of their own country and countrymen but also expect improved relations and healthy trade across the world. Development should be transformative and continuously evolving. Internal as well as external IT systems should work in tandem with government policies and procedures. Data Analytics has the ability to change the color and complexion of the world. E-governance should induce up-to-date information, initiate effective interaction, and engage with transparent transactions in compliance with rule of law, thus enabling a sustainable transformation model. The public‚Äìprivate partnership (PPP)-based e-governance projects are hugely successful in India. Many countries implement e-government policy in an attempt to build a corruption-free government.  Government to citizen  The goal of government-to-citizen (G2C) e-governance is to offer a variety of ICT services to citizens in an efficient and economical manner and to strengthen the relationship between government and citizens using technology. There are several methods of G2C e-governance. Two-way communication allows citizens to instant message directly with public administrators, and cast remote electronic votes (electronic voting) and instant opinion voting. These are examples of e-Participation. Other examples included the payment of taxes and services that can be completed online or over the phone. Mundane services such as name or address changes, applying for services or grants, or transferring existing services are more convenient and no longer have to be completed face to face.Miller, W & Walling, J, (2013). \\"Government in the twenty-first century: New Avenues of Study\\". Taking Sides. New York, NY: McGraw Hill. =By country= G2C e-governance is unbalanced across the globe as not everyone has Internet access and computing skills, but the United States, European Union, and Asia are ranked the top three in development. The Federal Government of the United States has a broad framework of G2C technology to enhance citizen access to Government information and services. benefits.gov is an official US government website that informs citizens of benefits they are eligible for and provides information on how to apply for assistance. US State Governments also engage in G2C interaction through the Department of Transportation, Department of Public Safety, United States Department of Health and Human Services, United States Department of Education, and others.Lee, (2004). \\"Communications of the ACM\\". Association for Computing Machinery. As with e-governance on the global level, G2C services vary from state to state. The Digital States Survey ranks states on social measures, digital democracy, e-commerce, taxation, and revenue. The 2012 report shows Michigan and Utah in the lead and Florida and Idaho with the lowest scores. Municipal governments in the United States also use government-to-customer technology to complete transactions and inform the public. Much like states, cities are awarded for innovative technology. Government Technology's \\"Best of the Web 2012\\" named Louisville, KY, Arvada, CO, Raleigh, NC, Riverside, CA, and Austin, TX the top five G2C city portals.Best of the Web, (2012). Government Technologies. http://www.govtech.com/e-government/2012-Best-of-the-Web-Award-Winners- Announced.html. European countries were ranked second among all geographic regions. The Single Point of Access for Citizens of Europe supports travel within Europe and Europe is a 1999 initiative supporting an online government. Main focuses are to provide public information, allow customers to have access to basic public services, simplify online procedures, and promote electronic signatures. Estonia is the first and the only country in the world with e-residency which enables anyone in the world outside Estonia to access Estonian online services. One caveat of the Estonia e-residency program is that it des not give e-residents physical rights to the country. This means that unless the e-resident buys land they do not get to participate in the democratic processes. The benefit to e-residents is the opportunity to develop business in the digital European Union market. Asia is ranked third in comparison, and there are diverse G2C programs between countries. Singapore's eCitizen Portal is an organized single access point to government information and services. South Korea's Home Tax Service (HTS) provides citizens with 24/7 online services such as tax declaration. Taiwan has top ranking G2C technology including an online motor vehicle services system, which provides 21 applications and payment services to citizens. India's e-governance programs have found success in regional areas. This is likely due to the ability to meet the language and literacy differences among their constituents. Government-to-Citizen is the communication link between a government and private individuals or residents. Such G2C communication most often refers to that which takes place through Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), but can also include direct mail and media campaigns. G2C can take place at the federal, state, and local levels. G2C stands in contrast to G2B, or Government-to-Business networks. One such Federal G2C network is USA.gov, the United States' official web portal, though there are many other examples from governments around the world.White, Jay D. (2007) Managing Information in the Public Sector. M.E. Sharpe. New York = Concerns = A full switch to government-to-citizen e-governance will cost a large amount of money in development and implementation. In addition, government agencies do not always engage citizens in the development of their e-gov services or accept feedback. Customers identified the following barriers to government-to-customer e-governance: not everyone has Internet access, especially in rural or low- income areas, G2C technology can be problematic for citizens who lack computing skills. Some G2C sites have technology requirements (such as browser requirements and plug-ins) that won't allow access to certain services, language barriers, the necessity for an e-mail address to access certain services, and a lack of privacy.Bertot, Jaegar, and McClure, (2008). \\"Citizen Centered E-Government Services: Benefits, Costs, and Research Needs\\". Montreal, Canada. Government to employees E-governance to Employee partnership (G2E) Is one of four main primary interactions in the delivery model of E-governance. It is the relationship between online tools, sources, and articles that help employees to maintain the communication with the government and their own companies. E-governance relationship with Employees allows new learning technology in one simple place as the computer. Documents can now be stored and shared with other colleagues online.Fang, Zhiyuan. \\"E-government in Digital Era: Concept, Development, and Practice.\\" International Journal of the Computer 10.2 (2002): 1-22. Web. 2 Apr. 2014.http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.133.9080&rep;=rep1&type;=pdf. E-governance makes it possible for employees to become paperless and makes it easy for employees to send important documents back and forth to colleagues all over the world instead of having to print out these records or faxCarter, Lemuria, and France Belanger. \\"Citizen Adoption of Electronic Government Initiatives\\". IEEE Xplore. Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, n.d. G2E services also include software for maintaining personal information and records of employees. Some of the benefits of G2E expansion include: * E-payroll ‚Äì maintaining the online sources to view paychecks, pay stubs, pay bills, and keep records for tax information. * E-benefits ‚Äì be able to look up what benefits an employee is receiving and what benefits they have a right to. * E-training ‚Äì allows for new and current employees to regularly maintain the training they have through the development of new technology and to allow new employees to train and learn over new materials in one convenient location. E-learning is another way to keep employees informed on the important materials they need to know through the use of visuals, animation, videos, etc. It is usually a computer-based learning tool, although not always. It is also a way for employees to learn at their own pace (distance learning), although it can be instructor-led. * Maintaining records of personal information ‚Äì Allows the system to keep all records in one easy location to update with every single bit of information that is relevant to a personal file. Examples being social security numbers, tax information, current address, and other informationDawes, Sharon S. \\"The Evolution and Continuing Challenges of E-Governance.\\" - Dawes. Wiley Online Library, n.d. Government-to-employees (abbreviated G2E) is the online interactions through instantaneous communication tools between government units and their employees. G2E is one out of the four primary delivery models of e-Government. G2E is an effective way to provide e-learning to the employees, bring them together and to promote knowledge sharing among them. It also gives employees the possibility of accessing information in regard to compensation and benefits policies, training and learning opportunities and civil rights laws. G2E services also include software for maintaining personal information and records of employees. G2E is adopted in many countries including the United States, Hong Kong, and New Zealand.  Government to government  =E-government= From the start of 1990s e-commerce and e-product, there has rampant integration of e-forms of government process. Governments have now tried to use the efficiencies of their techniques to cut down on waste. E-government is a fairly broad subject matter, but all relate to how the services and representation are now delivered and how they are now being implemented. Many governments around the world have gradually turned to Information technologies (IT) in an effort to keep up with today's demands. Historically, many governments in this sphere have only been reactive, but recently there has been a more proactive approach in developing comparable services such things as e-commerce and e-business. Before, the structure emulated private-like business techniques. Recently that has all changed as e-government begins to make its own plan. Not only does e-government introduce a new form of record keeping, but it also continues to become more interactive to better the process of delivering services and promoting constituency participation. The framework of such an organization is now expected to increase more than ever by becoming efficient and reducing the time it takes to complete an objective. Some examples include paying utilities, tickets, and applying for permits. So far, the biggest concern is accessibility to Internet technologies for the average citizen. In an effort to help, administrations are now trying to aid those who do not have the skills to fully participate in this new medium of governance, especially now as e-government progressing to more e-governance tho. An overhaul of the structure is now required as every pre-existing sub-entity must now merge under one concept of e-government. As a result, Public Policy has also seen changes due to the emerging of constituent participation and the Internet. Many governments such as Canada's have begun to invest in developing new mediums of communication of issues and information through virtual communication and participation. In practice, this has led to several responses and adaptations by interest groups, activist, and lobbying groups. This new medium has changed the way the polis interacts with government. =Editorial= The purpose to include e-governance to government is to means more efficient in various aspects. Whether it means to reduce cost by reducing paper clutter, staffing cost, or communicating with private citizens or public government. E-government brings many advantages to play such as facilitating information delivery, application process/renewal between both business and private citizen, and participation with the constituency. There are both internal and external advantages to the emergence of IT in government, though not all municipalities are alike in size and participation. In theory, there are currently 4 major levels of E-government in municipal governments: *The establishment of a secure and cooperative interaction among governmental agencies *Web-based service delivery *The application of e-commerce for more efficient government transactions activities * Digital democracy These, along with 5 degrees of technical integration and interaction of users include: *Simple information dissemination (one-way communication) * Two-way communication (request and response) *Service and financial transactions *Integration (horizontal and vertical integration) *Political participation The adoption of e-government in municipalities evokes greater innovation in e-governance by being specialized and localized. The level success and feedback depends greatly on the city size and government type. A council-manager government municipality typically works the best with this method, as opposed to mayor-council government positions, which tend to be more political. Therefore, they have greater barriers towards its application. Council-Manager governments are also more inclined to be effective here by bringing innovation and reinvention of governance to e-governance. The International City/County Management Association and Public Technology Inc. have done surveys over the effectiveness of this method. The results are indicating that most governments are still in either the primary stages (1 or stage 2), which revolves around public service requests. Though application of integration is now accelerating, there has been little to no instigating research to see its progression as e-governance to the government. We can only theorize it's still within the primitive stages of e-governance. =Overview= Government-to-Government (abbreviated G2G) is the online non- commercial interaction between Government organizations, departments, and authorities and other Government organizations, departments, and authorities. Its use is common in the UK, along with G2C, the online non-commercial interaction of local and central Government and private individuals, and G2B the online non-commercial interaction of local and central Government and the commercial business sector. G2G systems generally come in one of two types: Internal-facing - joining up a single Governments departments, agencies, organizations, and authorities - examples include the integration aspect of the Government Gateway, and the UK NHS Connecting for Health Data SPINE. External facing - joining up multiple Governments IS systems - an example would include the integration aspect of the Schengen Information System (SIS), developed to meet the requirements of the Schengen Agreement. =Objective= The strategic objective of e-governance, or in this case G2G is to support and simplify governance for government, citizens, and businesses. The use of ICT can connect all parties and support processes and activities. Other objectives are to make government administration more transparent, speedy and accountable while addressing the society's needs and expectations through efficient public services and effective interaction between the people, businesses, and government.

It is an IP-based virtual private network based on broadband technology introduced in April 1998 and further upgraded in February 2004. Among other things, it offers a variety of advanced services including file transfer and search facilities, directory services, email exchange facilities (both between network members and over the Internet) as well as voice and video services. An additional network is currently also under development: the Public Sector Network (PSN) will be the network to interconnect public authorities (including departments and agencies in England; devolved administrations and local governments) and facilitate in particular sharing of information and services among each other.HM Government (December 2009). \\"Putting the Frontline First: smarter government\\".

G2B: Refers to the conduction through the Internet between government agencies and trading companies. B2G: Professional transactions between the company and the district, city, or federal regulatory agencies. B2G usually include recommendations to complete the measurement and evaluation of books and contracts. =Objective= The objective of G2B is to reduce difficulties for business, provide immediate information and enable digital communication by e-business (XML). In addition, the government should re-use the data in the report proper, and take advantage of commercial electronic transaction protocol.IGI-GLOBAL What is Government-to-Business (G2B) Retrieved 27 OCT.2014 Government services are concentrated on the following groups: human services; community services; judicial services; transport services; land resources; business services; financial services and other.Bakry, S.

Each of the components listed above for each cluster of related services to the enterprise. =Benefits for business= E-government reduces costs and lowers the barrier of allowing companies to interact with the government. The interaction between the government and businesses reduces the time required for businesses to conduct a transaction. For instance, there is no need to commute to a government agency's office, and transactions may be conducted online instantly with the click of a mouse. This significantly reduces transaction time for the government and businesses alike. E-Government provides a greater amount of information that the business needed, also it makes that information more clear. A key factor in business success is the ability to plan and forecast through data-driven future. The government collected a lot of economic, demographic and other trends in the data. This makes the data more accessible to companies which may increase the chance of economic prosperity. In addition, E-Government can help businesses navigate through government regulations by providing an intuitive site organization with a wealth of useful applications. The electronic filings of applications for environmental permits give an example of it. Companies often do not know how, when, and what they must apply. Therefore, failure to comply with environmental regulations up to 70%, a staggering figureAccording to an Environmental Results Program (ERP) study conducted in 1997 covering 2,000 (of 16,000 total) businesses. most likely due to confusion about the requirements, rather than the product of willful disregard of the law.The Benefits of E-Government Retrieved 27 OCT.2014 =Disadvantages= The government should concern that not all people are able to access the internet to gain online government services. The network reliability, as well as information on government bodies, can influence public opinion and prejudice hidden agenda. There are many considerations and implementation, designing e-government, including the potential impact of government and citizens of disintermediation, the impact on economic, social and political factors, vulnerable to cyber attacks, and disturbances to the status quo in these areas. G2B rises the connection between government and businesses. Once the e-government began to develop, become more sophisticated, people will be forced to interact with e-government in the larger area. This may result in a lack of privacy for businesses as their government gets their more and more information. In the worst case, there is so much information in the electron transfer between the government and business, a system which is like totalitarian could be developed. As the government can access more information, the loss of privacy could be a cost.

The photo reconnaissance flights were flown in 1956, 1960, 1973, 1974 and 1980 by the U.S. Department of the Interior, and are archived by the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, California. Comparison of the aerial photographs indicate that no development had begun in the vicinity prior to 1956 other than the Palo Alto Airport and the Regional Water Quality Control Board Plant (terminus of Embarcadero Way). Between 1956 and 1960, no new development had taken place in the area; however, by 1973, the Harvey Gum Factory was on the subject site and structures were either completed or under construction at 1890 Embarcadero Road and 2440-2450 Embarcadero Way. Conditions were dentical in the 1974 aerial photograph. In the 1980 aerial photograph, the Harvey Gum Factory is standing, and additional infill construction can be seen in the area such as the Baylands Business Park adjacent and to south of the site and the structure now located at 1860 Embarcadero Road. The Harvey Gum Factory was demolished in 1982, based on Palo Alto Planning Department records. In 2015 the City of Palo Alto took over operations from Santa Clara County, after a 50-year lease had ended.

Career Sergio joined the band in April 2001 as a session member when he took over the role of Nathan Azarcon, who left the band in February 2001. When Kakoy Legaspi and Mike Elgar joined in May 2001, Sergio was officially absorbed and the band began recording for \\"Tuloy ang Ligaya\\". Their first performance under their new lineup was at NU Pocket Concerts in Alabang Town Center on June 2, 2001. Known to many as Japs, Japsuki, and JP, is actually a drummer. Furthermore, he is also one of the founders of the band Daydream Cycle and is the guitarist and co-songwriter of the said band. He went on hiatus some time in 2011 in Rivermaya as he was focusing with Daydream Cycle. On December 19, 2011, Sergio released his project solo album titled \\"Monologue Whispers\\" under the mononym Japsuki. On November 2012, Sergio posted on his official Facebook page that he is no longer with Rivermaya. Currently, he is the frontman of the band Peso Movement along Francis Reyes, Macky Macaventa and Kurt Floreska. Sergio labels the group's genre as \\"dirty rock\\". In 2016, Sergio temporarily returned to Rivermaya taking over Norby David after he left the band the same year. He toured on some live shows until original bassist Nathan Azarcon permanently filled in the position. He co-produced the 13th studio album Sa Kabila ng Lahat, which was released on September 15, 2017.

The moving parts have controlled and constrained motions. Moving parts are machine components excluding any moving fluids, such as fuel, coolant or hydraulic fluid. Moving parts also do not include any mechanical locks, switches, nuts and bolts, screw caps for bottles etc. A system with no moving parts is described as \\"solid state\\".  Mechanical efficiency and wear  The amount of moving parts in a machine is a factor in its mechanical efficiency. The greater the number of moving parts, the greater the amount of energy lost to heat by friction between those parts. For example, in a modern automobile engine, roughly 7% of the total power obtained from burning the engine's fuel is lost to friction between the engine's moving parts. Conversely, the fewer the number of moving parts, the greater the efficiency. Machines with no moving parts at all can be very efficient. An electrical transformer, for example, has no moving parts, and its mechanical efficiency is generally above the 90% mark. (The remaining power losses in a transformer are from other causes, including loss to electrical resistance in the copper windings and hysteresis loss and eddy current loss in the iron core.) Two means are used for overcoming the efficiency losses caused by friction between moving parts. First, moving parts are lubricated. Second, the moving parts of a machine are designed so that they have a small amount of contact with one another. The latter, in its turn, comprises two approaches. A machine can be reduced in size, thereby quite simply reducing the areas of the moving parts that rub against one another; and the designs of the individual components can be modified, changing their shapes and structures to reduce or avoid contact with one another. Lubrication also reduces wear, as does the use of suitable materials. As moving parts wear out, this can affect the precision of the machine. Designers thus have to design moving parts with this factor in mind, ensuring that if precision over the lifetime of the machine is paramount, that wear is accounted for and, if possible, minimized. (A simple example of this is the design of a simple single-wheel wheelbarrow. A design where the axle is fixed to the barrow arms and the wheel rotates around it is prone to wear which quickly causes wobble, whereas a rotating axle that is attached to the wheel and that rotates upon bearings in the arms does not start to wobble as the axle wears through the arms.) The scientific and engineering discipline that deals with the lubrication, friction, and wear of moving parts is tribology, an interdisciplinary field that encompasses materials science, mechanical engineering, chemistry, and mechanics.  Failure  As mentioned, wear is a concern for moving parts in a machine. Other concerns that lead to failure include corrosion, erosion, thermal stress and heat generation, vibration, fatigue loading, and cavitation. Fatigue is related to large inertial forces, and is affected by the type of motion that a moving part has. A moving part that has a uniform rotation motion is subject to less fatigue than a moving part that oscillates back and forth. Vibration leads to failure when the forcing frequency of the machine's operation hits a resonant frequency of one or more moving parts, such as rotating shafts. Designers avoid these problems by calculating the natural frequencies of the parts at design time, and altering the parts to limit or eliminate such resonance. Yet further factors that can lead to failure of moving parts include failures in the cooling and lubrication systems of a machine. One final, particular, factor related to failure of moving parts is kinetic energy. The sudden release of the kinetic energy of the moving parts of a machine causes overstress failures if a moving part is impeded in its motion by a foreign object. For example, consider a stone caught on the blades of a fan or propellor, or even the proverbial \\"spanner/monkey wrench in the works\\". (See foreign object damage for further discussion of this.)  Kinetic energy of the moving parts of a machine  The kinetic energy of a machine is the sum of the kinetic energies of its individual moving parts. A machine with moving parts can, mathematically, be treated as a connected system of bodies, whose kinetic energies are simply summed. The individual kinetic energies are determined from the kinetic energies of the moving parts' translations and rotations about their axes. The kinetic energy of rotation of the moving parts can be determined by noting that every such system of moving parts can be reduced to a collection of connected bodies rotating about an instantaneous axis, which form either a ring or a portion of an ideal ring, of radius a rotating at n revolutions per second. This ideal ring is known as the equivalent flywheel, whose radius is the radius of gyration. The integral of the squares of the radii all the portions of the ring with respect to their mass \\\\int a^2 dm, also expressible if the ring is modelled as a collection of discrete particles as the sum of the products of those mass and the squares of their radii \\\\sum_{k=0}^n m_k \\\\times a_k^2 is the ring's moment of inertia, denoted I. The rotational kinetic energy of the whole system of moving parts is \\\\frac{1}{2} I \\\\omega^2, where \\\\omega is the angular velocity of the moving parts about the same axis as the moment of inertia. The kinetic energy of translation of the moving parts is \\\\frac{1}{2} m v^2, where m is the total mass and v is the magnitude of the velocity. This gives the formula for the total kinetic energy of the moving parts of a machine as \\\\frac{1}{2} I \\\\omega^2 + \\\\frac{1}{2} m v^2. This engineering diagram (illustrating the principle in kinematic design that using incorrect types/numbers of mechanical linkages can cause fixed parts to wobble) shows the motion of the wobbling parts with a solid outline of the moving part in one position at one extremity of its motion and a phantom line outline of the part in the position at the other extremity.  Representing moving parts in engineering diagrams  In technical drawing, moving parts are, conventionally, designated by drawing the solid outline of the part in its main or initial position, with an added outline of the part in a secondary, moved, position drawn with a phantom line (a line comprising \\"dot-dot-dash\\" sequences of two short and one long line segments) outline. These conventions are enshrined in several standards from the American National Standards Institute and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, including ASME Y14.2M published in 1979. In recent decades, the use of animation has become more practical and widespread in technical and engineering diagrams for the illustration of the motions of moving parts. Animation represents moving parts more clearly and enables them and their motions to be more readily visualized. Furthermore, computer aided design tools allow the motions of moving parts to be simulated, allowing machine designers to determine, for example, whether the moving parts in a given design would obstruct one another's motion or collide by simple visual inspection of the (animated) computer model rather than by the designer performing a numerical analysis directly.

Early life Buckle was the son of George Buckle, canon of Wells Cathedral, and Mary Hamlyn Earle, the sister of the philologist John Earle. He attended Honition grammar school and Winchester College before beginning studies at New College, Oxford in 1873. There he won the Newdigate Prize in 1875 and received a first class in both literae humaniores and modern history. From 1877 until 1885, he was a Fellow of All Souls College. While reading in the chambers of John Rigby, Buckle began receiving offers from the world of journalism. Though he declined the assistant editorship of the Manchester Guardian, a few months before being called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn in 1880 he accepted John Walter's offer to join the editorial staff of The Times. When the editor, Thomas Chenery died in 1884, Buckle, then only 29, was named as his successor, having already assumed most of the position's duties during Chenery's final illness. Editor of The Times As editor, Buckle did little to alter either the appearance or the policies of the paper. No longer \\"the Thunderer\\" of old, its employees endeavoured to present the news irrespective of bias or interest. By now the staff saw themselves as a collective body serving the public interest, a sense preserved by its ongoing editorial practice of supporting whichever government was in power at the time. The paper's purchase and publication of Richard Piggott's forged letters purportedly showing a connection between Irish Parliamentary Party leader Charles Stewart Parnell and the Phoenix Park murders was primarily motivated by the desire for a scoop rather than because of politics, and Buckle's subsequent offer of his resignation was rejected by Walter.History of the Times, vol. 3:The Twentieth Century Test (New York: The Macmillan Company, 1947), p. 13-16, 43‚Äì4, 55‚Äì56, 80‚Äì81 In the years that followed, Buckle's control over the day-to-day operations of The Times declined due to administrative reorganisation, as authority was gradually decentralised within the paper. Buckle's own duties were reduced slowly to matters of editorial control and the writing of the leading article. When Lord Northcliffe purchased the paper in 1908, he pressed forward with modernisation measures which Buckle had long resisted. The death of the managing director, Charles Frederic Moberly Bell, three years later eliminated the last check on the owner, and Northcliffe forced Buckle's resignation on 31 July 1911. Literary career A few months after his departure from The Times, Buckle was approached by the trustees of the estate of Benjamin Disraeli about continuing work on a multi-volume biography of the former prime minister, work on which had been halted by the death of the initial author, William Flavelle Monypenny. Buckle accepted, spending the next eight years writing the final four volumes (of six) of the Life of Benjamin Disraeli. After its completion in 1920, he was asked to take on another ongoing project, the editing of Queen Victoria's letters. Accepting after some hesitation, he performed the task with discretion, ultimately editing six volumes covering Victoria's letters from 1861 until her death. Buckle's final project was organising a multi- volume history of The Times, the first volume of which was published before he died in 1935.Stanley Weintraub, \\"Buckle, George Earle\\" in The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, H.C.G. Matthew and Brian Harrison, eds. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), vol. 8, p. 526. Personal life Buckle married twice. His first marriage, in 1885, was to Alicia Isobel, the third daughter of the novelist James Payn; their union produced two children. After Alicia's death, Buckle married his first cousin Beatrice Anne, the second daughter of John Earle, in 1905.

Notable work  West is a chemist best known for his groundbreaking research in silicon chemistry as well as for his work with oxocarbons and organolithium compounds. In 2004, West was listed as one of the most cited scientists during the period 1981-1999, according to a citation survey by Thomson ISI. West's most well-known discovery was the synthesis of the first ever silicon-silicon double bond in 1981, a feat which broke the so- called \\"double-bond rule\\" (which stated that main group elements below row two of the periodic table could not form double bonds). West later discovered the first example of a stable silylene, a form of divalent silicon, acting as the silicon analog to the now catalytically important carbene. West also developed a new model for understanding rotations in polymers. West's numerous other discoveries include a siloxane-based electrolyte which has made possible revolutionary rechargeable implantable batteries for biomedical applications including the treatment of spinal injuries and nerve damage. His current interests include the synthesis of silicon-containing anticancer drugs, and the study of silicon and germanium compounds by muon resonance spectroscopy.

It is owned by Santa Clara County and is near the Evergreen district of San Jose where aviation pioneer John J. Montgomery experimented with gliders in 1911. Reid‚ÄìHillview Airport was also the official general aviation airport for the 2015 Super Bowl in Levi's Stadium (nearby Santa Clara, CA). Reid‚ÄìHillview is a general aviation airport; there is no scheduled airline service. As with most general aviation airports air charter operations are available. The airport has a control tower that operates 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. local time. The FAA classifies Reid‚ÄìHillview as a reliever airport for San Jose International Airport.  History  Groundbreaking for Reid‚ÄìHillview airport came in 1937. Bob and Cecil Reid built the Garden City Airport in 1935, which was quickly closed to make room for U.S. Route 101. Their second site was northwest of the Hillview golf course, hence the name. Until 1946 the single runway was unpaved. Reid‚ÄìHillview was a single runway airport until 1965, when a second runway was added. The control tower opened in October 1967. The airport was the origin for an emergency supply airlift to the Watsonville Municipal Airport following the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, after mountain and coastal roads were blocked, cutting off Santa Cruz and Watsonville from relief efforts by ground. The Watsonville Airport estimates that it received 100 tons of supplies via the airlift during the week following the quake. John McAvoy and Bill Dunn of the Reid‚ÄìHillview Airport Association received the 1990 Grand Award from the Bay Area's Metropolitan Transportation Commission for organizing the airlift. In 2010 San Jose State University's aviation program relocated to Reid‚ÄìHillview. The university operates out of the Swift Building, where it holds classes during the academic year.  Fixed-base operators (FBOs)  Overlooking transient parking and the control tower At Reid‚ÄìHillview, fixed- base operators (FBOs) compete for fuel sales, aircraft rentals and/or flight training. * Aerial AvionicsAerial Avionics * AeroDynamic Aviation,AeroDynamic Aviation formerly Amelia Reid Aviation * Air AccordAir Accord * The Flying 20'sThe Flying 20's * Nice Air AviationNice Air Aviation * San Jose Fuel CompanySan Jose Fuel Company * Squadron 2 Flying ClubSquadron 2 Flying Club * Trade Winds AviationTrade Winds Aviation * Victory Aero MaintenanceVictory Aero Maintenance  Future airport plans  The Santa Clara County wrote up a 120+ page documenthttp://www.countyairports.org/docs/MasterPlan/RHV_Masterplan- complete.pdf containing information for future plans and expansions for Reid‚ÄìHillview. In the mid-2000s the county announced they would demolish the second story of the airport terminal to make room for new offices for airport administration. They failed to follow up on this plan, and the second story has been sitting idle ever since. Included in the document, the county also planned on adding small expansions to the runway to allow turboprops and small business jets to land. Although turboprops and small business jets still land in the current runway, this minor expansion will allow a larger flow of these type of aircraft to land. On December 4, 2018 the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors voted 3-2 to not accept new FAA grant funding for the airport, which allows the county to explore alternative uses for the land. Previously accepted grants require the county to keep the airport open through 2031.https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/12/04/reid-hillview-airports-days-may- be-numbered-after-santa-clara-supervisors-action/ In December 2018, the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors voted not to accept additional FAA grant that would oblige the airport‚Äôs continued operation through 2051. The County is currently committed to operating the airport until 2031. Between 2019 and 2020, Santa Clara County undertook a community process to explore possible future uses for the airport site, resulting in the draft Reid Hillview Vision Plan. Its vision statement reads: ‚ÄúThis East San Jose neighborhood will be a place of empowerment built on our culture, diversity and history, and sustained by education, well-being, and economic opportunity for the community.  Ground transportation  Capitol Expressway (County Route G21) is at the entrance to the airport at Cunningham Avenue. = Rental cars/taxi = Enterprise car rental is available on the field next to the Airport Shoppe. Nice Air also has rental vehicles. = Bus = The Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) has its Eastridge Transit Center across Tully Road at Eastridge Mall, about a half-mile walk southbound along Capitol Expressway. VTA has plans for a bus rapid transit line from the Diridon train station in downtown San Jose to the Eastridge Transit Center. Further plans with less certain funding include a light rail extension from the Alum Rock station to Eastridge. In both cases, the segment along Capitol Expressway would serve Reid‚ÄìHillview Airport. = Other airport amenities = As of a few years ago, Reid‚ÄìHillview Airport had vending machines, a pilot's lounge and break room. Santa Clara County passed a new law stating the terminal would no longer allow unhealthy food or drinks to be sold inside. This meant that coffee and all the vending machines that used to be there would no longer exist in the terminal. Now, all that remains is a water drinking fountain and bathrooms. However, there is still a seating area inside the terminal.
