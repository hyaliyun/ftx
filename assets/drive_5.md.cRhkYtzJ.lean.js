His daily column, which ran in the Los Angeles Times for 37 years, expressed \\"keen observations of the life he loved in ever-surprising Southern California\\" and was described by former Los Angeles Times Editor Shelby Coffey III as \\"one of the abiding highlights of the Los Angeles Times.\\" Smith was the author of 10 books, many of them based on his columns, and won the Los Angeles chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists' Distinguished Journalist award in 1981. Life and career Smith was born in Long Beach on August 27, 1916 and grew up in both Bakersfield and Los Angeles. He attended Belmont High School in Los Angeles and served as editor of the student newspaper, the Belmont Sentinel. Smith would occasionally joke that it was the highest position he ever reached in his career. Following high school, Smith spent some time in the Civilian Conservation Corps before joining the United States Merchant Marine at age 21. He went into journalism, first for the Bakersfield Californian, then for the Honolulu Advertiser, United Press, the Sacramento Union, the San Diego Daily Journal, the Daily News, and the Los Angeles Herald-Express, before joining the Los Angeles Times in June 1953. He remained with the Times until his death in 1996. =World War II= On the beach in Iwo Jima, Smith (bottom right) reads a book titled Naming Your Baby. Smith was working for The Honolulu Advertiser during the Attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. On the morning of the attack, he and his wife had just left an all-night party with some friends when they noticed airplanes streaking over the shoreline. Shortly after, they noticed black puffs exploding below the planes in the distance. Smith and his friend stood watching in the road beside the car, something he would later describe in a column as \\"watching the war start.\\"Jack Smith, \\"What If? A Post- Pearl Harbor Attack on Oahu? A WWII Tale More Terrible Than Fact\\", Los Angeles Times, December 4, 1988. Smith enlisted in the United States Marine Corps as a combat correspondent and would take part in the Battle of Iwo Jima in 1945. In the amphibious landing on February 19, 1945, Smith went ashore in the third wave of soldiersJack Smith, \\"Forty years later, survivors return to Iwo Jima, their painful memories in focus\\", Los Angeles Times, May 27, 1985. with his rifle but without his typewriter, which had been lost at sea. Smith's Los Angeles Times column would occasionally recount his experiences during the battle. On the subject of the iconic Iwo Jima flag raising, Smith addressed a sometimes discussed controversy of a second, larger American flag being raised to replace the initially planted one (as the first one was too small to be seen by the soldiers fighting on the island). He recalled that he \\"happened to look up at Mt. Suribachi from the beach that day and saw [the flag] rippling in the breeze. I did not feel cheated because I had not seen the first one.\\"Jack Smith, \\"Pearl Harbor Day: Some Stirring Memories of the War\\", Los Angeles Times, October 2, 1991. During his service on Iwo Jima, Smith was the subject of an Associated Press photograph that appeared on the front page of hundreds of newspapers across the United States. On D-Day plus 5, he had received a care package from his wife, who was pregnant with their first child. The package contained a book titled Naming Your Baby along with a letter encouraging him to help decide on a name while there was still time. As Smith flipped through the pages, a crowd of Marines formed around him, each of them urging him to look up their own names, and the names of their fathers, mothers, siblings, and girlfriends. \\"While we were engaged in this incongruous diversion,\\" Smith wrote in his February 21, 1979 column, \\"a photographer happened by and was curious. What was going on here? He was sick of death, shock and horror and was looking for something upbeat. Human interest. A sign that life would go on.\\" The photographer snapped several photos, one of which was distributed by the Associated Press and appeared in newspapers a few days later. =The Black Dahlia= It was as a rewrite man for the Daily News in 1947 that Smith had what he later called \\"perhaps my finest hour as a newspaperman\\": his stories on the infamous Elizabeth Short murder case. The police beat reporter phoned in the bulletin to Smith, who recounted the moment this way in his book Jack Smith's L.A.: \\"Within the minute I had written what may have been the first sentence ever written on the Black Dahlia case. I can't remember it word for word, but my lead went pretty much like this: 'The nude body of a young woman, neatly cut in two at the waist, was found early today on a vacant lot near Crenshaw and Exposition Boulevards.'\\" His editor added one adjective, making Short \\"a beautiful young woman ... Our city editor, of course, no more knew what the unfortunate young woman had looked like than I did ... But the lesson was clear. On the Daily News, at least, all young women whose nude bodies were found in two pieces on vacant lots were beautiful. I never forgot it.\\"Jack Hawn, \\"Blind Journey: A Journalist's Memoirs\\", Google Books, Retrieved December 9, 2015. Later in his career, Smith wrote that he always believed himself to be the first person to get the name \\"Black Dahlia\\" into print, though he admitted he didn't come up with the nickname.Kevin Roderick, \\"Ellroy and the Black Dahlia\\", LA Observed, August 28, 2006. Smith picked up a tip that Elizabeth Short had frequented a Long Beach drugstore. Upon calling and speaking to the pharmacist, Smith was told that the kids around the soda fountain called her the Black Dahlia, on account of her black hair and in reference to a then current movie The Blue Dahlia. In his book, Jack Smith's L.A., he described the discovery of the nickname as \\"a rewrite man's dream\\" and said he \\"couldn't wait to get it into type.\\"Steve Hodel, \\"Black Dahlia Avenger: A Genius for Murder: The True Story\\", Google Books, Retrieved December 11, 2015. =Jack Smith, columnist= Smith joined the Los Angeles Times in June 1953. At the Times, besides his duties as a rewrite man, in which he would quickly assemble stories based largely on information from reporters who phoned in from the field, Smith began writing humor pieces for the op-ed page. He was awarded his own column in 1958. At the height of his popularity, Smith's columns were distributed to almost 600 newspapers worldwide by the Los Angeles Times-Washington Post News Service. His daily column was widely read at breakfast tables across Southern California, from the working class suburbs of Los Angeles to the mansions of Beverly Hills. Among his readers were Fred MacMurray, Bing Crosby, Henry Miller, Groucho Marx, and Charlton Heston.Beverly Beyette, \\"A Window on the World: Oddities, Celebrities and Just Plain Folks Fill His Room With a View\\", Los Angeles Times, January 1, 1992. Groucho Marx was a self-described \\"avid reader\\" of Jack Smith.Beverly Beyette, \\"A Window on the World: Oddities, Celebrities and Just Plain Folks Fill His Room With a View\\", Los Angeles Times, January 1, 1992. Charlton Heston, in a January 15, 1996 letter to the Los Angeles Times, wrote \\"Jack gave me the sense and rhythm of Los Angeles...Funny when he wanted to be, easy and generous always, Jack made me understand Los Angeles. I know of no one else who has done it as gracefully nor as well.\\"\\"An Appreciation: L.A. Won't Be The Same Without Jack Smith\\", Los Angeles Times, January 15, 1996. For most of his career he wrote five columns a week, a pace later eased to four per week. In 1992, he went into semi- retirement, writing one column per week. In his later years, his columns often concerned his declining health and the infirmities of age. Smith had quadruple bypass surgery in 1984 and a heart attack later that year, a second heart attack after prostate surgery in 1994 and a final heart attack in late December 1995. His last column appeared on December 25, 1995. He died on January 9, 1996, aged 79. His papers were donated to the Huntington Library in 2005. An exhibit, \\"Smith on Wry: Jack Smith, Columnist for Our Times\\" was on view at the Huntington in 2008. It featured original newspaper columns, drafts and galleys of his books, and other materials. =Personal life= Smith and his wife, Denny, lived in the same house in the Mount Washington, Los Angeles neighborhood near Downtown L.A.Layne Murphy, \\"Jack Smith - Mount Washington Favorite Son\\" , Mount Washington Homeowners Alliance, Retrieved December 4, 2015. from 1950 until his death in 1996.Myrna Oliver, \\"Denise Smith, 83; Wife of Jack Smith Was a Key Figure in His Columns\\", Los Angeles Times, April 13, 2004.

In May 2004, Mount Washington Elementary School broke ground on the Jack and Denny Smith Library on their campus. The library, named in honor of Smith and his wife's dedication to Mount Washington, was dedicated on June 2, 2007. Smith's family was often the subject of his columns, and readers came to know his wife Denny, their two sons, Curtis and Douglas, their two daughters-in-law, Gail and Jacqueline, and their five grandchildren, Chris, Adriana, Alison, Casey, and Trevor. Awards Jack Smith won the Greater Los Angeles Press Club's highest honor, the Joseph M. Quinn Memorial Award, in 1991.\\"Jack Smith to Get Press Club Award\\", Los Angeles Times, March 24, 1991. According to his Los Angeles Times obituary: \\"He occasionally joked that he had come close to winning a Pulitzer Prize but that 'one can't talk about having won second place in the Pulitzer Prize.'\\" Quotes In Westways Magazine, Smith wrote about driving down the Los Angeles River: \\"As we came out of the river I saw the Queen Mary. I thought that it was fitting to have a ship without engines sailing up a river without water.\\" On critics of Los Angeles: \\"Critics have despised us in Los Angeles as worshippers of money, health, sex, surf and sun. Not quite true. We don't worship those things; we just rather get used to them, since they happen to be so available.\\" \\"I've heard it said that men first begin to realize their youth is over when policemen begin to look like college boys.

His pale-blue eyes seemed alternately to burn and disconnect, as if his circuits were overloaded...They [Mailer and Monroe] had never met in life, and here was now, revealing himself as her last, most passionate, most hopeless lover...They seemed an odd couple: Mailer so open, Marilyn so closed.

What about the drive-in church?\\" On his Baja house: \\"When we reached the house, the rain had stopped, but the wind off the ocean was like wild organ music in the roof tiles. We lighted lanterns and I built a fire; that is to say, I put an ersatz log from the supermarket in the grate and put a match to it.\\" In the Times, Nov. 14, 1994, to \\" . . . the ultimate question--why are we here? . . .

When a substance or compound is combined with any other substance or compound the enthalpy of mixing is the consequence of the new interactions between the two substances or compounds. This enthalpy if released exothermically can in an extreme case cause an explosion. Enthalpy of mixing can often be ignored in calculations for mixtures where other heat terms exist, or in cases where the mixture is ideal. The sign convention is the same as for enthalpy of reaction: when the enthalpy of mixing is positive, mixing is endothermic while negative enthalpy of mixing signifies exothermic mixing. In ideal mixtures the enthalpy of mixing is null. In non-ideal mixtures the thermodynamic activity of each component is different from its concentration by multiplying with the activity coefficient. One approximation for calculating the heat of mixing is Flory‚ÄìHuggins solution theory for polymer solutions.  Formal definition  For a liquid, enthalpy of mixing can be defined as follows H_{(mixture)}=\\\\Delta H_{mix}+\\\\sum x_iH_{i} Where: * H(mixture) is the total enthalpy of the system after mixing * ŒîHmix is the enthalpy of mixing * xi is the mole fraction of component i in the system * Hi is the enthalpy of pure i Enthalpy of mixing can also be defined using Gibbs free energy of mixing \\\\Delta G_{mix}=\\\\Delta H_{mix}-T\\\\Delta S_{mix} However, Gibbs free energy of mixing and entropy of mixing tend to be more difficult to determine experimentally. As such, enthalpy of mixing tends to be determined experimentally in order to calculate entropy of mixing, rather than the reverse. Enthalpy of mixing is defined exclusively for the continuum regime, which excludes molecular-scale effects (However, first-principles calculations have been made for some metal-alloy systems such as Al-Co-Cr or Œ≤-Ti). When two substances are mixed the resulting enthalpy is not an addition of the pure component enthalpies, unless the substances form an ideal mixture. The interactions between each set of molecules determines the final change in enthalpy. For example, when compound ‚Äúx‚Äù has a strong attractive interaction with compound ‚Äúy‚Äù the resulting enthalpy is exothermic. In the case of alcohol and its interactions with a hydrocarbon, the alcohol molecule participates in hydrogen bonding with other alcohol molecules, and these hydrogen bonding interactions are much stronger than alcohol-hydrocarbon interactions, which results in an endothermic heat of mixing. Calculations Enthalpy of mixing is often calculated experimentally using calorimetry methods. A bomb calorimeter is created to be an isolated system. With an insulated frame and a reaction chamber, a bomb calorimeter is used to transfer heat of a reaction or mixing into surrounding water which is then calculated for temperature. A typical solution would use the equation H_{mixture}=\\\\Delta H_{mix}+\\\\sum x_iH_{i} (derived from the definition above) in conjunction experimentally determined total-mixture enthalpies and tabulated pure species enthalpies, the difference being equal to enthalpy of mixing. More complex models, such as the Flory-Huggins and UNIFAC models, allow prediction of enthalpies of mixing. Flory-Huggins is useful in calculating enthalpies of mixing for polymeric mixtures and considers a system from a multiplicity perspective. Calculations of organic enthalpies of mixing can be made by modifying UNIFAC using the equations * \\\\Delta H_{mix}=\\\\sum x_i \\\\overline{\\\\Delta H_i} * \\\\overline{\\\\Delta H_i}=\\\\sum_k N_{ki}(H_k-H^*_{ki}) * {H_k\\\\over{RT^2}}=Q_k\\\\biggl({\\\\sum_m{\\\\theta \\\\psi '_{mk}}\\\\over{\\\\sum_m{\\\\theta \\\\psi_{mk}}}}-\\\\biggl(\\\\sum_m {{\\\\theta_m \\\\psi '_km}\\\\over{\\\\sum_n \\\\theta_n \\\\psi_{nm}}}-}\\\\biggr)\\\\biggr) Where: ** x_i = liquid mole fraction of i ** \\\\overline{\\\\Delta H_i} = partial molar excess enthalpy of i ** N_{ki} = number of groups of type k in i ** H_k = excess enthalpy of group k ** H^* _{ki} = excess enthalpy of group k in pure i ** Q_k = area parameter of group k ** \\\\theta_m = {Q_m X_m \\\\over \\\\sum_n Q_n X_n} = area fraction of group m ** X_m = {\\\\sum_i x_i N_{mi} \\\\over \\\\sum_i x_i \\\\sum_k N_{ki}} = mole fraction of group m in the mixture *** \\\\psi_{mn} = exp \\\\biggl( - {Z a_{mn} \\\\over 2T} \\\\biggr) *** \\\\psi ^* _{mn} = {\\\\delta \\\\over \\\\delta T} ( {\\\\psi_mn} ) ** Z=35.2-0.1272T+0.00014T^2 = Temperature dependent coordination number It can be seen that prediction of enthalpy of mixing is incredibly complex and requires a plethora of system variables to be known. This explains why enthalpy of mixing is typically experimentally determined.  Ideal and regular mixtures  An ideal mixture is any in which the arithmetic mean (with respect to mole fraction) of the two pure substances is the same as that of the final mixture. Among other important thermodynamic simplifications, this means that enthalpy of mixing is zero: \\\\Delta H_{mix,ideal}=0. Any gas that follows the ideal gas law can be assumed to mix ideally, as can hydrocarbons and liquids with similar molecular interactions and properties. A regular solution or mixture has a non-zero enthalpy of mixing with an ideal entropy of mixing. Under this assumption, \\\\Delta H_{mix} scales linearly with X_1X_2, and is equivalent to the excess internal energy.  Mixing binary mixtures to form ternary mixtures The heat of mixing for binary mixtures to form ternary one can be expressed as a function of mixing ratios of binary mixtures: \\\\Delta H_{123} = (1 - x_1)^2 \\\\Delta H_{23} + (1 - x_2)^2 \\\\Delta H_{13} + (1 - x_3)^2 \\\\Delta H_{12} Intermolecular forces Intermolecular forces are the main constituent of changes in the enthalpy of a mixture. Stronger attractive forces between the mixed molecules, such as hydrogen-bonding, induced-dipole, and dipole-dipole interactions result in a lower enthalpy of the mixture and a release of heat. If strong interactions only exist between like-molecules, such as H-bonds between water in a water-hexane solution, the mixture will have a higher total enthalpy and absorb heat.

The club's ShawholmCricket Grounds, from CricketArchive, retrieved 4 November 2007 ground encompasses the cricket oval, three all-weather tennis courts, and used to have the world's only six-hole golf course approved by The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews. The clubhouse also hosted pool, table tennis, darts and poker tournaments in the winter months. Poloc Cricket Club's two principal senior cricket teams play under the names \\"Poloc\\" and \\"Shawholm\\". Poloc play in the Cricket Scotland organised Cricket Scotland League, administered by the Western District Cricket Union (\\"WDCU\\"), whilst Shawholm play in WDCU's West Cricket Scotland Reserve League. Another XI - the Poloc Panthers - plays in the WDCU Evening League, whilst a tapeball team, the Poloc Pythons, competes in the Cricket Scotland organised Tapeball League. History Scotland's first televised cricket match Founded in 1878, Poloc Cricket Club spent its first season on the site of the old Pollokshaws Race Course and in 1880 moved to its current location at Shawholm. A pavilion was acquired by the club from the now-defunct Pollokshields Athletic Club, also located on Pollok Estates, and the building was moved to Shawholm on rollers. In the same year, the main avenue from Pollokshaws Road to Pollok House was opened, running past the north side of the ground in what is now Pollok Park. This avenue still provides the approach to Shawholm with the River Cart to the left. The club's winter golf section was formed in 1889, with bowls, putting and archery being added in the years following. Full tenancy of the current site was granted to the club in 1888 by Sir John Stirling-Maxwell, 10th Baronet who continued to be involved in Poloc's affairs until his death in 1956. In 1908 the Pollokshaws Working Lads Club decided to form a football team from amongst their ranks. Sir John Stirling Maxwell also allotted that club an area of land on the estate, rent-free. The footballers, to show their appreciation, took the name of Pollok Juniors FC, (later Pollok F.C.) and Sir John became their first Honorary President. The ground allocated became known as Haggs Park and was adjacent to Poloc Cricket Club; in fact, the different spellings of the two names \\"Pollok\\" and \\"Poloc\\" were adopted at this time, deliberately, to avoid confusion. Membership at Poloc reached a peak of 600 in the late 1940s. Scotland's first televised cricket match also took place at Shawholm on 7 May 1955 when West of Scotland Cricket Club were Poloc's visitors. Poloc batted first making 110 for 9. In reply, West made 120 for 6. Junior cricket Poloc runs junior cricket teams at four age-group levels: under 10, 11, 12 and 16 and compete in West District Junior Cricket Union (\\"WDJCU\\") as well as Cricket Scotland-organised competitions. Under 10 and 11 players predominantly compete in \\"Kwik cricket\\" competitions. The club's junior sides won the WDCJU Under 11, 13 and 15 leagues in 2007, and were beaten finalists in the Under 18 Frank Smith Trophy. 2008 saw the Under 18s league champions, the Under 15s unbeaten and the Poloc Academy Strathclyde League winners, whilst 2009 saw a league championship for the Under 13Bs, another Frank Smith Trophy Final appearance and the Under 15s winning the Scottish Cup. 2010 brought the Under 18 league trophy to the club, and appearances at both the Under 18 Scottish Cup, and Under 18 Frank Smith Trophy, Finals Days. Success at junior level continued, with season 2015 seeing another Frank Smith Trophy win, the Under 11 league title and a win in the Under 12 WDJCU Indoor Super 8s tournament, and 2016 bringing another Under 18 league championship. The Under 19 WDJCU Indoor Super 8s tournament title was secured for the first time since the late 1980s in 2017. The Community Coaching Initiative Poloc Cricket Club has been providing cricket coaching in its local community under the auspices of the \\"Community Coaching Initiative\\" since 2002. Working predominantly in the Glasgow City Council area coaching has been provided to local Primary and Secondary Schools. In addition, the club, under the umbrella of the Initiative and in partnership with the WDJCU, regularly hosts \\"Kwik cricket\\" festivals. In addition to the work in local schools, the club's Community Coaching Initiative also works with other community groups in providing sports coaching in and around the club's locality.

The artist also completed a number of sculptures, including a commission to carve a family crest for a manor house. Biography Mann was born in London, England on 28 May 1911. He spent most of his childhood in Nottingham where, at 14, he was the youngest boy at the time to be awarded a scholarship to study at the Nottingham School of Art. Two years later he left for Canada, hoping to become a missionary. After giving up religion and while working at various jobs in British Columbia ‚Äì including mining, logging and printing ‚Äì Mann was inspired by the beauty of the landscape to start painting again. In Vancouver he met Arthur Lismer, a portrait painter originally from Sheffield who was a member of the Canadian Group of Seven. Lismer advised the young man to return to England and continue his art studies there. He returned to London in 1933. He continued drawing and painting water colours around the Little Venice canal in Maida Vale, a neighbourhood in West London. He met the Rev Oliver Fielding Clark, who admired his work. Clark helped to set up a trust fund, enabling Mann to study at the Royal Academy. He gained admission in 1935 on the strength of his water colours. After three years there, Mann continued his art education in Paris, supported by his art patron, Erica Marx. He returned to England with his first wife, Mary Jervis Read, at the outbreak of war. Their daughter, Sylvia, was born in 1940. Throughout the war, Mann served as a Gunner in the Royal Artillery but was never appointed an official war artist. From 1956 to 1964, Mann lived in Bevin Court, London where a wall plaque recording his life was erected in 2013. Art and career In an art career that spanned nearly half a century, the effects of light and shadow remained a lifelong fascination. In his earliest work done in Paris and London, the artist paints facing the sun. These small-scale works of urban scenes tend to be monochromatic and done from preliminary sketches. For three years, from the early to mid-1950s, Mann painted in artificial light, focusing on the three-dimensional shape of shadows cast by household objects. This development, known as the \\"solid- shadow period\\", was important to Mann's artistic development, as he used strong, intense colouring with a formalised line for the first time. In his final phase, from the 1960s onwards ‚Äì when, coincidentally, he married his second wife, the Dutch-Indonesian Renske van Slooten, who was 29 years his junior ‚Äì Mann painted the dynamic effects of light and shadow. He uses as his inspiration nudes of his young wife, as well as sunlit interiors, flowers, self-portraits and anything else at hand, such as an oil can, a stapler, and toys from his second daughter, Amanda, born in 1968. There is a sense of release as these now often large oils are painted directly and at great speed. Death Mann died on 7 January 1980, aged 68, after suffering years of mental instability and heart disease. His last self-portrait, entitled \\"Ecce Homo\\" (or \\"Behold The Mann\\"), shows the artist defiantly posing nude, between two earlier self-portraits.

The main building is connected with Aupark by a footbridge over the highway; it connects the two buildings on their second floors. Project There was also a high-rise building in the original project but it was changed after the financial group Penta had entered the project. This and other changes made the area less filled and the available space will be used for an artificial lake and a park. The construction of the park proceeded in stages. During the years 2005 and 2006, the main 9-floor building was built, the remaining buildings were constructed in the following years. Gross investment is about 3 billion Slovak crowns (cca ‚Ç¨90 million).Penta Stage 1 The first building of the complex was passed (as capable) in October 2006. The building has 9 floors and one underground floor. The first floor is intended for shops, restaurants, and other services, while the remaining ones serve as offices. A parking lot and storerooms are located underground. The total area available for rent is 12,400 m¬≤. About one half of this is already rented to a foreign company that has a technical support center for the EMEA region here. Stage 2 Digital Park II was built between 2007 and 2009. It consists of four mutually interconnected buildings. It is the largest of all the park's stages with a total rentable area of more than 40,000 m¬≤, most of which is intended for offices. The premises are also used as conference rooms. There are hundreds of parking places underground. Stage 3 The third and final stage of Digital Park was completed in 2012. It is actually an extension to the already built Digital Park II. It offers more than 21,000 m¬≤ of rentable area and over 360 parking places underground. As in Stage 2, its premises can also be used as conference rooms. In total, the entire Digital ParkDigital Park 3D panorama offers about 74,000 m¬≤ of rentable area.

It was their first novel (followed by The Safe House) and originally published by William Heinemann in 1997. Plot The novel concerns the account of one Jane Martello, a middle aged woman undergoing divorce proceedings with her husband, and subsequently separating herself from a large and strong family she has known since her childhood. The intricate traditions of her family and the one she had married into begin to break down when the body of her sister- in-law, Natalie, is found buried in the garden, after over two decades. This startlingly close distance to the house leads to the revelation of the murderer being very close to the family after all. The revelation acts to bring down the family structure that for so long was unbalanced, but stable - such as Jane's father-in-law, Alan, an openly crude and sexist novelist having once frequently had relations outside his marriage (to the knowledge of the whole family) and other underlying tensions between family members. Jane undergoes psychiatric counselling, as she revels in the mysterious circumstances of one of her best childhood friend's death, and already present forerunnings to what appear to be a mid-life crisis. She undergoes a memory exercise (that the book is named for) to unlock memories lost from the trauma of her friend's death. What she unlocks proves seemingly to be the key to the death of Natalie, but the validity of the memories become questionable with the serious allegations they lead to.

As at 2001, the population of the civil parish of Ecclesmachan was 529 and was 811 in 1991. History The name means 'church of Saint Machan', and is its form is thought to show that a church was present in the area in Sub-Roman times. However, it is not clear whether the name was coined in Gaelic or in the earlier Celtic language Cumbric (Old Welsh).Bethany Fox, 'The P-Celtic Place- Names of North-East England and South-East Scotland', The Heroic Age, 10 (2007), http://www.heroicage.org/issues/10/fox.html (appendix at http://www.heroicage.org/issues/10/fox-appendix.html). The church was once under the care of the Templars via Torphichen receptory and in fact the graveyard contains several examples of Templar symbology. The medieval church is almost entirely rebuilt but two arched doorways dating from c. 1200 survive. A date of 1710 is inscribed on one lintel.Buildings of Scotland;Lothian, by Colin Mcwilliam The most recent major remodelling dates from 1908 and was undertaken by John Honeyman. Stained glass in the interior is by Ballantine & SonBuildings of Scotland: Lothian by Colin McWilliam The new cemetery lies in a hollow at the foot of a fairly steep lane opposite the Church. It contains a large number of war graves given the small size of the village and many of the unmarked graves (566) contain the unclaimed bodies of patients who died at the nearby Bangour Village Hospital. In Ecclesmachan there is a village hall, the hall is usually used at Christmas and Galaday times. The hall is also used for OAP and Toddler clubs. Inside the hall there is a plaque that is dedicated to the war heroes that fought in World War I. There is a cemetery near the hall where some of the war heroes are buried. Ecclesmachan is best known for its countryside views, one being the Binny Craig. One of Ecclesmachans attractions is the bomb hole, it is near the Binny Craig. The bomb was meant to hit the Forth Bridge. This was during World War II. The village is home to Oatridge Agricultural College (built in 1972). It is also home to the Scottish National Equestrian Centre (SNEC) Binny Stone At least six quarries encircled the village at one time, producing stone of good quality and particularly suited to carving. The stone contains bitumen giving it a freckled appearance. Its most noteworthy use is on the Scott Monument on Princes Street in Edinburgh.http://www.ecclesmachan.org.uk/oindust.htm Notable residents Notable natives include surgeon Robert Liston, Jacobite poet William Hamilton and Stephen Mitchell (Tobacco manufacturer and philanthropist).  Improvements  Ecclesmachan had some improvements made in 2009; there was a refurbishment made to the garages after they were found to contain asbestos; West Lothian council paid to get the garages redone, and after 2‚Äì3 months the garages were finished. Other improvements included getting a Basketball net put in the local park and getting a Rugby field put up; the field it is in is closer to Oatridge College than to the village itself, but was made for the villagers to use. Scottish National Equestrian Centre Ever since the arrival of the SNEC in 2007, Ecclesmachan has started to become a well known area. There are regular Horse riding contests every weekend, and even through the week. The Old school Around the 19th and 20th century, there was a school in Ecclesmachan. It was a highly populated school, as it was the only one in the Threemiletown area. Not much is known about the school, but a report by the H.M. Inspector on the Public School in Ecclesmachan stated; 'It has been long celebrated as one of the best schools for many miles around, and the large number of children attending it from other parishes, speaks for itself'. The report went on to describe the Schoolmaster (Mr Cunningham), as 'totally devoted to his work and makes his school his first work'. The school was closed in July 1951 by the local authority due to the roll being only 6 pupils. The ‚ÄòOld school‚Äô is now used as the village hall. The village hall was refurbished in 2011, improvements were made in the toilet facilities, the lighting and the hall itself.

It is generally accepted that the simple publication of poems, visual poems or art images in a web site can not be considered Net-poetry, which is connected with the concept of \\"network\\", openness, and interactivity. Poetry hypertext and interactive environments online Some pioneer artists created different kind of net- poetry, as interactive environment on line including animated text and digital poetry: Ana Maria Uribe, Reiner Strasser (interactive video-sound poetry), Jim Andrews (vispo.com). Other artists intend net-poetry as interactive hypertext poetry/narration that can be adapted for Internet, examples being Deena Larsen (Marble Spring, interactive poetry hypertext in CD ROM, 1993, Disappearing Rein, 1999), Robert Kendall (Frame Work, 1999, a Study in Shades, 2000), Mendi Obadike (Keeping Up Appearances, a hypertextimonial, 2001) and others.

Life Gerard was born in Tilburg, an older brother of Cornelis van Spaendonck (1756‚Äì1840), who was also an accomplished artist. In the 1760s he studied with decorative painter Willem Jacob Herreyns (also known as Guillaume-Jacques Herreyns) (1743‚Äì1827) in Antwerp. In 1769 he moved to Paris, where in 1774 he was appointed miniature painter in the court of Louis XVI. In 1780 he succeeded Madeleine Fran√ßoise Basseporte (1701‚Äì1780) as professor of floral painting at the Jardin des Plantes, and shortly afterwards was elected as a member of the Acad√©mie des beaux-arts. Among his pupils were Pierre- Joseph Redout√© and Henriette Vincent. Gerard van Spaendonck painted with both oil and watercolors. He contributed over fifty works to Les V√©lins du Roi, a famous collection of botanical watercolors possessed by French royalty. From 1799 to 1801 he published twenty-four plates of Fleurs Dessinees d'apres Nature (Flowers Drawn from Life), which were high-quality engravings for students of floral painting. Today, Spaendonck's Fleurs Dessin√©es d'apr√®s Nature is a highly treasured book on floral art. In 1788 he was appointed adviser to the Acad√©mie, and in 1795 became a founding member of the Institut de France. In 1804 he received the L√©gion d'honneur and soon afterwards was ennobled by Napoleon Bonaparte. Spaendonck died in Paris in 1822 and is buried in the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery.

Fundraising Model  Fundraising models differ from event to event, however the purpose of a charity rally from the organiser's perspective is to organise an event that will generate funds or direct donations which can then be donated to charitable causes. A pure charity rally involves participants raising money for charity, which is paid directly to the nominated charitable organisation. Controversy exists over some other forms of charity rallies, whereby organisers fund their costs, and sometimes their lifestyle, from charitable donations, while holding out their organised rally to be a charitable one. Purists consider this to be a form of charity fraud.  Aid Model  In other forms of charity rallies, teams have to compete in a motorsport event and deliver goods, services and other direct aid to the communities they visit during the rally. Rallies such as the Budapest-Bamako and the Mongolia charity rally follow this model. Different schools of thought exist with respect to the type of aid model that a charity rally should support.  Business Model  Ultimately, the choice of aid model follows the organisation's business model. A business model from which the organisers make no profit, either from the entry fee or the funds raised by teams, is the most valuable model for the community. This is a model used by Charity Rallies, a volunteer based rally run by a UK registered charity, with teams paying a ¬£300 entry fee to cover administration costs for the Mongolia charity rally (with the excess being donated to charity), and the teams raising ¬£1,500 for charity, in 2009 and 2010. Another form of business model involves the events themselves being run by a profit making company, whereby the entry fee supports the organisers who make a profit from organising the event, while teams who take part in the event raise money for charity. The Mongol Rally has a business model like this, with a ¬£650 entry fee being raised for the organisers, and the teams raising an extra ¬£1,000 for nominated charities, in 2009.

It symbolically indicates that the wearer is a legitimate heir of Osiris. The sidelock was used as a divine attribute from at least as early as the Old Kingdom. In earlier depictions, the sidelock can be seen with short hat-like hairstyles in, for example, mortuary cults. Later it was usually attached to an almost shoulder-length wig, which was worn in three styles: curled, straight, or in tresses. Based on the connection between sidelocks and children, Egyptologists coined the term \\"sidelock of youth\\". They are worn by both mortal and divine children.Sylvia Schoske, Dietrich Wildung. Gott und G√∂tter im Alten √Ñgypten. von Zabern, Mainz 1992, , No. 85.  Forms The name \\"sidelock of youth\\" is not entirely accurate, since it is usually a braid rather than a lock, with its end twisted into a spiral. In Middle Kingdom depictions, the end is rolled to the front.Rolf Gundlach, Matthias Rochholz. √Ñgyptische Tempel, pp. 304‚Äì307 and 310‚Äì311. The sidelock was generally worn on the right. In reliefs it can be depicted on the left or the right, since otherwise the lock would not be visible on a figure in profile facing left. A strand of hair was separated off from the side of the skull, itself further separated into three individual braids. The braided portion was held in place by a clasp at its point of origin. Thereafter there were several different possibilities, such as the triple braided sidelock, whose three strands converged in a spiral. Only in a few cases was it gathered with a clasp at its point of origin and ended with a spiral but left as a loose lock of hair in between. Further types of divine sidelock are also known. The Horus lock, like the sidelock, was braided from three strands of hair, which seem to terminate in a claw-like shape and are connected with the goddess Mafdet in Egyptian mythology.  Mythological significance  Nefrubity (sister of Hatshepsut) as a child with the sidelock of youth The sidelock of youth was used by the children of the pharaohs, not only to show them to be children, but also to indicate their connection to the youthful Horus. Like them, the young Horus had worn the sidelock as the heir apparent of his father Osiris. In accordance with the mythological precedent, the children of the king, as his designated heirs, received the Horus lock as an indication of the special duties that were bound up with that status. In iconography, royal children were depicted naked and sucking on their finger, with their heads shaved entirely bald except for the sidelock. Amenhotep I, as well as Thutmoses III, reused the special form of the Middle Kingdom, which is connected with their revival of the imagery of the Middle Kingdom more generally. Again in the Late Period, the Middle Kingdom depiction of the sidelock was revived. With the beginning of the New Kingdom, the lock of youth achieved central significance as a special symbol of the princes and princesses of the 18th Dynasty. Particularly notable is the connection of the lock of youth with princesses, who as children of the reigning king were also seen as probable heirs and therefore were also depicted with the Horus lock.

Burnside was the first do-it-yourself concrete skatepark project and has spawned other similar projects across the globe. It is located under the east end of the Burnside Bridge. The project was started without permission from the city of Portland before being accepted as a public skatepark. Its features include many hips, pools, pyramids, and vertical sections. The skatepark is free-admission and requires no helmet, protective knee-pads, or elbow-pads. The skatepark receives no funding from the city of Portland. The park is regarded as an on-going project that is funded by donations. History The Burnside Skatepark as of May 18, 2019. Taken from the west wall of the skatepark. The DIY project was begun by skateboarders Rusten Muhlestein, Bret Taylor, Chuck Willis, Osage Buffalo, Kent Dahlgren, Jay Grahm, and Mark \\"Red\\" Scott in the summer of 1990 by pouring concrete against Burnside's main wall, creating a vertical transition obstacle in the empty parking lot below the east-end of the Burnside bridge. The skateboarders found inspiration to do so because the area was covered and protected from Portland's rainy season, allowing the park's riders to skate all year long. With a spare couple of bags of cement, the project was begun. The founders created a bank obstacle three feet by three feet in dimensions. The second obstacle created was another bank against the same wall, this time, this time with the dimensions of five by six feet. The banks were eventually merged into a single bank. The second major obstacle built was a mini bowl pocket along the north-end support beam of the bridge. Following these initial small obstacles, the founders of the DIY project struck a deal with nearby construction workers, employed by Ross Island Cement, building the I-84 on- ramp. The skateboarders convinced the workers to give them leftover cement from the I-84 on-ramp construction. From then on, the project's construction exploded, with the skaters re-paving the ground of the parking lot. Prior to the beginning of the skatepark project, the spot was known as \\"Hobo Camp,\\" because of the numerous homeless people living there. In 2016, an apartment complex known called the \\"Yard\\" was constructed west of the Burnside skatepark. There was a lot of speculation on what would happen to the park, with supporters of the skatepark creating petitions to preserve the skatepark. Ultimately, the skatepark did not experience any loss of territory, just a loss of sunlight from the building blockage. The construction of the apartment complex obstructed sunlight from the skatepark, causing Burnside to be much darker during the day. To compensate for this, Yard's chief developer agreed to install lights for the skatepark.  Influence  Signage above the skatepark, 2020 Burnside is credited with the start of the DIY movement in the skateboarding industry. Its foundation lead to two of the largest skatepark- construction companies, Grindline Skateparks and Dreamland Skateparks, both of which have gone to build hundreds of additional skateparks across America. Through the creation of Burnside, popular opinion is, it also helped to ignite the flame for the rebirth of public Skateparks in the United States. Additionally, Burnside popularized the use of poured concrete for DIY skate obstacles. Up until the park's popularization, nearly all conventional public skateparks' ramps and obstacles had been crafted out of wood and metal. Uses in Media Burnside is one of the playable levels in the video game Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and its remakes.

Comprising more than 50 musicians on most game days, Argonotes is the largest musical organization associated with the CFL. In addition to game day duties, the band also stays active during the offseason by promoting the Argos, Toronto, and the city's pride by taking part in various local events (Leafs, Raptors, Marlies games, fan festivals, etc.). Occasionally, the band takes its show on the road by representing Toronto and its fans in other cities such as Hamilton and Montreal for events such as the Labour Day Classic and playoff games. Starting in June and running until the end of the football season, the band rehearses weekly. The band disbanded during the 2017 CFL season. Band history The Argonotes are the spiritual successors to earlier marching bands associated with the Argonauts over the franchise's long history. The last Argonauts band had dissolved by the 1970s, and only the occasional invited marching band played at halftimes of games in the 1980s and early 90s. The Argonotes era began in 1995, when the band was founded by Steve Hayman.

Buxton was the son of Reverend Barclay Buxton, a missionary who co-founded the Japan Evangelical Band, and Margaret Maria Amelia Railton. He was the great- grandson of Sir Thomas Buxton, 1st Baronet the abolitionist and social reformer. He was educated at Repton School, and Trinity College, Cambridge. In World War I, he fought in the Duke of Wellington's Regiment, gaining the rank of Captain. When a shell fell on his billet, he was severely wounded with shrapnel damage to both legs. He was invalided out and walked with two sticks for the rest of his life. Unable to fulfil his lifelong dream of becoming a missionary himself, he asked his brothers - \\"What can God do with this bag of bones?\\" The answer was that if he could not go himself, he should stay behind to train those who could. He took over what was left of Harley College, dissipated due to the war, and, using the post-war Army billets and camps, founded the Missionary Training Colony in 1923, based in Upper Norwood in south-east London. In 1962, the Missionary Training Colony merged with another South London seminary, the All Nations Bible College (formerly the All Nations Missionary Union), to form the All Nations Missionary College and in 1964, Buxton, then a member of the college council, suggested that the college move to the Easneye estate, the Buxton ancestral property. By another merger in 1971 the college became the All Nations Christian College. After the death of his father in 1946, Buxton succeeded him in his role at the Japanese Evangelical Band as Chairman of the British Home Council, the parent body Buxton married Dorothea Reader Harris, younger daughter of Richard Reader Harris, in 1922 and they had a daughter and son.

HIs name in infancy was Sentetsu (‰ªôÈâÑ), later becoming Matsudaira Masaoki (ÊòåËàà) from 1693. The same year, he became daimy≈ç of Echizen-Matsuoka on the death of his father. At that time, he took the name of Matsudaira Masahira (ÊòåÂπ≥) and was granted Senior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade Court rank and the courtesy title of Takumi-no-kami. In 1721, he was chosen by Matsudaira Yoshikuni as heir to Fukui Domain, and became daimy≈ç of Fukui the following year. With his accession to Fukui, Echizen-Matsuoka was dissolved and its territories rejoined to Fukui Domain.Burke, pp. 42, 47. After being received in formal audience by Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Yoshimune, he changed his name to Munemasa and was granted Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade court rank. Munemasa was already in his 40s when he became daimy≈ç , and although married to an adoptive daughter of Ogasawara Tadataka of Kokura Domain, he had no heir. This concerned the shogunate greatly, as Fukui Domain had been plagued several times by succession disputes, so at the insistence of the shogunate, he adopted Matsudaira Munenori of the Maebashi-Matsudaira clan as his heir, and married him to a daughter of Matsudaira Yoshikuni. He died in 1724 at the clan residence in Edo. His grave was at the temple of Tentoku-ji in Toranomon, which was later moved the clan temple of Kaian-ji in Shinagawa, in Tokyo, as well as the temple of Unsh≈ç-ji in Fukui.

Career Born in Alexandria, Egypt, the daughter of a cigarette factory manager, she met her husband, Raymond Aghion (1921‚Äì2009), when both were seven years old in elementary school. He was born into a wealthy family of cotton exporters, but displayed early stirrings of the social consciousness that would later land him in political exile. Gaby and Raymond, both Jewish, married at the age of 19. The couple moved to Paris in 1945. In Paris the Aghions gravitated toward the Communists, becoming close to writers Louis Aragon, Paul √âluard and Tristan Tzara. Gaby launched Chlo√© in 1952. Raymond opened an art gallery in 1956, specializing in modern art. According to the website of Chlo√©, Aghion rejected the stiff formality of 1950s fashion and created soft, feminine, body conscious clothes from fine fabrics, and called them \\"luxury pr√™t-√†-porter\\". Unique for their time, they were beautifully made clothes available off the rack. She set up her workshop in a maid's room above her large flat. In 1953, Gaby Aghion joined forces with Jacques Lenoir ‚Äì he ran the business side and she ran the creative side. The duo put on the first Chlo√© show in 1956 at a breakfast at the Caf√© de Flore, the epicentre of young intellectual Parisians of the 1940s and 1950s.

The Convention was opened for signature on 4 April 1997 in Oviedo, Spain and is thus otherwise known as the Oviedo Convention. The International treaty is a manifestation of the effort on the part of the Council of Europe to keep pace with developments in the field of biomedicine; it is notably the first multilateral binding instrument entirely devoted to biolaw.Roberto Andorno, The Oviedo Convention: A European Legal Framework at the Intersection of Human Rights and Health Law, JIBL Vol 02, 2005 The Convention entered into force on 1 December 1999. Characteristics The Convention provides a framework structure to preserve human dignity comprehensively across the field of bioethics.Ismini Kriari- Cataris, The Convention for the protection of human rights and dignity of the human being with regard to the application of biology and medicine: Convention on human rights and biomedicine, Panteion University of Social and Political Sciences Athens, Greece, Journal of Asian and International Bioethics, 12 (2002) 90-93 The instrument is shaped around the premise that there is a fundamental connection between human rights and biomedicine.Roberto Andorno, The Oviedo Convention: A European Legal Framework at the Intersection of Human Rights and Health Law, JIBL Vol 02, 2005 A minimum common standard is created by the Convention and allows states to legislate for a greater degree of protection upon ratification (Article 27). In addition, judicial protection is conferred on the national courts. Therefore, there is no basis on which an individual can bring an action in relation to the Oviedo Convention alone. The Convention may only be referenced in conjunction with proceedings brought in respect of a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights. Absence of any provisions for a judicial procedure from the convention is considered to be a major weakness of the Oviedo Convention.Henriette Roscam Abbing, The Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine. An Appraisal of the Council of Europe Convention, European Journal of Health Law, 1998, no.5, p.379 History The rate of advancement in biomedicine caused concern to the Council of Europe that as much as development in this field instilled hope for mankind, it also posed a threat.Explanatory Report It became the objective of the Council of Europe to set out common general standards for the protection of the dignity of the human person in relation to biomedical sciences.Explanatory Report A draft convention was requested by the Steering Committee on Bioethics (CDBI)Committee on Bioethics and drafted by its Working Group in July 1992. The draft convention underwent public consultation in July 1994, adopted by the Committee of MinistersCommittee of Ministers in November 1996, and finally opened for signature on 4 April 1997.Roberto Andorno, The Oviedo Convention: A European Legal Framework at the Intersection of Human Rights and Health Law, JIBL Vol 02, 2005 Parties to the Convention Thirty- five countries have signed the Oviedo Convention since it was opened for signature in 1997; however, only 29 of these countries have also ratified the convention. This means that only 29 countries have implemented the principles of the instrument into their national law. Furthermore, six of those ratifying countries have reservations limiting the extent to which they are bound to certain provisions. Notably, the UK and Germany have neither signed nor ratified the convention.Parties to the Oviedo Convention The UK considered the convention too restrictive, whereas Germany thought it too permissive.Roberto Andorno, The Oviedo Convention: A European Legal Framework at the Intersection of Human Rights and Health Law, JIBL Vol 02, 2005 Issues addressed by the Convention The preamble to the Oviedo Convention makes clear that its intention is for developments in biomedicine to benefit future generations and all of humanity. The convention sets out the legal framework, which will ensure the protection of the dignity and identity of the human being. Intended as a supplementary instrument, the convention will be read in conjunction with other human rights protections namely: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR),UDHR the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR),ICCPR the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR),ICESCR the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC),CRC the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR),ECHR the European Social Charter.European Social Charter =General Principles= The general provisions of the Oviedo Convention outline the object and purpose of the instrument. The aim is to secure the dignity of human beings within the field of biomedicine. Several principles are adopted in order to achieve this goal. Embodied in the first chapter to the convention, the principles relate to the primacy of the human being, equitable access to healthcare (equitable access to healthcare), and professional standards. =Consent= The issue of consent is pivotal to the Convention because of the relationship it has to individual autonomy. Medical intervention carried out without consent is a general prohibition within Article 5.The Oviedo Convention, Article 5 Furthermore, consent must be free and fully informed. Free and informed consent is based on objective information. Protection is afforded to those not able to consent and provision is made for emergency situations. Specific rules must be observed where any medical intervention is carried out in any situation where a person is not able to give free and informed consent.The Oviedo Convention, Chapter II =Private life and right to information= This issue is closely related to the right to privacy in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The scope of the right encompasses an individual‚Äôs entitlement not to know as well as the right to know information regarding their health. Interests of the patient, a third party, or society may lead to a restriction of either facet of the right.The Oviedo Convention, Chapter III =Human genome= The Oviedo Convention incorporates provisions to address concerns relating to research into the human genome. Focus is honed on genetic testing, the storage of genetic data and modification of the human genome. Genetic testing as a tool for discrimination is prohibited under Article 11,The Oviedo Convention, Article 11 while Article 12 allows genetic testing only for health or for scientific research linked to health purposes.The Oviedo Convention, Article 12 The overarching theme is that genetic testing is reserved for health- related purposes only.Explanatory Report Similarly, modification of the human genome, for reasons other than health-related is generally prohibited under Article 13 of the Convention.The Oviedo Convention, Article 13 =Scientific research= The freedom of scientific research World Congress for Freedom of Research is embodied in Chapter V.The Oviedo Convention, Chapter V However, precedence is afforded to the protection of human dignity and other fundamental freedoms. Therefore, the freedom of research is qualified (Article 15).The Oviedo Convention, Article 15 Research carried out on human beings is under strict controls set forth by the convention (Article 16).The Oviedo Convention, Article 16 The general rules on consent stipulated in Chapter IIThe Oviedo Convention, Chapter II must be observed in the context of research. In addition, the creation of embryos in vitro for the purposes of scientific research is expressly prohibited (Article 18).The Oviedo Convention, Article 18 =Organs and Transplantation= The Convention provides the general rule that living donors for organ transplants are only to be utilised if there is no availability of organs from a deceased person.The Oviedo Convention, Chapter VI Any removed parts of the body must be disposed of respectfully in accordance with the wishes of the individual. In addition, there is to be no financial gain arising from the human body or its parts, however adequate compensation for expenses incurred for a medical procedure is not prohibited.Explanatory Report, para 132 The rules relating to consent laid out in Chapter II of the Convention also apply in the context of organ transplantation. Infringements of the Provisions of the Convention In accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, any individual who has suffered damage should have access to fair compensation (Article 24).The Oviedo Convention, Article 24 Appropriate judicial protection is required to be put in place to ensure there is no infringement of the principles contained in the Convention. Proportionate sanctions will be imposed for non-compliance in accordance with Article 25.The Oviedo Convention, Article 25 Wider Protection The Oviedo Convention reflects a minimum harmonisation instrument. Therefore, parties to the convention have jurisdiction to provide a greater degree of protection than that offered by the convention. However, they cannot offer lesser protection.Explanatory Report, para 161-162 Interpretation of the Convention Questions of interpretation may be referred to the European Court of Human Rights for an advisory opinion to be issued.Explanatory Report, para 164 Individuals are unable to bring an action on the basis of violation of the Oviedo Convention alone, but may reference the provisions in proceedings relating to the European Convention on Human Rights. Reservations A reservation may be made with respect to a particular provision of the convention (Article 36). Six states have reservations regarding particular provisions: * Croatia * Denmark * France * Norway * Switzerland * Turkey Denunciation Any signatory can denounce the convention by means of notification to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe. Protocol on the Prohibition of Cloning Human Beings Deliberate cloning, to create genetically identical human beings, is contrary to human dignity and constitutes a misuse of biology and medicine. It is therefore prohibited under this protocol.Protocol on the Prohibition of Cloning Human Beings Protocol on Transplantation The protocol stipulates that, insofar as is possible, equitable access to transplantation services should be ensured. In addition, any transplantation should be carried out with respect for rights and freedoms of donors, potential donors, and recipients of organs and tissues.Protocol on Transplantation Protocol on Biomedical Research In the context of biomedical research, the protocol aims to ensure protection for dignity and identity of all human beings without discrimination. The Protocol recognises that research can contribute to saving and improving human life but it can also run contrary to the fundamental principles of dignity and other rights. Where this may be the case the research should not be carried out.Protocol on Biomedical Research Protocol on Genetic Testing for Health Purposes The protocol responds to the concerns regarding possible improper use of genetic testing and aims to protect the dignity and identity of all human beings within this sphere. Through restricting use of genetic testing to health purposes only the convention aims to achieve its object and purpose. Genetic Testing is also permitted for scientific research, but its regulation is not included in this Protocol. It also establishes the need of free and informed consent and genetic counselling.Protocol on Genetic Testing for Health Purposes References Further reading *Roberto Andorno, \\"The Oviedo Convention: A European Legal Framework at the Intersection of Human Rights and Health Law\\", Journal of International Biotechnology Law, 2005, n¬∞ 2, p. 133-143. *Maurice de Waechter, ‚Äò‚ÄôThe European Convention on Bioethics‚Äô‚Äô, Hastings Center Report, no.1, 1997, p. 13-23.

Identification They are easily identified by their distinctive black and yellow stripes, which no other dragonfly in the United Kingdom has. A very large species, males average 74 mm and the larger females 84 mm. Wingspan is up to 101 mm. Larvae The female lays the eggs in shallow water. The hairy larvae live at the bottom of the water and are well camouflaged amongst the silt. They emerge after about 2‚Äì5 years, and usually under the cover of darkness. Behaviour They are often seen flying leisurely over mountain streams or a river; they also occasionally show up at a pond. They are also typically seen flying over heath land. Their bright yellow and black stripes make them easy to identify, even from a fair distance away. They feed mainly on insects ranging from small prey such as midges to flies, butterflies and even bumblebees. This strikingly-coloured insect is incredibly aerobatic and they sometimes fly very high up into the sky.

With the exception of a five-day de facto independence in the winter of 1906, when a peasant uprising declared an autonomous Republic of Comrat, Gagauzians have been ruled by the Russian Empire (1812‚Äì1917), Romania (1918‚Äì1940 and 1941‚Äì1944), the Soviet Union (1940‚Äì1941 and 1944‚Äì1991), and Moldova (1917‚Äì1918 and 1991 to date).https://books.google.com/books?id=7GhbDxIUkIIC&pg;=PA76&lpg;=PA76&dq;=world+war+two+in+gagauzia&source;=bl&ots;=HQTlbjiwpQ&sig;=ACfU3U1-qSwys_ZPTYUVoZfFflsKKDvGYQ&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwiy4smIy7vqAhVQUK0KHdifBs8Q6AEwDnoECAIQAQ#v=onepage&q;=world%20war%20two%20in%20gagauzia&f;=false Middle Ages The Gagauz people descend from the Seljuk Turks that settled in Dobruja, together with the Pechenegs, Uz (Oghuz) and Cuman (Kipchak) people that followed the Anatolian Seljuk Sultan ƒ∞zzeddin Keykavus II (1236-1276). More specifically, one clan of Oghuz Turks migrated to the Balkans during the inter-tribal conflicts with other Turks. This Oghuz Turk clan converted from Islam to Orthodox Christianity after settling in the Eastern Balkans (nowadays in Bulgaria) and were called Gagauz Turks. Russian Empire In 1812 Bessarabia, previously eastern half of the Principality of Moldavia became part of the Russian Empire, and Nogai tribes that inhabited several villages in south Bessarabia (or Budjak) were forced to leave. Between 1812 and 1846, Russians settled the Gagauz people from what is nowadays eastern Bulgaria (which remained under Ottoman Empire) to the orthodox Bessarabia, mainly in the settlements vacated by the Nogai tribes. They settled there in parallel with Bessarabian Bulgarians in Avdarma, Comrat, Congaz, Tomai, Ci≈ümichioi, and other former Nogai villages. Some Gagauz were also settled in the part of the Principality of Moldavia that did not come under Russian control in 1812, but within several years village by village moved to the compact area they inhabit today in the south of Bessarabia. Soviet Union During World War Two, the Soviet created Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic was invaded by the forces of Nazi Germany.http://www.conflicts.rem33.com/images/moldova/mold_his_3.htm Gagauzian nationalism remained an intellectual movement during the 1980s, but strengthened by the end of the decade, as the Soviet Union began to embrace democratic ideals. In 1988, activists from the local intelligentsia aligned with other ethnic minorities to create a movement known as the \\"Gagauz People\\". A year later, the \\"Gagauz People\\" held its first assembly in which a resolution was passed to demand the creation an autonomous territory in southern Moldova, with the city of Comrat as its capital. The Gagauzian national movement intensified when the Romanian language was accepted as the official language of the Republic of Moldova in August 1989, replacing Russian, the official language of the USSR. A part of the multi-ethnic population of southern Moldova regarded this decision with concern, precipitating a lack of confidence in the central government in Chi≈üinƒÉu. The Gagauzians were also worried about the implications for them if Moldova reunited with Romania, as seemed increasingly likely at the time. Independent Moldova In August 1990, Comrat declared itself an autonomous republic, but the Moldovan government annulled the declaration as unconstitutional. At that time, Stepan Topal emerged as the leader of the Gagauz national movement.https://books.google.com/books?id=hPJWCAAAQBAJ&pg;=PT121&lpg;=PT121&dq;=world+war+two+in+gagauzia&source;=bl&ots;=8qZ3k2Gmqr&sig;=ACfU3U22qADq1QjyA7hgqgPVe3q_omcTQg&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwiy4smIy7vqAhVQUK0KHdifBs8Q6AEwEXoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&q;=world%20war%20two%20in%20gagauzia&f;=false Support for the Soviet Union remained high, with a referendum in March 1991 returning an almost unanimous vote in favor of remaining part of the USSR. The referendum, however, was boycotted by Moldovans in Gagauzia, as well as in the rest of Moldova. Many Gagauzians supported the Moscow coup attempt in August 1991, and Gagauzia declared itself independent on 19 August 1991, followed in September by Transnistria, thus further straining relations with Chi≈üinƒÉu. However, when the Moldovan parliament voted on whether Moldova should become independent on 27 August 1991, six of the twelve Gagauz deputies in Moldovan parliament voted in favor, while the other six did not participate. As a consequence, the Moldovan government toned down its pro-Romanian stance and paid more attention to minority rights.https://www.fpri.org/article/2016/09/gagauzia-bone-throat-moldova/ In February 1994, President Mircea Snegur promised the Gagauzians autonomy, but he was against outright independence. He was also opposed to the suggestion that Moldova become a federal state made up of three republics: Moldova, Gagauzia and Transnistria. In 1994, the Parliament of Moldova awarded to \\"the people of Gagauzia\\" (through the adoption of the new Constitution of Moldova) the right of \\"external self-determination\\", should the status of the country change. In other words, if the case was that Moldova decided to join another country (by all accounts, that would be Romania), then the Gagauzians would be entitled to decide, by means of a self-determination referendum, whether to remain part of the new state or not. On December 23, 1994, the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova accepted the \\"Law on the Special Legal Status of Gagauzia\\" (Gagauz: Gagauz Yeri), resolving the dispute peacefully. This date is now a Gagauzian holiday. Many European human rights organizations recognize and promote Gagauzia as a successful model for resolving ethnic conflicts. Gagauzia is now a \\"national-territorial autonomous unit\\" with three official languages, Moldovan, Gagauz, and Russian. Three cities and twenty-three communes were included in the Autonomous Gagauz Territory: all localities with over 50% of Gagauzians, and those localities with between 40% and 50% of Gagauzians, which expressed their desire to be included as a result of referendums to determine Gagauzia's borders. In 1995, Georgi Tabunshik was elected to serve as the Governor (Moldovan: Guvernator, Gagauz: Bashkan) of Gagauzia for a four-year term, as were the deputies of the local parliament, \\"The People's Assembly\\", with Peter Pashali as chairman. Dumitru Croitor won the 1999 Governor elections and began to make use of the rights granted to the Governor by the 1994 agreement. The central authorities of Moldova proved unwilling to accept the results initiating a lengthy stand-off between the autonomy and Chi≈üinƒÉu. Finally Croitor resigned in 2002 due to the pressure from the Moldovan government which accused him of abuse of authority, relations with the separatist authorities of Transnistria and other charges. The central electoral commission of Gagauzia did not register Croitor as a candidate for the post of the Governor in the subsequent elections and Gheorgi Tabunshik was elected in what was described as unfair elections.

It is a parody of the Robin Hood story.http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b78edb9cc Plot In not-so-merry-old-England during the 13th Century, the neurotic Prince John (Roddy McDowell) sits on the throne, supported by his evil henchman, Sir Guy of Gisbourne (Tom Baker) and constantly ridiculed by his mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine (Janet Suzman). While celebrating his birthday, the Prince becomes unhappy when he discovers his older brother, Richard, is not dead as everyone thought but rather being held for ransom in Austria. As Richard is the rightful King of England, this creates a problem for Prince John. However, Gisbourne openly suggests that they tax the Saxon peasants to raise the ransom, while secretly confiding in the Prince that the King will most likely die of pneumonia before the year is out and that they will keep the money. The birthday revels are interrupted by Robin Hood (George Segal), disguised in drag and reciting an offensive poem. Not seeing through the disguise, Gisbourne demands she take them to Robin Hood's hideout in Sherwood Forest. That night, Eleanor convinces Maid Marian (Morgan Fairchild) to play up to Gisbourne's advances and use him to help Robin Hood. When Prince John and Guy travel to Sherwood, they are ambushed by Robin Hood's Merry Men. They are stripped of their garments, their possessions and money stolen, then driven out of the forest. Will Scarlet (Robin Nedwell) frequently tries to make a song out of these events, but thankfully Robin stops him every time. Eleanor and Marian sneak into the bandits' camp at night, disguised as two nuns, and hoping to enlist Robin's help in freeing King Richard. They are caught by Robin, who recognises them immediately, and the trio eat together and discuss plans. Robin and Marian realise they love each other. Robin and his band begin travelling across the country to raise the ransom money but nothing goes right. They try robbing a bank only to find that they have won a prize as the hundredth customer and get distracted. When they finally rob the bank, they find it only has three coins and a pfennig. Times are hard for everyone, it seems. Eventually, Robin has to report back to Eleanor that England is broke. She advises him to get the money from Isaac of York (Kenneth Griffith), a Jewish moneylender. In York, Robin stands out like a sore thumb amongst all the orthodox Jews. Isaac agrees to lend Robin the ransom money provided that in return the King gives the Jews their own country. Isaac suggests Palestine, although Miami would be his second choice. They settle on naming the new country after Isaac's father, Israel. Robin sneaks into the Prince's castle to tell Eleanor, who now insists he must raise an army. Robin then tries to seduce Marian, promising her they'll be wed once King Richard returns, but with little success.

The conquest would be completed by 78, and Roman rule would endure until the region was abandoned in AD 383. Roman rule in Wales was a military occupation, except for the southern coastal region of South Wales east of the Gower Peninsula, where there is a legacy of Romanisation, and some southern sites such as Carmarthen. The only town in Wales founded by the Romans, Caerwent, is located in South Wales. Wales was a rich source of mineral wealth, and the Romans used their engineering technology to extract large amounts of gold, copper, and lead, as well as modest amounts of some other metals such as zinc and silver. It is the Roman campaigns of conquest that are most widely known, due to the spirited but unsuccessful defence of their homelands by two native tribes, the Silures and the Ordovices. Aside from the many Roman-related finds along the southern coast, Roman archaeological remains in Wales consist almost entirely of military roads and fortifications.\\"A History of Wales\\", by Sir John Edward LLoyd Britain in AD 47 right On the eve of the Roman invasion of Wales, the Roman military under Governor Aulus Plautius was in control of all of southeastern Britain as well as Dumnonia, perhaps including the lowland English Midlands as far as the Dee Estuary and the River Mersey, and having an understanding with the Brigantes to the north., An Atlas of Roman Britain, Britain Before the Conquest, and The Conquest and Garrisoning of Britain. They controlled most of the islands centers of wealth, as well as much of its trade and resources. In Wales the known tribes (the list may be incomplete) included the Ordovices and Deceangli in the north, and the Silures and Demetae in the south. Archaeology combined with ancient Greek and Roman accounts have shown that there was exploitation of natural resources, such as copper, gold, tin, lead and silver at multiple locations in Britain, including in Wales., An Atlas of Roman Britain, The Economy. Apart from this we have little knowledge of the Welsh tribes of this era. Invasion and conquest right In AD 47 or 48 the new governor, Publius Ostorius Scapula, moved against the Deceangli along the northeastern coast of Wales, devastating their lands., Annals XII, where they are referred to as the 'Cangi'. He campaigned successfully but indecisively against the Silures and then the Ordovices, the most notable feature of which is the leadership of both tribes against him by Caratacus., Annals XXIII Scapula died in 52, the same year that the resurgent Silures inflicted a defeat on one of the Roman legions., History of Wales, Wales and Rome Scapula was succeeded by a number of governors who made steady but inconclusive gains against the two tribes. Gaius Suetonius Paulinus was in the process of conquering Anglesey in AD 60 when the revolt led by Boudica in the east forced a delay in the final conquest of Wales. There followed a decade of relative peace while Roman imperial attention was focused elsewhere. When expansion into Wales resumed in 73, Roman progress was steady and successful under Sextus Julius Frontinus, who decisively defeated the Silures,, History of Wales, Wales and Rome followed by the success of Gnaeus Julius Agricola in defeating the Ordovices, and in completing the conquest of Anglesey in AD 77‚Äì78., Life of Agricola XVIII There is no indication of any Roman campaigns against the Demetae, and their territory was not planted with a series of forts, nor overlaid with roads, suggesting that they quickly made their peace with Rome. The main fort in their territory was at Moridunum (modern Carmarthen), built around AD 75, and it eventually became the centre of a Roman civitas. The Demetae are the only pre-Roman Welsh tribe that would emerge from Roman rule with their tribal name intact. Wales in Roman Society =Mining= 220px The mineral wealth of Britain was well-known prior to the Roman invasion and was one of the expected benefits of conquest. All mineral extractions were state-sponsored and under military control, as mineral rights belonged to the emperor., An Atlas of Roman Britain, The Economy His agents soon found substantial deposits of gold, copper, and lead in Wales, along with some zinc and silver. Gold was mined at Dolaucothi prior to the invasion, but Roman engineering would be applied to greatly increase the amount extracted, and to extract huge amounts of the other metals. This would continue until the process was no longer practical or profitable, at which time the mine would be abandoned., An Atlas of Roman Britain, The Economy Modern scholars have made efforts to quantify the value of these extracted metals to the Roman economy, and to determine the point at which the Roman occupation of Britain was \\"profitable\\" to the Empire. While these efforts have not produced deterministic results, the benefits to Rome were substantial. The gold production at Dolaucothi alone may have been of economic significance., An Atlas of Roman Britain, The Economy =Industrial production= 220px The production of goods for trade and export in Roman Britain was concentrated in the south and east, with virtually none situated in Wales. This was largely due to circumstance, with iron forges located near iron supplies, pewter (tin with some lead or copper) moulds located near the tin supplies and suitable soil (for the moulds), clusters of pottery kilns located near suitable clayey soil, grain-drying ovens located in agricultural areas where sheep raising (for wool) was also located, and salt production concentrated in its historical pre-Roman locations. Glass-making sites were located in or near urban centres. In Wales none of the needed materials were available in suitable combination, and the forested, mountainous countryside was not amenable to this kind of industrialisation. Clusters of tileries, both large and small, were at first operated by the Roman military to meet their own needs, and so there were temporary sites wherever the army went and could find suitable soil. This included a few places in Wales., An Atlas of Roman Britain, The Economy: The distribution of tileries However, as Roman influence grew, the army was able to obtain tiles from civilian sources who located their kilns in the lowland areas containing good soil, and then shipped the tiles to wherever they were needed. =Romanisation= 220px The Romans occupied the whole of the area now known as Wales, where they built Roman roads and castra, mined gold at Luentinum and conducted commerce, but their interest in the area was limited because of the difficult geography and shortage of flat agricultural land. Most of the Roman remains in Wales are military in nature. Sarn Helen, a major highway, linked the North with South Wales. The area was controlled by Roman legionary bases at Deva Victrix (modern Chester) and Isca Augusta (Caerleon), two of the three such bases in Roman Britain, with roads linking these bases to auxiliaries' forts such as Segontium (Caernarfon) and Moridunum (Carmarthen). Furthermore, South-east Wales was the most Romanised part of the country. It is possible that Roman estates in the area survived as recognisable units into the eighth century: the kingdom of Gwent is likely to have been founded by direct descendants of the (romanised) Silurian ruling class Roman Wales on the RCAHMW website: early Medioeval times' The best indicators of Romanising acculturation is the presence of urban sites (areas with towns, coloniae, and tribal civitates) and villas in the countryside. In Wales, this can be said only of the southeasternmost coastal region of South Wales. The only civitates in Wales were at Carmarthen and Caerwent., An Atlas of Roman Britain, The Development of the Provinces. There were three small urban sites near Caerwent, and these and Roman Monmouth were the only other \\"urbanised\\" sites in Wales., An Atlas of Roman Britain, The Development of the Provinces. In the southwestern homeland of the Demetae, several sites have been classified as villas in the past,, An Atlas of Roman Britain, The Countryside. but excavation of these and examination of sites as yet unexcavated suggest that they are pre-Roman family homesteads, sometimes updated through Roman technology (such as stone masonry), but having a native character quite different than the true Roman- derived villas that are found to the east, such as in Oxfordshire., An Atlas of Roman Britain, The Countryside: Dyfed. Perhaps surprisingly, the presence of Roman-era Latin inscriptions is not suggestive of full Romanisation. They are most numerous at military sites, and their occurrence elsewhere depended on access to suitable stone and the presence of stonemasons, as well as patronage. The Roman fort complex at Tomen y Mur near the coast of northwestern Wales has produced more inscriptions than either Segontium (near modern Caernarfon) or Noviomagus Reginorum (Chichester)., An Atlas of Roman Britain, The Development of the Provinces: Latin Inscriptions and Language. =Hill forts= In areas of civil control, such as the territories of a civitas, the fortification and occupation of hill forts was banned as a matter of Roman policy. However, further inland and northward, a number of pre-Roman hill forts continued to be used in the Roman Era, while others were abandoned during the Roman Era, and still others were newly occupied. The inference is that local leaders who were willing to accommodate Roman interests were encouraged and allowed to continue, providing local leadership under local law and custom., Celtic Britain and Ireland, c. 200‚Äì800, The non-Romanized zone of Britannia. Religion There is virtually no evidence to shed light on the practice of religion in Wales during the Roman era, save the anecdotal account of the strange appearance and bloodthirsty customs of the druids of Anglesey by Tacitus during the conquest of Wales., Annals, Bk. XIV, Ch. XXX. It is fortunate for Rome's reputation that Tacitus described the druids as horrible, else it would be a story of the Roman massacre of defenceless, unarmed men and women. The likelihood of partisan propaganda and an appeal to salacious interests combine to suggest that the account merits suspicion. The Welsh region of Britain was not significant to the Romanisation of the island and contains almost no buildings related to religious practice, save where the Roman military was located, and these reflect the practices of non-native soldiers. Any native religious sites would have been constructed of wood that has not survived and so are difficult to locate anywhere in Britain, let alone in mountainous, forest-covered Wales. The time of the arrival of Christianity to Wales is unknown. Archaeology suggests that it came to Roman Britain slowly, gaining adherents among coastal merchants and in the upper classes first, and never becoming widespread outside of the southeast in the Roman Era., An Atlas of Roman Britain, Religion., Britannia, The Romanisation of Britain. There is also evidence of a preference for non-Christian devotion in parts of Britain, such as in the upper regions of the Severn Estuary in the 4th century, from the Forest of Dean east of the River Wye continuously around the coast of the estuary, up to and including Somerset., An Atlas of Roman Britain, Religion. Aerial view of the amphitheatre at Caerleon. In the De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae, written c. 540, Gildas provides a story of the martyrdom of Saint Alban at Verulamium, and of Julius and Aaron at Legionum Urbis, the 'City of the Legion', saying that this occurred during a persecution of Christians at a time when 'decrees' against them were issued., The Works of Gildas, The History, ch. 10. The 'City of the Legion' is not specified in the original Latin. This translator, for whatever reason, chooses Carlisle. Bede repeats the story in his Ecclesiastical History, written c. 731. The otherwise unspecified 'City of the Legion' is arguably Caerleon, Welsh Caerllion, the 'Fortress of the Legion', and the only candidate with a long and continuous military presence that lay within a Romanised region of Britain, with nearby towns and a Roman civitas. Other candidates are Chester and Carlisle, though both were located far from the Romanised area of Britain and had a transitory, more military-oriented history. A parenthetical note concerns Saint Patrick, a patron saint of Ireland. He was a Briton born c. 387 in Banna Venta Berniae, a location that is unknown due to the transcription errors in surviving manuscripts. His home is a matter of conjecture, with sites near Carlisle farvoured by some, while coastal South Wales is favoured by others.. MacNeill argues that the southern coast of Wales offered both numerous slaves and quick access to booty, and as the region was also home to Irish settlers, raiders would have had the contacts to tell them precisely where to go in order to quickly obtain booty and capture slaves. MacNeill also suggests a possible home town based on naming similarities, but allows that the transcription errors in manuscripts make this little more than an educated guess. Irish settlement 220px By the middle of the 4th century the Roman presence in Britain was no longer vigorous. Once-unfortified towns were now being surrounded by defensive walls, including both Carmarthen and Caerwent., An Atlas of Roman Britain, The Development of the Provinces. Political control finally collapsed and a number of alien tribes then took advantage of the situation, raiding widely throughout the island, joined by Roman soldiers who had deserted and by elements of the native Britons themselves.: p.413, Ammianus 26.4.5 Trans.; pp. 453‚Äì455, Ammianus 27.8 Trans.; pp 483‚Äì485, Ammianus 28.3 Trans. Order was restored in 369, but Roman Britain would not recover. It was at this time, Early Celtic Britain and Ireland, Wales and the Isle of Man. that Wales received an infusion of settlers from southern Ireland, the U√≠ Liath√°in, Laigin, and possibly D√©isi, the last no longer seen as certain, with only the first two verified by reliable sources and place- name evidence. The Irish were concentrated along the southern and western coasts, in Anglesey and Gwynedd (excepting the cantrefi of Arfon and Arllechwedd), and in the territory of the Demetae. The circumstances of their arrival are unknown, and theories include categorising them as \\"raiders\\", as \\"invaders\\" who established a hegemony, and as \\"foederati\\" invited by the Romans. It might as easily have been the consequence of a depopulation in Wales caused by plague or famine, both of which were usually ignored by ancient chroniclers. What is known is that their characteristically Irish circular huts are found where they settled; that the inscription stones found in Wales, whether in Latin or ogham or both, are characteristically Irish; that when both Latin and ogham are present on a stone, the name in the Latin text is given in Brittonic form while the same name is given in Irish form in ogham;, pp 307‚Äì313 and that medieval Welsh royal genealogies include Irish- named ancestors who also appear in the native Irish narrative The Expulsion of the D√©isi. This phenomenon may however be the result of later influences and again only the presence of the U√≠ Liath√°in and Laigin in Wales has been verified. End of the Roman era Roman Walls at Caerwent (Venta Silurum), erected c. 350. Historical accounts tell of the upheavals in the Roman Empire during the 3rd and 4th centuries, with notice of the withdrawal of troops from Roman Britain in support of the imperial ambitions of Roman generals stationed there. In much of Wales, where Roman troops were the only indication of Roman rule, that rule ended when troops left and did not return. The end came to different regions at different times. Tradition holds that Roman customs held on for several years in southern Wales, lasting into the end of the 5th century and early 6th century, and that is true in part. Caerwent continued to be occupied after the Roman departure, while Carmarthen was probably abandoned in the late 4th century., Celtic Britain and Ireland, c. 200‚Äì800, The non- Romanized zone of Britannia. In addition, southwestern Wales was the tribal territory of the Demetae, who had never become thoroughly Romanised. The entire region of southwestern Wales had been settled by Irish newcomers in the late 4th century, and it seems far-fetched to suggest that they were ever fully Romanised. However in the southeast Wales, following the withdrawal of the Roman legions from Britain, the town of Venta Silurum (Caerwent) remained occupied by Romano-Britons until at least the early sixth century: Early Christian worship was still established in the town, that might have had a bishop with a monastery in the second half of that century. Magnus Maximus In Welsh literary tradition, Magnus Maximus is the central figure in the emergence of a free Britain in the post-Roman era. Royal and religious genealogies compiled in the Middle Ages have him as the ancestor of kings and saints. In the Welsh story of Breuddwyd Macsen Wledig (The Dream of Emperor Maximus), he is Emperor of Rome and marries a wondrous British woman, telling her that she may name her desires, to be received as a wedding portion. She asks that her father be given sovereignty over Britain, thus formalising the transfer of authority from Rome back to the Britons themselves. Remains of the Pillar of Eliseg near the town of Llangollen, Wales, erected c. 855. It lists Magnus Maximus as an ancestor of a medieval Welsh king. Historically Magnus Maximus was a Roman general who served in Britain in the late 4th century, launching his successful bid for imperial power from Britain in 383. This is the last date for any evidence of a Roman military presence in Wales, the western Pennines, and Deva (i.e., the entire non-Romanised region of Britain south of Hadrian's Wall). Coins dated later than 383 have been excavated along the Wall, suggesting that troops were not stripped from it, as was once thought., Britannia, The End of Roman Britain. In the De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae written c. 540, Gildas says that Maximus left Britain not only with all of its Roman troops, but also with all of its armed bands, governors, and the flower of its youth, never to return., The Works of Gildas, The History, ch. 14 Having left with the troops and senior administrators, and planning to continue as the ruler of Britain, his practical course was to transfer local authority to local rulers. Welsh legend provides a mythic story that says he did exactly that. After he became emperor of the Western Roman Empire, Maximus would return to Britain to campaign against the Picts and Scots (i.e., Irish), probably in support of Rome's long-standing allies the Damnonii, Votadini, and Novantae (all located in modern Scotland). While there he likely made similar arrangements for a formal transfer of authority to local chiefs: the later rulers of Galloway, home to the Novantae, would claim Maximus as the founder of their line, the same as did the Welsh kings. Maximus would rule the Roman West until he was killed in 388. A succession of governors would rule southeastern Britain until 407, but there is nothing to suggest that any Roman effort was made to regain control of the west or north after 383, and that year would be the definitive end of the Roman era in Wales. Legacy Wendy Davies has argued that the later medieval Welsh approach to property and estates was a Roman legacy, but this issue and others related to legacy are not yet resolved. For example, Leslie Alcock has argued that that approach to property and estates cannot pre-date the 6th century and is thus post-Roman., Celtic Britain and Ireland, c. 200‚Äì800, The non-Romanized zone of Britannia. There was little Latin linguistic heritage left to the Welsh language, only a number of borrowings from the Latin lexicon. With the absence of early written Welsh sources there is no way of knowing when these borrowings were incorporated into Welsh, and may date from a later post-Roman era when the language of literacy was still Latin. Borrowings include a few common words and word forms. For example, Welsh ffenestr is from Latin fenestra, 'window'; llyfr is from liber, 'book'; ysgrif is from scribo, 'scribe'; and the suffix -wys found in Welsh folk names is derived from the Latin suffix -ƒìnsƒìs.Koch, John. The Gododdin of Aneirin, Celtic Studies Publications, 1997, p. 133.Maund 2006, p. 16, n.2 There are a few military terms, such as caer from Latin castra, 'fortress'. Eglwys, meaning 'church', is ultimately derived from the Greek klƒìros. Welsh kings would later use the authority of Magnus Maximus as the basis of their inherited political legitimacy. While imperial Roman entries in Welsh royal genealogies lack any historical foundation, they serve to illustrate the belief that legitimate royal authority began with Magnus Maximus. As told in The Dream of Emperor Maximus, Maximus married a Briton, and their supposed children are given in genealogies as the ancestors of kings. Tracing ancestries back further, Roman emperors are listed as the sons of earlier Roman emperors, thus incorporating many famous Romans (e.g., Constantine the Great) into the royal genealogies. The kings of medieval Gwynedd trace their origins to the northern British kingdom of Manaw Gododdin (located in modern Scotland), and they also claim a connection to Roman authority in their genealogies (\\"Eternus son of Paternus son of Tacitus\\"). This claim may be either an independent one, or was perhaps an invention intended to rival the legitimacy of kings claiming descent from the historical Maximus. Gwyn A. Williams argues that even at the time of the erection of Offa's Dyke (that divided Wales from medieval England) the people to its west saw themselves as \\"Roman\\", citing the number of Latin inscriptions still being made into the 8th century.Williams, Gwyn A., The Welsh in their History, published 1982 by Croom Helm, Citations References     *  External links  *Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales *Roman Wales on the RCAHMW website *Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust info on Roman Wales *58 pages of artifacts and places associated with Roman Wales on Gathering the Jewels the website of Welsh cultural history *Iron Age and Roman Coins in Wales : A study by Cardiff University * Map of Roman localities in Wales (click on the arrows to get detailed information Category:Roman history of modern countries and territories w ","title":"Wales in the Roman era"},{"id":"14075327","text":"Map of Diocese of La Rochelle (1703) The Roman Catholic Diocese of La Rochelle and Saintes (; ) is a diocese of the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church in France. The diocese comprises the d√©partement of Charente-Maritime and the French overseas collectivity of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon. The bishop is a suffragan of the Archbishop of Bordeaux. The episcopal seat is in La Rochelle Cathedral. Saintes Cathedral is a co-cathedral. History The Diocese of La Rochelle was erected on 4 May 1648.Jean, p. 147. David M. Cheney, Catholic- Hierarchy: Diocese of La Rochelle (-Saintes). Retrieved: 2016-08-13 The Diocese of Maillezais was transferred on 7 May 1648, to La Rochelle. This diocese before the French Revolution, aside from Maillezais, included the present arrondissements of Marennes, Rochefort, La Rochelle, and a part of Saint-Jean-d'Ang√©ly. During the French Revolution, the Diocese of Saintes and the Diocese of La Rochelle were combined into the Diocese of Charente- Inferieure, under the direction of a Constitutional Bishop, salaried by and responsible to the French Republic. There was a schism with Rome and the Pope. On 15 July 1801, Pope Pius VII signed a new Concordat with First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte, who had overthrown the Directorate in the Coup of 18 Brumaire (9 November 1799);Andr√© Latreille, Napol√©on et le Saint-Si√®ge, 1801‚Äì1808: l'ambassade du Cardinal Fesch √† Rome (Paris, 1935), pp. 1‚Äì21. Fesch was Napoleon's uncle. the terms included the suppression of the Dioceses of Saintes and Lu√ßon, which was carried out on 29 November 1801. The entire territory of the former Diocese of Saintes, except for the part in Charente belonging to the Diocese of Angoul√™me, and the entire Diocese of Lu√ßon, were added to the Diocese of La Rochelle. In 1821 a see was again established at Lu√ßon, and had under its jurisdiction, aside from the former Diocese of Lu√ßon, almost the entire former Diocese of Maillezais; so that Maillezais, once transferred to La Rochelle, no longer belongs to the diocese, now known as La Rochelle et Saintes. Saintes Cathedral is the Co-Cathedral of the diocese St. Louis of France is the titular saint of the cathedral of La Rochelle and the patron of the city. St. Eutropius, first Bishop of Saintes, is the principal patron of the present diocese of La Rochelle. In this diocese are especially honoured: St. Gemme, martyr (century unknown); St. Seronius, martyr (third century); St. Martin, Abbot of the Saintes monastery (fifth century); St. Vaise, martyr about 500; St. Maclovius (Malo), first Bishop of Aleth, Brittany, who died in Saintonge about 570; Saint Amand, Bishop of Maastricht (seventh century). From 1534 La Rochelle and the Province of Aunis were a centre of Calvinism. In 1573 the city successfully resisted the Duke of Anjou, brother of Charles IX of France, and remained the chief fortress of the Huguenots in France. But in 1627 the alliance of La Rochelle with the English proved to Louis XIII and to Richelieu that the political independence of the Protestants would be a menace to France; the famous siege of La Rochelle (5 August 1627 ‚Äì 28 October 1628), in the course of which the population was reduced from 18,000 inhabitants to 5000, terminated with a capitulation which put an end to the political claims of the Calvinistic minority. The Chapter of the Cathedral of Saint-Louis was composed of eight dignitaries and twenty Canons. The dignitaries were the Dean (elected by the Chapter), the Treasurer, the Almoner, the Grand Archdeacon, the Archdeacon of Fontenay, the Cantor, the Subcantor and the Archdeacon of Bressuire‚Äîall appointed by the bishop. A seminary was established by royal order, with an income of 3000 livres, derived from an assessment on all of the benefices in the diocese. The seminary was entrusted to the Jesuits in 1694 by Bishop de la Frezeli√®re, two of whose brothers were Jesuits. During the French Revolution, when the Civil Constitution of the Clergy instituted a national church, and the nation was redivided into dioceses which matched as far as possible the civil departments into which the administration of the state was divided, the diocese of Saintes and the diocese of La Rochelle were combined into the Diocese of Charente- Inferieure. Both Bishop de La Rochefoucauld and Bishop de Coucy refused to take the oath of loyalty to the Civil Constitution, as required by law. They were therefore deposed. The electors of Charente-Infeurieure assembled on 27 February 1791 and elected Fr. Isaac-√âtienne Robinet, the cur√© of Saint- Savinien-du-Port as their Constitutional Bishop. He made his formal entry into Saintes on 31 March, and took formal possession of the cathedral on 10 April. He roused up the anti-clerical feelings of the populace against the non- jurors, but, once roused, they turned against all the clergy, including Robinet. Bishop Robinet resigned on 6 December 1793, and took up residence with his brother at Torx√©, where he died on 8 September 1797. On 1 March 2018, the Apostolic Vicariate of Iles Saint-Pierre et Miquelon, which had existed since 1763, was suppressed and the French overseas collectivity Saint-Pierre and Miquelon added to this Diocese.

Live performances \\"Loving Cup\\" has been performed sporadically by the Stones since its introduction to their catalogue. It was performed at the Stones' concert in Hyde Park on 5 July 1969. Mick Jagger introduced it as \\"Gimme a Little Drink\\" at the concert. The song was heard during early shows of the 1972 tour of America, and was re-introduced to set lists during the 2002-2003 Licks Tour. It was also performed with Jack White during the 2006 leg of the A Bigger Bang Tour, and this version was featured in the Martin Scorsese 2008 documentary film Shine a Light and on the soundtrack album. Reception Jonathan Zwickel of Pitchfork considers it \\"some of the Rolling Stones' most enduring and soulful work.\\" Cover versions The band Phish frequently covers \\"Loving Cup\\" during live performances.

It was one of two public high schools operated by the Elmira City School District serving Chemung County, alongside Elmira Free Academy, before the two merged into its current state in 2014.Elmira Stargazette \\"Sorrell accuses Murdoch of panic buying\\", Stargazette, In Elmira, Southside High School and Elmira Free Academy will combine as Elmira High School. The school has the honor to be recognized by the New York State Education Department as the only high performing school in the district, scoring the highest averages on state testing and curriculum exercises. Southside offers many special classes such as AP and ACE classes that could potentially count for future college credits. Aside from academics, Southside has been a strong contender in many different sports throughout the years, boasting an upgraded hall of fame in its gymnasium area. The high school is also involved in several different club opportunities, the top three being FBLA-PBL (Future Business Leaders of America), Key Club, and National Honor Society. All three are directly involved in community service. Some of these, with the addition of student council, assist in planning events such as Southside's annual Special Olympics program, the spirit week activities for what is now known as the \\"Express Fest,\\" community service involvement, school functions such as managing program box offices and the school store, amongst other positive endeavors of the many clubs. Southside and EFA In its time of existence, which came shortly after EFA, Southside High had two different buildings in use. Currently, it is using a newly renovated building on South Main Street on Elmira's southside. Prior to the merger, its school colors had been green and white since the establishment of the high school as well as its sports teams, called the Green Hornets. Until the 2011‚Äì2012 school year, Elmira Free Academy would play Southside High School in football for the Erie Bell, a trophy donated to the two schools by a local railroad company. In 2011, it was announced that the long-standing rivalry between the schools would come to an end and they would combine. The two high schools combined their sports teams by the 2011‚Äì12 school year. A community vote was taken to determine what new mascot and colors people were interested in. On May 25, 2011, the district officially announced that the new team would be called the Elmira Express, a common nickname for Elmiran legend Ernie Davis, the first African-American to ever win the Heisman Trophy in the sport of football. The team colors becams red, black, and white. The Decker Bell replaced the 64-year Erie Bell tradition. The new Elmira Express combined team has begun somewhat of a new rivalry with the Corning Hawks from two recently combined schools in Corning, New York. Both team combinations were due to severe budget issues that are still imminent and pose a threat to combine the schools altogether. The Elmira budget problem also jeopardizes the education of the students in the district, as well as the futures of the employed staff. Principals * Frank M.

In this case diffraction of light from the hologram is possible only as Bragg diffraction, i.e., the light has to have the right wavelength (color) and the wave must have the right shape (beam direction, wavefront profile). Volume holograms are also called thick holograms or Bragg holograms.  Theory  Volume holograms were first treated by H. Kogelnik in 1969 by the so-called \\"coupled-wave theory\\". For volume phase holograms it is possible to diffract 100% of the incoming reference light into the signal wave, i.e., full diffraction of light can be achieved. Volume absorption holograms show much lower efficiencies. H. Kogelnik provides analytical solutions for transmission as well as for reflection conditions. A good text-book description of the theory of volume holograms can be found in a book from J. Goodman .  Manufacturing  A volume hologram is usually made by exposing a photo-thermo-refractive glass to an interference pattern from an ultraviolet laser. It is also possible to make volume holograms in nonphotosensitive glass by exposing it to femtosecond laser pulses  Bragg selectivity  In the case of a simple Bragg reflector the wavelength selectivity \\\\Delta\\\\lambda can be roughly estimated by \\\\Delta\\\\lambda/\\\\lambda \\\\approx \\\\Lambda/L, where \\\\lambda is the vacuum wavelength of the reading light, \\\\Lambda is the period length of the grating and L is the thickness of the grating. The assumption is just that the grating is not too strong, i.e., that the full length of the grating is used for light diffraction. Considering that because of the Bragg condition the simple relation \\\\Lambda=\\\\lambda/(2\\\\Delta n) holds, where \\\\Delta n is the modulated refractive index in the material (not the base index) at this wavelength, one sees that for typical values (\\\\lambda = 500\\\\mbox{ nm},\\\\, L = 1\\\\mbox{ mm},\\\\, \\\\Delta n = .01) one gets \\\\Delta\\\\lambda \\\\approx 12.5 nm showing the extraordinary wavelength selectivity of such volume holograms. In the case of a simple grating in the transmission geometry the angular selectivity \\\\Delta\\\\Theta can be estimated as well: \\\\Delta\\\\Theta \\\\approx \\\\Lambda/d, where d is the thickness of the holographic grating. Here \\\\Lambda is given by \\\\Lambda = (\\\\lambda/2\\\\sin\\\\Theta). Using again typical numbers (\\\\lambda = 500\\\\mbox{ nm},\\\\, d = 1\\\\mbox{ cm},\\\\, \\\\Theta = 45 ^\\\\circ) one ends up with \\\\Delta\\\\Theta \\\\approx 4 \\\\times 10^{-5}\\\\mbox{ rad} = 0.002^\\\\circ showing the impressive angular selectivity of volume holograms.  Applications of volume holograms  The Bragg selectivity makes volume holograms very important. Prominent examples are: *Distributed feedback lasers (DFB lasers) as well as distributed Bragg reflector lasers (DBR lasers) where the wavelength selectivity of volume holograms is used to narrow the spectral emission of semiconductor lasers. *Holographic memory devices for holographic data storage where the Bragg selectivity is used to multiplex several holograms in one piece of holographic recording material using effectively the third dimension of the storage material. *Fiber Bragg gratings that employ volume holographic gratings encrypted into an optical fiber. Wavelength filters that are used as an external feedback in particular for semiconductor lasers.http://www.optigrate.com/ - Optigrate Although the idea is similar to that of DBR lasers, these filters are not integrated onto the chip. With the help of such filters also high-power laser diodes become narrow-band and less temperature sensitive. *Imaging spectroscopy can be achieved by selecting a single wavelength for each pixel in a full camera field.Blais-Ouellette S., Daigle O., Taylor K., The imaging Bragg Tunable Filter: a new path to integral field spectroscopy and narrow band imaging.

Life Sextius was born no later than 70 BC.The Philosophical Thought of the School of the Sextii by Omar Di Paola He founded a school of philosophy combining some features of the Pythagoreans with others of the Stoics; and which was consequently classed sometimes with one, and sometimes with the other of those sects. Seneca describes Sextius as a Stoic but mentions that Sextius himself denied it.Seneca, Epistles, lxiv, 2. From the Epistles of Seneca we learn that Sextius, though born of an illustrious family, had declined the office of Senator when offered him by Julius Caesar.Seneca, Epistles, xcviii. 13. He also subjected himself to a scrupulous self- examination at the close of each day;Seneca, De Ira, iii. 36. and he abstained from animal food, though for different reasons than those ascribed to Pythagoras: > Sextius believed that man had enough sustenance without resorting to blood, > and that a habit of cruelty is formed whenever butchery is practised for > pleasure.Seneca, Epistles, cviii. 18.

They lay down rules, they argue, and they quibble; they do not > infuse spirit simply because they have no spirit.

Function  HNF-4Œ± is a nuclear transcription factor that binds DNA as a homodimer. The encoded protein controls the expression of several genes, including hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha, a transcription factor which regulates the expression of several hepatic genes. This gene plays a role in development of the liver, kidney, and intestines. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. HNF4A is required for the PXR and CAR-mediated transcriptional activation of CYP3A4. Genetic mutations in the HNF4A gene can influence the activity of HNF4Œ±'s downstream proteins such as CYP2D6, in vitro and in vivo. The alkaloid berberine upregulates the expression of HNF4A. This gene also plays a pivotal role in the expression and synthesis of SHBG, an important glycoprotein made primarily in the liver, which in addition to lowering insulin-resistance also serves in reducing levels of free Estrogen as-well as prolonging the half-life of Testosterone. Function of HNF4A gene can be effectively examined by siRNA knockdown based on an independent validation.  Clinical significance  Mutations in the HNF4A gene are associated with a form of diabetes called maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY).

The diocese comprises the department of Ari√®ge and is suffragan to the Archdiocese of Toulouse. The diocese of Pamiers is divided into five Deaneries: Pamiers, Foix, Haut-Ari√®ge, Couserans, and Pays-d'Olmes-Mirapoix. The episcopal see is the Cathedral of Saint Antoninus in the city of Pamiers, and the current bishop is Jean-Marc Eychenne, appointed on 17 December 2014. The diocese of Pamiers has no seminary of its own. Its one seminarist (as of 2017) attends the S√©minaire Interprovincial Saint Cyprien in Toulouse. History The traditions of the diocese mention as its first apostle of Christianity St. Antoninus, born at Fredelacum (Fr√©d√©las) near Pamiers in the Rouergue, and martyred in his native country at a date uncertain. Cardinal Cesare Baronius believed that he was one of the martyrs of the Theban Legion in 286. The Abbey of St. Antonin was founded near Fredelacum about 960; in 1034 it passed under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Girone and was annexed in 1060 to the Congregation of Cluny. By 1095, however, the monastery followed the Rule of Saint Augustine.Sainte-Marthe, Gallia christiana XIII, p. 154. A castle built on the site of the abbey by Roger II Count of Foix (1070‚Äì1125) was called Appamia; hence the name of Pamiers which passed to the neighbouring small town. The monastery buildings were located a mile and a half outside the walls of the villa that became the city.Sainte-Marthe, Gallia christiana XIII, p. 151. =Creation of the diocese, 1296= Pope Boniface VIII created a see at Pamiers by the Bull Romanus Pontifex 23 July 1295, and made it a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Narbonne. On 16 September 1295 he named the church of the monastery of Saint Antoninus as the cathedral of the new diocese, and promoted Pamiers from the status of villa to the status of civitas. In that bull, also called Romanus Pontifex, he noted that he had taken action in creating the new diocese based on a plan of Pope Clement IV (1265‚Äì1268), who had been Bishop of Puy and Archbishop of Narbonne, which had not been put into effect.Sainte-Marthe, Gallia christiana XIII, Instrumenta, pp. 98-99. He named Bernard Saisset, Abbot of St. Antonin as the first Bishop of Pamiers, and by a decree of 18 April 1296 settled the boundaries of the new diocese which had been created out of territory of the large and wealthy diocese of Toulouse.J.-M. Vidal, \\"Les origines de la province eccl√©siastique de Toulouse,\\" Annales du Midi 15 (1903), pp. 289-328, especially 294-310; 469-492; 16 (1904), pp. 5-30. This greatly angered King Philip IV, who believed that his feudal rights were being contravened. The opposition of Hughes Mascaron, Bishop of Toulouse, and the conflict between Saisset and Roger Bernard III, Count of Foix, who had been excommunicated, prevented Bishop Saisset from taking possession of his diocese until their conflict was settled by King Philip IV of France.Sainte-Marthe, Gallia christiana XIII, Instrumenta, pp. 100-103. The conflict was over money and homage. J. M. Vidal has proven that it is not true, as had long been thought, that St. Louis of Anjou, who became Bishop of Toulouse at the death of Mascaron, had been appointed provisional administrator of the Diocese of Pamiers. Bishop Hugues went to Rome to argue his case with Pope Boniface. He died there on 6 December 1296.Lahond√®s, I, p. 100. Saisset took possession of his see on 19 April 1297. On 18 December 1295, no doubt as a rebuff to the Bishop of Toulouse, Pope Boniface issued the Bull Dum sollicite considerationis, creating the University of Pamiers. On 21 December 1295, he issued the Bull Ad Extirpandam Pestem, naming an Inquisitor for the diocese of Pamiers. Lahond√®s, I, pp. 92-93. On 5 February 1295, Pope Boniface launched his famous bull Clericis Laicos against Philip IV. Bishop Bernard sided with Pope Boniface VIII (1301) in his conflict with King Philip the Fair and was imprisoned by order of the King. He was released in 1302.Lahond√®s, I, pp. 102-108. The conflict between Toulouse and Pamiers nonetheless continued, even after the death of Boniface VIII in 1303. The new Pope's strategy was different. Pope Clement V first appointed his nephew, Gaillard de Preyssac, as the new bishop of Toulouse in 1306. Then, after a careful and no doubt disinterested investigation, Pope Clement, on 3 August 1308, agreed to a number of claims of Toulouse concerning the decree of Boniface VIII;Vidal, Annales du Midi 15 (1903), p. 313. the Diocese of Pamiers remained, but with less territory and poorer resources than those assigned it by Boniface VIII. Clement imposed a perpetual silence on the Archbishop of Toulouse and his successors.Vidal, Annales du Midi 15 (1903), pp. 320-321. However, when Pope John XXII raised Toulouse to metropolitan status on 22 February 1318, he also extended the Diocese of Pamiers which he made suffragan of Toulouse. Cathedral and Chapter Before the creation of the diocese in 1295, the inhabitants of the monastery of Saint-Antonin lived as Canons Regular according to the Rule of Saint Augustine.Sainte-Marthe, Gallia christiana XIII, p. 151. Doublet, p. 6. Bishop Saisset's brief tenure did not permit him to address the matter of the organization of a cathedral Chapter or the apportioning of revenues. This was left to his successor, Bishop Pilfort de Rabastens, who immediately met violent opposition from the Canons of Saint- Antonin. Prestige was at issue, and also power and money. Arbitration finally settled the issues which included the division of income, the power of appointing to various benefices, the creation of the office of Prior of the Cloister, and the nomination and admission to office of Chapter dignities and of Canons. The Prior was to be elected by the Chapter and instituted by the Bishop. The dignities (not dignitaries) were: the Archdeacon, the Treasurer, the Sacristan, the Infirmarian, the Master of Works, and the Aumonier.Sainte- Marthe, Gallia christiana XIII, p. 160. Lehonid√®s, p. 157-158. Doublet, p. 7. Bishop-elect Pilfort moved his residence from the monastery buildings of Saint-Antonin into the city of Pamiers. This separated him from his cathedral and from the Canons.Sainte-Marthe, Gallia christiana XIII, p. 159. In 1371 Pope Gregory XI reduced the number of Canons in the Cathedral Chapter to 18, and Pope Eugene IV further reduced the number to 12.Doublet, p. 7. In 1693 there were only four dignities, and 12 Canons. In 1787 there were six dignities, but only 9 Canons.Ritzler-Sefrin, V, p. 91, note 1. Ritzler-Sefrin, VI, p. 90, note 1. =Inquisition= The third bishop of Pamiers was Jacques Fournier (1317‚Äì1326), who subsequently was elected pope under the name of Benedict XII. The historian of Pamiers, Jean-Marie Vidal, discovered in the Vatican Library the record of the procedure of the Inquisition tribunal created at Pamiers by Jacques Fournier in 1318, for the extirpation of the remnants of Albigensianism in the Foix region. This document is most important for the history of the Inquisition, representing as it does, and perhaps in this instance only, that particular tribunal in which the inquisitor and the diocesan bishop had almost equal responsibility, as decreed in 1312 by the Council of Vienne.Carl Joseph Hefele, Histoire des Conciles (tr. Delarc) Tome IX (1274‚Äì1378) )Paris: Leclere 1873), pp. 437-438. In this new regime the traditional procedure of the Inquisition was made milder by temporizing with the accused who persisted in error, by granting defendants a fair amount of liberty, and by improving the prison regime. =Troubles in Foix and Pamiers= In 1485, Jean de Foix, Vicomte de Narbonne, the uncle of Countess Catherine de Foix the legitimate heir of Fran√ßois-Phoebus, came to Pamiers to demand homage. He threatened reprisals if he did not get what he wanted. A representative of the city received the Vicomte at the gate, but declared that the city had taken its oath to Countess Catherine; they would nonetheless receive the Vicomte as a member of the House of Foix. Angered, the Vicomte threw his forces at Le Mas, set fire to the gates, used his siege engines against the walls, drove out Bishop Pascal Dufour and established in his place Mathieu d'Artigueloube. He then turned on the Porte de Lolmet of Pamiers, without success, and withdrew to Maz√®res. Next year, on 14 July, the Vicomte's forces returned and attacked Pamiers. They entered and pillaged the city and imprisoned the leaders who favored the Countess. Her forces arrived on 28 August, entered and rescued the city, killing the leader of the attackers, the Sieur de Lavelanet.Lehond√®s, I, pp. 322-326. In April 1486, the Parlement of Toulouse issued an order declaring that the income of the bishopric of Pamiers should be divided, one-third for Bishop Pascal Dufour, one-third for Mathieu d'Artigueloube, and one-third for the repair of the church of Le Mas; it also ordered that the seat of the bishop should be transferred to Lieurac. Jean de Foix, Vicomte de Narbonne, died in November 1500, and the one contending bishop for succession to Pierre de Castelbajac, Gerand Jean, died in September 1501, but the conflict over the episcopal seat of Pamiers did not abate. Mathieu d'Artigueloube arrived immediately from Paris and sent a Commissioner from the Parlement of Paris to take possession of the diocese on 4 October 1501. The Commissioner was refused entry on the grounds that a plague was active, but he returned on the 7th, and his demand to place the arms of Mathieu d'Artigueloube above the door of the episcopal palace was agreed to by the Consuls of Pamiers.Lehond√®s, I, pp. 361-362. Mathieu then used his influence with the Vicomtes de Narbonne to have the Parlement of Toulouse to place the Diocese of Pamiers and the Abbey of L·∏ïzat in the hands of the King of France, Louis XII. Two parliamentary Commissioners arrived in Pamiers on 29 February 1503 to carry out the orders of the Parlement, but they could not obtain the submission of the Abbey of L·∏ïzat since the Abbot, Cardinal Amanieu d'Albret, was in Rome.Cardinal d'Albret was also the Administrator of the dioceses of Comminges, Vannes, Condom, Lascar, Oloron, Couserans, and Pamplona. Albret had arrived in Rome on 13 September 1502. Pope Alexander VI died on 18 August 1503, and Amanieu d'Albret, the brother-in-law of Cesare Borgia, participated in both the Conclave of August that elected Francesco Piccolomini (Pius III), and the Conclave of October‚ÄìNovember that elected Giuliano della Rovere (Julius II). Eubel, II, p. 6 no. 26; 56. The Commissioners ordered the Officers of the diocese to administer the temporal goods of the diocese and to turn over the income to the Consuls of Pamiers to control.Lehond√®s, I, pp. 364-365. Mathieu d'Artigueloube died on 30 March 1513. The Consuls of Pamiers immediately went to the Canons at Le Mas, and informed them of the fact, begging them to name a bishop to bring peace to the Church of Pamiers. The Canons designated the Protonotary Apostolic Bertrand de Lordat, who immediately began to function as though he were bishop, though he did not canonically become bishop until ten years later. Pope Leo X had named Cardinal Amanieu d'Albret as Administrator of the diocese and given him his bulls on 15 May 1514. The Cardinal resigned on 15 August 1514 on the appointment of Charles de Gramont as the new Bishop of Pamiers, thereby negating the election of Bertrand de Lordat. Gramont was transferred to the diocese of Couserans on 25 June 1515, and Cardinal d'Albret again took charge as Administrator.Eubel, III, p. 111, with notes 2 and 3; 176. Lehond√®s, I, p. 384. =Huguenots= During the episcopate of Robert of Pellev√© (1557‚Äì79), brother of Bishop Nicolas de Pellev√© of Amiens, the French Wars of Religion gave rise to cruel strife: Protestants destroyed every church in Pamiers, among them the magnificent church of Notre-Dame du Camp, and three times they demolished the episcopal palace of the Mas Saint-Antonin. It was Robert de Pellev√©, however, who obtained permission from the Papal Legate, Cardinal Trivulzio, on 24 January 1558 to establish the Jesuits in a coll√®ge at Pamiers, the second college to be established by the Jesuits in France. The arrangement was ratified by King Fran√ßois II on 11 February 1559. The efforts of three Jesuit priests to carry out the plan was repeatedly obstructed by the Consuls, as well as by the hostility of Huguenot believers in Pamiers. Nonetheless, the Coll√®ge opened at Christmas in 1559. In the same year, Huguenot violence against religious images began with repeated outbreaks of destructive violence.Lahond√®s, II, p. 7-10. In July 1561 the Consuls of Pamiers absolutely refused to publish the edict of King Charles IX which prohibited Huguenots from assembling publicly or raising troops; in 1562, now thoroughly Protestant, they attempted to close the Jesuit college by not renewing its permit to operate. At the time of the Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre in 1572, however, Pamiers was in the hands of the Catholic party, and there was every attempt to allow both sides the chance to live in peace and exercise their religions. However, following the Protestant assembly at Montauban on 24 August 1573, the towns of Ludi√®s and Saverdun were seized, and the nuns of Salenques were forced to flee; an attempt was made in April 1574 by the Huguenots to seize Pamiers, which turned out unsuccessfully.Lahond√®s, II, p. 11; 35-36. Another bishop of Pamiers Henri de Sponde (1626‚Äì42) (Spondanus), as a recent convert, suggested to Cardinal Baronius the project of producing an epitome of Baronius' twelve volume Annales Ecclesiasti (Ecclesiastical Annals). He carried out the project so well that he won the high praise of the Cardinal and the attention of Pope Paul V, who named Sponde rector of the French church in Rome, San Luigi dei Francesi. Paul V also gave Sponde a post in the Roman Curia as Revisor of Petitions in the office of the Major Penitentiary. Pamiers also had been governed by the Jansenist Fran√ßois Etienne de Caulet (1644‚Äì1680). =Revolution= In 1790 the National Constituent Assembly decided to bring the French church under the control of the State. Civil government of the provinces was to be reorganized into new units called 'd√©partements', originally intended to be 83 or 84 in number. The dioceses of the Roman Catholic Church were to be reduced in number, to coincide as much as possible with the new departments. Since there were more than 130 bishoprics at the time of the Revolution, more than fifty dioceses needed to be suppressed and their territories consolidated. Clergy would need to take an oath of allegiance to the State and its Constitution, specified by the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, and they would become salaried officials of the State. Both bishops and priests would be elected by special 'electors' in each department. This meant schism, since bishops would no longer need to be approved (preconised) by the Papacy; the transfer of bishops, likewise, which had formerly been the exclusive prerogative of the pope in canon law, would be the privilege of the State; the election of bishops no longer lay with the Cathedral Chapters (which were all abolished), or other responsible clergy, or the Pope, but with electors who did not even have to be Catholics or Christians. A new civil department, called \\"Ari√®ge\\", was created by the French Legislative Assembly, as part of a new Metropolitanate called \\"M√©tropole du Sud\\". The old diocese of Pamiers was suppressed and a new \\"Diocese of Ari√®ge\\" was created, with its center at Pamiers. When the Estates General had been summoned in 1789, the legitimate bishop of Pamiers, Joseph- Mathieu d'Agoult, behaved in such an authoritarian and aristocratic way when the cahiers (Notes of complaints and recommendations) were being drawn up that his own clergy refused to elect him as their representative for the meeting in Paris, and chose Canon Bernard Font instead. Canon Font's brother was one of the members of the Assembly who drew up the plan for the new departments. Font was elected bishop of Ari√®ge in 1791, and consecrated at Toulouse by Constitutional Bishop Antoine-Pascal-Hyacinthe Sermet on 15 May 1791. The consecration was valid, but canonically irregular, schismatic, and blasphemous (as a parody of genuine Catholic sacraments). The new Constitutional Bishop had a difficult time with his clergy, a substantial portion of whom refused the Oath. A portion of the people were offended by the execution of King Louis XVI on 21 January 1793, and nearly everyone was shocked by the abolition of Religion and the substitution of Reason, with the Festival of Reason on 10 November 1793. There was no longer a Catholic church, and there was no longer a Constitutional Church. Bishop Font tried to intercede on behalf of the √©migr√©s and protested against the arrest of opponents of the regime, acts which brought him to be arrested himself at the end of 1793. He was not released until 5 February 1795, after which he immediately went into hiding for more than a year. He established himself at Foix, where he assembled some 82 priests who were still loyal to him, and in 1797 he vigorously opposed the notion of a liturgy in the vernacular. He did not have to submit to the Concordat of 1801, for he died on 1 November 1800 without having been reconciled to the Roman Catholic Church.Pisani, pp. 368-369. =Church of the Concordat= After the signing of the Concordat of 1801 with First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte, Pope Pius VII demanded the resignation of all bishops in France, in order to leave no doubt as to who was a legitimate bishop and who was a Constitutional imposter. He then immediately abolished all of the dioceses in France, for the same reason. Then he began to restore the old Ancien R√©gime dioceses, or most of them, though not with the same boundaries as before the Revolution. The diocese of Pamiers was not one of those revived by Pope Pius VII in his bull Qui Christi Domini of 29 November 1801. Its territory was assigned to the Archdiocese of Toulouse. Under the Concordat, however, Bonaparte exercised the same privileges as had the kings of France, especially that of nominating bishops for vacant dioceses, with the approval of the Pope. The practice continued until the Restoration in 1815, when the privilege of nomination returned to the hands of the King of France. In accordance with the Concordat between Pope Pius VII and King Louis XVIII, signed on 11 June 1817, the diocese of Pamiers was restored bringing together territory from the ancient Diocese of Pamiers and the Diocese of Couserans, along with the larger portion of the former Diocese of Mirepoix and Diocese of Rieux, and a deanery of the former Diocese of Alet. The Concordat, however, was never ratified by the French National Assembly, which had the reputation of being more royalist than the King, and therefore, ironically, Napoleonic legislation was never removed from the legal code (as agreed in the Concordat of 1817) and the terms of the Concordat of 1817 never became state law. Louis XVIII, however, nominated Fran√ßois de La Tour-Landorthe on 13 January 1823, and he was approved by Pope Pius VII on 16 May 1823.Louis Blazy, in: L' √©piscopat fran√ßais..., p. 442. Ritzler-Sefrin, VII, p. 81. The 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State disestablished Catholicism as the religion of France, ended all state subsidies to religious organizations, cancelled all salaries and pensions paid to the French clergy, required the repayment of all loans made to churches and church organizations, and required that all property not subject to a religious foundation created since the Concordat of 1801 was to be turned over to the government. Pope Pius X protested that this was a unilateral abrogation of the Concordat of 1801. Diplomatic relations between the French Government and the Papacy were terminated. A decree of the Holy See 11 March 1910, revived the titles of the former Sees of Couserans and Mirepoix. and annexed them to the title of the Bishop of Pamiers.

The documents of his provision by the Pope arrived in Pamiers in the Spring of 1488, and he took possession of the diocese on 7 September 1488.

He was confirmed and settled his accounts with the Apostolic Camera (Treasury) on 21 May 1497. In 1499 he sent commissioners to Pamiers, attempting to claim his diocese. The entry of the commissioners was refused; they obtained an order from the Parlement of Toulouse, but Queen Catherine de Foix had them withdraw the order and requested the Parlement to stop bothering Pamiers. He died c. 1514, or, according to Lahond√®s, on 30 March 1513. Sainte- Marthe, Gallia christiana XIII, p. 166. Lahond√®s, I, p. 333.

The Canons of the Cathedral were divided: some supported Mathieu and held services at Le Mas, while others supported Jean and held services at Sainte-Marie-de- Marcadal. On 26 February 1499 the Pope transferred the seat of the bishop from Mas-Saint-Antonin to Sainte-Marie-de-Marcadal. News was received in Pamiers on 16 September 1501 that G√©rard Jean was dead in Paris. Sainte-Marthe, Gallia christiana XIII, pp. 166-167. Lahond√®s, I, p. 355-357, 361.

At the same time, Bertrand de Lordat, who had been acting as Vicar-General of Cardinal d'Albret in Pamiers, was elected bishop by the Chapter. On 20 January 1521 he issued a document as Bishop Elect and Confirmed. Leo X died on 1 December 1521, with the problem of two bishops for the same See unresolved.

Bosquet was not nominated by the King, and therefore not put forth for approval by the Pope. In no sense was he a bishop of Pamiers. : [Jacques de Montrouge]Montrouge, who was the Aumonier of Anne of Austria, was nominated in 1643, but was not granted his bulls of consecration and institution.

Its duration is approximately 35 minutes. It consists of three movements: #Andante ‚Äì Poco meno mosso (andante assai) ‚Äì Adagio #Allegro giusto #Tema (allegro) ‚Äì Interludio 1 ‚Äì Variations 1‚Äì3 ‚Äì Interludio 2 ‚Äì Variation 4 ‚Äì Reminiscenza (meno mosso) ‚Äì Coda (poco sostenuto) ‚Äì Pi√π mosso History The concerto was premiered on 26 November 1938 in Moscow by the USSR State Symphony Orchestra. Alexander Melik-Pashayev was the conductor and Lev Berezovsky played the cello. The premiere of Prokofiev's Cello Concerto (Op. 58) was generally thought to have been very poorly interpreted by the cellist. The pianist Sviatoslav Richter, who rehearsed the piece with Berezovsky prior to its premiere, considered the soloist ill-suited to the piece (\\"the music was foreign to his nature\\") but felt that the conductor was also responsible for the performance's failure: \\"Melik-Pashayev's tempi were as impossible as they were wrong. It seemed to me that he utterly failed to grasp the work's inner essence. It was a total fiasco.\\" The concerto was seldom played afterwards, until Prokofiev heard Rostropovich play it at a 1947 concert at the Moscow Conservatory. The performance reawakened Prokofiev's interest in the cello, and he rewrote his concerto (with advice from Rostropovich) to create the Symphony-Concerto (Op. 125). Orchestration The work is scored for solo cello, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 2 French horns, 2 trumpets, tuba, timpani, percussion (cymbals, castanets, bass drum, snare drum, tambourine), and strings.

It has been criticised for conflicts of interest and for acting as an industry lobby group. History It was founded in 1967 by Professor Alastair Frazer. In 1973 it held its first annual conference. The BNF educational programme, Food - a fact of life, was launched in 1991. Aims According to its entry in the Charity Commission's register, the aims of the British Nutrition Foundation are: #to advance the education of the public, and those involved in the training and education of others, in nutrition; and #to advance the study of and research into nutrition for the public benefit, and to disseminate and publish the useful results of such research. Operations The BNF's team of nutrition scientists conduct academic reviews of published research on issues of diet and public health. They present their reports in the BNF's Nutrition Bulletin, as well as various Task Force reports, intended for both academic and lay dissemination. The BNF also organises educational programs designed to provide accessible information on diet and health for children and young people, aged 3‚Äì16+ years. The BNF's education website, foodafactoflife.org.uk, provides teaching and learning resources about food and nutrition. The BNF receives funding for its projects from a variety of sources, including contracts with the European Commission, national government departments and agencies; food producers and manufacturers, retailers and food service companies; grant providing bodies, trusts and other charities. Criticism Concerns have been raised about the BNF's relationship with the food industry. The BNF receives funding from some food manufacturers and distributors in the UK. The British Medical Journal published an article in 2010 criticizing the way in which the BNF has been treated as a source of impartial nutritional information by the media, usually without describing the industry ties. It also criticized the UK government for paying the BNF to develop educational materials on nutrition, and quoted Tim Lobstein, a director at the International Association for the Study of Obesity-International Obesity Task Force, saying that some BNF educational materials seem to support industry messages. A 1985 World in Action documentary interviewed Derek Shrimpton, a previous director general at BNF, who said: \\"In the period I was there the foundation was solely taken up with defence actions for the industry.\\" He also said that BNF worked to frustrate government committees working on policies to reduce sugar, salt, and fat consumption. The BNF is open about its intention to shape UK Government policy on food, and this has led to concerns that it is serving as a lobbying group for the food industry.

He was the son of Berthold IV and Heilwig of Frohburg.  History and legacy  Berthold V, pictured on the ' monument in Bern (Karl Emanuel Tscharner, 1847). Berthold succeeded his father Berthold IV in 1186. At the beginning of his reign, he reduced the power of the Burgundian nobles and settled the Bernese Oberland and the area of Lucerne. As a result, he enlarged Thun and founded Bern in 1191, which became the focus of his expansionism. At the battle of Ulrichen in 1211, however, he failed to gain access to the Valais. The resulting treaty, signed at Hautcret Abbey on 19 October 1211, forced Berthold to accept Savoyard suzerainty over the upper Valais. Following the death of the Holy Roman Emperor Henry VI in 1198, he was one of the candidates in the Imperial election. He offered his nephews as hostages to the Archbishops of Cologne and Trier to gain their support. However, when he discovered that a majority had elected the Hohenstaufen Philip of Swabia (antiking to Welf Emperor Otto IV of Brunswick) he renounced his claim. In exchange for this renunciation, Berthold gained territorial concessions in what is now southern Germany and northern Switzerland, consolidating Z√§hringer hold over the Ortenau, the Breisgau, Schaffhausen, Breisach and All Saints' Abbey. In 1198 Philip also paid Berthold 3,000 silver Marks for renouncing his claims. His nephew Konrad von Urach who would eventually decline the papacy was put under the tutelage of Berthold's uncle. In the same year Berthold crushed an uprising of the Burgundian nobles, an event that is recorded on the gate in Freiburg. In 1200, Berthold began rebuilding Freiburg's city-parish church in Romanesque style.History of Freiburg accessed 29 December 2008 Around 1240 the building was continued in Gothic style. The church was finished in 1360 except for the choir that took another 150 years to complete. The church admired for its steeple is known as Freiburg Minster. Berthold married Clementia, daughter of Stephen III of Auxonne. Their son Berthold died before his father, in 1216. Therefore, with the death of Berthold V in 1218, the Z√§hringer dynasty became extinct in the male line. The Z√§hringer lands partly reverted to the crown, were granted imperial immediacy, or were divided between the houses of Urach (the counts of Freiburg), Kyburg and F√ºrstenberg.

The 23S rRNA is a 2904 nt long (in E. coli) component of the large subunit (50S) of the bacterial/archean ribosome. The ribosomal peptidyl transferase activity resides in domain V of this rRNA, and this domain is the most common binding site for antibiotics that inhibit translation. A well-known member of this antibiotic class, chloramphenicol, acts by inhibiting peptide bond formation, with recent 3D-structural studies showing two different binding sites depending on the species of ribosome. Linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin also bind to the 23S rRNA, and cross-resistance has been demonstrated between these antibiotics. Compared to 16S rRNA genes, 23S rRNA genes typically have higher sequence variations including insertions and/or deletions. The eukaryotic homolog of the 23S rRNA is the 28S ribosomal RNA, with a region filled by the 5.8S ribosomal RNA.  23S rRNA Functions  In general, rRNA has an essential function of peptidyl transferase, the stimulating core of the ribosome plays role in the peptide bond configuration. Both peptidyl-tRNA and aminoacyl-tRNA are important for synthesizing protein and transpeptidation response. However, 23S rRNA positions which are G2252, A2451, U2506, and U2585 have a significant function for tRNA binding in P site of the large ribosomal subunit. These modification nucleotides in site P can inhibit peptidyl-tRNA from binding and also remains U2555 modification intervene with transferring peptidyl-tRNA to puromycin. Furthermore, the chemical modification of half of these positions G2251, G2253, A2439, and U2584 can not prevent the tRNA binding. Peptidyl-tRNA of 50s subunits which binds to the P site preserve eight positions of 23S rRNA from chemical modification. On the other hand, 23S rRNA impacts on mutation for cell growth. Mutations A1912G, A1919G and Œ®1917C have a powerful growth phenotypes and they prevent translation while mutation A1916G has a simple growth phenotype and it leads to defect in the 50S subunits.

He played for hometown club Great Marlow before signing for Small Heath. He made 93 appearances in the FA Cup, Football Alliance and the Football League for the club in its early days. His career was ended prematurely when he broke his leg in a match against Darwen in 1892, the season when Small Heath won the inaugural Second Division championship. Although he played a couple of league games a year later, he retired from the game in 1894. After a sudden breakdown, he died in an asylum in 1909, when he was remembered as \\"one of the strongest backs who ever represented the allied counties of Berks and Bucks.\\" Life and career =Marlow= Speller was born in Wooburn near Marlow, Buckinghamshire, and played football as an amateur for his hometown club, Great Marlow. He appeared in the semi-final of the 1881‚Äì82 FA Cup as Marlow suffered a heavy defeat to eventual winners Old Etonians ‚Äì Bell's Life in Londons reporter thought the backs \\"hardly up to the mark\\" ‚Äì and helped the club to victories in the 1885 and 1886 Berks and Bucks Challenge Cup. He was a regular selection in the Berks and Bucks Football Association representative eleven to play against other associations. Among his numerous appearances for that team, he featured in the annual fixture against the Sheffield Association in 1883, as one of four players described by the York Herald as \\"perhaps ... the pick of the Southerners\\", in 1885, where the Sheffield and Rotherham Independent noted that the crossing by the Sheffield wings \\"gave Field and Speller any amount of work, but they were equal to the occasion, and by ponderous kicking they relieved the pressure\\", and 1887. =Early league football= Speller joined Small Heath in 1888. The club were then playing in the Combination, a league established to include those teams not invited to join the inaugural season of the Football League. Against Long Eaton Rangers in a Combination match in October, Speller's long shot led to Devey's fourth goal as Small Heath won 6‚Äì2. In November, the Birmingham Daily Post assessed the team as \\"quite equal, if not superior, to several of the league clubs\\" by reason of new players \\"whose presence materially strengthens the eleven\\"; they singled out centre-forward Will Devey and Speller, whom they described as \\"a fine little back [who] kicks and tackles splendidly\\". Representing Warwickshire against the Manchester Association in February 1890, alongside Small Heath teammates Chris Charsley, Harry Morris, Caesar Jenkyns and Will Devey, Speller sprained an ankle during the second half. The injury kept him out for Small Heath's next two games. The Combination folded, and Small Heath became founder members of the Football Alliance in 1890. In his second game in that league, he was noted as \\"defend[ing] in fine style\\" as Small Heath lost 3‚Äì0 at home to Sunderland Albion. According to the Birmingham Daily Post, his defence was \\"very safe\\" as Small Heath comfortably defeated Hednesford Town in the FA Cup, but rather less secure when he obstructed his goalkeeper, allowing Horace Pike to score for Nottingham Forest. Small Heath went on to win an exciting game by five goals to four to inflict Forest's first home defeat of the 1890‚Äì91 Football Alliance season. The following season, Small Heath accepted ¬£200 to switch the venue of their FA Cup tie against Sheffield Wednesday to the Wednesday's ground at Olive Grove. In rough weather and against rough play ‚Äì the Wednesday finished the game with nine men ‚Äì the defence of Bayley, Speller and Jenkyns was singled out for praise by the Sheffield and Rotherham Independent, but they were unable to prevent a defeat. =The Football League= Small Heath were elected to the Second Division of the Football League for its inaugural season in 1892. In October, in a match against Darwen, Speller broke his leg in collision with opponent William Campbell. The Birmingham Daily Post reported it thus: He was taken to the Queen's Hospital for treatment. The following April, Small Heath and Darwen played a benefit match for Speller; unfortunately for the beneficiary, the attendance was adversely affected by the Birmingham Charity Cup match between Aston Villa and West Bromwich Albion on the same day. A variety of full-backs stood in for him as Small Heath went on to win the Second Division title. When training resumed for the 1893‚Äì94 season, full-back Tom Bayley had been released, but the Post expected Speller to take his place. He had played in practice matches and was \\"fully confident of his ability to perform as well as ever he did\\". Teddy Jolley and newcomer Bernard Pumfrey began the season at full back, but a defeat at Liverpool and a heavy defeat at Burslem Port Vale gave Speller his chance. His first game for almost a year came in a visit to Ardwick, won 1‚Äì0 by Small Heath. According to the Post, \\"he played carefully at the start, but gained confidence as the game proceeded, and many times put a stop to extremely dangerous attacks by the clever right wing of the home team.\\" He played in the next game, a 5‚Äì2 win at home to Grimsby Town, then lost his place to William Reynolds. At Christmas, Small Heath played a friendly at Marlow, in which Speller had \\"not been seen in such form since his leg was broken\\". Nevertheless, he retired at the end of the season. Before he broke his leg, he had not missed a game in League or FA Cup since the ankle injury some two-and-a-half years earlier. While a Small Heath player, Speller lived in Muntz Street, the street that marked one side of the club's ground in the Small Heath district of Birmingham. The 1891 Census recorded him sharing lodgings with teammate Fred Heath and employed as a gun maker. Institutionalisation and death Speller was later engaged as a groundsman for Birmingham F.C. On 22 April 1909, Speller went to Cookham to watch the 1909 FA Cup Final at the Crystal Palace. Speller, who was staying with his brother in Cookham, had recently suffered from influenza. According to his brother, Speller appeared \\"unwell\\" and weakened by the influenza, but otherwise normal. The following morning, however, Speller was found wandering down one of the main streets of Cookham \\"brandishing a heavy stake\\" and threatening a woman and a constable who approached him. According to The Yorkshire Post, > He struggled violently, and it required several constables to convey him to > the station. In his cell he smashed the windows and became so dangerous that > he had to be strongly bound. Dr. Cronyn certified that Speller was insane. On 24 April, he appeared in court at Maidenhead‚Äî\\"on a charge of being a wandering lunatic\\"‚Äîand was sent to a county insane asylum. Newspapers reported that he was a \\"pitiful\\" sight in court, lying on the floor both handcuffed and shackled, while moaning and talking incoherently, but wearing a Berks and Bucks Cup gold medal. Speller interrupted proceedings frequently, exclaiming that he was \\"the champion footballer\\" and \\"the best little back in the world.\\" He also complained of head pain, yelling, \\"My poor head! Oh, my head!\\" Speller's mysterious transformation was reported with sorrow by journalists. The South Bucks Standard newspaper reported, \\"A great deal of sympathy is felt hereabouts for Speller, who is a sober, well-conducted man, held in much respect not only in Berks and Bucks, but at Birmingham, where he has been very popular.\\" Speller was transferred to the Winson Green asylum in Birmingham on 6 July 1909, and died five weeks later.UK, Lunacy Patients Admission Registers, 1846-1912England & Wales, Civil Registration Death Index, 1837-1915 References Category:1863 births Category:1909 deaths Category:People from Marlow, Buckinghamshire Category:English footballers Category:Association football fullbacks Category:Marlow F.C. players Category:Birmingham City F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Date of birth missing Category:Football Alliance players ","title":"Fred Speller"},{"id":"14075900","text":"A Time for Love (, Na ge bu duo qing) is a 1970 Hong Kong Shaw Brothers comedy film directed by Kuei Chih-Hung.

It is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues and cell types. The protein encoded by this gene is a transcription factor that is highly expressed in the liver and is involved in the regulation of the expression of several liver-specific genes. Mutations in the HNF1A gene have been known to cause diabetes. The HNF1A gene also contains one of 27 SNPs associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease.  Structure  = Gene = The HNF1A gene resides on chromosome 12 at the band 12q24.2 and contains 9 exons. This gene produces 8 isoforms through alternative splicing. = Protein = This protein belongs to the HNF1 homeobox family. It contains 3 functional domains: an N-terminal dimerization domain (residues 1‚Äì32), a bipartite DNA-binding motif containing an atypical POU-homeodomain (residues 98‚Äì280), and a C-terminal transactivation domain (residues 281‚Äì631). There is also a flexible linker (residues 33‚Äì97) which connects the dimerization and DNA binding domains. Crystal structures have been solved for the dimerization domain, which forms a four-helix bundle where two Œ± helices are separated by a turn; the DNA-binding motif, which forms a helix-turn-helix structure; and the POU-homeodomain, which is composed of three Œ± helices, contained in the motif. This homeodomain is considered atypical due to an extended loop inserted between the second and third helices relative to the canonical homeodomain fold. The atypical insertion is thought to stabilize the interface to improve transcriptional efficiency. Meanwhile, the dimerization domain is responsible for the homo- and heterodimerization of HNF-1Œ±. The resulting dimer contains a rigid ‚Äúmini-zipper‚Äù, comprising Œ±-helices 1 and 1‚Ä≤, linked by a non-canonical tight turn to a flexible C-terminal comprising Œ±-helices 2 and 2‚Ä≤.  Function  HNF-1Œ± is a transcription factor expressed in organs of endoderm origin, including liver, kidneys, pancreas, intestines, stomach, spleen, thymus, testis, and keratinocytes and melanocytes in human skin. It has been shown to affect intestinal epithelial cell growth and cell lineages differentiation. For instance, HNF1A is an important cell-intrinsic transcription factor in adult B lymphopoiesis. The participation of HNF-1Œ± in glucose metabolism and diabetes has been reported, including the involvement in GLUT1 and GLUT2 transporter expression in pancreatic Œ≤-cells and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 gene expression in pancreatic islets. HNF-1Œ± could promote the transcription of several proteins involved in the management of type II diabetes including dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV/CD26). HNF-1Œ± is also involved in various metabolic pathways of other organs, such as being a transcriptional regulator of bile acid transporters in the intestine and kidneys. HNF-1Œ± is involved in the promotion of hepatic organic cation transporters, which uptake certain classes of pharmaceuticals; hence, the loss of its function can lead to drug metabolism problems. In addition, HNF-1Œ± regulates the expression of acute phase proteins, such as fibrinogen, c-reactive protein, and interleukin 1 receptor, which are involved with inflammation. Moreover, significantly lower levels of HNF-1Œ± in pancreatic tumors and hepatocellular adenomas than in normal adjacent tissues was observed, suggesting that HNF-1Œ± might play a possible tumor suppressor role.  Clinical significance  HNF1A mutations can cause maturity onset diabetes of the young type 3, one of the forms of \\"monogenic diabetes\\", as well as hepatocellular adenoma. HNF-1 protein is present in clear cell carcinoma of ovary In humans, mutations in HNF1A cause diabetes that responds to low dose sulfonylurea agents. The identification of extreme sulfonylurea sensitivity in patients with diabetes mellitus owing to heterozygous mutations in HNF1A presents a clear example of the relevance of HNF1A in diabetes patients and how pharmacogenetics can contribute in patient care. For example, patients with maturity onset diabetes of the young owing to mutations in HNF1A (which accounts for ~3% of all diabetes mellitus cases diagnosed under the age of 30 years) are extremely sensitive to sulfonylurea treatment and can successfully transition off insulin treatment. Likewise, patients with diabetes caused by mutations in the HNF1A gene have been described as sensitive to the hypoglycemic effects of sulphonylureas. The cause of hyperglycemia appears to alter the response to hypoglycemic drugs. Accordingly, HNF-1Œ±-induced diabetes has marked sulphonylurea sensitivity. This pharmacogenetic effect is consistent with models of HNF-1Œ± deficiency, and the genetic basis of hyperglycemia may have implications for patient management.. Common genetic variation within HNF1A is also associated with risk of developing type 2 diabetes and increased penetrance of early-onset diabetesCommon HNF1A Variant I27L Is a Modifier of Age at Diabetes Diagnosis in Individuals With HNF1A-MODY\\" = Clinical marker = A multi-locus genetic risk score study based on a combination of 27 loci, including the HNF1A gene, identified individuals at increased risk for both incident and recurrent coronary artery disease events, as well as an enhanced clinical benefit from statin therapy.

From 1968 to 1974 As early as 1968, art critics Pierre Restany and Fran√ßois Pluchart refer to socially engaged art and less commercial practices among a diverse set of artists, including body artists Gina Pane and Michel Journiac, Spanish-born video artist Joan Rabascall, Herv√© Fischer, Fred Forest, and Jean-Paul Thenot. In the fall of 1973, Fran√ßois Pluchart initiated a debate between Journiac, Pane, Fischer, and Thenot, which was published as ‚ÄúTen Questions on Sociological Art‚Äù (‚ÄúDix questions sur l‚Äôart sociologique‚Äù) in the art magazine artTitudes, which he had founded in 1971. The history of sociological art might also be traced through the independent practices of Fischer, Forest, and Thenot who would later form the Sociological Art Collective. These practices must themselves be put into dialogue with broad international artistic tendencies towards social engagement and the social sciences, evident, for instance, in the work of Stephen Willats and Hans Haacke, exhibitions such as Art into Society, Society into Art (Institute of Contemporary Art, London, 1974), and the intellectual histories of social art history and sociology of art. In the mid-1960s, Forest (born 1933, Algeria) began a series of actions using of audiovisual and communication technologies to challenge conventional artistic media and activity. Images of many works are available at Webnetmuseum He projected slides onto his paintings (Tableau Ecran, 1963), initiated community events in impoverished neighborhoods (Family Portrait, 1967), and used video to engage social spaces (\\"Mur d‚ÄôArles and Cabine Telephonique\\", 1967). In the early 1970s, his utilization of the press and video as tools of social engagement and political provocation expanded. In January 1972, Forest began his \\"Space Media\\" project by placing a blank rectangle in the newspaper Le Monde and inviting readers to fill it in and mail it to him. For an exhibition entitled ‚ÄúArcheology of the Present‚Äù (‚ÄúArcheologie du present‚Äù) at the Galerie Germain, Paris, in May 1972, Forest took the street where the gallery was located, Rue Gu√©negaud, as a topic, creating a video circuit displaying the street in the gallery and the gallery in the windows facing the street and collecting trash from the street to show in the gallery. Pierre Restany carried out short interviews with passersby for an episode of ‚ÄúForum des Arts\\", aired on May 13, 1973. In June 1973, with the collaboration of the philosopher Vilem Flusser and sociologist Philippe Butaud, Forest set up a video studio in a community of retirees to launch a video exchange in the south of France (\\"Video Troisieme Age\\", 1973). On the occasion of the XII Bienal de S√£o Paulo in October 1973, he effectuated a series of events, including a version of Space Media, a sociological walk, and a procession through the city center with participants holding white placards (\\"Blancs evanhit la ville\\"), all of which were provocations in the face of the established military dictatorship. Always highly critical of those in power, committed to participatory art, and deeply engaged with new communication technologies, Forest would continue these pursuits after joining the collective in October 1974. Herv√© Fischer (born 1941, France) was a student of sociology and taught the sociology of communication and culture at the Sorbonne beginning in the early 1970s. Initially involved with ‚ÄúSupport/Surface,‚Äù Fischer did a series of ‚ÄúEssuie-mains‚Äù paintings with handprints on cloth rolls as a means of deconstructing the medium of painting. He also began various campaigns, grouped under the title ‚ÄúHygiene de l‚Äôart,‚Äù to eradicate art of traditional mores and media, and even invited artists to send him their works, which he tore up and displayed in small plastic bags (‚ÄúLa d√©chirure des oeuvres d‚Äôart‚Äù). Around 1974, his projects shifted away from the medium of painting toward more marginal and popular visual idioms, such as stamps and street signs, and into performances in the social realm. Jean-Paul Thenot (born 1943, France) was trained as a psychotherapist, a profession he continued while producing art. Around 1969, he began creating artworks, beginning with his ‚ÄúInterventions in the Street,‚Äù which consisted of a series of scaled sculptures of everyday objects, such as mousetraps, set up in public space. Around 1970, he moved away from producing objects into largely textual and conceptual works, such as his ‚ÄúConstats d‚Äôexistence,‚Äù typed pages of commentary on contemporary artists that were mailed to various figures in the art world. In 1972, he began conducting interactive surveys about art and perception. In response to the infamous, state-sponsored ‚ÄúExpo 72‚Äù (‚ÄúDouze ans de l‚Äôart contemporain en France‚Äù), he carried out a large survey inviting respondents to select the most representative French artists and then declared the person whose submitted list was closest to the averaged, final list the honorary curator of a public exhibition opening that May. The three artists met at openings and events in the early 1970s and were part of a global trend in artistic practice toward more conceptual and less skill-based art that was intentionally anti-commercial. In France, the events of May and June 1968 had irrevocably changed how many artists conceived of their work. While each artist brought areas of expertise‚ÄîForest's interest in new media, Fischer's theoretical grounding, and Thenot's inquiry-based research‚Äîa commitment to engage the public, to oppose traditional and commercially-driven art, and to affect social change united the three artists. From 1974 to 1980 In the summer of 1974, Journiac organized a series of meetings at his apartment on √éle Saint-Louis in Paris to discuss the initiation of an artist movement engaged with critical and sociological realities. The meetings brought together artists such as Gina Pane, Bertrand Lavier, Thierry Agullo, Joan Rabscall, Jocelyne Herv√©, Sonso, Herv√© Fischer, Jean-Paul Thenot as well as art critics Fran√ßois Pluchart and Bernard Teyssedre. It was from these meetings that the impulse to form the Sociological Art Collective emerges, and on October 10, 1974, the Sociological Art Collective was officially declared with the publication in newspaper Le Monde of its first manifesto, signed by Herv√© Fischer, Fred Forest, and Jean-Paul Th√©not. From this date onwards, these artists would alternate between practices claiming this lineage and their own personal practices. Concretely speaking, the collective published a number of texts, including three manifestos; organized and effectuated a series of projects, including four group exhibitions and large-scale urban interventions; and founded the Ecole Sociologique Interrogative. Their activity instantiates an early moment in the history of what would be called in the mid-1990s relational art or socially-engaged art but also connected with a number of artistic tendencies of the 1970s, such as conceptual art, performance art, and institutional critique. For example, the Collective's two-week intervention in the southern French town of Perpignan in July 1976, entitled \\"Study and Animation of Perpignan\\" began with a study of the conditions and needs of neighborhoods in Perpignan by a thirty-person, interdisciplinary team and then led to dozens of direct interventions, which included pop-up exhibitions, screenings, interviews, parties, and a multi- neighborhood photograph swap, all aimed to, as the press release notes, ‚Äúbring together different neighborhoods [. . .], which although geographically close remain distant at the level of social communication.‚Äù After setting out four principles‚Äîcritique, communication, intervention, and pedagogy‚Äîthe group proposes sociological art as means to overcome the divide between ‚Äúa quasi- scientific approach to the environment and a lived connection established among individuals [. . .] and the studied environment.‚Äù This project and related texts indicate three key aspects that broadly characterized sociological art. First, artistic labor included activities such as organizing, writing, research, and teaching. The expansion of traditional artistic skills to integrate intellectual and white-collar skills related to the broader transition from an industrial economy to service and information economy. Second, projects developed in dialogue with specific sites and their associated audiences. Whether focused on a town or a particular community, sociological art aimed to increase awareness about social conditions of existence through exchange with sites and humans. Third, sociological art was usually time-based and ephemeral and funded primarily by grants, personal finances, and commissions. The remaining material, therefore, consists largely of documentation rather than ‚Äúrarified‚Äù art objects bought, sold, and collected. For six years, the Collective carried out a handful of collaborative sociological art projects, participated in colloquia and exhibition, generated a community of collaborators, and provided support for independent work. Interlocutors included Henri Lefebvre, Edgar Morin, Vilem Flusser, Jean Duvignaud, Jorge Glusberg, Kristine Stiles, and numerous artists, including John Latham of the Artist Placement Group, Stephen Willats, and Ken Friedman. Tensions developed among Fischer, Forest, and Thenot, and in 1980, Forest and Thenot published an ad in Art Press selling the Ecole Sociologique Interrogative, which was located in Fischer's apartment, and wrote a tract declaring the end of the Collective.

Theory Sociological Art aimed to develop a critical analysis of art and society through interventionist artistic practices and associated writing that drew on the methods and theories of sociology. It envisioned art in terms of interaction, animation, pedagogy, and the creation of structures of exchange, provocation, and disruption of conventional social behaviors with a view to denouncing all and any forms of conditioning. As summarized by Fred Forest: ‚ÄúThe practical aim of Sociological Art is to provide the necessary conditions of existence for various devices that frame a given efficient and effective questioning or investigation, thereby establishing the optimal conditions for a situation of intersubjectivity.‚ÄùL'art sociologique a pour objet pratique de r√©unir les conditions necessaires √† la mise en oeuvre de \\" dispositifs\\" de nature diverses, √† partir desquels une fonction de questionnement et d'interrogation pourra √™tre d√©velopp√©e efficacement en vue d'√©tablir les conditions optimum d'une situation intersubjective. . Sociological Art was a politically engaged response to an art world that was perceived as being out of touch both with the technologies and the society of its time. This stance was in strict opposition to reigning modernist and formalist dogmas that privileged medium specificity and authorial intention. Various theoretical influences can be traced through sociological art. In a classical examine of Situationist d√©tournement, Sociological Art aimed to draw attention to the channels of power and mass communication it was aiming to undermine. It called upon derision, simulacrum and participation in order to explode or alter a certain reality structured by the social codes of the time. Considering how ideology structured society related to contemporaneous analyses in French critical theory, such as Louis Althusser‚Äôs idea of Ideological State Apparatus as well as Foucault‚Äôs writing on power. At the same time, sub-disciplines within the social sciences emerged to study art and culture, including the sociology of art and visual anthropology, and applied novel method and theories to draw attention to art‚Äôs socio-economic frames. Beyond Following the dissipation of the Sociological Art Collective, its founders retained certain sociological tenets in their later work and pursuits. Fischer continued work with the Ecole Sociologique Interrogative and carried out large-scale urban interventions. He then moved to Montreal, where he worked as a curator of new media, and in 2010, he has a large retrospective exhibition in C√©ret. Forest launched his subsequent theory of Communication aesthetics and continued his work as a teacher and artist, becoming an important early theorist and practitioners of net and internet art. In 2007, Forest had a retrospective exhibition at Slought Foundation. Thenot focused on the therapeutique potential of art and video in his work as a psychotherapist. In 2010, he had an exhibition, called an \\"Intervention d'art sociologique\\" at Galerie Flux in Liege that included a video interview with the artist. All three continued to write prodigiously and have recently exhibited their artwork again. Though relatively unknown today, Sociological Art is thoroughly emblematic of the historical upheavals of the late 1960s and 1970s in France and Europe generally and prefigures many of the most prominent trends in art since the mid-1990s.

PKCŒµ is an isoform of the large PKC family of protein kinases that play many roles in different tissues. In cardiac muscle cells, PKCŒµ regulates muscle contraction through its actions at sarcomeric proteins, and PKCŒµ modulates cardiac cell metabolism through its actions at mitochondria. PKCŒµ is clinically significant in that it is a central player in cardioprotection against ischemic injury and in the development of cardiac hypertrophy.  Structure  Human PRKCE gene (Ensembl ID: ENSG00000171132) encodes the protein PKCŒµ (Uniprot ID: Q02156), which is 737 amino acids in length with a molecular weight of 83.7 kDa. The PKC family of serine-threonine kinases contains thirteen PKC isoforms, and each isoform can be distinguished by differences in primary structure, gene expression, subcellular localization, and modes of activation. The epsilon isoform of PKC is abundantly expressed in adult cardiomyocytes, being the most highly expressed of all novel isoforms, PKC-Œ¥, -Œ∂, and ‚ÄìŒ∑. PKCŒµ and other PKC isoforms require phosphorylation at sites Threonine-566, Threonine-710, and Serine-729 for kinase maturation. The epsilon isoform of PKC differs from other isoforms by the position of the C2, pseudosubstrate, and C1 domains; various second messengers in different combinations can act on the C1 domain to direct subcellular translocation of PKCŒµ. Receptors for activated C-kinase (RACK) have been found to anchor active PKC in close proximity to substrates. PKCŒµ appears to have preferred affinity to the (RACK/RACK2) isoform; specifically, the C2 domain of PKCŒµ at amino acids 14‚Äì21 (also known as ŒµV1-2) binds (RACK/RACK2), and peptide inhibitors targeting ŒµV1-2 inhibit PKCŒµ translocation and function in cardiomyocytes, while peptide agonists augment translocation. It has been demonstrated that altering the dynamics of the (RACK/RACK2) and (RACK1) interaction with PKCŒµ can influence cardiac muscle phenotypes. Activated PKCŒµ translocates to various intracellular targets. In cardiac muscle, PKCŒµ translocates to sarcomeres at Z-lines following Œ±-adrenergic and endothelin (ET)A-receptor stimulation. A myriad of agonists have also been shown to induce the translocation of PKCŒµ from the cytosolic to particulate fraction in cardiomyocytes, including but not limited to PMA or norepinephrine;arachidonic acid;ET-1 and phenylephrine; angiotensin II and diastolic stretch; adenosine; hypoxia and Akt-induced stem cell factor; ROS generated via pharmacologic activation of the mitochondrial potassium- sensitive ATP channel (mitoK(ATP)) and the endogenous G-protein coupled receptor ligand, apelin.  Function  Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of serine- and threonine-specific protein kinases that can be activated by calcium and the second messenger diacylglycerol. PKC family members phosphorylate a wide variety of protein targets and are known to be involved in diverse cellular signaling pathways. PKC family members also serve as major receptors for phorbol esters, a class of tumor promoters. Each member of the PKC family has a specific expression profile and is believed to play a distinct role in cells. The protein encoded by this gene is one of the PKC family members. This kinase has been shown to be involved in many different cellular functions, such as apoptosis, cardioprotection from ischemia, heat shock response, as well as insulin exocytosis. = Cardiac muscle sarcomeric contractile function = PKCŒµ translocates to cardiac muscle sarcomeres and modulates contractility of the myocardium. PKCŒµ binds RACK2 at Z-lines with an EC50 of 86 nM; PKCŒµ also binds at costameres to syndecan-4. PKCŒµ has been shown to bind F-actin in neurons, which modulates synaptic function and differentiation; however it is unknown whether PKCŒµ binds sarcomeric actin in muscle cells. Sarcomeric proteins have been identified in PKCŒµ signaling complexes, including actin, cTnT, tropomyosin, desmin, and myosin light chain-2; in mice expressing a constitutively-active PKCŒµ, all sarcomeric proteins showed greater association with PKCŒµ, and the cTnT, tropomyosin, desmin and myosin light chain-2 exhibited changes in post-translational modifications. PKCŒµ binds and phosphorylates cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) in complex with troponin C (cTnC); phosphorylation on cTnI at residues Serine-43, Serine-45, and Threonine-144 cause depression of actomyosin S1 MgATPase function. These studies were further supported by those performed in isolated, skinned cardiac muscle fibers, showing that in vitro phosphorylation of cTnI by PKCŒµ or Serine-43/45 mutation to Glutamate to mimic phosphorylation desensitized myofilaments to calcium and decreased maximal tension and filament sliding speed. Phosphorylation on cTnI at Serine-5/6 also showed this depressive effect. Further support was gained from in vivo studies in which mice expressing a mutant cTnI (Serine43/45Alanine) exhibited enhanced cardiac contractility. = Cardiac muscle mitochondrial metabolism and function = In addition to sarcomeres, PKCŒµ also targets cardiac mitochondria. Proteomic analysis of PKCŒµ signaling complexes in mice expressing a constitutively-active, overexpressed PKCŒµ identified several interacting partners at mitochondria whose protein abundance and posttranslational modifications were altered in the transgenic mice. This study was the first to demonstrate PKCŒµ at the inner mitochondrial membrane, and it was found that PKCŒµ binds several mitochondrial proteins involved in glycolysis, TCA cycle, beta oxidation, and ion transport. However, it remained unclear how PKCŒµ translocates from the outer to inner mitochondrial membrane until Budas et al. discovered that heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) coordinates with the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane-20 (Tom20) to translocate PKCŒµ following a preconditioning stimulus. Specifically, a seven amino acid peptide, termed TAT-ŒµHSP90, homologous to the Hsp90 sequence within the PKCŒµ C2 domain induced translocation of PKCŒµ to the inner mitochondrial membrane and cardioprotection. PKCŒµ has also been shown to play a role in modulating mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT); the addition of PKCŒµ to cardiomyocytes inhibits MPT, though the mechanism is unclear. Initially, PKCŒµ was thought to protect mitochondria from MPT through its association with VDAC1, ANT, and hexokinase II; however, genetic studies have since ruled this out and subsequent studies have identified the F0/F1 ATP synthase as a core inner mitochondrial membrane component and Bax and Bak as potential outer membrane components These findings have opened up new avenues of investigation for the role of PKCŒµ at mitochondria. Several likely targets of PKCŒµ action affecting MPT have been discovered. PKCŒµ interacts with ERK, JNKs and p38, and PKCŒµ directly or indirectly phosphorylates ERK and subsequently Bad. PKCŒµ also interacts with Bax in cancer cells, and PKCŒµ modulates its dimerization and function. Activation of PKCŒµ with the specific activator, ŒµRACK, prior to ischemic injury has shown to be associated with phosphorylation of the F0/F1 ATP synthase. Moreover, the modulatory component, ANT is regulated by PKCŒµ. These data suggest that PKCŒµ may act at multiple modulatory targets of MPT function; further studies are required to unveil the specific mechanism.  Clinical significance  = Cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure = Findings of PKCŒµ phosphorylation in animal models have been verified in humans; PKCŒµ phosphorylates cTnI, cTnT, and MyBPC and depresses the sensitivity of myofilaments to calcium. PKCŒµ induction occurs in the development of cardiac hypertrophy, following stimuli such as myotrophin, mechanical stretch and hypertension. The precise role of PKCŒµ in hypertrophic induction has been debated. The inhibition of PKCŒµ during transition from hypertrophy to heart failure enhances longevity; however, inhibition of PKCŒµ translocation via a peptide inhibitor increases cardiomyocyte size and expression of hypertrophic gene panel. A role for focal adhesion kinase at costameres in strain-sensing and modulation of sarcomere length has been linked to hypertrophy. The activation of FAK by PKCŒµ occurs following a hypertrophic stimulus, which modulates sarcomere assembly. PKCŒµ also regulates CapZ dynamics following cyclic strain. Transgenic studies involving PKCŒµ have also shed light on its function in vivo. Cardiac-specific overexpression of constitutively-active PKCŒµ (9-fold increase in PKCŒµ protein, 4-fold increase in activity) induced cardiac hypertrophy characterizes by enhanced anterior and posterior left ventricular wall thickness. A later study unveiled that the aging of PKCŒµ transgenic mice brought on dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure by 12 months of age,] characterized by a preserved Frank-Starling mechanism and exhausted contractile reserve. Crossing PKCŒµ transgenic mice with mutant cTnI mice lacking PKCŒµ phosphorylation sites (Serine-43/Serine-45 mutated to Alanine) attenuated the contractile dysfunction and hypertrophic marker expression, offering critical mechanistic insights. = Cardioprotection against Ischemic injury = JM Downey was the first to introduce the role of PKC in cardioprotection against ischemia-reperfusion injury in 1994,; this seminal idea stimulated a series of studies which examined the different isoforms of PKC. PKCŒµ has been demonstrated to be a central player in preconditioning in multiple independent studies, with its best known actions at cardiac mitochondria. It was first demonstrated by Ping et al. that in five distinct preconditioning regimens in conscious rabbits, the epsilon isoform of PKC specifically translocated from the cytosolic to particulate fraction. This finding was validated by multiple independent studies occurring shortly thereafter, and has since been observed in multiple animal models and human tissue, as well as in studies employing transgenesis and PKCŒµ activators/inhibitors. Mitochondrial targets of PKCŒµ involved in cardioprotection have been actively pursued, since the translocation of PKCŒµ to mitochondria following protective stimuli is one of the most well-accepted cardioprotective paradigms. PKCŒµ has been shown to target and phosphorylate alcohol dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) following preconditioning stimuli, which increased the activity of ALDH2 and reduced infarct size. Moreover, PKCŒµ interacts with cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COIV), and preconditioning stimuli evoked phosphorylation of COIV and stabilization of COIV protein and activity. The mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channel (mitoK(ATP)) also interacts with PKCŒµ; phosphorylation of mitoK(ATP) following preconditioning stimuli potentiates channel opening. PKCŒµ modulates the interaction between subunit Kir6.1 of mitoK(ATP) and connexin-43, whose interaction confers cardioprotection. Lastly, several mitochondrial metabolic targets of PKCŒµ phosphorylation involved in cardioprotection following activation with ŒµRACK have been identified, including mitochondrial respiratory complexes I, II and III, as well as proteins involved in glycolysis, lipid oxidation, ketone body metabolism and heat shock proteins. The role of PKCŒµ acting in non- mitochondrial regions of cardiomyocytes is less well understood, though some studies have identified sarcomeric targets. PKCŒµ translocation to sarcomeres and phosphorylation of cTnI and cMyBPC is involved in the Œ∫-opioid- and Œ±-adrenergic-dependent preconditioning that slows myosin cycling rate, thus protecting the contractile apparatus from damage. Activation of PKCŒµ by ŒµRACK prior to ischemia was also found to phosphorylate Ventricular myosin light chain-2, however the functional significance remains elusive. Actin-capping protein, CapZ appears to affect the localization of PKCŒµ to Z-lines and modulates the cardiomyocyte response to ischemic injury. Cardioprotection in mice with reduction of CapZ showed enhancement in PKCŒµ translocation to sarcomeres, thus suggesting that CapZ may compete with PKCŒµ for the binding of RACK2. = Other functions = Knockout and molecular studies in mice suggest that this kinase is important for regulating behavioural response to morphine and alcohol. It also plays a role lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated signaling in activated macrophages and in controlling anxiety-like behavior.

It started in 1965 after the publication of Lotfi Asker Zadeh's seminal work Fuzzy sets.Zadeh, L. A. (1965) \\"Fuzzy sets\\", Information and Control, 8, 338‚Äì353. Definition A fuzzy subset A of a set X is a function A:X‚ÜíL, where L is the interval [0,1]. This function is also called a membership function. A membership function is a generalization of a characteristic function or an indicator function of a subset defined for L = {0,1}. More generally, one can use a complete lattice L in a definition of a fuzzy subset A .Goguen, J. (1967) \\"L-fuzzy sets\\", J. Math. Anal. Appl., 18, 145-174. Fuzzification The evolution of the fuzzification of mathematical concepts can be broken down into three stages:Kerre, E.E., Mordeson, J.N. (2005) \\"A historical overview of fuzzy mathematics\\", New Mathematics and Natural Computation, 1, 1-26. :# straightforward fuzzification during the sixties and seventies, :# the explosion of the possible choices in the generalization process during the eighties, :# the standardization, axiomatization, and L-fuzzification in the nineties. Usually, a fuzzification of mathematical concepts is based on a generalization of these concepts from characteristic functions to member functions. Let A and B be two fuzzy subsets of X. Intersection A ‚à© B and union A ‚à™ B are defined as follows: (A ‚à© B)(x) = min(A(x),B(x)), (A ‚à™ B)(x) = max(A(x),B(x)) for all x ‚àà X. Instead of min and max one can use t-norm and t-conorm, respectively ,Klement, E.P., Mesiar, R., Pap, E. (2000) Triangular Norms. Dordrecht, Kluwer. for example, min(a,b) can be replaced by multiplication ab. A straightforward fuzzification is usually based on min and max operations because in this case more properties of traditional mathematics can be extended to the fuzzy case. A important generalization principle used in fuzzification of algebraic operations is a closure property. Let * be a binary operation on X. The closure property for a fuzzy subset A of X is that for all x,y ‚àà X, A(x*y) ‚â• min(A(x),A(y)). Let (G,*) be a group and A a fuzzy subset of G. Then A is a fuzzy subgroup of G if for all x,y in G, A(x*y‚àí1) ‚â• min(A(x),A(y‚àí1)). A similar generalization principle is used, for example, for fuzzification of the transitivity property. Let R be a fuzzy relation in X, i.e. R is a fuzzy subset of X√óX. Then R is transitive if for all x,y,z in X, R(x,z) ‚â• min(R(x,y),R(y,z)).

In 1984, he delivered a controversial sermon in the LDS Church's general conference which the church redacted before publishing. Biography Poelman was born in Salt Lake City, Utah to a Latter-day Saint family. As a young man, he served as a Mormon missionary in the LDS Church's Netherlands Mission. He began his college studies at what is now California State University, Long Beach and later transferred to the University of Utah completing a degree in history. In 1955 he graduated from the law school at the University of Utah and in 1965 he graduated from Harvard Business School with an MBA degree. Poelman lived in San Francisco, California and was a vice president of Consolidated Freightways. He was a bishop of the LDS Church over the Stanford Ward. Poelman also served in several other callings including in the Palo Alto Stake presidency. In April 1978, Poelman became a member of the church's First Quorum of Seventy. During his time of service, Poelman has served as a counselor to Hugh W. Pinnock in the general presidency of the Sunday School from 1979 to 1981 and from 1985 to 1986. From 1992 to 1994 he again served in the Sunday School General Presidency.2005 Deseret Morning News Church Almanac (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Morning News, 2004) p. 102 In 1998, Poelman was released from active duties and granted general authority emeritus status. Poelman was married to Claire, who was for a time a consultant with Stanford University. After she died, he married Anne G. Osborn, a doctor connected with the University of Utah. At the age of 83, Poelman died of \\"causes incident to aging\\" at his home in Salt Lake City, Utah. Controversial sermon In the October 1984 general conference of the LDS Church, Poelman delivered a sermon entitled \\"The Gospel and the Church\\". Controversy ensued when the version of his sermon that was published in the November 1984 Ensign magazine differed from the sermon Poelman had delivered orally. According to Poelman's brother, after Poelman had delivered his sermon, it had been pointed out to him by apostles that have dealt with apostate, often pro-polygamy, groups that the text of his talk might support these groups' claims that people do not need the LDS Church. In response, Poelman had revised the text of the sermon for publication in the Ensign and re-delivered the edited sermon on film. A \\"cough track\\" was included in the retaping to make it appear that the revised sermon was delivered in front of an audience. The church spliced the retaped sermon into the tapes of general conference prior to their distribution and archival. One commentator has criticised the changes to the sermon as a dramatic shift in the meaning of Poelman's address: > \\"The rewriting and refilming of Elder Ronald Poelman's October 1984 > Conference address, originally a rare and inspiring defense of free agency, > so that it became yet another cry for obedience. His text was not edited ‚Äî > his ideas were turned inside out.\\" Poelman spoke again in general conference after four-and-a-half years. Notes External links *Ronald E. Poelman at Grampa Bill's G.A.

Being military associators, they were not provided soldiers' uniforms, weapons, or pay by the British government, and survived by foraging, robbery, and looting of the battlefields. Company formed British Loyalist Mohawk chief Joseph Brant in a 1776 painting by artist George Romney The initial size of Brant's guerrilla company was approximately 100 men, comprising 20% Mohawk allies of the British, and 80% white, New York Loyalists. The Loyalists were mostly of English, Scottish, and Irish descent recruited from the Province of New York. Although Brant himself received a captain's commission in the Six Nations Indian Department, other members of the group were Loyalist associators (volunteers). They were unpaid by the British, and relied upon plunder‚Äîand sometimes Joseph's credit‚Äîfor their compensation. Eventually, Frederick Haldimand authorized provisioning, but no monetary payments. Since the unit had no official recognition, many members later transferred to Butler's Rangers and the King's Royal Regiment of New York. Later in the war, Brant was able to attract a larger number of Indians to his unit, which grew to over 300 members. Brant's Volunteers were at the 1777 Battle of Oriskany. They fought in 1778 at the Battle of Cobleskill, the Attack on German Flatts, and the Raid on Springfield. In 1779, they were engaged at the Battle of Minisink. Uniforms Joseph Brant's Volunteers usually wore civilian attire. In order to avoid confusion during battle, he had his men wear yellow lace on their hats so they could be easily identified as British Loyalists. Brant's men, on at least one occasion, dressed as Indians to disguise themselves while raiding their former Patriot neighbors.Text: \\"Colonel Alden's Report To General, Stark; Head Quarters, Cherey Valley Aug'st 12th 1778.

This term is generally used to refer to sponsored content on blogs, wikis, forums, social networking web sites and individual web sites. This sponsored content is also known as sponsored posts, paid posts or sponsored reviews. The content includes links that point to the home page or specific product pages of the website of the sponsor. Examples include Diet Coke and Mentos videos, the I've Got a Crush On Obama video, and Star Wars fan films. Companies that have employed consumer-generated ads include Subaru North America, McDonald's, Rose Parade and Toyota North America. The practice of consumer-generated marketing has been in use for several years with the emergence of communal forms of information sharing including weblogs, online message boards, podcasts, interactive broadband TV, and other new media that has been adopted by consumers at the grass roots level to establish community forums for discussing their customer experiences. Consumer-generated marketing is not the same as viral marketing or word of mouth advertising, however, the result of it achieves a high level of publicity within high relevance communities. These communities are extremely critical to the success of a brand, and normally follow the 80/20 rule, where 20% of the brand's customers account for 80% of its sales. The very act of reaching out to consumers to invite them in as co- collaborators and co-creatives, is a fundamental component of the marketing campaign. The construct naturally lends itself to other consumer-marketing activities, like \\"communal branding\\" and \\"communal research.\\" Sponsored posts Sponsored posts have been defined as the promoted entries or posts which contain links that point to a webpage or specific product pages of the website of the sponsor for which the creator of the content receives compensation in the form of money, products, services or in other ways.Mutum, D. S. & Ghazali, E. (2014). Personal Blog Marketing. In Ali Ghorbani (Ed) Marketing in the Cyber Era: Strategies and Emerging Trends As opposed to the graphical ads (in the form of banners or buttons), which have been around on websites for quite some time, the sponsored content may be in the form of feedback, reviews, opinion, videos or other content. Forrester Research uses the term sponsored conversation which refers to sponsored conversation which involves payment to bloggers and other consumers who generate the advertising, to create transparent and genuine content about the brand. Communal marketing Communal marketing refers to a marketing practice that incorporates public involvement in the development of an advertising/marketing campaign. Such a campaign invites consumers to share their ideas or express their articulation of what the brand means to them through their own personal stories, with the use of print media, film or audio. The resulting consumer- generated content is then incorporated into the campaign. Finally, the result of this collaboration is showcased, often in a cross-media campaign, to invite the extended community of like-minded individuals to share in the results, thereby creating a communal bond between the \\"brand champions as advertisers\\" and other individuals who have a natural affinity with what the brand has to offer. The result provides the brand with a way to create a deeper connection with their core market, while also opening up new pathways to extend the relationship to new customers. Anytime a brand reaches out to its audience to invite them in to become co-collaborators in the development of an advertising campaign, they are participating in a \\"communal branding\\" effort. Whenever marketing decisions are the result of communing with the brand's audience to help drive the development of a campaign, they are engaging in \\"communal research.\\" For example, Peter Jackson, in the making of The Lord of the Rings, reached out to loyal followers of the book to help weigh in on some major directorial decisions. Customer rewards Joel Moss Levinson won 11 consumer generated marketing contests, and earned more than $200,000 in money and prizes, by creating corporate jingles and short commercials. Customer Loyalty Customer Loyalty can be defined as the outcome of consistently positive emotional experience, physical attribute-based satisfaction and perceived value of an experience, that also includes products or services. Customer loyalty can also be related to customer experience management as it blends the physical, emotional and value elements of an experience into one unified experience. Maintaining faithful customer costs a company less money than acquiring new ones. Customer experience management is one of the most cost- effective way to drive customer satisfaction, customer retention and customer loyalty. Customer loyalty is important to a business because loyal customers generally ensure sales and is more likely to purchase high-margin supplemental products and services. Loyal customers also help organizations reduce costs linked with consumer education and marketing, especially when the loyal customers become the company's net promoters. Customer experience programs are one of the most effective way to differentiate an organization from its competitors. This level of differentiation effectively drives customer loyalty when customers are involved on an emotional, intellectual or spiritual level. Customer loyalty schemes are an effective way to improve an organization's customer retention levels and profitability. To build a loyal clientele, organizations need to recognize and reward their best customers. Loyalty schemes can be used by companies to incentivise and satisfy valued customers which in turn can help businesses improve their customer base and also their profitability. An organization's loyalty programs allows them to focus on loyal customers and improve satisfaction levels. Faithful customers tend to purchase more products and are often willing to pay more than the usual price, which in turn can boost an organization's cash flow. Increased loyalty from customers also extends the time that they place their business with the company, meaning they will stick to the business more often and in an extended period. Customer loyalty schemes also help companies improve their triple bottom line through the data collected during the course of the customer loyalty schemes. It also helps companies to identify customer behaviour and focus on them to come up with strategies that may help organizations reward their loyal customers. Customer loyalty schemes can also be used to gain back the attention of customers who are turning away from the business. The data generated by a loyalty scheme can offer other helpful information. It can help point out defection patterns from customers and also to help organizations improve their product range and stock selection.

MT-RNR1, or RRNS, is one of the two mitochondrial ribosomal RNA genes (blue boxes). Mitochondrially encoded 12S ribosomal RNA (often abbreviated as 12S or 12S rRNA), also known as Mitochondrial-derived peptide MOTS-c or Mitochondrial open reading frame of the 12S rRNA-c is a component of the small subunit (SSU) of the mitochondrial ribosome. In humans, 12S is encoded by the MT-RNR1 gene and is 959 nucleotides long. MT-RNR1 is one of the 37 genes contained in animal mitochondria genomes. Their 2 rRNA, 22 tRNA and 13 mRNA genes are very useful in phylogenetic studies, in particular the 12S and 16S rRNAs. The 12S rRNA is the mitochondrial homologue of the prokaryotic 16S and eukaryotic nuclear 18S ribosomal RNAs. Mutations in the MT-RNR1 gene may be associated with hearing loss.  Structure  The MT-RNR1 gene is located on the p arm of the mitochondrial DNA at position 12 and it spans 953 base pairs.  Function  The MT-RNR1 gene encodes for a protein responsible for regulating insulin sensitivity and metabolic homeostasis. The protein acts as an inhibitor of the folate cycle, thereby reducing de novo purine biosynthesis which leads to the accumulation of the de novo purine synthesis intermediate 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide (AICAR) and the activation of the metabolic regulator 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The protein also protects against age-dependent and diet-induced insulin resistance as well as diet- induced obesity.  Clinical significance  = Nonsyndromic Hearing Loss and Deafness, Mitochondrial = Pathogenic mutations in the MT-RNR1 gene have been found to cause late-onset Mitochondrial Nonsyndromic Hearing Loss and Deafness with predisposed aminoglycoside ototoxicities. Nonsyndromic Deafness is characterized by a partial or total sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) of variable onset and severity that is not associated with other signs and symptoms. Most forms of nonsyndromic deafness are associated with permanent hearing loss caused by damage to structures in the inner ear. Mutations of 1494C>T, 1555A>G, and 1095T>C in the MT-RNR1 gene have been identified to cause the hearing loss. = Complex IV Deficiency = MT-RNR1 mutations have been associated with complex IV deficiency of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, also known as the cytochrome c oxidase deficiency. Cytochrome c oxidase deficiency is a rare genetic condition that can affect multiple parts of the body, including skeletal muscles, the heart, the brain, or the liver. Common clinical manifestations include myopathy, hypotonia, and encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A 9952G>A mutation was found in a patient with the deficiency.

The insecticides not only represent an environmental threat, but are a significant expenditure to poor rice farmers. The Bangladesh Rice Research Institute is working with various NGOs and international organisations to reduce insecticide use in rice. Wheat is not a traditional crop in Bangladesh, and in the late 1980s little was consumed in rural areas. During the 1960s and early 1970s, however, it was the only commodity for which local consumption increased because external food aid was most often provided in the form of wheat. In the first half of the 1980s, domestic wheat production rose to more than 1 million tons per year but was still only 7 to 9 percent of total food grain production. Record production of nearly 1.5 million tons was achieved in FY 1985, but the following year saw a decrease to just over 1 million tons. About half the wheat is grown on irrigated land. The proportion of land devoted to wheat remained essentially unchanged between 1980 and 1986, at a little less than 6 percent of total planted area. Wheat also accounts for the great bulk of imported food grains, exceeding 1 million tons annually and going higher than 1.8 million tons in FY 1984, FY 1985, and FY 1987. The great bulk of the imported wheat is financed under aid programs of the United States, the European Economic Community, and the World Food Programme. Food grains are cultivated primarily for subsistence. Only a small percentage of total production makes its way into commercial channels. Other Bangladeshi food crops, however, are grown chiefly for the domestic market. They include potatoes and sweet potatoes, with a combined record production of 1.9 million tons in FY 1984; oilseeds, with an annual average production of 250,000 tons; and fruits such as bananas, jackfruit, mangoes, and pineapples. Estimates of sugarcane production put annual production at more than 7 million tons per year, most of it processed into a coarse, unrefined sugar known as gur, and sold domestically.

The company was based in Springfield, Massachusetts, USA. Its main areas of focus were milling machines and grinding machines. Early history An advertisement from 1902. A pair of brothers surnamed Van Norman were the founders of the company. Their names were Charles E. and Fred D. Van Norman.. The Van Normans began their company as the Hopkins Watch Tool Company in Waltham, Massachusetts around 1874.. Their first products were watch repair lathes and associated tooling. In 1883, they bought the name Waltham Watch Tool Company, as that company started watch production under the name of U.S. Watch Co. It was at that time that the move was made to Springfield. In 1890 the first Van Norman Milling Machine was built, and in 1914 the first of Van Norman's oscillating grinding machines was introduced. Oscillating grinders were sold to many of the world's leading manufacturers of ball and roller bearings.  Ram type mills  Van Norman was most noted for their \\"ram type\\" milling machines, which due to their swiveling head design could be converted quickly and easily from horizontal to vertical spindles. The ram type mills were produced for many years and in a wide range of sizes, from the home-shop- sized No. 6 up to the 9,000 pound No. 38. The company also produced heavy horizontal milling machines, as well as a small vertical milling machine for tool and die work. #12 with head in horizontal position #12 with head in vertical position  Other tools  In addition to milling machines, Van Norman pursued several other machining-related lines of business. ;Automotive repair Van Norman pioneered a portable boring bar that could be used to bore the cylinders of automobile engines without removing the engine from the automobile. They also manufactured other automotive service machinery, such as brake lathes and crankshaft grinders. When Van Norman ceased to exist as an independent company, the automotive portion was purchased by Kwik-Way, who still sell tools and machinery using the Van Norman name. ;Machine tools for grinding Van Norman's line of grinding machines became very important in the bearing industry. Oscillating grinders were sold to many of the world's leading manufacturers of ball and roller bearings. Van Norman sold its precision external centerless grinder line to Bryant in 1972.  Spindle tooling  In keeping with many manufacturers of the era, some Van Norman machines use a proprietary spindle taper. The No. 6, No. 12, and some of the No. 16 ram type mills use what Van Norman referred to as their \\"C\\" taper (Hardinge refers to this taper as 5V today). This taper was also used in some of Van Norman's smaller dividing heads and auxiliary milling subheads. Some of the larger machines use Van Norman's \\"No. 2\\" taper (Hardinge 50V), and some of the larger dividing heads and milling subheads use this taper as well. Larger machines used an assortment of tapers‚Äîearlier mills will most likely have either some size of Brown & Sharpe taper or Van Norman's \\"No. 2\\" taper. Later mills usually have NMTB milling machine tapers (30, 40, or 50, depending on machine size). It is probable that any machine could be ordered new with any taper the buyer desired.

After 1086 it belonged to Durand, the Sheriff, and was worth ten shillings. Buildings Saint Mary's church is in the Norman and Early English styles and has a large tower which contained three bells. This older church had outlived the chapel which was demolished in 1800. In the churchyard is a war memorial that unusually is shaped like a lantern. The inscription reads: A thank offering to Almighty God \\"At evening time it shall be light \\" for the safe return of all the men from this parish who fought in the Great War 1914 - 1918 and 1939 - 1945Middleon site on demon accessed 8 November 2007 In 1874 a school was erected at a cost of ¬£210 that could cater for 42 children.

Frederick Ouseley was the musical prodigy son of Sir Gore Ouseley, the diplomat who served in Persia, Russia and India.Gore-Ouseley at Iranica.com accessed 12 September 2007 The church is a magnificent structure of stone, in the Middle Pointed style of architecture, and was consecrated on the 29 September 1856. There is beautiful stained glass in the east and west windows in particular, which represents figures of angels and the Crucifixion. The font is placed in a complete baptistery well of water, and there were only two of its kind when it was installed. The organ, a remarkable instrument that has 64 stops and four manuals, with many other novel and effective features, was installed under the direction of the Rev. Sir Frederick A. Gore Ouseley, Bart., M.A., Mus. Doc., professor of Music in the University of Oxford, and precentor of Hereford cathedral. Population The village is now primarily home to commuters. Its population in 1861 was 445 and in 1871, 382. In the United Kingdom Census 2001 the Middleton on the Hill ward headcount was recorded as 244. Local radio The village is covered by Wyvern FM on 96.7 FM (owned by GCap Media) and 96.4 BRMB (owned by GCap Media, and Sunshine 855, as well as BBC Hereford and Worcester.

History The first book to come off the press was about murdered Tyneside gangland figure Viv Graham and was written by investigative author Stephen Richards. Mirage was the first publisher to take a chance on publishing a book of poems, Birdman Opens His Mind () by UK prisoner Charles Bronson. This was followed up by Bronson's autobiography Silent Scream (), which depicted the anachronistic penal system in the UK. Further books by Bronson and his then co-author and business manager Stephen Richards followed, including the book Solitary Fitness (), detailing an individual training process with minimal resources and space. Considered by The Times newspaper to be an \\"obscure publishing company from Tyneside\\", Mirage Publishing went from strength to strength when it published the authorised biography of rock star Sting, A Sting in the Tale (), which was written by long-time friend of Sting, James Berryman. The book became Night & Day magazine's book of the week, as well as being serialised in a UK tabloid. Numerous books from Mirage Publishing have since been serialised by the UK press and magazines. The biggest accolade to be achieved by Mirage Publishing was to see its book Burnt (), by Scottish author Ian Colquhoun, being held aloft by Richard Madeley on Richard & Judy on UK TV. Mirage, in a change of publishing genres, has moved away from true crime book publishing, citing the increase in violence for doing so. Mirage Publishing now solely concentrate on publishing mind, body and spirit, self-help, how-to guides and biographies.

FBN1 is a 230-kb gene with 65 coding exons that encode a 2,871-amino-acid long proprotein called profibrillin which is proteolytically cleaved near its C-terminus by the enzyme furin convertase to give fibrillin-1, a member of the fibrillin family, and the 140-amino-acid long protein hormone asprosin. Fibrillin-1 is a large, extracellular matrix glycoprotein that serves as a structural component of 10-12 nm calcium-binding microfibrils. These microfibrils provide force bearing structural support in elastic and nonelastic connective tissue throughout the body.  Structure  The sequence of fibrillin-1 includes 47 six-cysteine EGF-like domains, 7 eight-cysteine domains homologous with latent TGF-beta binding protein, and a proline-rich region.  Fetal cardiovascular development  The FBN-1 gene is involved in a variety of embryonic developmental programs. The microfibrils that are made from fibrillin-1 contribute to both elastic and non-elastic structures. The formation of the elastic fibers in the heart valves and the aorta require the involvement of both FBN-1 and FBN-2. It has been shown that both FBN-1 and FBN-2, along with the other components of elastic fibers, are expressed in the embryonic semilunar valves as early as 4 weeks of gestation. These molecules interact to form the elastic fibers in the ventricularis layer of the semilunar valves. Fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 are also crucial for the development of elastic fibers in the aorta. While expression of fibrillin-2 decreases significantly after fetal development, the expression of fibrillin-1 continues into adulthood. This supports the idea that fibrilin-2 dictates the development of early elastic fibers, while fibrillin-1 provides the structural support of mature elastic fibers. When mutations in the FBN-1 or FBN-2 genes occur, significant deformations can result from the damage to the extracellular matrix. Marfan Syndrome is a congenital disease that arises from a mutation in the FBN-1 gene. This leads to the malformation and subsequent weakening of the microfibrils in the patient‚Äôs body, including the structures of the cardiovascular system. The weakened elastic fibers will result in an impaired durability and distensibility in the heart valves and aorta. This provides the explanation for the aortic aneurysms and prolapsed valves that are commonly associated with Marfan Syndrome. Marfan Syndrome Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant disorder that affects the connective tissues of bodily systems such as the eyes, cardiovascular system, skeletal system, skin, pulmonary system and the dura. MFS affects approximately 1 in 5,000 individuals. MFS is not an easily diagnosed pathology with a scoring system called the Ghent nosology table used, rather than a single molecule test. To diagnose MFS individuals that have no previous family history, two criteria must be met. Firstly, two different major organ systems must be affected, and secondly, a third organ system must be involved. MFS usually occurs from ‚Äò‚ÄôDe Novo‚Äô‚Äômutations and results in the individual phenotypically displaying long and thin limbs and extremities, curved spines usually resulting in thoracic scoliosis, hyperflexible joints, pectus excavatum, retinal detachment and sunken chests. ‚Äò‚ÄôDe Novo‚Äô‚Äô mutations resulting in severe MFS have high expected mortality rates for neonates. Classical MFS symptoms usually become noticeable during puberty or later in life; rarely does it develop in the earlier stages of life. The most common skin manifestation of MFS is striae distensae where bands of skin are coloured red, purple and then white. The skin epidermis is thin and flattened, and the upper protective skin layer is decreased in thickness. This manifestation is characterised histologically by straight, thin collagen bundles arranged in a parallel to the skin and the elastic fibres. Elastic fibres are denser in the upper dermis, and beneath this zone there is a localised absence of the elastic fibres. Between the borders of the striae and skin, there are curled, broken, reticular elastic fibres sometimes present. These symptoms are responsible for cobweblike skin appearances in patients with MFS. Management of MFS is to operate on the individual through open heart surgery. Management of MFS includes standard implications such as counselling on lifestyle to reduce and restrict physical activity, endo prophylaxis, serial imaging the aorta, √ü-blocker medication for aortic protection and prophylactic replacement of the aortic root. In MFS affected adults, it is recommended they reduce emotional and physical stress and switch from high impact sports such as martial arts, football, basketball etc to isotonic, low impact exercise such as swimming, biking or jogging where the pulse rate lies approximately at <110 beats per minute. Children should also follow similar guidelines to ensure correct management of MFS. MFS is caused by a mutation in the ‚Äò‚ÄôFBN1‚Äô‚Äô gene positioned at chromosome 15q21.1 resulting in a deconstructed form of Fibrillin-1. Fibrillin-1 is a 350-kDa, 2871-amino acid cystine-rich glycoprotein that is responsible for the amalgamation of elastin into the elastic fibres of the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix (ECM). The fragility of the connective tissue usually results in aortic aneurysms due to the wall having the inability to withstand intraluminal pressure. Defects in fibrillin-1 results in elevated TGF-√ü levels that directly correlate to MFS. Role of TGF-√ü in the expressions of Marfan Syndrome TGF-√ü is a paracrine regulatory protein responsible for embryonic processing, cell growth, apoptosis induction, and enhances collagen production and ECM remodelling. In a non-MFS affected individual, the TGF-√ü protein is secreted from the cell to stimulate PAI-1 production and Smad2 phosphorylation. The TGF-√ü protein binds with latency associated protein (LAP) at the N-terminal propertied and one of three latent TGF-√ü binding proteins (LTBP1, 3 or 4) to form a small latent complex (SLC). SLC then binds extracellularly to latent TGF-√ü binding protein (LTBP) forming a large latent complex (LLC), which includes an active cytokine. The LLC attaches to the microfibrils of Fibrillin-1 via LTBP, allowing the preservation of inactive TGF-√ü [6]. TGF-√ü can only be activated through a series of regulated mechanisms; maintaining correct functioning in embryonic development. Mutations in Fibrillin-1 cause elevated levels of TGF-√ü in the EC space due to LLC being unable to attach to the microfibrils and latent forms not being produced. TGF-√ü forms a complex with its dimer receptors, to initiate a phosphorylation cascade. This phosphorylation can cause failures such as an aortic aneurysm and prolapsed valves. Clinical symptoms of MFS such as aortic root dilation, pulmonary emphysema, atrioventricular valve changes and skeletal muscle myopathy are induced by altered TGF-√ü activation and signalling. Aortic specific symptoms are closely related to excessive TGF-√ü signalling in the aortic root wall. TGF-√ü antagonism via systemic administration of TGF-√ü neutralising antibody (NAb) averted the development of aortic pathologies associated with MDS, more specifically changes in the aortic wall and progressive aortic dilation. Antagonism of TGF-√ü also further reduced MFS symptoms where it helped muscle regeneration, architecture and strength, pulmonary alveolar septation and mitral valve morphology. LLC that fails to be removed from the ECM is more vulnerable to be activated in a protease-dependent or independent manner. MMP2 and MMP9 are select TGF-√ü activators and ligands and are found in higher levels in the tissues of patients affected with MFS. TGF-√ü in its complex and free-form can leach into the circulation due to the mutated ECM sequestration and increased LLC activation. Mutations in the ‚Äò‚ÄôFBN1‚Äô‚Äô gene ‚Äò‚ÄôFBN-1‚Äô‚Äô is a gene approximately 200kb and is made up of a large coding sequence divided into 65 exons located on chromosome 15. This gene encodes for Fibrillin-1 protein. Fibrillin-1 is a large cysteine rich-glycoprotein approximately 350 kDa mainly composed of tandemly repeating domains of epidermal growth factor (ECF)-like modules. These domains are homologous to calcium binding epidermal growth factor module (cbEGF-like motifs) and of distinct 8-cysteine modules to make up elastic and non-elastic tissue. These elastic and non-elastic tissues are microfibrillar bundles, heteropolymers of both Fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2. Elastogenesis is a biological process where microfibrils and elastic fibres are self-assembled via organised deposition by several macromolecules. Polymerised fibrillins can be characterised by their ‚Äòbeads- on-a-string‚Äô microfibril structure; giving rise to a microfibril lattice via lateral communication of the individual polymers and structural components. Fibrillin-1 mutations are the main mutated protein causing MFS. This mutation usually interferes with the assembly of microfibrils resulting in a dominant- negative mechanism Mutations can include: # Missense mutations caused by single base substitutions such as cysteine or those associated with calcium binding in Fibrillin-1. # Premature terminations caused by nonsense mutations or frameshifts. # Mutations within the exonic splice site allowing for insertions or deletions due to creations of cryptic splice sites. # Intronic splice site base changes leading to alternative splicing and in-frame exon skipping or deletion. The combination of the four types of mutations results in Fibrillin-1 being expressed incorrectly. There is no correlation between phenotype and genotype at a molecular level The mutations of the FBN-1 gene at six chromosomal loci, TAAD1 at 5q13-14, FAA1 at 11q23-24, TAAD2 at 3p24-25, TAAD3 at 15q24-26, TAAD4 at 10q23-24 and MYH11 at 16p12-13 are known to be triggers of MFS. These loci tend to have genes that are involved in vascular function. The MYH11 gene is responsible for the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain and ACTA2 at TAAD4 loci encodes for smooth muscle alpha-actin. A nonsynonymous amino acid change affecting conserved cysteine of the CaB-EGF- like domain encoded by exon 13 of the FBN1 gene can cause MFS to develop. Higher frequency and severity of MFS occurs when there are incorrect substitutions at the C1-C2 or C3-C4 disulphide bonds, therefore, correct cysteine localisation and disulphide bonding at these loci are critical to structural integrity. Mutations in the FBN1 gene resulting in incorrect bonding at the C5-C6 disulphide bond generally results in MFS of lesser severity. Concentrated mutations of the CaB-EGF domain along the FBN1 polypeptide affects MFS severity phenotype. Localised substitution mutations of the cysteine substitution at C538P on exon 13, C570R on exon 14 or C587Y on exon 15 result in MFS symptoms related to the eyes, specifically ectopia lentis. Microfibrils themselves can support the hemodynamic load in the circulatory systems of invertebrates and lesser vertebrates. Elastin and the development of the ECM system integrated with surrounding VSMC are needed for higher vertebrates to function correctly. Fibrillin-1 is not essential in the stabilisation of the elastic unit but instead in the assembly of the microfibril. Up-regulation of activin A works in conjunction with Fibrillin-1 and TGF-√ü signalling molecules to produce a fibroproliferative response. CYR61 induction also functions to support cell adhesion and regulate matrix remodelling and is fundamental in the formation of large vessels and their integrity.  Clinical significance  Mutations in the FBN1 gene are associated with Marfan syndrome and its variant Marfanoid‚Äìprogeroid‚Äìlipodystrophy syndrome, autosomal dominant Weill- Marchesani syndrome, isolated ectopia lentis, MASS phenotype, and Shprintzen- Goldberg syndrome. Mutations in FBN1 and FBN2 are associated with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Clinical symptoms of MFS such as aortic root dilation, pulmonary emphysema, atrioventricular valve changes and skeletal muscle myopathy are induced by altered TGF-√ü activation and signalling. Aortic specific symptoms are closely related to excessive TGF-√ü signalling in the aortic root wall. TGF-√ü antagonism via systemic administration of TGF-√ü neutralising antibody (NAb) averted the development of aortic pathologies associated with MDS, more specifically changes in the aortic wall and progressive aortic dilation. Antagonism of TGF-√ü also further reduced MFS symptoms where it helped muscle regeneration, architecture and strength, pulmonary alveolar septation and mitral valve morphology. =Losartan= Losartan is an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blocker known to antagonise TGF-√ü signalling via inhibiting the expression and activation of TGF-√ü. Losartan can work independently or with √ü-blocker therapy to reduce rate of change in the aortic root diameter of MFS pathology.

It is a subsidiary of Stagecoach. History In 1927, Stratford-on-Avon Motor Services commenced operating a service between Stratford-on-Avon and Royal Leamington Spa. In June 1935, Midland Red purchased Stratford Blue but continued to operate under its own identity until January 1971 when the National Bus Company integrated the Stratford Blue operation into Midland Red.Midland Red History MidlandRed.net In September 1981, Midland Red South was formed with 163 buses operating from five depots in Buckinghamshire, Northamptonshire, Oxfordshire and Warwickshire. In December 1987, Midland Red South was sold in a management buyout to Western Travel Group,Companies House extract company no 2041677 Stagecoach West Limited formerly Western Travel Limited which also owned Cheltenham & Gloucester Omnibus. During Western Travel ownership, Midland Red South opened a garage in Coventry, and also revived the Statford Blue name. In 1993, Western Travel was sold to Stagecoach who re-branded part of it as Stagecoach Midland Red. It set about simplifying the routes and improving the profitability of the operation, which included the closure of the depots in Coventry and Stratford in 1999. Upon national re-branding in 2000, Stagecoach Midland Red became Stagecoach in Warwickshire for operations from Leamington, Nuneaton and Rugby and Stagecoach in Banbury for operations in Banbury. For a long time Midland Red shared a management team with Stagecoach Oxford, but this was split in July 2002 with the Banbury operations becoming part of Stagecoach in Oxfordshire. Meanwhile, Guide Friday, an operator of sight- seeing tours in Stratford had established a small number of local and tendered bus services in the town following Stagecoach's departure. This company was eventually purchased by Ensignbus, who rebranded the Stratford services by once again reviving the Stratford Blue fleetname. In February 2007, Stagecoach purchased the Stratford operation from Ensignbus, once again giving them a depot in the town. On 12 November 2007, Stagecoach in Warwickshire introduced the second Stagecoach Goldline service in the UK, on route 66 (renumbered G1) between South Farm, Leamington Spa and Warwick, using Optare Solos. The 'Unibus' brand is used for services operating predominantly between Leamington Spa and the University of Warwick, mainly direct via the A46, although variations exist at weekends. In 2010 - Stagecoach in Warwickshire merged with Stagecoach East and Stagecoach in Northants to create Stagecoach Midlands.

The Atlantic Ocean is to the left. The history of Lisbon, the capital city of Portugal, revolves around its strategic geographical position at the mouth of the Tagus, the longest river in the Iberian Peninsula. Its spacious and sheltered natural harbour made the city historically an important seaport for trade between the Mediterranean Sea and northern Europe. Lisbon has long enjoyed the commercial advantages of its proximity to southern and extreme western Europe, as well as to sub-Saharan Africa and the Americas, and today its waterfront is lined with miles of docks, wharfs, and drydock facilities that accommodate the largest oil tankers. During the Neolithic period, pre-Celtic peoples inhabited the region; remains of their stone monuments still exist today in the periphery of the city. Lisbon is one of the oldest cities in western Europe, with a history that stretches back to its original settlement by the indigenous Iberians, the Celts, and the eventual establishment of Phoenician and Greek trading posts (c. 800‚Äì600 BC), followed by successive occupations in the city of various peoples including the Carthaginians, Romans, Suebi, Visigoths, and Moors. Roman armies first entered the Iberian peninsula in 219 BC, and occupied the Lusitanian city of Olissipo (Lisbon) in 205 BC, after winning the Second Punic War against the Carthaginians. With the collapse of the Roman Empire, waves of Germanic tribes invaded the peninsula, and by 500 AD, the Visigothic Kingdom controlled most of Hispania. In 711, Islamic Moors, who were mostly Berbers and Arabs from the Maghreb, invaded the Christian Iberian Peninsula, conquering Lisbon in 714. What is now Portugal first became part of the Emirate of C√≥rdoba and then of its successor state, the Caliphate of C√≥rdoba. Despite attempts to seize it by the Normans in 844 and by Alfonso VI in 1093, Lisbon remained a Muslim possession. In 1147, after a four-month siege, Christian crusaders under the command of Afonso I captured the city and Christian rule returned. In 1256, Afonso III moved his capital from Coimbra to Lisbon, taking advantage of the city's excellent port and its strategic central position. Lisbon flourished in the 15th and 16th centuries as the centre of a vast empire during the period of the Portuguese discoveries, This was a time of intensive maritime exploration, when the Kingdom of Portugal accumulated great wealth and power through its colonisation of Asia, South America, Africa and the Atlantic islands. Evidence of the city's wealth can still be seen today in the magnificent structures built then, including the Jer√≥nimos Monastery and the nearby Tower of Bel√©m, each classified a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. Panoramic view of Lisbon, showing the Castle hill and the Cathedral The 1755 Lisbon earthquake, in combination with subsequent fires and a tsunami, almost totally destroyed Lisbon and adjoining areas. Sebasti√£o Jos√© de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal, took the lead in ordering the rebuilding of the city, and was responsible for the creation of the elegant financial and commercial district of the Baixa Pombalina (Pombaline Lower Town). During the Peninsular War, (1807‚Äì1814) Napoleon's forces began a four-year occupation of the city in December 1807, and Lisbon descended with the rest of the country into anarchy. After the war ended in 1814, a new constitution was proclaimed and Brazil was granted independence. The 20th century brought political upheaval to Lisbon and the nation as a whole. In 1908, at the height of the turbulent period of the Republican movement, King Carlos and his heir Lu√≠s Filipe were assassinated in the Terreiro do Pa√ßo. On 5 October 1910, the Republicans organised a coup d'√©tat that overthrew the constitutional monarchy and established the Portuguese Republic. There were 45 changes of government from 1910 through 1926. The right-wing Estado Novo regime, which ruled the country from 1926 to 1974, suppressed civil liberties and political freedom in the longest-lived dictatorship in Western Europe. It was finally deposed by the Carnation Revolution (Revolu√ß√£o dos Cravos), launched in Lisbon with a military coup on 25 April 1974. The movement was joined by a popular campaign of civil resistance, leading to the fall of the Estado Novo, the restoration of democracy, and the withdrawal of Portugal from its African colonies and East Timor. Following the revolution, there was a huge influx into Lisbon of refugees from the former African colonies in 1974 and 1975. Portugal joined the European Community (EC) in 1986, and subsequently received massive funding to spur redevelopment. Lisbon's local infrastructure was improved with new investment and its container port became the largest on the Atlantic coast. The city was in the limelight as the 1994 European City of Culture, as well as host of Expo '98 and the 2004 European Football Championships. The year 2006 saw continuing urban renewal projects throughout the city, ranging from the restoration of the Pra√ßa de Touros (Lisbon's bullring) and its re-opening as a multi-event venue, to improvements of the metro system and building rehabilitation in the Alfama. Prehistory to the Neolithic period Lisbon area settlements prior to 1800 BC There are traces of human occupation for many thousands of years in the area of what is now Lisbon. Its terrain was made attractive by the advantages of dwelling near the River Tagus and its estuary. The first human inhabitants were probably the Neanderthals, who gradually became extinct about 30,000 years ago when modern humans entered the Iberian Peninsula. During the Neolithic period, the region was inhabited by an unknown people who lived in farming communities near the coast. Some of the megalithic burial chambers in the region around Lisbon appear to have been built by Mesolithic pastoral-hunting peoples. They built religious monuments called megaliths, dolmens and menhirs that still survive in the periphery of the city. Permanent settlements are not shown in the archaeological record until c. 2500 BC. Antiquity Ancient authors refer to popular legends that the city of Lisbon was founded by the mythical hero Odysseus.. The Estr√≠mnios (in Portuguese) are given by some historians as the first known native people of Portugal. Called Oestrimni (Latin for \\"people of the far west\\") by the Romans, they extended their territory from present-day Galicia to the Algarve during the Late Bronze Age (1100‚Äì700 B.C.). These indigenous communities engaged in maritime and overland commerce, their fortified settlements dominating trade on the larger rivers and coastal estuaries of central southern Portugal. The Indo-European Celts entered the Iberian peninsula in the first millennium BC and gradually spread west to the Atlantic, intermarrying with the native Pre-Indo-European population, and thus giving rise to Celtic-speaking local tribes such as the Cempsi and Sefes or Ophis (\\"People of the Serpents\\"). They colonised the fertile lands of Oestriminis and formed a territory known to the Greeks as Ophiussa (Land of Serpents), stretching from the Douro to the Tagus. Phoenician archaeological dig in the Lisbon Cathedral cloisters Although the first fortifications on Lisbon's Castelo hill are known to be no older than the 2nd century BC, recent archaeological finds have shown that Iron Age people occupied the site from the 8th to 6th centuries BC. This indigenous settlement maintained commercial relations with the Phoenicians, which would account for the recent findings of Phoenician pottery and other material objects. Archaeological excavations made near the Castle of S√£o Jorge (Castelo de S√£o Jorge) and Lisbon Cathedral indicate a Phoenician presence at this location since 1200 BC, and it can be stated with confidence that a Phoenician trading post stood on a site now the centre of the present city, on the southern slope of the Castle hill. The Phoenicians are known to have traded with the resident Oestrimni and related tribes. The harbour of the Mar da Palha (Sea of Straw), a large basin in the estuary of the River Tagus near the river's mouth, is the best natural port on the Atlantic coast of Portugal, stretching 23 km at its widest point. This would have made it an ideal location for a settlement to unload and reprovision Phoenician ships sailing on trade voyages. Legend tells that they sailed to Cornwall in Britain and the legendary Tin Islands, or Cassiterides, to buy tin from the natives, but this is unsubstantiated.Pilkington 2013, p. 89. \\"The only other evidence for tin trading in the 9th‚Äì7th centuries BC is a small set of Phoenician settlements along the Atlantic coast of Iberia. None of these settlements was permanently inhabited and no settlement yields a necropolis. If tin was so central to the economic health of Phoenician colonies in the western Mediterranean, then Phoenician colonies should concentrate in the areas with access to this resource. However, Phoenicians never settled these areas permanently and peacefully abandoned most of their trading stations in modern Portugal during the mid-6th century BC.\\" Iberia before Carthaginian conquests, c. 300 BC The Phoenicians established a trading post at the site, supposedly called Alis Ubbo, meaning \\"Pleasant Haven\\" or \\"Safe Harbour\\" in the Phoenician language. It may have been an outpost of the Tyrian colony at Gadir (C√°diz).Pilkington 2013, p. 160. \\"In modern Portugal, by 700, the Phoenicians had developed some form of seasonal presence at Setubal, Almaraz, Lisbon, and Santarem. Expansion continued throughout the 7th century with foundations at Abul, Santa Olaia, and Cerro de Rocha. It must be noted that none of the sites in Portugal have yet to produce a necropolis, a fact which suggests some dependence on larger colonies in the southern Iberian Peninsula.\\" The indigenous settlement extended from the highest hill in the vicinity, where the Castle and Cathedral now stand, to the Tagus. For centuries, the Phoenicians had cultivated relationships with the indigenous peoples on the Atlantic coast of Iberia. From what was a simple outpost for trade with northern Europe, the Tagus settlement became an important centre of commercial trade where they exchanged their manufactured products for valuable metals, salted fish and salt with the inland tribes of the region accessible by the Tagus. Although Phoenician remains from the 8th century BC have been found beneath the medieval S√© de Lisboa (Lisbon Cathedral), most modern historians believe that Lisbon was founded as an ancient indigenous settlement that maintained commercial relations with the Phoenicians (accounting for the discovery of Phoenician pottery and artefacts at the site). It is possible that the Phocaean Greeks at one time also had a trading station at the mouth of the Tagus, but were eventually driven out as the Phoenician colony of Carthage increasingly dominated maritime commerce in the western Mediterranean and expanded its naval power, with control of localised mercantile relations with Olissipo passing to that city. A multitude of Lusitanian deities, including Aracus, Carneus, and Bandiarbariaicus were worshiped at the city by the original inhabitants of the Turduli settlement. =Olisipo: Roman Lisbon= Roman conquest of Hispania The suffix \\"-ippo\\" (-ipo), present in \\"Olissipo\\" (the Roman name of Lisbon), is typical of Tartessian or Turdetani linguistic influence. Lisbon's name was written Ulyssippo in Latin by the geographer Pomponius Mela, a native of Hispania. It was referred to as \\"Olisippo\\" by Pliny the Elder and by the Greeks as Olissipo (·ΩàŒªŒπœÉœÉŒπœÄœéŒΩ) and Olissipona (·ΩàŒªŒπœÉœÉŒπœÄœåŒΩŒ±). According to local legend, the location was named for the mythical Ulysses, who founded the settlement.Bartrol√≠ 2013, p. 13 Later, the Greek name appeared in Vulgar Latin in the form Olissipona, mentioned in the Etymologies of Saint Isidore of Seville. Recent archaeological finds show that Lisbon grew around a pre-Roman settlement on the hill of the Castelo de S√£o Jorge, as its ancient name, Olissipo, indicates. During the Second Punic War, Mago, the younger brother of Hannibal Barca, was stationed with his troops among the Cynetes, or Conii, in the Algarve, while Hasdrubal Gisco was encamped at the mouth of the Tagus on the Atlantic coast. After the defeat of Hannibal at the Battle of Zama in 202 BC, Rome decided to deprive Carthage of its most valuable possession, Hispania (the name given by the Romans to the whole of the Iberian Peninsula). With the decisive victory of Scipio at the Battle of Ilipa in Spain in 206 BC, the Carthaginian hold in Iberia was broken. Following the defeat of the Carthaginians in eastern Hispania, the pacification of the West was led by Consul Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus. Brutus obtained the alliance of Olissipo by integrating it into the Empire in 138 BC. when the Romans sought to conquer the Lusitanians and other peoples of the northwest Iberian Peninsula. He also fortified the city, building defensive city walls against Lusitanian raids and rebellions. The townspeople fought beside the Roman legions against the Celtic tribes; in return the city became a Municipium Cives Romanorum and was given the name Olisipo Felicitas Julia by either Julius Caesar or Octavian. Local authorities were granted self-rule over a territory that extended 50 kilometres (31 mi), and was integrated within the Roman province of Lusitania, whose capital was Emerita Augusta. The city was granted the Latin Rights (ius Latii), giving its citizens the privileges of Roman citizenship and exempting them from paying taxes. The city population was around 30,000 at the time. Among the majority of Latin speakers lived a large minority of Greek traders and slaves. Earthquakes were documented in 60 BC, several from 47 to 44 BC, several in 33 AD and a strong quake in 382 AD, but the exact amount of damage to the city is unknown. The town was located between the Castle Hill and the Baixa, but most riparian areas were at the time still submerged by the Tagus. Olissipo in Roman times was an important commercial centre, providing a link between the northern countries and the Mediterranean Sea. Its main products were garum, a fish sauce considered a luxury, salt and the Lusitanian horses renowned in antiquity. =Invasions and the Germanic tribes= Visigothic Kingdom After the disintegration of the Roman empire and the subsequent feudalisation of society, the first waves of invaders, including Alans, Germanic tribes, Huns, and others, swept into the peninsula. Initially accepted as settlers in lands depopulated by the terrible epidemics (probably measles and smallpox) that killed much of the population, their incursions soon gave way to military expeditions with the sole object of plunder and conquest. In the early 5th century the Vandals took Olissipo, followed by the Alans. In 419 Olissipo was plundered and burnt by the Visigothic king Walia, who founded the Visigothic kingdom in Spain. Remismund conquered Lisbon in 468 with the help of a Hispano-Roman called Lusidius, and finally in 469 it was integrated into the Suevi kingdom whose capital city was Braga. After the invasion, the Visigoths set up their court in Toledo and following several wars during the 6th century, conquered the Suevi, thus unifying the Iberian Peninsula, including the city they called Ulixbona. During this tumultuous time, Lisbon lost its political links with Constantinople, but not its commercial connections. Merchant Greeks, Syrians, Jews, and others from the East formed communities that exchanged local products with the Byzantine Empire, Asia and India. Middle Ages =Al-UsÃ≤hÃ≤b≈´na: Muslim Lisbon= The visible profile of the Castle of S√£o Jorge overlooking the historical centre of Lisbon After three centuries of looting by invaders and the devastation of its economy, Ulixbona was reduced to little more than a village by the beginning of the 8th century. In 711, taking advantage of a civil war in the Visigothic Kingdom, the Arabs, led by Tariq ibn Ziyad, invaded the Iberian Peninsula with their Moorish troops. Ulixbona, like the rest of the western peninsula, was conquered by the troops of Abdelaziz ibn Musa, a son of Tariq, who took the city in 714. Lisbon, known to the Arabs as \\"al-UsÃ≤hÃ≤b≈´na\\" or al- æI≈°b≈´nah ÿßŸÑÿ£ÿ¥ÿ®ŸàŸÜÿ©, again became a major commercial and administrative centre for the territory along the Tagus, collecting its raw products and exchanging them for goods from the Arabic Mediterranean, particularly Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Syria and Iraq. According to contemporary accounts, the city was one of the largest cities in Europe at the time, several times larger than Paris and London, which then had only 5,000‚Äì10,000 inhabitants each. Most of the Hispano-Roman inhabitants adopted the Arabic language and Islamic religion of the Muslim invaders, who, although a minority among the population, had become the new elite. The members of the Mozarabic Christian population had their own bishop, and were speakers of Arabic, or a variety of Vulgar Latin. Speaking the Mozarabic language, a Romance language similar to that spoken in Galicia and the northern provinces, was tolerated by the Muslim authorities as one of the rights of residence allowed the dhimmi, in exchange for their paying a tax, the jizyah. This Mozarabic community, which followed the heretical Arian Christian rites and customs of the Visigoths, was usually ostracised by Roman Catholics. The Jewish community, which had existed since the city's earliest days, grew more influential as Jews established themselves as merchantsJack 2007, p. 14 and gained the financial advantage of living in the city's rising commercial hub. Besides salt, fish and horses, they traded spices from the Levant, medicinal herbs, dried fruit, honey and furs. The Saqaliba (Arabic:SaqƒÅliba), slaves from Eastern Europe who served as mercenarys, joined the population and also acquired a prominent position in society. The Slavic slave Sabur al-Saqlabi ((Sabur the Slav)) became, during what was later known as the r√©gulo eslavo, ruler of the Taifa of Badajoz. He was the son of Sabur al-Jatib, a Slav who had been in the service of al-Hakam II. His sons Abd al- Aziz ibn Sabur and Abd al-Malik ibn Sabur ruled successively as emirs of the Taifa of Lisbon. Moorish walls, part of the Cerca Moura surrounding the city Al-UsÃ≤hÃ≤b≈´na was renovated and rebuilt in the customary pattern of the Middle Eastern city: high walls (muralhas) surrounding the main buildings, which were a large mosque, a castle at the top of the hill (which in modified form became the Castelo de S√£o Jorge), a medina or urban centre, and an alc√°cer, or fortress-palace for the governor. The Alfama neighbourhood grew next to the original urban core. The citadel of al-Madan, now the city of Almada, was built on the south bank of the Tagus to protect the port. The Arabs and Berbers introduced new methods of irrigated agriculture that were much more productive than the old Roman system of irrigation. The waters of the Tagus and its tributaries were used to irrigate the land in summer, producing several crops a year of vegetables including lettuce and annual crops of oranges. Lisbon became part of the Umayyad Caliphate based in Damascus, Syria, soon after the beginning of Muslim rule in Iberia. An ongoing rebellion (740‚Äì743) of the Berber or \\"Moorish\\" elite against the Umayyads had spread through the Maghreb (North Africa) and across the Strait of Gibraltar to al- Andalus, but needed reinforcements to defeat the caliphate. When the Umayyad dynasty was finally toppled by the Abbasid Revolution in 750, Abd al-Rahman I, an Umayyad prince, fled with his family from the capital in Damascus across North Africa to al-Andalus, and gained independence from the new Abbasid Caliphate. There he established the Umayyad Emirate of C√≥rdoba and Lisbon came under its dominion. With the beginning of the Reconquista, the opulent al- UsÃ≤hÃ≤b≈´na became a target of raids by the Christians, who plundered the city first in 796 and on other occasions in the following years, led by King Alfonso II of Asturias, but the border between Muslim and Christian Iberia remained north of the Douro. In 844 several dozen Viking boats sailed into the Sea of Straw. After a siege of 13 days, the Scandinavians conquered the city and the surrounding territory, but eventually retreated in the face of continued resistance by the townspeople led by their governor, Wahb Allah ibn Hazm. At the beginning of the 10th century, various Islamic sects rose in al- UsÃ≤hÃ≤b≈´na and converted the Hispano-Roman population. These sects were a form of political organization in revolt against the hierarchical system of the Muslim conquerors which institutionalised obstacles to their social mobility. The elite descendants of Muhammad ranked first, then full-blooded Arabs, then Berbers or Moors, and lastly the Arabised Muslims and Hispano-Romans. Several Hispano-Roman leaders emerged, including Ali ibn Ashra and others, who claimed to be prophets or descendants of \`Alƒ´ ibn Abƒ´ ·π¨ƒÅlib, regarded by Shias as the first Imam. With their allies in other cities they started civil wars against the Sunni Arab troops. The Mozarabs and the Jews were treated even worse, sometimes suffering persecution that, although regrettable in modern eyes, was a pale reflection of what the Catholics would do not only against Muslims and Jews, but even against fellow Christians themselves when they reconquered the land. The king of Asturias, Ordonho I, took the city in 851, as did Alfonso VI of Le√≥n in 1093 when al-Mutawakkil of Badajoz surrendered al-UsÃ≤hÃ≤b≈´na, SÃ≤hÃ≤antarƒ´n (Santar√©m), and SÃ≤hÃ≤intra (Sintra) to Alfonso in 1093,Marques 1972, p. 34 but it was soon retaken by the Amoravids in 1094. An unsuccessful new attack by the Vikings followed in 966. With the fragmentation of the Caliphate of C√≥rdoba around the year 1000 as a result of political infighting, the notable leaders of al-UsÃ≤hÃ≤b≈´na oscillated between obedience to the Taifa of Badajoz or to that of Ishbiliya (Seville), and were able to manoeuvre politically to obtain considerable autonomy. This situation lasted a short time until the return of the division of the Taifa brought autonomy and prosperity for al-UsÃ≤hÃ≤b≈´na. In 1111 a new pan-Hispanic Caliphate was established after an Almoravid invasion from the deserts of Morocco led by the caliph Ali ibn Yusuf. His general, Zir ibn Abi Bakr, Yusuf's nephew, forced Lisbon to surrender in 1111 after several unsuccessful attempts, and was later stopped in the region of Tomar by Gualdim Pais, Grand Master of the Order of Knights Templar of Portugal. This new caliphate did not last long, and soon the times of divided taifas and a powerful al-UsÃ≤hÃ≤b≈´na had returned. =Conquest of al-UsÃ≤hÃ≤b≈´na= The Siege of Lisbon in 1147, part of the Reconquista (painted in 1917) Internal dissensions eventually divided the loyalties of the kingdoms in al-Andalus of the 11th century; the collapse of the Caliphate of C√≥rdoba in 1031 led to a period of smaller successor states (taifas), while the Kingdom of Le√≥n lying directly to the north was ceded the county of Portugal. The history of the county is traditionally dated from the reconquest in 868 by V√≠mara Peres of the city of Portucale (Porto), which was the port of Cale, the present Gaia. Although the county had its seat at Guimar√£es, the economic strength that enabled its autonomy was based in Portucale. The isolated Atlantic province, recently centred in Coimbra, separated from the Kingdom of Le√≥n to become the independent Kingdom of Portugal in 1139. It was eventually attached to Lisbon, thus integrating the territories adjoining the entire length of the Tagus. Famed for its opulence, al-UsÃ≤hÃ≤b≈´na's capture would bring the kingdom great prestige. Afonso I and his Christian forces first attempted to conquer the city in 1137 but failed to breach the city walls. In 1140 crusaders passing through Portugal launched another unsuccessful attack. According to the Anglo-Norman chronicler, in June and July 1147 a more numerous force of crusaders, consisting of 164 boatloads of English, Norman, and Rhenish crusaders, left from Dartmouth in England bound for the Holy Land. Bad weather forced the ships to stop on the Portuguese coast at Porto where they were persuaded to join in a new assault on the city. While the Portuguese forces attacked by land, the crusaders, lured by promises of booty to be taken and prisoners to be ransomed, set up their siege engines, among them catapults and towers, and attacked both by sea and land, preventing the arrival of reinforcements from the south. In their first encounters the Muslims killed many Christians; this affected the Crusader's morale, and occasioned several bloody conflicts between the various Christian contingents. Portrait of King Afonso I of Portugal Legend has it that after many previous attempts, the Portuguese knight Martim Moniz led an attack on the castle doors and when he saw the Moors closing them, blocked the doorway with his own body, allowing his companions to enter, and was crushed. With the success of the crusaders' assault on the city's walls with siege engines, the Moors capitulated on 22 October. According to an account by the priest Raol addressed to Osbert of Bawdsley (Osbernus), Germans from Cologne and the Flemish cohort violated their oaths to the king of Portugal after entering the city and plundered it. These crusaders behaved in a wanton manner, looting Muslims and Mozarabs indiscriminately, debauching virgins and even cutting the throat of the elderly Mozarab bishop. Afterwards, an epidemic of the plague killed thousands among the Mozarabic and the Muslim populations. Afonso I officially took possession of the city on 1 November, when the Great Mosque in the Moorish Aljama was dedicated to St. Mary in a religious ceremony converting it to a Cathedral. He appointed Gilberto of Hastings, an English crusader, the first Catholic bishop of the city, and granted lands and titles to many of the most prominent crusaders in the region. After conquering the city, Afonso I received information that the relics of Saint Vincent of Saragossa were buried in the Algarve. He made his way southward to reclaim the martyr's remains. but when he arrived at the village it had been totally destroyed and there was no sign of the burial site. A flock of crows was seen flying over the place when the remains were finally found in 1176, and according to legend, two crows accompanied the boat that was carrying them all the way to Lisbon. In commemoration of this story, the crow was chosen to adorn the city's coat of arms as a symbol of its faithful guardians; but the fearless birds are no longer found in the area. Three years later, in 1150, Afonso I built a cathedral on the site of the Great Mosque, now the S√©.\\"LeguayMarques1993\\" p. 174 The original Christian edifice built on the site had been converted into a mosque by the Moors, but when Afonso took the city, the building was already decrepit. He had the structure rebuilt and enlarged under the name of the first cathedral of Lisbon, Santa Mar√≠a, and all the privileges of M√©rida, the ancient ecclesiastical capital of the former Roman province of Lusitania, passed to the new diocese. =Medieval Christian Lisbon= Lisbon Cathedral is the seat of the Patriarch of Lisbon Afonso I granted Lisbon a Foral in 1179, and tried to restore the city's commercial connections by inaugurating a major new fair or market. Consequently, the Portuguese merchants, Christian and Jewish, not only reestablished some of the old trade links of al-UsÃ≤hÃ≤b≈´na with Seville and C√°diz, and in the Mediterranean with Constantinople, but also opened up new trade routes to the ports of northern Europe that the Muslims rarely visited because of religious differences. Lisbon became a conduit for maritime trade between the North Sea and the Mediterranean, and thanks to advances in navigation, the volume of ocean shipping increased. Portuguese merchants opened trade houses in Seville, Southampton, Bruges, and in the cities of the Hansa, which later joined to form the Hanseatic League. Meanwhile, the Portuguese Jews continued to trade with their relatives in North Africa. They exchanged Portuguese olive oil, salt, wine, cork, honey and wax as well as wool and fine linen textiles, tin, iron, dyes, amber, guns, furs and artisanal works of the north for the spices, silks and herbal remedies of the Mediterranean countries, in addition to the gold, ivory, rice, alum, almonds and sugar bought from the Arabs and Moors. Shipyards were founded to build more commercial and military vessels for the naval fleet (armada) essential to protect this trade from Saracen pirates. Increasing demand for goods by the growing populations of Europe in the 12th and 13th centuries stimulated innovations in the construction of boats, the sturdy but clumsy barge (barca) becoming obsolete when a gradual synthesis of Christian, Viking and Arabic sea-going knowledge led to the development of the caravel (first mentioned in the early 13th century), the first truly seaworthy Atlantic sailing ship. Professions in the maritime industry, such as those of ships-carpenters and sailors, were allowed certain privileges and protections, including the creation in 1242 of a maritime judicial office in Lisbon called the Alcaide do Mar (Alcaide of the Sea). An indirect effect of this economic dynamism was that Lisbon's trade contributed to the ruin of the south German merchants, who engaged in the same commerce by using a more costly land route between the ports of Italy and those of the Netherlands and the Hansa that was only viable when Muslim pirates and their ships controlled southern Spain and the Strait of Gibraltar. As the Holy Roman Empire lost influence over its kingdoms, duchies and city-state constituents, the German merchants, hitherto the masters of European trade, were forced to seek new markets in the East. With the new prosperity and increased security of Lisbon after the final conquest of the al-Gharb or al-Garve (Arabic: al-Gharb, \\"the west\\"), in 1256 Afonso III took note of its obvious advantages and chose the largest and most powerful city in the kingdom for his capital, moving his court, the national archives and the treasury from Coimbra to Lisbon. Denis, the first Portuguese king to rule at Lisbon during all his reign, created the University in 1290, which was transferred to Coimbra in 1308 because of increasing conflicts between the students and Lisbon residents. At this time the area where the Pra√ßa do Com√©rcio (Commerce Square) is today was reclaimed from the sea by draining the already muddy terrain (the river flowed freely until the time of the conquest, but had become clogged due to sediment deposits). New streets were laid out, such as Rua Nova, while the Rossio square became the city centre, stealing that distinction from the Castle hill. Other construction projects initiated by King Denis included a wall to protect the Cais da Ribeira from pirate raids, and reconstruction of the Alc√°√ßova or Moorish Palace (later destroyed in the 1755 earthquake) and the S√©. Just as there were Portuguese communities in the cities of northern Europe, there were colonies of merchants from the rest of Europe in Lisbon, then one of the most important cities in international trade. Not counting the Jewish population (already established as a Portuguese minority), the Genoese were the most numerous expatriate community, followed by those of the Venetians and other Italians, and the Dutch and English. These merchants brought new cartographic and navigational techniques to Portugal, as well as an understanding of financial and banking practices and of the mercantilism system, not to mention the knowledge gained through their contacts with Byzantine and Muslim middlemen of the origins of imported Asian luxury goods such as silks and spices. Political tensions with Castile were counterbalanced by an alliance made in 1308 by King Denis between Portugal and England,Diffie 1960, p. 47 the main trading partner of Lisbon (and also of Porto), which has continued uninterruptedly until the present. This alliance later fought on one of the two sides of the so-called Caroline War; the second phase of the Hundred Years' War, on the other were Castile and France. During Ferdinand's reign, Portugal started a war with Castile, and Lisbon boats armed with cannons were recruited to participate in an unsuccessful Genoese attack on Seville. In response to this provocation, the Spaniards laid siege to Lisbon, taking it in 1373, but departed when they were paid a ransom. It was following this calamity that the Great Fernandine Walls (Grandes Muralhas Fernandinas de Lisboa) of Lisbon were built. On the lower end of the social scale in Lisbon were all types of labourers and street merchants, as well as fishermen and farmers of vegetable gardens. In this era the streets were occupied by tradesmen who had organised artisans' guilds directed by masters of their respective trades. These included: Rua do Ouro (Goldsmiths' Street), Rua da Prata (Silversmiths' Street), Rua dos Fanqueiros (Drapers' Street), Rua dos Sapateiros (Cobblers' Street), Rua dos Retroseiros (Mercers' Street) and Rua dos Correeiros (Saddlers' Street). Such corporations were formed for social protection and to educate apprentices, and were employed to enforce a system of price controls for the benefit of their members. The aristocracy, attracted to Lisbon by the court, established its presence in the city with the building of large palaces, and served in the bureaucratic offices of governmental administration. But the most powerful segment of society in Lisbon, even after the city gained its status as the nation's capital, was the bourgeoisie, the merchant class that was the economic powerhouse of this rising commercial centre, now among the most important in Europe. They were the magnates of commerce who controlled the city and its oligarchic council. It was to serve their needs that business professionals organised in the city: bankers to raise capital and coordinate the financial risks; lawyers to protect the rights of citizens and handle their legal cases; naval architects and marine engineers to build boats, and scientists to design their navigational instruments. With their political influence, they could extract from the monarchy concessions that favored their mercantile interests, and were a great impetus for exploration to find new markets. A mutual benefit association, the Companhia das Naus, was founded in 1380 as a kind of insurance company which required the payment of compulsory quotas from all ship owners in exchange for the sharing of losses after shipwrecks. As an umbrella organisation covering more than five hundred large vessels owned by the magnates of the city, it was the forerunner of Portuguese overseas expansion. With rising profits, the wealthiest merchants acquired titles of nobility, even as the poorer nobles engaged in trade. Minorities in the city included Sephardic Jews and Muslims (not only the Moors but also Arabs and Islamised Arabic-speaking Latinos). There was a large Jewish quarter occupying the parishes of St. Mary Magdalene, St. Julian and St. Nicholas along the Rua Nova dos Mercadores, where the Great Synagogue was located. The Jews (perhaps 10% of the population, or even more) were great traders, who took full advantage of connections to their coreligionists throughout Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. Those who did not engage in trade were largely scholars or professionals such as doctors, lawyers, cartographers and other specialists in the sciences or arts. The Jewish community's business activities were fundamental to the vitality of the city's economy. The Jews of Lisbon included such distinguished families as the Abravanels, descendants of Samuel Abravanel, a converso who had served as royal treasurer in Andalusia and comptroller in Castile. He apparently fled to Portugal with his family where they reverted to Judaism and later served in high governmental positions. No matter how eminent a social position individual Jews of Lisbon might attain, however, they were always the first victims of popular revolts. Their living quarters were segregated from those of the rest of the population and they were forbidden to go out at night; as well as being forced to wear distinctive clothes and to pay extra taxes. The Moorish quarter was the corresponding ghetto for Muslims, containing the Great Mosque situated on the Rua do Capel√£o (Chaplains Street). However, they were not as prosperous nor as educated as the Jews, since the Muslim elites had fled to North Africa, while the Jews, who were literate speakers of Portuguese, had no other homeland. Most Muslims were workers in low-skilled, low-wage jobs and many were slaves of Christians. They had to display identifying symbols on their robes and pay extra taxes, and suffered the violence of the crowds. The deprecatory term saloio (countryman) came from a special levy, the salaio, that the Muslims who cultivated gardens within the city limits had to pay. Likewise, the term alfacinha (little head of lettuce) came from the cultivation by the Moors of lettuce plants, then little consumed in the north. The city's prosperity was interrupted in 1290 by the first major earthquake in its recorded history, with many buildings collapsing and thousands of people dying. Earthquakes were recorded in 1318, 1321, 1334, and 1337; the temblor of 1344 leveled part of the Cathedral and the Moorish palace, or Alc√°√ßova, and later quakes occurred in 1346, 1356 (destroying another portion of the Cathedral), 1366, 1395 and 1404, all probably resulting from displacements in the same geological fault. Famine in 1333 and the first appearance of the Black Death in 1348 killed half the population; new outbreaks of lower mortality occurred in each succeeding decade. The aftermath of these disasters, in Lisbon as well as in the rest of Europe, led to a series of religious, social, and economic upheavals, destroying the vibrant European civilization of the Middle Ages and the spirit of universal Christianity symbolised by the soaring Gothic architecture of its cathedrals. Yet it also paved the way for the emergence of a new civilization with the coming of the age of discovery and the rise of a revitalised spirit of scientific inquiry. =Revolution: the 1383‚Äì1385 crisis and its aftermath= In the battle of Aljubarrota, the new bourgeois elite of Lisbon and their national allies defeated the old feudal aristocracy and its ally, Castile. A new chapter in the history of Lisbon was written with the social revolution of the 1383‚Äì1385 Crisis. This was a time of civil war in Portugal when no crowned king reigned. It began when King Ferdinand I of Portugal died without male heirs, and his kingdom ostensibly passed to the King of Castile, John I of Castile. The powerful aristocrats and clerics in the north of Portugal owned large estates in the south acquired during the redistribution of land after the Reconquista; their cultural point of view was similar to that of the Castilians, with an emphasis on social distinctions based on the possession of land. They were invested in the spirit of Crusade against the Moors from the Maghreb and the potential benefits of the union of all Hispania. However, these were not the main concerns of the merchants of Lisbon (many of them small gentry). For them, union with Castile meant a severing of trade links with England and the countries of northern Europe, and also with the Middle East; as well as a diversion of attention from their privileges and the building of commercial ships to the privileges of the nobles (fidalgos) and the waging of war with land armies. This helps explain why the merchants and lesser nobles supported the cause of the Master of Avis. The war fought in 1383‚Äì1385 was at bottom a war between the conservative land-owning medieval aristocracy (very similar to and allied with their Galician and Castilian counterparts) centred in the former County of Portugal in Minho (except the bourgeois city of Porto, a Lisbon ally, among a few other cities and personages of the north), and the rich merchants of the pluralistic society of Lisbon. The nobles had reclaimed the country from the Muslims and founded the northern counties‚Äîas their alliance with the Castilian nobility was reestablished, the increasing dominance of Lisbon threatened their supremacy. For the merchants of Lisbon, a commercial city, the feudal practices and land wars of the Castilians were a threat to their business interests. It was the bourgeoisie who, with their English connections and substantial capital, would win the struggle. The Master of Avis was acclaimed King John I of Portugal, his forces having survived the Siege of Lisbon in 1384 and won the Battle of Aljubarrota in 1385 against the forces of Castile and the northern Portuguese nobles, under the leadership of his constable Nuno √Ålvares Pereira/ The new Portuguese aristocracy rose from the merchant class of Lisbon, and it is only from this date that the centre of power in north Portugal actually moved to Lisbon, it becoming a sort of city-state, whose interests almost entirely determined the course of the country's independence. The new bourgeois nobles built their palaces and stately homes in the Santos neighbourhood; other important buildings included the University, which had returned to Lisbon in the Alfama; the Carmo Church (Igreja do Carmo); the Alf√¢ndega (Customs Building); and some of the first residential buildings built in medieval Europe with several floors (up to five). The town had the narrow, winding streets characteristic of medina quarters, mostly unpaved, its houses alternating with gardens and orchards. As the city continued to grow, the widespread abandonment of highly productive Moorish irrigation techniques meant that it had to import wheat from Castile, France, the Rhineland and even Morocco. With this expansion into the countryside, the adjacent territory became suburbs like those of other European commercial cities. Lisbon, along with Antwerp, served the same function of an organised trade centre on the Atlantic coast as Venice, Genoa, Barcelona or Ragusa on the Mediterranean; or Hamburg, Lubeck and the other cities on the Baltic Sea. Wanting to improve public hygiene, the city council in 1417 prohibited garbage piles near the Carmo Monastery and other areas, and in 1426 another law was enacted prohibiting the dumping of trash in the streets, under penalty of paying a fine. Portuguese foreign policy promoted the interests of Lisbon: trade and cooperation agreements were signed with the commercial city-states of Venice (accord of 1392), Genoa (1398), Pisa and Florence, whose merchants had already formed communities in the city, and many of whom were naturalised and married into the Portuguese nobility. Ceuta on the north African coast was captured by the Portuguese during the Battle of Ceuta in 1415, giving Lisbon's merchants a base from which to attack Saracen pirates and better local control of the Mediterranean trade that passed through the Strait of Gibraltar, as well as the importation of Moroccan wheat at the best prices. Moreover, at this time Ceuta received caravans bearing gold and ivory, a trade Lisbon wanted to dominate, and it was feared that its Castilian rivals in Seville or the Aragonese of Barcelona might seize the outpost. A renewed alliance with England, one of its most important trade partners, was pursued. Lisbon, mistress of the seas Prince Henry the Navigator The prosperity of Lisbon was threatened when the Ottoman Empire invaded and conquered the Arab territories of North Africa, Egypt and the Middle East in the 15th century. The Turks were initially hostile to the interests of Lisbon and its allies in Venice and Genoa; consequently the trade in spices, gold, ivory and other goods suffered heavily. The merchants of Lisbon, many of them descendants of Jews or Muslims with links to North Africa, reacted by seeking to negotiate directly with the sources of these goods, without using Muslim mediators. The Portuguese Jews' connections with the Jews of the Maghreb, and the conquest of Ceuta, allowed the Lisbon merchants to spy on the Arab merchants. They learned that the gold, slaves and ivory brought to Morocco in the great caravans travelled through the Sahara desert from the Sudan (which at that time included all the savannas south of the desert, the current Sahel). and that spices like black pepper were transported to Egyptian ports on the Red Sea from India. The new strategy of the merchants of Lisbon ‚Äì Christian and Jewish Portuguese, Italian and Portuguese-Italian ‚Äì was to send ships to the sources of these valuable products. Prince Henry, based in the city of Tomar, was the major proponent of this initiative,. As headquarters of the Order of Christ (formerly the Knights Templar),Marques1972, vol. 2, From Empire to Corporate State, p. 122 and with a large community of Jewish merchants, the city was also very connected to Lisbon by its trade in grains and nuts (one of Lisbon's main exports). The ready access to large amounts of capital and knowledge of the Orient that the Templars and the Jews had were key to achieving the objectives of the Lisbon merchants. Although Prince Henry was the driving force of this project, it was not actually of his own design, but rather had been conceived by the merchants of Lisbon. Those who supported the monarchy financially by the payment of taxes and customs tariffs, making it virtually independent of the resources of the territorial nobles, bent it to their own mercantilist purposes. Prince Henry was, however, the organiser of the state's policy of dirigisme (state- directed investment): the substantial risk involved and the capital needed to finance the opening of new trade routes required the cooperation of all merchants throughout the realm (just as today many large capital projects are undertaken with international cooperation). Henry organised and supervised preparations by the Portuguese merchant fleet to reach the sources of gold, ivory and slaves, efforts that the merchants themselves had managed inefficiently. Using funds made available by the Order of Christ, mariners' schools were founded to centralise the resources and practical knowledge of the merchants of Lisbon. Several expeditions were launched under contract to some of the most influential of the bourgeoisie in Lisbon, and the Gulf of Guinea was finally reached around 1460, the year Prince Henry died. After Henry's death, by which time the sea route was already open, the expansion of the African trade led to the rise of a private sector in the Portuguese economy. In 1469, Afonso V granted the Lisbon merchant Fern√£o Gomes the monopoly of this trade, in exchange for exploring 100 leagues southward on the West African coastline each year for five years, and payment of an annual rent of 200,000 reais. With his profits from the African trade, Gomes assisted Afonso in the conquests of Asilah, Alc√°cer Ceguer, and Tangier in Morocco, where he was knighted Meanwhile, there were new attempts by the remaining feudal nobles of northern Portugal to retake control of the kingdom, frustrated as they were by the growing prosperity of Lisbon's merchants in contrast to their own loss of income. Their purpose was to seek further conquest in North Africa, which offered the prospect of more and relatively easy victories. Such a campaign would be favorable to the interests of the feudal nobles, who stood to gain lands and tenants in Morocco by waging war, but was anathema to the merchant nobles and Jews in Lisbon who would be paying the extra taxes needed to finance such expeditions. The merchants favored investing the resources of the kingdom and its military forces in the discovery of new African and Asian markets, not in augmenting the power of the hostile and pro-Castilian Portuguese nobility. The ongoing disputes that John II engaged in against these nobles, with the backing of the merchants, demonstrate the underlying reality of the conflict between Lisbon and the former County of Portugal, birthplace of the nation: its resolution would set the future course of the country. Following the exposure of several conspiracies and various other incidents of their treachery, the northern nobles again sought the aid of their Castilian counterparts, but Lisbon and its merchants eventually prevailed: the ringleaders of one plot were executed, including the Duke of Braganza in 1483 and the Duke of Viseu in 1484. A great confiscation of estates followed and enriched the Crown, which now became the sole political power of the realm, aside from the Catholic Church. John II famously restored the policies of active Atlantic exploration, reviving the work of his great-uncle, Henry the Navigator. The Portuguese explorations were his main priority in government, pushing ever further south on the west coast of Africa with the purpose of discovering the maritime route to India and breaking into the spice trade. The colonial ventures in north Africa were abandoned to pursue trade in the new lands discovered further south. Gulf of Guinea As the islands of Madeira and the Azores were colonised, the Crown encouraged production of commercial products for export to Lisbon, primarily cane sugar and wine, which soon appeared in the markets of the capital. In the recently discovered land of Guinea, cheap products like metal pots and cloth distributed from Lisbon-controlled depots were exchanged for gold, ivory and slaves. The natives of the region relocated their economic activities closer to the coast for this European trade, but their settlements were left unmolested because such campaigns of conquest were deemed too costly. Sham weddings between officials of the trading posts and the daughters of local chieftains were made to facilitate commerce, albeit with an aim for profit, not colonisation. The result was a new impetus to trade in Lisbon: wheat was shipped from Ceuta, as well as musk, indigo, other clothing dyes, and cotton from Morocco. Significant amounts of gold were obtained from Guinea and the Gold Coast; other sources of this precious metal were sorely lacking in Europe of the late 15th century. Berber slaves from the Canaries and later, black Africans, were trafficked in the often brutal slave trade. The best markets and most valuable products were to be found, however, in India and the East. The war between the Ottoman Empire and Venice resulted in greatly increased prices for black pepper, other spices, and silks brought by the Venetians to Italy from the Ottoman-controlled Egypt, which received Arabian boats sailing from India at its ports on the Red Sea (and thence to Lisbon and the rest of Europe). To circumvent the \\"Turkish problem\\", a voyage of discovery to be captained by Vasco da Gama was organised, again on the initiative of the Lisbon merchants, but this time with royal funding; his boats arrived in India in 1498. Before the end of the 16th century, the Portuguese merchant fleets had reached China (where they founded the commercial colony of Macau), as well as the island archipelagos of present-day Indonesia and Japan. They established the ports of call of the Eastern trade route and made commercial agreements with the chiefs and kings in Angola and Mozambique. A large colonial empire was consolidated by Afonso de Albuquerque, his armed forces securing those ports on the Indian Ocean in locations convenient for ships outbound from Lisbon against competition from the Turks and Arabs. Local territories were generally not seized, excepting the ports that carried on a profitable trade with the natives. Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, Pedro √Ålvares Cabral had arrived at Brazil in 1500. Lisbon from Georg Braun and Frans Hogenberg's atlas Civitates orbis terrarum, 1572 As the Portuguese merchant fleets established the ports of call of the Eastern trade route and made commercial agreements with their rulers, Lisbon gained access to the sources of products it exclusively sold to the rest of Europe for many years: in addition to African products including pepper, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, herbs, and cotton fabrics, as well as diamonds from Malabar in India transported on the Carreira da √çndia (\\"India Run\\"), it sold Moluccan spices, Ming porcelain and silk from China, slaves from Mozambique, brazilwood and Brazilian sugar. Lisbon also traded in fish (mainly salted cod from the Grand Banks), dried fruit, and wine. Other Portuguese cities, like Porto and Lagos, contributed to foreign trade only marginally, the country's commerce being practically limited to the exports and imports of Lisbon. The city still controlled much of the commerce of Antwerp through its depot there, which exported fine fabrics to the rest of Europe. The German and Italian merchants, seeing their trade routes, by land in the case of the first, and by the Mediterranean sea in the second, mostly abandoned, founded large trading houses in Lisbon for re-exporting goods to Europe and the Middle East. As Lisbon became the prime market for luxury goods to satisfy the tastes of the elite classes all across Europe: Venice and Genoa were ruined. The Lisbons controlled for several decades all trade from Japan to Ceuta. In the 16th century Lisbon was one of the richest cities in the world, and the city gained a mythic stature. England and the Netherlands were obliged to imitate the Portuguese mercantile model to halt the loss of foreign exchange. Meanwhile, merchants migrated from all over Europe to establish their businesses in Lisbon, and even some Indian, Chinese, and Japanese traders found their way to the city. Large numbers of African and a few Brazilian Indian slaves were imported at this time as well. During the reign of King Manuel I, festivals were celebrated on the streets of Lisbon with parades of lions, elephants, camels and other animals not seen in Europe since the time of the Roman circus. In 1515, Afonso de Albuquerque presented an Indian rhinoceros to King Manuel, who had it let loose in a ring with an elephant to test the reputed mutual animosity of the two species. The rhinoceros was then forwarded as a gift to Pope Leo X. In Europe the prestige of Lisbon and its land discoveries had grown so great that when Thomas More wrote his book Utopia, about the political system of an ideal and imaginary island nation, he tried to further its plausibility by saying that the Portuguese had discovered it. Bel√©m Tower To organise private trade and manage the collection of taxes, the great Portuguese trading houses of the capital were founded in the late 15th- century: the Casa da Mina ( House of Mina), the Casa dos Escravos (House of Slaves), the Casa da Guin√© (House of Guinea), the Casa da Flandres (House of Flanders), and the famous Casa da √çndia (House of India). Their huge revenues were used to finance construction of the Jer√≥nimos Monastery and the Torre de Bel√©m (Bel√©m Tower), prominent examples of the Manueline architectural style (evocative of the overseas discoveries and trade), the Forte de S√£o Louren√ßo do Bugio with its garrison and heavy artillery on an island in the Tagus, the Terreiro do Pa√ßo (Palace Square), the new and imposing Pa√ßo da Ribeira or Ribeira Palace (destroyed in the earthquake of 1755), and the \\"Arsenal do Exercito\\" (Military Arsenal), all raised next to the Mar da Palha; and even the Hospital Real de Todos-os-Santos (Royal Hospital of All Saints). Numerous palaces and mansions were built by the merchants with their profits. As the city expanded and reached nearly 200,000 inhabitants, the Bairro Alto urbanisation (known initially as Vila Nova de Andrade) was developed by the wealthy Galicians Bartolomeu de Andrade and his wife, and quickly became the richest neighbourhood in town. Jer√≥nimos Monastery The 16th century in Lisbon was the cultural golden age for Portuguese science and arts and letters: among the scientists who called the city home were the humanist Dami√£o de G√≥is (friend of Erasmus and Martin Luther), the mathematician Pedro Nunes, the physician and botanist Garcia da Orta and Duarte Pacheco Pereira; and the writers Lu√≠s de Cam√µes, Bernardim Ribeiro, Gil Vicente and others. Isaac Abravanel, one of the greatest Hebrew philosophers, was appointed the King's Treasurer. All social classes benefited from the city's prosperity, although the urban nobility serving in royal administration and the bourgeoisie benefited the most, but even the common people enjoyed luxuries unattainable to their English, French or German contemporaries. Heavy manual labour was done by African slaves and by Galicians. The first African slaves were sold in Pra√ßa do Pelourinho (Pelourinho Square); they were separated from their families, worked all day without pay, and were subject to brutal treatment. The Galicians, although uprooted from their homes, certainly found their lot improved, considering their miserable condition in rural Spain, and their language being very similar to Portuguese facilitated their integration into Portuguese society. The Jewish population, as always, included some of the poor, as well as scholars, merchants, and financiers who were among the most educated and wealthy citizens in the city. A commentary on the Pentateuch, written in Hebrew by Moses ben Nahman, and published by Eliezer Toledano in 1489, was the first book printed in Lisbon. In 1496, the Spaniards expelled the Jews from Spanish territory, motivated by a fundamentalist spirit that demanded an exclusively Christian kingdom. Many of the Jews fled to Lisbon, and may have temporarily doubled its population. Although acknowledging the central importance of the Jews to the city's prosperity, Manuel I decreed in 1497 that all Jews must convert to Christianity, only those who refused being forced to leave, but not before the expropriation of their property. His desire to wed Princess Isabel of Castile, daughter of the Catholic Monarchs, who required that he first expel all the Jews of Portugal, is generally given as his reason for the forced conversions. For many years these New Christians had practiced Judaism in secret or openly despite the riots and the violence perpetrated against them (many Jewish children were torn from their parents and given to Christian families who treated them as slaves). For now, they were tolerated till the start of the Inquisition in Portugal decades later. Without the disadvantage of being considered Jewish, they were able to rise in the social hierarchy, even to the higher ranks of the court. Again the elite descendants of the ancient families of the old aristocracy of Asturias and Galicia created barriers to the social ascent of Jews, who were often better- educated and more proficient than their antagonists. The anti-semitic movement among the Old Christians infected the common people, and in 1506, spurred by the perceived blasphemy of some injudicious remarks uttered by a converso over the occurrence of a supposed miraculous event at the Church of S√£o Domingos, and then further inflamed by the invective of three Dominican friars, culminated in a massacre of New Christians, in which between 3,000 and 4,000 people were killed.Soyer 2007, p. 287 The king was at Evora when these events occurred, but angered when he received the news, he ordered an investigation which resulted in two of the instigating friars being excommunicated and burned alive, and the Dominicans were expelled from their convent. Portuguese Inquisition at the Terreiro do Pa√ßo in front of the Ribeira Palace As a result of the dissension aroused by this catastrophe, King Manuel was persuaded by the territorial nobles to introduce the Inquisition (which did not become formally active until 1536) during the reign of his son and successor, King John III, and legal restrictions were imposed on all descendants of New Christians (similar to those the Old Christians had imposed on the Jews), to prevent them from threatening senior government posts held by the Old Christian aristocracy. The first auto-da-f√© was held at the Palace Square in 1540. Besides the Inquisition, other social problems arose; in 1569 the great Plague of Lisbon killed 50,000 people. The inquisition put to death many of the New Christians, and expropriated the property and wealth of many others. The riches of even some Old Christian merchants were expropriated after false anonymous complaints were made that the inquisitors accepted as valid, since the property of the condemned reverted to themselves. On the other hand, few merchants would not have had some New Christian ancestry, as marriages between the children of Christian and Jewish partners in the major firms were commonplace. The Inquisition thus became an instrument of social control in the hands of the Old Christians against almost all the Lisbon merchants, and finally restored their long lost supremacy. In this climate of intolerance and persecution, the expansion of the economy enabled by the genius of the traders was undone by the large landowners (whose collectible rents were much less than the receipts of the merchants), and the prosperity of Lisbon was destroyed. The former climate of liberalism conducive to trade disappeared and was replaced by Catholic fanaticism and a rigid conservatism. The noble elites persecuted those who were alleged to be not of \\"pure blood\\" and truly Old Christian. Many of the merchants fled to England or the Netherlands, bringing their naval and cartographic knowledge with them as they settled in those places. Lisbon was taken by the feudal mentality of the great nobles, and the Portuguese merchants, with no security or social support and unable to obtain credit during the persecutions of the Inquisition, could not compete with the English and Dutch merchants (many of them of Portuguese origin) who subsequently took over the markets of India, the East Indies and China. Battle of Alc√¢ntara (1580) The young king Sebastian I was burning with zeal to go to Morocco and stop the advances of the Turkish-supported armies, an enterprise which held the promise of more land and revenues in North Africa for the nobles (they perhaps believing this would allow them to maintain their economic supremacy over the merchants), but the mercantile bourgeoisie also supported the effort as it would benefit Portuguese commerce in North Africa. Sebastian used much of Portugal's imperial wealth to equip a large fleet and gather an army. He and the flower of the Portuguese nobility were killed in the military disaster of the Battle of Alc√°cer Quibir in 1578, his death triggering a succession crisis, where the main claimants to the throne were Philip II of Spain and Ant√≥nio, Prior of Crato. The remaining Portuguese nobles and the high clergy were gathered once again to the arms of their like- minded counterparts, the Castilians, and supported Philip, a maternal grandson of Manuel I of Portugal. Philip sent an army of 40,000 men under the command of the Duke of Alba to invade Portugal. They defeated Ant√≥nio's troops at the Battle of Alc√¢ntara and Philip was crowned Philip I of Portugal in 1581. Thus he at least partly fulfilled the ambition of his father, the Habsburg King Carlos I of Spain (also Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire), who was famously quoted by Friar Nicolau de Oliveira: \\"Se eu fora Rei de Lisboa eu o fora em pouco tempo de todo o mundo\\" (\\"If I were King of Lisbon, I would soon rule over all the world.\\") The union of Portugal with Spain lasted sixty years (1580‚Äì1640). Philippine dynasty The Philippine Dynasty was the third royal house of Portugal. It was named after the three Spanish kings who ruled Portugal from 1581 to 1640 in a dynastic union of the Castilian and Portuguese crowns. The three kings, all named Philip, belonged to the House of Habsburg. The 16th century was the golden age of Lisbon, a time when the city became the European hub of commerce with Africa, India, the Far East and, later, Brazil, accumulating great riches through the importation of spices, slaves, sugar, textiles and other goods. Nevertheless, the sixty years of Habsburg rule in Portugal beginning in 1580 coincided with a period of economic distress, social upheaval, and warfare in Europe that spread around the world through the colonial empires. When King Sebastian of Portugal died at Alc√°cer Quibir in 1578 without heirs, he was succeeded by his great-uncle Henry of Portugal, who reigned until his own death on 31 January 1580. Henry also lacked heirs, and his death triggered the succession crisis of 1580, in which the main claimants to the throne were Philip II of Spain and Anthony, Prior of Crato. Philip was crowned king of Portugal as Philip I in 1581, beginning the union between the two nations known as the Iberian Union. After a three-year-long war with Anthony and his foreign allies, the resistance crumbled and the union was consolidated. Philip II of Spain In 1580, Philip started a series of construction works and renovations throughout Portugal, seeking to rehabilitate the kingdom after the War of the Portuguese Succession. During his three-year stay in Lisbon, from 1580 to 1583, Philip considered making the city the imperial capital of his trans-European monarchy and empire. To better suit the city for his extravagant court, he ordered the remodeling and expansion of Ribeira Palace, under the supervision of Filippo Terzi of Bologna, the Master of the Royal Works. The king decided to modernise the palace, stripping it of its early renaissance Manueline style and converting it into a monumental Mannerist complex. The highlight of the Philippine renovations was the reconstruction and enlargement of the Torre do Rei (Tower of the King), which transformed the three-story Manueline tower that housed the Casa da √çndia into a five-story Mannerist tower, complete with an observatory and one of the largest royal libraries in all of Europe. Philip also ordered the reconstruction of the Monastery of S√£o Vicente de Fora (Mosteiro de S√£o Vicente de Fora), a prime example of ecclesiastical structures built to reinforce a religious piety that instilled a sense of loyalty to the Catholic monarchy. The plan for the building, produced by Juan de Herrera in Madrid, was adapted in Lisbon by Filippo Terzi. Other works were begun to defend against pirate raids from the north, with new city walls and fortifications built according to military engineering principles of the time: these included the Torre do Bugio on an island in the middle of the Mar del Plata; and others in Cascais, Set√∫bal and on the south bank of the Tagus. Dutch and English pirates, among them Francis Drake, made several attacks on some Portuguese squares, but did not dare to attack Lisbon. Philip attempted to reconcile the interests of the Portuguese nobility in acquiring more territory in Europe with those of the clergy in halting the spread of Protestantism, as well as those of the bourgeoisie in eliminating mercantile competition and privateering by the English and Dutch. All the boats capable of military action in Lisbon, Seville and Barcelona were gathered in an armada sent against England in 1588 with the express purpose of escorting an army from Flanders to invade the island nation across the Channel. The strategic aim was to overthrow Queen Elizabeth I and the Tudor establishment of Protestantism in England. Philip sent the large mercenary infantry regiments (ter√ßos) of the Army of Flanders, commanded by the Duke of Parma, to the coast of Flanders in preparations for the invasion. A combination of severe storms in the North Atlantic, the faster and more maneouverable ships of the English navy, and the superior seamanship of the English admirals resulted in the destruction of the Spanish fleet and put an end to these plans. From the Portuguese succession crisis in 1580 to the beginning of the reign of the monarchs of the House of Braganza in 1640 was an era of transition in Lisbon. The Portuguese Empire's spice trade was near its height at the start of this period, having expanded to global influence after Vasco da Gama had finally reached the East by sailing around Africa to India in 1497‚Äì1498. Da Gama's achievement completed the exploratory efforts inaugurated by Henry the Navigator, and opened an oceanic route for the profitable spice trade into Europe that bypassed the Middle East, greatly enriching the city's merchants as well as the royal treasury. Throughout the 17th century, the increasing predations and surrounding of Portuguese trading posts in the East by the Dutch, English and French, and their rapidly growing intrusion into the Atlantic slave trade, undermined Portugal's near monopoly on the lucrative oceanic spice and slave trades. This sent the Portuguese spice trade into a long decline. The diversion of wealth from Portugal by the Habsburg monarchy to help support the Catholic side of the Thirty Years' War also strained the union, although Portugal did benefit from Spanish military power in retaining Brazil and in disrupting Dutch trade. Over time, Portugal became economically dependent on its colonies, first India and then Brazil. As the Dutch and English made encroachments on the overseas trade, they were unable to seize the Spanish territorial empires of Mexico and Peru, so they concentrated on taking the Portuguese trading posts, ports and coastal colonies that provided the goods trafficked in Lisbon. The northeastern ports of Brazil, the Cape of Good Hope, other ports in East Africa, Ceylon, Malacca and the Moluccas Islands were taken, as well as the island of Formosa (Taiwan) and the trade concession in Japan.Russell-Wood 1998, p. 138 Lisbon, with its merchants persecuted by the Inquisition (which expropriated the property of Crypto-Jews and even that of genuine Christians), and having already lost much of its fleet in the disaster of the Spanish Armada, as well as paying high taxes to support the armies of the Spanish nobles in Europe, began gradually to lose its overseas ports and its access to foreign products. Although the Portuguese royal monopoly suffered from competition by the Dutch joint-share trading companies, the private enterprises of the Portuguese merchants faced only limited competition from their European rivals until 1600. In the 17th century their share of the Asian trade declined and profits shrank, but they lost no markets in Asia to the Dutch and English trading companies through the 1630s. However, from the 1640s and 1650s onward the northern European merchants dominated the Atlantic economy and overseas trade.Boyajian 2007, p. 14‚Äì15 With the rise of bureaucratic government (\\"government by paper\\") in the administration of the empire during the Philippine age, the Spanish inevitably found deficiencies in Portuguese administration both in Portugal and its overseas colonies, to the point that a new code of Portuguese law, the Ordena√ß√µes Filipinas (Philippine Decrees), was promulgated in 1603. The city's mercantile operations and Its potential as a centre of maritime trade were described by the Portuguese cartographer, Pedro Teixeira Albernaz,http://www.press.uchicago.edu/books/HOC/HOC_V3_Pt1/HOC_VOLUME3_Part1_chapter38.pdf who conducted a survey in 1622 of all the coasts of the Iberian peninsula at the order of Philip III. The results were published at Madrid in 1634.Iconograf√≠a de una ciudad atl√°ntica Memoria e identidad visual de Pontevedra Facultad de Geograf√≠a e Historia Departamento de Historia del Arte Universidad De Santiago De Compostela, Doctoral Thesis, Carla Fern√°ndez Mart√≠nez, Santiago de Compostela, June 2013 http://ddspace.usc.es/bitstream/10347/9566/1/rep_548.pdf p.191 Portugal was brought low during the final years of the reign of Philip III, as the Spanish officials often flagrantly violated the conditions granted by Philip I, which were the original contract and unalterable constitution of Portugal while it was subject to the monarchs of Castile. Lisbon, the once great cosmopolitan city, was reduced to the rank of a provincial city with no influence among the higher Spanish nobility who governed from Madrid,Boyajian 2007, pp. 212‚Äì213 their conservative and fundamentalist Catholic capital. Lisbon lost much of its population and its importance to the world economy as its mercantile activity shrank. With economic decline, unemployment and crime increased greatly, adding to the misery of the common people. The Spanish authorities were obliged to introduce a kind of auxiliary police force, the Quadrilheiros, whose members patrolled the streets to control street crime, fights, sorcery and gaming. Half a century of continual war and more than a century of depredations by privateers and pirates weighed heavily on the administration and defence of the Portuguese empire,Truxillo 2001, p. 37 spread as it was across Asia, Africa and America, and exhausted the Portuguese treasury.Bethell 1987, p. 48 In 1640, Count-Duke de Olivares, royal favourite of Philip IV and prime minister of Spain, imprudently chose to levy a special tax upon Portugal in violation of its constitution, at the very time when the Catalans, a merchant people like those of Lisbon, and also oppressed by Castilian taxes, were on the verge of armed rebellion. Then the prime minister of Portugal, Miguel de Vasconcelos, on the advice of the Spanish nobility, and with the complicity of the Portuguese feudal nobles, announced the Spanish minister's intention of abolishing the Portuguese Cortes, and of making the country a mere province of Castile with its own representatives in the Castilian Cortes.Acton1964, p. 561 This provocation was the last straw for those Portuguese who desired the restoration of Portugal's independence. Portuguese Restoration War During the so-called 'Philippine dominion', royal power in Portugal was administered mostly by viceroys and governors; this period ended in 1640 when the Portuguese Restoration War was initiated against Spain, and Portugal regained its independence (the Restaura√ß√£o) under the Braganza (Bragan√ßa) dynasty. The merchants of Lisbon allied themselves with the lower and the middle Portuguese nobility and entreated the Duke of Braganza to accept the throne. According to some historians he was really as indifferent as he seemed and it was the ambition of his wife and of his allies that made him king. Some of them assert as well that the duke was hesitant because he, like the rest of the high nobility, benefited by Madrid's rule, but that the prospect of becoming king finally persuaded him. In any event, on 1 December 1640, the conspirators assailed the royal palace and the citadel of Lisbon, and meeting little resistance, acclaimed the duke as the new King of Portugal, John IV (Jo√£o IV). Brazilian gold Post-Restoration Lisbon was increasingly dominated by Catholic religious orders. Traditionally, the second and third sons in a family, who received no inheritance from the father under the law of primogeniture, had gone into trade or other business overseas, but under current depressed economic conditions they took refuge in religious orders where they obtained church sinecures or lived off alms. This led to such a proliferation of priests, nuns and friars that they became a significant proportion of the population. The financial plight of the country was finally relieved, not by the successful prosecution of state-issued directives, but by the colonial government's exploitation of the deposits of gold discovered 1693‚Äì1695 in what is now the state of Minas Gerais (General Mines) in Brazil. The Portuguese state charged a tax of one-fifth of the gold extracted from the mines, known as the royal fifth (quinto del rey), which began arriving in Lisbon in 1699; revenues rose quickly, peaking at more than 3 tonnes annually in the early 1750s, representing almost the entire budget of the state. With the large income generated by this surge in gold production, opulent buildings were commissioned by the clergy and the aristocracy of Lisbon. These were built in the new Baroque architectural style of the Counter-Reformation; among them were several palaces and the Church of Santa Engr√°cia (Igreja de Santa Engr√°cia), which in the 20th century was converted into the National Pantheon (Pante√£o Nacional). In contrast to the luxurious lifestyle of the elite classes, the common people generally lived under wretched conditions, even though demand for manual labour to construct new buildings increased as the population grew. The first descriptions of Lisbon as a dirty and degraded city were written in this period, just two centuries after its having been among the most prosperous and cosmopolitan in Europe. The late 17th-century discoveries of gold and diamond deposits in Brazil were the most important such finds ever made in the colonial New World. Between 1700 and 1800 a thousand metric tonnes of gold were recorded as received by the Portuguese treasury, and another thousand tonnes may have evaded the royal fifth. Around 2.4 million carats of diamonds were extracted from the alluvial sources in Minas Gerais, while an unknown amount was smuggled out. These riches had a great economic impact there and in the mother country, encouraging large numbers of Portuguese to emigrate to the colony and giving it a more European character. Many of the settlers found their way to the gold-bearing region in the Atlantic Forest {Mata Atl√¢ntica}, where they could become prosperous enough to buy African slaves. Increasing demand from Brazil benefited the merchants of Lisbon, who supplied the colonials with cloth and metal wares, as well as luxury items including spices, porcelain, silks, and velvets from Europe and Asia.Bethell 1987, p. 242 Competition with British- financed merchants, who had direct access to sources for the precious metals mined in Brazil, caused the Lisbon merchants to enter the more open market of Luanda where they purchased captive Africans. They sold these slaves in exchange for gold at Rio de Janeiro, the port city that grew on the Atlantic coast to satisfy the demand for import goods created by the mining activities of Minas Gerais. To secure a larger portion of the lucrative Brazilian gold market, the Rio merchants worked out a strategy of obtaining slaves from traders in Angola. Earthquake of 1755 and Pombaline era Lisbon before and after the 1755 earthquake A new era began in Lisbon on 1 November 1755, All Saints Day, when a devastating earthquake, one of the most powerful in recorded history, destroyed two thirds of the city. The first shock struck at 9:40 a.m., followed by another tremor at 10:00 a.m., and a third at noon. Many persons rushed to those squares beside the River Tagus with enough space to escape the collapsing structures of the city, but were drowned by a 7-metre high tsunami that flooded the river's mouth about half an hour later. After the earthquake, the tsunami, and subsequent fires, Lisbon lay in ruins. The large Royal Turret, the Casa das √çndias, the Carmo Convent (Convento da Ordem do Carmo), the Court of the Inquisition, and the Hospital de Todos-os-Santos were destroyed. Thousands of buildings collapsed, including many churches, monasteries, nunneries, and palaces. Of the 20,000 less solidly built houses of the lower classes, 17,000 were destroyed. Many buildings occupied by the rich in the Bairro Alto neighbourhood survived, as well as some buildings made of solid stone in a few other areas. Major fires raged in the city for six days and there was rampant looting. Of the city's 180,000 inhabitants, between 30,000 and 60,000 died, while many others lost their entire property. The Marquis of Pombal, who was inspired by the new political, economic, and scientific theories of the Enlightenment and had such influence over the king that he was de facto ruler of Portugal, seized the opportunity presented by the catastrophe to implement in Portugal some of the liberal reforms that had been tried successfully in other western European countries. In 1756, the French philosopher and voice of the enlightenment, Voltaire, published a poem entitled Po√®me sur le d√©sastre de Lisbonne (\\"Poem on the Lisbon Disaster\\") which expressed the shock and disillusionment of European intellectuals after the Lisbon earthquake, as well as his own rejection of the philosophical optimism popularised by the English poet, Alexander Pope, in his poem, An Essay on Man. Voltaire subsequently used the catastrophic event in his novella Candide, published in 1759, to satirise Leibnizian optimism, religion, and war. Military engineers and surveyors under the supervision of chief engineer General Manuel da Maia (1672‚Äì1768), Colonel Carlos Mardel (1695‚Äì1763), and Captain Eug√©nio dos Santos (1711‚Äì1760) were ordered by the Marquis of Pombal to draw up plans for the rebuilding of the city, to inventory property claims, and to ensure that debris was removed safely and the bodies of the dead were disposed of in a sanitary manner.Maxwell 1995, p. 24 The √Åguas Livres Aqueduct (Aquaducto das √Åguas Livres), built by order of John V and put into service in 1748, was so well constructed that it was unharmed by the earthquake of 1755; it had 127 masonry arches, the highest of which is in the stretch crossing the Alc√¢ntara valley, and is high. As part of the reconstruction of downtown Lisbon, a new naval arsenal was erected by order of Pombal at the same site on the banks of the Tagus, west of the royal palace, where many of the ships of the Portuguese age of exploration were built, among them the naus and galleons that had opened the trade route to India. It was a vast building containing naval magazines and offices of different departments of the naval service. Renamed the Arsenal Real da Marinha (Royal Navy Shipyard), the official maritime works of the Ribeira das Naus continued operating there as in the expansive days of Manuel I, who had ordered the construction of new shipyards (tercenas) on the site of the medieval shipyards. Marquis of Pombal The 1st Marquis of Pombal, who had been born into the lower-ranking nobility, became effectively prime minister to Joseph I, after brief careers in the Portuguese army and the diplomatic service He famously responded to the king's query regarding what he should do about the devastation caused by the earthquake: \\"Bury the dead. Feed the living. Rebuild the city.\\" This was a succinct expression of Pombal's approach to the recovery of the city's economy and social structure. The marquis, after he had ordered a review of the actual situation through an unprecedented population survey, refused the counsel of some of his advisers who wished to move the capital to another city, and initiated reconstruction in Lisbon according to new theories of urban planning. The royal income from Brazil paid for almost the entire reconstruction project, its cost amounting to over 20 million silver cruzados. The city also received emergency aid from England, Spain and the Hansa, and subsequently filled with construction sites. Most of the Portuguese aristocracy took refuge on their country estates around Lisbon, while King Joseph and his court took up residence in a huge complex of tents and barracks built in Ajuda, on the outskirts of the city. This became the centre of Portuguese political and social life for a couple of years after the great earthquake, while repairs were made on the royal palace in Bel√©m, then still an area outside the city. Church of Saint Anthony, in Lisbon, the birthplace of Saint Anthony of Padua, also known as Anthony of Lisbon. It was fully rebuilt after the 1755 earthquake to a Baroque-Rococo design by architect Mateus Vicente de Oliveira . Most of the reconstruction was carried out, however, in the old city centre with a new layout approved by the marquis and designed by Eugenio dos Santos and Carlos Mardel, for the Baixa, the neighbourhood hardest hit by the earthquake. Their plan fit the pragmatic spirit of the age of Enlightenment, with the narrow old streets being replaced by wide straight avenues arranged orthogonally. These not only allowed proper ventilation and lighting of the streets, but also allowed for better security, including police patrols and access to buildings in case of fire, as well as measures to prevent the spread of fire to neighbouring structures. The buildings had to conform to regulations based on a consistent policy, with the architectural team defining which fa√ßade designs were allowed, and the rules of construction for all buildings. They aimed to reorganise the social structure of the city, with a new emphasis on mercantile business, and developed a set of rules for the construction of housing better able to survive a powerful earthquake. The critical architectural innovation designed for this purpose consisted of a wooden skeleton called the gaiola pombalina (Pombal Cage), a flexible rectangular frame with diagonal braces enabling structures to withstand the overload and stress of an earthquake without coming apart. This wooden frame was erected atop walls with barrel vault arches on a masonry foundation, giving solidity and weight to the first floor of the buildings, intended for occupation by shops, offices and warehouses. All new structures in the downtown area were erected on pine log pilings driven into the sandy soil of the Baixa, to ensure the effective support of their weight. They were arranged according to their importance in a horizontal hierarchy based on proximity to the street (the uppermost storey would be reserved for poorer families with few possessions, usually having lower ceilings, communal balconies, smaller windows and smaller rooms). All the buildings had masonry firewalls separating them from each other. The standardization of fa√ßades, windows, doors, simple geometric patterns in the hallway tiles, etc. permitted accelerated progress of the works through the mass production of these elements on site. The entire area was laid out along neo-Classical lines with classical proportions according to architectural rules of composition using the golden ratio. The structural core of the new city was the Rua Augusta, connecting the northern limit of the city, the Rossio, and the southern boundary, the Pra√ßa do Com√©rcio, commonly referred to as the \\"Terreiro do Pa√ßo\\" (Palace Square), opening onto Rua Augusta through the triumphal Arco da Vit√≥ria (erected to commemorate the city's reconstruction but not finished until 1873). This plan is integral to the design of what was intended to be the new heart of commercial activity in the reconstructed city. The buildings surrounding the Palace Square were built to contain warehouses and the large commercial buildings expected to stimulate mercantile activity in the plaza, but after several years of abandonment were eventually occupied by government ministries, courts, the Navy Yard, the Customs building, and the stock exchange during the reign of Queen Maria I. A new market was designed, although it was ultimately never built, at the north end, parallel to Rossio, at the square originally called Pra√ßa Nova (New Square), and today known as the Pra√ßa da Figueira. Despite their fervent desire to complete the project, rebuilding Lisbon took much longer than Pombal and his staff expected, its reconstruction not being completed until 1806. This was due largely to the lack of capital among the bourgeoisie of a city in crisis. With ruthless efficiency Pombal limited the power of the Church, expelled the Jesuits from Portuguese territories and brutally suppressed the power of the conservative territorial aristocracy. This led to a series of conspiracies and counter-conspiracies, culminating with the torture and public execution in 1759 of members of the T√°vora familyNewitt 2009, p. 146 and its closest relatives, who were implicated in a plot to assassinate the king, dispatch Pombal and put the conservative Duke of Aveiro on the throne. Some historians argue that this charge is unsupportable, that it was a hoax perpetrated by Pombal himself to limit the growing powers of the old aristocratic families. By the 1770s Pombal had effectively neutralised the Inquisition, consequently the new Christians, still the majority of the educated and liberal middle class of the city and the country, were freed from their legal restrictions and finally allowed access to the high government positions previously the exclusive monopoly of the 'pureblood' aristocracy. Industry was supported in a somewhat dirigiste, but vigorous, manner, several royal factories being established in Lisbon and other cities that thrived. After the Pombaline period there were twenty new plants for every one that had previously existed. The various state-imposed taxes and duties, which had proven burdensome to trade, were abolished in 1755. Throughout the implementation of these initiatives by the Junta do Com√©rcio, Pombal relied on donations and loans made by the merchants and industrialists of Lisbon. Nicola in Rossio Square Signs of a recovering economy emerged slowly under the Portuguese economic renewal policy. The city grew gradually to 250,000 inhabitants who settled in all geographical directions, occupying the new neighbourhoods of Estrella and Rato, while its new industrial centre concentrated around the recent water supply brought by the aqueduct to the water tower of Alc√¢ntara.Livermore 2004, p. 84‚Äì85 Many factories arose in the area, including the royal ceramic factory and the silk factory of Amoreiras, where mulberry trees were grown to provide leaves to feed the larvae of the silkworms used by the local silk factories. The Prime Minister tried continually to stimulate the rise of middle class, which he saw as essential to the country's development and progress. The first cafes owned by Italians were founded in the city around this time: some survive today such as Martinho da Arcada (1782) in the Palace Square and the Nicola in Rossio Square,Jack 2007, p. 136 whose Liberal owner, among others, illuminated the fa√ßade after each Progressive political victory. The richest burghers acquired the habit of holding social soir√©es, with the unprecedented participation of women, while among the conservative nobility women held their traditional place and did not participate. In this manner a self-conscious bourgeois middle class rose again from the people of Lisbon, composed of both New Christians and Old Christians; these were the source of the national Liberal and Republican political movements, their presence manifested by the publication of several new newspapers in the capital. Pombal was forced to resign after the death of King Joseph and the ascension to the throne of his daughter, the very religious Maria I, whose great contribution to the nation's cultural patrimony was the building of the Bas√≠lica da Estrela. Under the advisement of the clergy and the conservative nobles, she dismissed the prime minister and sought to limit and even reversed some of his progressive reforms, a movement called the Viradeira. Economic conditions had greatly improved in the Pombaline era, but began to deteriorate under the new regime while budgetary problems mounted. To deal with rising poverty and crime, a police force was created in 1780 under the leadership of Diogo Pina Manique. Secular political persecution resumed at this time. The police hounded, arrested, tortured and expelled progressive partisans: Freemasons, Jacobins and liberals; as well as their newspapers, were censored. Many literary works by liberal Protestants or philosophers were banned and the cafes where they congregated were watched by plainclothes policemen. Cultural expression was controlled and any manifestations less than rigidly Catholic were outlawed, including the ancient Carnival. Conversely, Portuguese theatre was stimulated by the construction in 1793 of the Teatro de S√£o Carlos in Chiado, which replaced the opera house destroyed during the earthquake. It was, however, funded by the private sector. Civil war: liberals and conservatives Sir Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington In the last quarter of the 18th century, the American Revolution, begun in 1776, galvanised liberal ideas of government throughout Europe. When the French Revolution erupted in France in 1789, the liberal partisans of Lisbon rejoiced in the downfall of the French aristocracy. The revolutionary movement in Paris was quickly radicalised, however, when its leadership fell into the hands of the extreme left. The bourgeoisie felt threatened and called to power the politically centrist Napoleon Bonaparte, who eventually declared himself Emperor of France. The foreign policy he deployed in his struggle against Great Britain during the Napoleonic Wars is referred to as the Continental System or Continental Blockade (known in French as Blocus continental). After the French declaration of war against the United Kingdom in 1793, Portugal signed a treaty of mutual aid with Britain. As a response to the naval blockade of the French coasts enacted by the British government in 1806, Napoleon issued the Berlin Decree, which effected a large-scale embargo against British trade, which Portugal defied. After the Treaty of Tilsit was signed in July 1807, Napoleon attempted to capture the Portuguese fleet as well as members of the royal House of Braganza, and to occupy the Portuguese ports, but failed. The Portuguese population rose in revolt against the French invaders, causing Napoleon to send General Junot at the head of a large army to conquer the country. The prince regent of Portugal, later King John VI, who had formally governed the country on behalf of Maria I since 1799, took his fleet and transferred the Portuguese Court to Brazil with a British Royal Navy escort just before Napoleonic forces invaded Lisbon on 30 November 1807. Since Portugal was an ally of Great Britain, the British Army under Arthur Wellesley, future Duke of Wellington intervened, and the Peninsular War began. When Junot entered Lisbon on 30 November 1807, the Portuguese royal family, aristocracy and high clergy had already set sail for Brazil the previous day. The French Army was initially well received by Lisboners,Esdaile 2008, p. 155 General Junot taking up residence in the Queluz National Palace (Pal√°cio Nacional de Queluz). and redecorating it. The bourgeoisie of Lisbon discussed the new liberal ideas in conversations with French officers in the cafes of the city, particularly the Nicola in Rossio square, where the French established their headquarters. The people expected a continuation of the political reforms enacted by the Marquis of Pombal, but Junot did not want to risk stimulating radical ideas and did nothing along those lines. Napoleon proposed that Lisbon should be incorporated directly into the French Empire, while the old Portucale of northern Portugal would be resurrected as the 'Kingdom of Northern Lusitania' in the province of Entre Douro e Minho. Meanwhile, 50,000 Spanish and French troops roamed the countryside arresting, killing, plundering and raping the citizenry. The lack of any movement by General Junot to enact reforms and the violent behavior of the French soldiers finally compelled the Junta Provisional do Supremo Governo do Reino (Provisional Board of the Supreme Government of the Kingdom) to seek the aid of England, which sent an expeditionary force led by Wellesley and William Beresford. The French were outnumbered, and Junot was forced to retreat in late 1808 following a withdrawal agreement with the British, who simultaneously entered the town and set up their headquarters in Arroios. The British received control of Lisbon's and Portugal's governments from Prince Regent John, who now resided in Rio de Janeiro, and administered them as virtual colonies of Great Britain. Lisbon suffered economically with the opening of the ports of Brazil to England. Following the French withdrawal, the Portuguese populace was free to avenge itself on their francophile compatriots for the brutality and depredations of the French. Meanwhile, to control access to the capital, Wellington's chief engineer, Richard Fletcher, built the defensive lines known as the Lines of Torres Vedras across the peninsula on which Lisbon sits, using Portuguese workmen. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on one side and the Tagus on the other, the city was reachable only by a narrow stretch of land blocked by a range of hills stretching from Sintra to Torre Vedras,Esdaile 2008, p. 150 which since Roman times had marked the bounds of Lisbon's territory. Conceived by Fletcher and a Portuguese major, Neves Costa, the Lines proved impregnable to the French invasion force (Arm√©e de Portugal) commanded by Marshal Andr√© Mass√©na, who withdrew in defeat in March 1811, after which the British and some Portuguese troops under General Wellington left Portugal to launch another offensive against the French army in Spain. This offensive culminated with a victory at Vittoria, effectively ending French control of Spain. Napoleon was finally defeated 18 June 1815 at Waterloo by a coalition of Britain, Prussia, Austria and Russia. Beresford was made a Lieutenant-General in the British army and given command of the Portuguese army in 1809, with the rank of Marshal to bolster his authority over the Portuguese generals. He remained in the country long after the French withdrew in 1811, and, although he took his orders from King John, acted as a virtual dictator, becoming increasingly despotic after 1815, when Brazil was declared a kingdom. A conspiracy against John and the Regency Council, organised by General Gomes Freire de Andrade, leader of the Portuguese partisans of France (Partido Franc√™s), was discovered at Lisbon in May 1817; on the orders of Marshal Beresford, the principals were promptly arrested and tried. The object of the conspirators was to overthrow the British, to put Beresford to death, and to set up a revolutionary government. Gomes Freire, formerly commander of the Portuguese Legion in Napoleon's army, was sentenced to death with eleven of his accomplices, and on 18 October 1817 they were executed. He and seven others were hanged, their bodies burnt, and their ashes thrown into the Tagus. The bourgeoisie of Lisbon chafed under the British occupation; in 1820 the Liberals of Porto rebelled and took control of the city, followed by a coup d'√©tat in Lisbon and the expulsion of the British governors. The Cortes were then convoked by the Liberals, one of them enacting the Constitution of 1822 (actually written in 1820),\\" a charter of human rights that ended the privileges of the clergy and the nobility. Pedro IV of Portugal The years of political struggle between the conservative authoritarian absolutists and the progressive constitutionalist Liberals over the issue of royal succession, lasting from 1828 to 1834, was a complex period in Lisbon's history. In 1828, Prince Michael, whom the absolutists wanted to rule Portugal as an absolute monarch, returned from exile in Vienna. Conservative politicians, clergymen and aristocratic supporters of Queen Carlota manipulated political developments and proclaimed him king, starting a civil war against the forces of the Liberal constitutionalists who supported his brother, Emperor Peter I of Brazil. Peter's forces won the war in 1834 and he became Pedro IV of Portugal, but the new Constitution as promulgated was more conservative than expected by the people. However, it did present some liberal reforms, such as restoration of freedom of the press, mandatory education, abolishment of the slave trade in the African colonies, extinction of the religious orders and confiscation of their convents, as well as the expropriation of many other properties of the Catholic Church, which had supported the Miguelists. The Liberals of Lisbon soon became disillusioned with Pedro and formed new political conspiracies. On 9 September 1836, the politicised population, many of them petty bourgeois and literary intellectuals, joined with the National Guard to drive the Cartistas (Chartists) from power and forced Queen Maria II to reinstate the 1822 Constitution. Members of the government installed following this revolution were called Setembristas, after their short-lived movement, the Setembrismo, which was launched in September. The absolutists attempted a coup in 1836, and again in 1837. The country was divided into two opposing radical groups that refused to engage in a dialogue. Seeing opportunity in this chaotic state of affairs, the great northern European powers planned the division of its provinces and colonies. The period of Liberal government (1820‚Äì1842) was marked by wars and guerrilla actions, but even so, many reforms and public works projects were introduced. The long-planned project to provide lighting in the city was finally implemented; and introduced in many private homes of the bourgeoisie between the years 1823 and 1837. Initially, lamps were lit by olive oil, and later fish oil, then were replaced by gas lamps in 1848. A new network of roads was constructed; and a line of steamships went into service linking Lisbon to Porto by sea. Plans were made to launch the construction of railways, but the war with the Conservatives made this impossible, and the first railroad line in Portugal, the Caminhos de Ferro Portugueses, between Lisbon and Carregado, would not open until 1856. This period was marked by a partial loss of Lisbon's economic vitality when Brazil became independent and its gold and other products no longer flowed into the capital. During the Cabralismo, the period from 1842 to 1846 when Ant√≥nio Bernardo da Costa Cabral dominated Portuguese politics, noble titles were assigned to many of the more important bourgeoisie, as a compromise with the Conservative Party that had some success. With the loss of earnings from Brazil, dependence on the state became attractive for the leisure class, who feared competition from the neo- aristocrats and supported traditionally rigid social divisions. It was at this time that titles of 'Baron' and 'Viscount' multiplied among the landed property owners,Livermore 2004, p. 31 many of them hereditary, but many others being limited to the life of the beneficiary receiving rents from the state or engaged in the corrupt politics of the time. The territorial aristocracy acquired the habit of spending the winters in Lisbon, staying in their manor houses (solars) only in summer. However, it was the common people who suffered most from the wars and the loss of Brazil, as the city's economy stagnated and it lost its international influence, going from the fifth most populous city in EuropeBankoffL√ºbken 2012, p. 157 to the tenth and continuing downward. Employment opportunities became more precarious and poverty again increased. Lisbon between Europe and Africa The D. Maria II National Theatre Following the end of the wars and conflicts between absolutist conservatives and liberals, Lisbon was in a declining economic situation, having lost the gold and commodities monopoly of Brazil, the source of most of its wealth since the end of the 16th century. The northern European nations had prospered through industrialisation, and become rich through trade in the Americas (Great Britain would dominate the Brazilian market) and Asia. Portugal's downturn seemed irreversible. Unable to decisively defeat the Liberals, and frightened by the economic downturn that conservative policies had led Portugal into since the 16th century, in contrast to the success of liberal England, France and the Netherlands, the absolutists who dominated the country and the capital partially relented. Limited reforms would be allowed in exchange for defending the conservative and religious values of a mostly rural population, with political power remaining in the hands of the large landowners. Elections would be held, but only those qualified by ownership of substantial property would be allowed to vote. The patronage of the state would be shared with the neo-aristocrats and titles granted to the large bourgeoisie and capitalists. The ruling classes would retain their privileges and subsidies from the state, and industrialisation would be limited to their interests. In this period Lisbon was a poor and dirty city compared to the cities of northern Europe. Almost all its commercial importance derived from the monopoly it held on the products of the Portuguese colonies, especially Angola and Mozambique. The country itself was described in London, Paris and Berlin as an extension of North Africa, meaning a territory unable to govern itself. The first large-scale emigrations began, and many thousands of poor Lisbons departed for Brazil,Thomson 2014, p. 23 not to take government administrative jobs, but rather to rise from the lower levels of the Portuguese social scale: Despite the poverty and backwardness of most of the country, a rich upper class rose in Lisbon which spent lavishly and behaved as if it belonged to the elite of northern Europe, while governing a rural and backward country crippled by economic protectionism, and lacking systems to provide state-funded education and health care. With the decreasing importance of land as a factor of wealth, the landed aristocracy and gentry orbited the royal court, living luxuriously on allowances and salaries distributed by the state using taxes collected from the middle and lower classes. A regime \\"of genteel manners\\" was established which ceased political persecution, but also halted any reforms; corruption was routine and almost always went unpunished. Occasionally, an exceptional politician who was amenable to change and willing to invest time and effort to bring it about would appear in the succession of mostly idle and corrupt administrators. The Prime Minister Fontes Pereira de Melo reacted against protectionism and fought for economic liberalization and expanded industrialisation; various economic and industrial developments were encouraged under his leadership, which was focused primarily on the development of infrastructure. Gallagher 1983, p. 16 Neo-Manueline fa√ßade of Rossio Railway Station in Lisbon A railway line connecting Lisbon to Porto and intervening cities was constructed, with two new train stations: Santa Apol√≥nia and Rossio. Electric lighting was introduced as a public utility in 1878, replacing gas lighting. The first master plans of urban development were drawn up.in response to the need to reverse the city's reputation as a dirty, backward capital that shocked visitors from northern Europe. Its inhabitants were encouraged to use the decorative ceramic tiles called azulejos on the exteriors of their houses and to paint the facades pink, according to municipal guidelines (the numerous buildings with decorated tiles of this period dominate the city centre today). The first plumbing systems were installed and sewage and water treatment plants built in response to the cholera epidemics that killed thousands. Using the labour of the impoverished working class, it was now possible to pave both the new and the old streets (as well as Rossio Square) as had been done on a smaller scale in the 16th century, with the centuries-old traditional technique, known as cal√ßada, of laying cobblestones. Other important innovations were the American street cars (passenger vehicles on rails pulled by horses), introduced in 1873; they were replaced in 1901 by electric trams, which still exist today, and the funiculars and cable cars that were installed on several of the ciiy's hills after 1880. A photograph of the Santa Justa Lift, as it appeared prior to a 1907 conversion to electric power. Elevador da Bica, The Bica funicular was opened on 28 June 1892 The cultural and commercial centre of the city moved to the Chiado. With the old streets of the Baixar already occupied, the owners of new stores and clubs established their businesses in the newly annexed hillside neighbourhood, which was rapidly developed. Clubs founded there included institutions like the Gr√©mio Liter√°rio (Literary Guild), founded by the writers Almeida Garrett and Alexandre Herculano and described in the famous stories of Eca de Queiroz. Its elegant salons were frequented by Garrett and Herculano, as well as Ramalho Ortig√£o, Guerra Junqueiro, and Pedro de Oliveira Martins, among others. Clothing stores carried the latest Paris fashions and other luxury products, and department stores were built and set up in the style of Harrods of London or the Galeries Lafayette in Paris, as well as new Luso-Italian cafes like Tavares and Cafe Chiado. Buildings rose and roads were constructed in the new neighbourhoods north of Lisbon, works initiated by the city council with the support of the bourgeoisie. In 1878 the public promenade was demolished; it was replaced in 1886 by the Avenida da Liberdade (Liberty Avenue), designed by Ressano Garcia to be the central urban axis of the city, connecting the Baixa with the newly developed areas of the city and extending into agricultural land in anticipation of further urban expansion. At the head of the avenue was constructed Marquis of Pombal Square (Pra√ßa do Marqu√™s de Pombal), the new geographical centre of Lisbon, from which radiated the newly built avenues of Lisbon. The upper class of Lisbon built palaces on these thoroughfares; the most important was the Avenida Fontes Pereira de Melo, running northeast and ending in the new Pra√ßa Duque de Saldanha, whence it became a part of another great avenue, today Rep√∫blica but initially Ressano Garcia. In the vicinity was the Campo Grande (then an open field and not a Garden) and the new Campo Pequeno bullring, completed in 1892 in a Moorish Revival architectural style. New neighbourhoods were built nearby on plans similar to that of the Baixa, including Campo de Ourique to the west, and Estef√¢nia to the east.Pereira Mata 1996, p. 81 Adjacent to the Estef√¢nia neighbourhood was the grand new avenue Avenida Rainha Dona Am√©lia (now rebuilt as Avenida Almirante Reis), linking it to the Martim Moniz. All these new developments transformed the city. The lower middle class and the common people settled in the eastern side of the city, while the upper middle classes and the wealthy bourgeoisie moved to the western side, with the Baixa being the location of the larger retail establishments. Bandstand in the Jardim da Estrela In the cultural realm, this was the period when bullfighting and fado became popular entertainments, soon joined by the popular theatre and theatrical revues (imported from Paris) which, along with classical comedies and dramas, competed with the new theatres of the capital. A typically Portuguese entertainment of the time was the oratory, a competition in which actors corrupted the old art of Ant√≥nio Vieira, vying for prizes in the performance of florid and usually superficial arguments in song. The first large public gardens were created around this time, imitating Hyde Park in London and the gardens of German cities; the first was the Jardim da Estrela (located opposite the Basilica da Estrela).where the Lisbon bourgeois resorted on the weekends. Socially, the upper classes of Lisbon were now a mix of conservative nobles who were forced to accept, albeit reluctantly, some liberal ideas, and the newly entitled bourgeois who held many conservative ideas. They were joined by the Brazilians, many of them formerly poor and uneducated immigrants who had immigrated to Brazil and grown rich, then returned to the city, eager to find acceptance in higher social circles. Lisbon was the industrial centre of the country, despite its industrialisation being minimal compared to that of England or Germany. The poorer strata of Lisbon society grew exponentially with the arrival of the first workers to man the new factories. They often lived in miserable slums, amidst raging epidemics of cholera and other diseases, working all day just to have enough to eat. Prior liberal governments had betrayed the middle class, whose taxes paid for the luxuries of the leisure classes, but they, receiving nothing in return, were invigorated by a new, more radical liberal movement, which threatened not only the old landowners but also the new capitalist barons and viscounts who depended on the largesse of the state. An alliance between the most educated workers and the middle class was borne of the new radical liberalism, better known as Republicanism because of its opposition to the alliance of former liberals who now depended on the monarchist state (the newly entitled bourgeois) and the conservative monarchists of the old aristocracy, as well as large capitalists, landowners and dependents of the royal court. 1910 Revolution The colors of the Republican Party inspired the flag of Portugal With the emergence of a compromise government between the more right wing Liberals and the more moderate conservatives, as manifested in the constitutional monarchy, the lack of development and further notable reforms in the country led the more left wing Liberal party, made up mostly of middle class partisans, to reformulate its policy objectives. Thus was born a Republican Party that advocated radical liberal reforms such as universal suffrage, the end of the privileges of the Catholic Church and rents given to the nobles, and above all, the overthrow of a political elite discredited by its corruption and incompetence. The country went into debt and was increasingly dependent on the northern provinces of the country. The humiliation of submitting to the ultimatum of 11 January 1890 issued by Great Britain, an allied nation, was undoubtedly a cathartic episode. Britain demanded that Portugal surrender what are now Zambia and Zimbabwe and abandon its plans to acquire lands in this part of Africa that it needed to connect Angola and Mozambique.Jack2007, p. 154 The conditions that made possible the Republican rise to power were above all economic. In the last quarter of the 19th century, a slow but vigorous industrialisation began in Portugal, concentrated in Lisbon and Porto.Pereira Mata1996, p. 128 Although the people of the country remained mostly rural and Catholic, reflexively supporting the king and the Church, a new social class made up of industrial workers formed in Lisbon (and to a lesser extent in Porto and Beira) who shared most of the progressives' ideas. The manufacture of tobacco products and matches were the major industries in Lisbon at the time, but there were also textile, glass, rubber and canning factories, among many others. In total, at the end of the 19th century there would be tens of thousands of workers in various industries out of a total population of over 300,000 people. The first \\"industrial zones\\" of Lisbon were established in the Alc√°ntara, Bom Sucesso and Santo Amaro neighbourhoods, thanks to the production of electricity coming from the Tejo Power Station in Bel√©m. Living conditions for the new working class in Lisbon were miserable. Coming in large numbers from rural areas, they lived in tin shanties in large neighbourhoods with no infrastructure on the outskirts of town, their children often working long hours in the factories. Others came in large groups from the same village, and settled in abandoned lots, tents, and p√°tios in the former parish of Gra√ßa, located at the top of the Castelo hill and known for its courtyards. The first workers' districts appeared at this time, with dwellings built at minimal cost by entrepreneurs to attract the workforce. As the working poor struggled under deteriorating economic conditions and falling wages, the nation came increasingly under the control of an oligarchy of the rich. The first trade unions were organised at this time, many of which were affiliated with anarchists. Instead of joining the new Marxist party as elsewhere in Europe, other workers gathered around the middle and professional classes of the Republican Party, and supported their candidates in the elections of 1899 and 1900.Jack2007, p. 153 As a result, the party, very weak in the north of the country, with the exception of Porto, gained increasing influence in the capital. Despite championing property rights and the free market, the Republicans promised to improve working conditions and pass social measures. However, the upper classes still lived in a society apart, unable to respond to the new political environment except with repression. The result was increasingly violent actions among the populace. Facing republican dissent, Prime Minister Jo√£o Franco dissolved the C√¢mara dos Deputados (Chamber of Deputies) and established an authoritarian government in 1907 with the backing of the elite. He was still in office when the king of Portugal, Carlos I, and his son and heir to the throne, Luis Filipe, were killed in the Terreiro do Pa√ßo on 1 February 1908 by assassins\\"CMH1910\\", p. 272 sympathetic to republican interests and aided by elements within the Portuguese Carbon√°ria, disenchanted politicians and anti- monarchists. In 1909 the workers of Lisbon organised extensive strikes, and in 1910 Lisbon finally revolted. The population formed barricades in the streets and guns were distributed. Ordered to suppress the revolution, the army was decimated by defections. On 5 October of the same year the armed forces deposed the monarchy, ending the government's subordination to the interests of Great Britain. The rest of the country, although still deeply rural, Catholic and conservative, followed the capital's lead and accepted the republican regime, and the First Republic was proclaimed. The writer and politician Te√≥filo Braga was acclaimed President of the Provisional Government of the Portuguese Republic and led the government until approval of the Constitution in 1911, which marked the beginning of the First Republic. The old Republican Party would not survive the creation of the Republic, factions quickly developing between groups within the party to form new organizations. Liberal measures were enacted in 1911 with the passage of the \\"Separation Act\\", or Lei de Separa√ß√£o da Igreja do Estado (Law on the Separation of Church and State), including the right to divorce and the right to strike, as well as social support for workers implemented by creation of the welfare state (Estado Provid√™ncia). Subsequently, the tax structure was modified from a model based on contributions from workers and the middle classes to one that taxed the rich more heavily. The privileges of the nobility and the Church were rescinded, while religious orders were again expelled and some of their property seized by the state. First Republic Sid√≥nio Pais reads a telegram from the British king, George V, congratulating Portugal for its contribution to the allied victory in World War I ‚Äì 1918 On 5 October 1910, Portugal became a republic, ending a monarchy that had endured since the 12th century. The period of the First Portuguese Republic (1910‚Äì1926) was marked by strife and political violence in Lisbon: under a little less than 16 years of republican government, there would be 45 changes of government.WheelerOpello 2010, p. 15 Although the political environment was tense across Europe, with terrorist attacks and riots in even the most developed countries, the situation was more critical in Portugal, with economic and financial havoc. This was a time of upheavals, locally and nationally. The old Republican Party would not survive the creation of the Republic; factions quickly developed between groups within the party and formed new organizations. There was a succession of general strikes (now legal), demonstrations, gunfire exchanges, and even bombings in the streets of Lisbon; the Republican political class was divided on how to handle the situation. In 1912 the monarchists exploited discontent with liberal laws imposed by the Republicans in the north, and launched a coup that failed. In 1916, after Portugal interned German ships in Lisbon, Germany declared war on Portugal. In 1918 the Spanish flu descended on the city, killing many thousands and worsening the situation of the workers, who then revolted several times. Sid√≥nio Pais, the military leader and politician was murdered in central Lisbon on 14 December 1918. As the city's population grew during this period, it continued to expand northward into the broad expanse above Pombal Square and Parque Eduardo VII known as ‚ÄúAvenidas Novas\\",Pereira Mata 1996, p. 80 which became the heart of the fashionable part of Lisbon, where the nouveau riche upper middle class built its grand new residences. This growth was part of the vision of engineer Frederico Ressano Garcia, with wide streets having tree-lined walkways in the middle, although the street grid was laid out unevenly as the area developed. The fa√ßades of the multi- story mansard-roofed buildings were topped by sculptures and painted in the traditional residential colors of the city: yellow, pink and light blue, presenting a characteristic appearance that remains its most visible face. Nearly all of them were built by speculators and small contractors, mostly originating from the city of Tomar, and known colloquially as patos bravos (wild ducks). Some of the new buildings were constructed in haste with little concern for safety, leading to several landslides and fatal accidents in the following years. The First Republic ended in 1926, well into the 20th century, when the anti-democratic conservative right (still led for the most part by the descendants of the old nobility in northern Portugal and the Catholic Church) finally took power after two attempts in 1925, leading eventually to the development of a new ideology and authoritarian government under the leadership of Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar. This was the beginning of the Estado Novo, centred in Lisbon.  Second Republic, or New State  Pra√ßa do Areeiro The New State (Estado Novo) was the corporatist authoritarian regime installed in Portugal in 1933. It evolved from the Ditadura Nacional formed after the coup d'√©tat of 28 May 1926 against the unstable democratic First Republic. Together, the Ditadura Nacional and the Estado Novo encompass the historical period of the Portuguese Second Republic. The New State, inspired by conservative and authoritarian ideologies; was developed by Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar, who ruled Portugal as a dictator from 1932 until 1968, when he had a stroke and was replaced by Marcelo Caetano. The regime was staunchly conservative and nationalistic, opposing communism, socialism, anarchism, liberalism and anti-colonialism. In the 1930s, Duarte Pacheco (1900‚Äì1943), first as Public Works minister and later as Mayor of Lisbon, was responsible for a redefinition of the city's urban area by an innovative concerted action of legislation, architecture and urbanisation. In 1933, Pacheco invited the French urban architect, Alfred Agache (1875‚Äì1959), to draw up an urbanization plan from Terreiro do Pa√ßo to Cascais. 24 July 1933 issue of the newspaper, Di√°rio de Lisboa, announced: ‚ÄúWe Will Modernise the Capital! The French architect Agache came to Lisbon to study the construction of a highway from Lisbon to Cascais\\". This was to be a panoramic coastal road designed to accentuate the Portuguese capital's spectacular location, emphasising its proximity to the sea and associated entertainment and touristic activities, as well as sunbathing areas and thermal spas of cosmopolitan character. Lisbon would be connected to \\"The Costa do Sol\\", a tourist resort with the Palace Hotel and the International Casino, where facilities for golf, horse-riding and horse racing, polo, auto racing, fencing, pigeon shooting and beach sports were available.Agache, A. \\"L‚Äôamenagement de la Costa do Sol (Portugal)\\". Urbanisme. (Mars-Avril, 1936)Agache, A. Lisbonne ‚Äì Urbanisation de la R√©gion Ouest. Paris: Mimeo, 1936 Alameda D. Afonso Henriques In 1938, Duarte Pacheco was appointed mayor of the Lisbon City Council. Under his administration, significant changes were made in town planning policies, including new ordinances to facilitate land appropriation. Pacheco invited √âtienne de Gro√´r to work on a master plan for Lisbon between 1938 and 1948. It was de Gro√´r who planned the renovation of the Baixa and whose actions resulted in: the building of the University Campus of the Instituto Superior T√©cnico (IST) by the architect Porf√≠rio Pardal Monteiro (1897‚Äì1957), the design of an integrated development of the city, the finalisation of the Bairro do Arco do Cego (the precursor of social housing in Lisbon), the widening of the Alameda D. Afonso Henriques, completion of the Luminosa fountain, the building of the National Institute of Statistics, the villas of the Avenida M√©xico and finally the steering of new development in the city to the north.Catarina Teles Ferreira Camarinhas & Vasco Brito, \\"Elementos para o estudo do Plano de Urbaniza√ß√£o da cidade de Lisboa (1938)\\". Cadernos do Arquivo Municipal, n.¬∫ 9 (2007), pp. 182‚Äì183. The Lisbon Marina In 1940 Lisbon hosted The Portuguese World Exhibition (Exposi√ß√£o do Mundo Portugu√™s). The double centenary, celebrated with the Exposi√ß√£o do Mundo Portugu√™s (Portuguese World Exhibition) held between June and December 1940, was the first major cultural event of the Estado Novo (New State) dictatorship and marked the high-point of its \\"nationalist-imperialist\\" propaganda. Staged to commemorate the foundation of the nation in 1140 and the regaining of its independence from Spain in 1640, the Exhibition became a vehicle for the diffusion and legitimisation of the dictatorship's ideology and values in which the idea of the nation was (re)constructed through a series of carefully planned images, myths and symbols. The World Exhibition of Lisbon attracted over 3 million visitors. The site of the trade fair was located between the northern bank of the river Tagus and the Jeronimos Monastery. Today this area covers the Belem Cultural Centre and the gardens directly in front of the Jeronimos Monastery. The marina of Lisbon was constructed expressly for the fair. Despite the preparations for the 1940 Portuguese World Exhibition, Lisbon was the stage of an unusual movement: as the crossroads of the circulation of refugees from World War II, Lisbon was an important meeting place for spies from both sides, given the neutral character of the country. \\"In 1940 Lisbon, happiness was staged so that God could believe it still existed,\\" wrote the French writer Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry. During World War II, Saint-Exupery escaped from France to Portugal and ended up in Lisbon, waiting for a visa to go to America. He was not the only one; the Portuguese capital became a symbol of hope for many refugees. Even Ilsa and Rick, the star-crossed lovers in the film Casablanca, sought a ticket to that \\"great embarkation point.\\" Thousands had flooded the city, trying to obtain the documents necessary to escape to the United States or Palestine. On 26 June the main HIAS-HICEM (Jewish relief organization) European Office was authorised by the Portuguese Government to be transferred from Paris to Lisbon.Steven Spielberg Film and Video Archive ‚Äì Portugal Europe's Crossroads The bridge was originally named the Salazar Bridge (Ponte Salazar), in honor of the Prime Minister In 1956, the Portuguese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Dr Pedro Theotonio Pereira, and Bernard Morgan, a retired solicitor from London, organised the first Tall Ships' Race a race of 20 of the world's remaining large sailing ships. The race was from Torquay, Devon, to Lisbon, and was meant to be a last farewell to the era of the great sailing ships. Public interest was so intense, however, that race organisers founded the Sail Training International Association to direct the planning of future events. Since then Tall Ships' Races have occurred annually in various parts of the world, with millions of spectators. On 6 August 1966, a suspension bridge connecting Lisbon to the municipality of Almada on the left (south) bank of the Tejo river was inaugurated. Because it is a suspension bridge and has similar colouring, it is often compared to the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, United States. The bridge also allowed Lisbon inhabitants direct egress to escape the hassle and the heat of Lisbon on a hot summer day and enjoy the beaches of Costa da Caparica, a continuous 30 km stretch of golden sands, a suitable alternative to the Cascais/Estoril coast. Trigueirinhas of Mouraria Urban renewal projects initiated by the New State razed much of the Mouraria in the 1930s through the 1970s, thus eradicating a considerable amount of the last physical remnants of Moorish Lisbon, the loss of which has become a subject of lament in Lisbon fado. In the later years of the New State's rule, the city had a population boom, driven by economic development and industrial progress. During the 1950s and especially the 1960s, there was a large-scale rural exodus from the provinces to the capital. Surrounding areas were filled with peasants uprooted from farms and dwelling in squalid neighbourhoods. The largest and best known of these was the Brandoa.Barraqu√© 2010, p. 81 From the 1960s onward, government policy was influenced by the technocratic faction in the regime which advocated modernisation projects including expansion of the educational system and industrialisation, leading to a fast-growing national economy with increases in general standards of living and quality of life in the city. Although it is generally agreed that the republic accomplished several notable social and economic achievements, including major improvements in public health and education levels in the period between the end of the Second World War and the 1974 revolution, the New State was finally deposed by the Carnation Revolution (Revolu√ß√£o dos Cravos), launched in Lisbon with a military coup on 25 April 1974. The movement was joined by a popular campaign of civil resistance, leading to the fall of the Estado Novo, the restoration of democracy, and the withdrawal of Portugal from its African colonies and East Timor. The strain of waging the Portuguese Colonial War had overextended and weakened the Portuguese dictatorship, leading to the overthrow of Caetano's regime. Younger military officers, disillusioned by a far-off and taxing war, began to side with the pro-independence resistance against Portugal and eventually led the military coup in Lisbon, ending a dictatorship that had been in power since 1933.  Third Republic  The Carnation revolution of 1974, effectively a bloodless left-wing military coup, installed the Third Republic, and broad democratic reforms were implemented in the country's government. With Portugal's admission to the European Union in 1986, plans to rehouse the huge population living in deprived areas of the city emerged. There are now fewer slums in the capital and its environs, although there are serious problems in those that remain. But even these, such as Mouraria, have seen changes. In 1988, a fire near the historical centre of Chiado greatly disrupted normal life in the area for about 10 years. Another boost to Lisbon's international standing was Expo 98 which opened up a new space in the capital, the Parque das Na√ß√µes (Park of Nations). Expo '98 (1998 Lisbon World Exposition), held to coincide with the commemoration of the 500th anniversary of Vasco da Gama's voyage to India, was exploited by the Portuguese government to perform a thorough renovation of the city. Construction of the Vasco da Gama Bridge, the longest bridge in Europe (including viaducts), with a total length of , had begun in February 1995, and it opened to traffic on 29 March 1998, just in time for the fair. The Exposition's theme was 'The Oceans, a Heritage for the Future'; around 11 million visitorsOECD 2008, p. 57 attended in 132 days, with 155 countries and organizations represented. Expo '98 shut down on 30 September 1998, and the site remained closed until February 1999, when it reopened as Parque das Na√ß√µes (Park of the Nations), a free-access park, keeping the gardens, Oceanarium (Europe's then largest aquarium), observation tower, funicular, and the Virtual Reality pavilion. The area thrives today, attracting 18 million tourists a year to its gardens, museums, commercial areas and modern buildings. It has also become a permanent residential area for up to 25,000 people and one of Lisbon's premier business centres, with many multinational corporations having their headquarters in its main avenue. The city has also hosted meetings of the Ibero-American Summit as well as of the Portuguese- speaking African countries, or PALOP, (Pa√≠ses Africanos de L√≠ngua Oficial Portuguesa). The real impetus to Lisbon's modernization came when Portugal joined the European Union (EU). The city received significant funds for land redevelopment and urban renewal, and was chosen the European Capital of Culture in 1994. The Lisbon Strategy was an agreement between the EU nations based on measures to improve the European economy, signed in the city in March 2000. Sessions of the European Council were held in Lisbon in which the ministerial meetings and the agreements to be worked out between members of the European Community, known as the Bologna Process, were approved, having been first proposed in the Italian city. 21st century Plataforma ferroviaria da Gare do Oriente Reforms made by local government in the first years of the 21st century established the administrative region of the Lisbon metropolitan area. Lisbon's metro system was expanded with the addition of several new stations, among them the transportation hub of Gare do Oriente, designed by the Spanish neofuturistic architect, Santiago Calatrava, and finished in time for the Expo '98 world's fair on land east of the city centre in Parque das Na√ß√µes (Park of Nations). The station has since reached a ridership of 75 million passengers per year. Lisbon's international airport is located in the city centre, but with no room to expand, may soon have problems meeting demand. Portuguese modern architecture: buildings at Parque das Na√ß√µes, Lisbon Between 1999 and 2001, Lisbon hosted various world sport championships including the 1999 World Junior Basketball Championship, the 2000 Bowling World Championship, the 2000 Masters Cup in Tennis, the 2001 Cycling World Championships, the 2001 Fencing World Championship, and the 2001 Indoor Athletics World Championships. The city acquired the Museu do Design e da Moda (Museum of Design and Fashion) in 2002. This small museum, located in the architecturally distinctive former Banco Nacional Ultramarino building, features displays of fashion and industrial design, grouped by decade. These consist of about a thousand objects of furniture and utilitarian design, as well as 1200 pieces of haute couture representing remarkable moments in high fashion of the 20th and 21st centuries. On 3 November 2005, Lisbon hosted the MTV European Music Awards at the Pavilh√£o Atl√¢ntico. The show was opened by a leotard-clad Madonna, who exploded from a shiny disco ball to the tune \\"Hung Up\\". Lisbon is also the host city for the Portuguese editions of Rock in Rio, the largest rock festival in the world. On 7 July 2007, Lisbon was the site of the election ceremony of the \\"New 7 Wonders Of The World\\" in the Est√°dio da Luz, with live transmission to millions of people around the world. Aerial view of the Campo Pequeno bullring after its 2006 renovation The Campo Pequeno bullring (Pra√ßa de Touros do Campo Pequeno), Lisbon's bullfighting arena, built between 1890 and 1892 in neo-Mud√©jar style, is located in the Campo Pequeno Square by the Avenida da Rep√∫blica. After a major renovation, it reopened as a multi-event venue in 2006, designed to be used for various events besides bullfighting. Including an underground shopping centre, restaurants and a parking lot, it features a range of live performances, with many famous bands having performed there. Immigrants who came to Lisbon in the early years of the 21st century from the Portuguese-speaking African countries (PALOP), especially Angola and Guinea, now constitute a large proportion of the city's immigrant population. The majority of them arrived before the economic crisis of 2008 to fill the demand for workers in the service sector and in the construction of large public works projects. As in the past, Lisbon has a network of outdoor vegetable gardens (hortas) providing fresh produce to residents of many of the traditional neighbourhoods in the city, although today they are officially sanctioned and regulated. Fado was often performed in the hortas of Mouraria and the Alfama during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The Treaty of Lisbon, signed in December 2007, was the premier European Union event held in Portugal. The document was designed to improve the functioning of the Union by amending the Treaty on European Union as well as the treaty establishing the European Community. The most important reforms introduced were mitigating the chances of deadlock in the Council of the European Union, increasing the legislative and budgetary powers of the European Parliament, reducing the number of members of the European Commission, abandoning the three pillars of the European Union, and creating the positions of President of the European Council and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to provide greater consistency and continuity to EU policies. The NATO Lisbon Summit of 2010 (19‚Äì20 November) convened to cement NATO'S new \\"Strategic Concept\\", a plan aiming to implement better coordination between the military and civilian organisations and to address the economic concerns of member states, as well as new threats such as cyberattacks.http://www.nato.int/docu/review/2010/lisbon-summit/EN/index.htm These summit meetings are regarded as a periodic opportunity for the Heads of State and Heads of Government of NATO member countries to evaluate and provide strategic direction for Alliance activities.

According to boxrec.com, \\"West complained of double vision between the 6th and 7th rounds. After he was hurt to the body by Bassett, he was floored by a right hand. As he fell, he landed hard on his head. West died of injuries suffered in this bout on December 21st. The official cause of death was given as a 'inter-cerebral hemorrhage resulting from a cerebral concussion.'\\" Notes Category:Boxers from Washington, D.C.

On January 2, 2006, Bishop began working on The Adam Carolla Show as a call screener. On May 4, 2006, Bishop filled in for Mike Lynch, the show's sound effects person, while Lynch was getting married. When Lynch was promoted to writer, Bishop became the show's permanent sound effects person and the call screener position was filled by Kyle Baugher. LAist described Bryan as \\"a sound-effects wizard, and ultra quick-witted third-man\\". = Role on The Adam Carolla Show = Bishop occasionally participates in both conversations and performances on the show. One of Bishop's hallmarks is providing prerecorded verbalized and audio commentary by triggering humorous and relevant sound effects. Examples of Bishop's sound effects include the \\"correct answer\\" and \\"incorrect answer\\" bells/buzzers from Family Feud, or sentences spoken by others on the show, out of context. Bishop's sound effects are often referred to as \\"drops\\" on the show.

Brain tumor  On Adam Carolla's Podcast in May 2009 Bishop stated he was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor (a low-grade glioma located in the brainstem). Keith Black, the chairman of Neurosurgery at Cedars-Sinai Hospital, referred Bishop to a specialized team who pursued treatment involving radiation and chemotherapy. No official update on his prognosis has been made public, though Bishop indicated Black and his team have a more positive outlook than the initial prognosis. On October 21, 2009, Bishop appeared on Carolla's podcast and reported that his most recent MRI showed that the tumor had shrunk significantly and his treatment is ongoing. Bishop announced that he is undergoing therapy using the angiogenesis inhibiting drug, Avastin. Bishop announced on the same podcast that, because he is undergoing radiation treatments which might result in him becoming sterile, he has made deposits at a sperm bank as a precaution in advance of his pending nuptials. Bishop and his wife had a healthy daughter in 2016 through natural conception. Carolla hosted a fundraiser \\"Laughs for Bald Bryan\\" in November 2009, which included performances by Jimmy Kimmel, Larry Miller, Greg Fitzsimmons, and others.

Organizations are able to disseminate and coordinate emergency alerts and warning messages through NAWAS and other public systems by means of the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System. NAWAS is operated and fully funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Today, the system consists of what is essentially a 2200+ telephone party line. The phone instruments are designed to provide protection for lightning strikes so they may be used during storms. The interconnecting lines provide some protection by avoiding local telephone switches. This ensures they are available even when the local system is down or overloaded. NAWAS has major terminals at each state Emergency Operations CenterEmergency Alert System Update ‚Äì Martin Bongers,Project Officer, Integrated Public Alert and Warning System, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and State Emergency Management Facility.

This information includes acts of terrorism including Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) after aircraft incidents/accidents, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, nuclear incidents/accidents, severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, tsunamis and winter storms/blizzards. NAWAS allows issuance of warnings to all stations nationwide or to selected stations as dictated by the situation.

Series 1 was set in the depressed economic coalfields of 1927, while Series 2 was set in 1944 as World War II draws to a close. Series 2 was broadcast on BBC across the UK from October 2009 Plot The series follows three or more families who are placed in a location which replicates the lifestyle of Welsh people living in a coal mining town of that period. The chosen families leave all 21st century luxuries behind, swapping a modern high-tech life for a miner's cottage in Stack Square in the Welsh hills of Blaenavon. The mines are owned by Mr. Blanford, and are up the hills. Men and boys over the age of 14 are required to work in the mines. Production =Series 1= Filmed from early October 2007 and shown from late October 2007, three families (the Cartwright family from Penarth, the Griffiths family from Ceredigion; and the Phillips family from the Vale of Glamorgan), cope with daily life as the Welsh mining community lived it 80 years ago - a year after the last general strike and before the pits were nationalised. For the men and boys over 14 there was the harsh reality of long walks to work over mountains in all weather, to face a long day as coal miners at Blaentillery No.2 Mine - the last working mine of its kind in the UK. Meanwhile, the women had to run the home under 1927 conditions, keeping the children fed, watered and clean. Even making a cup of tea involved the hard work of collecting water from a pump and lighting a fire. A special hour-length final episode was recorded which included footage from a Hunger March Concert held at Park Street Chapel, Blaenafon. Blaenavon Male Voice Choir took part in the concert, along with members of the Coal House families who sang and recited verse.Great Turnout for BBC Coalhouse Hunger March Concert =Series 2= Series 2, titled Coal House At War, was filmed in October 2008 in the same Blaenavon location, but set in 1944. Three families - the Griffiths family from Ammanford, the Paisey family from Cardiff, and the Tranter Davies family from Merthyr Tydfil - live life as it was in a mining community during World War II. In an attempt to gain an insight into how people lived during the war, they swapped a hectic twenty-first century life for a more simplified way of living. As in the first series, the men - and boys aged over fourteen - had to work a long day as coal miners at Blaentillery No. 2 Mine. Once again, they have to cope with the demands of the mine owner, Mr Blanford. The men of the family were also expected to do their duty in the Home Guard after a long day underground. Mines were considered a target, so inclusion in the Home Guard was vital. The women had to run the home under 1944 conditions, which included war work and feeding their families with limited rations. The families were joined by evacuees and Bevin Boys, who were conscripted to fight and then sent to dig for coal. Setting The series is filmed mostly on location in period cottages at Stack Square, Blaenavon. The Stack Square cottages were built between 1789 and 1792 to house part of the Blaenavon Ironworks workforce.Blaenavon historic landscape Coal House Diary In 2008, Gwen Cartwright, a 12-year-old participant in series one, published her diary of her experience ‚Äî Coal House Diary.Pont Books.

The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on August 4, 2009. Plot The story is set in the year 2707.The world is loosely based on that of the Mutant Chronicles role-playing game, where many technologies are steam powered and mankind has exhausted Earth's natural resources. The protagonists must battle against mutated humans that were accidentally unleashed. The plot revolves around a \\"machine\\" which came from space 10,000 years ago. The \\"machine\\" mutates people into barely intelligent killing drones, known as \\"mutants\\", that drag new victims to the machine for conversion. Sealed away thousands of years ago by human tribes, the machine is accidentally uncovered during a large battle in Eastern Europe between two of the four corporations that now rule the world. Within six weeks the world is almost completely conquered by the mutant gangs. Some of the population has been evacuated to Mars, but millions remain on the doomed Earth. A group of soldiers are assembled to take another ancient device to the heart of the machine in an attempt to destroy it in a suicide mission. In return, their loved ones receive coveted tickets to Mars. En route their spaceship is shot down by a kamikaze airship piloted by a mutant. The group is forced to battle through the mutants in tunnels to reach the machine, hoping to save the last of humanity. In their attempt to reach the machine most die, with Mitch being partially transformed into a mutant and Brother Samuel being fully transformed. Mitch is able to halt his own transformation, but is forced to kill Brother Samuel. Mitch, being the last survivor, is ultimately successful in activating the ancient device, causing the machine (which was actually part of a spacecraft) to blast off into space. A dying and mutated Samuel tells him to \\"have faith\\" as Mitch jumps from the slowly ascending rocket, landing in an underground lake beneath the rocket. Crawling onto land he sees the rocket disappear into the sky, realizing he is the prophesied savior of mankind, despite not believing in a god. Grievously wounded and partially mutated, he lights a final crooked cigarette.

The process involves sending a request from the visa issuing post to the Department of State's headquarters in Washington, D.C., to investigate an individual's case for possible espionage, terrorism, and illegal export of technology out of the United States. Apart from the Department of State, the process involves other agencies of the federal government of the United States, especially those under Department of Homeland Security. Some of the agencies involved are: FBI, CIA, Drug Enforcement Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, and the Department of State's Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation. The process may also include checking with Interpol. The process for issuing a United States visa, possibly including a Visas Mantis check SAOs have been the source of long delays for determining if a non-U.S. citizen should be issued a visa or not. As a result, United States Government Accountability Office found in a report dated February 2004 that \\"students and scholars with science backgrounds might decide not to come to the United States, and technological advancements that serve U.S. and global interests could be jeopardized\\" as a result. In mid-2003, SAOs were submitted for about 2% of the applicants. The Department of State processed 245,000 SAOs in FY 2006, and has processed over a million SAOs in the period from September 2001 to May 2007. Types There are various types of SAOs, usually named after various animals, with two named after legendary characters. As of August 2006, these included: * Visas Mantis: potential illegal transfer of sensitive or dual-use technology, which was introduced in 1998 * Visas Bear: for foreign government officials, representatives to international organizations, and their families * Visas Donkey: name hits, certain nationalities * Visas Merlin: refugees and asylees * Visas Eagle: certain nationals of Cuba, China, Iran, Russia * Visas Condor: certain nationalities, introduced in January 2002 * Visas Hawk: for immigrant visas * Visas Viper: for suspected terrorists There are also other types of SAOs used for notifying the Department of State about visa issuance and that the applicant will be traveling to the United States, including: * Visas Horse: diplomatic visa holders of certain nationalities * Visas Pegasus: officials of Commonwealth of Independent States Validity period The validity of the clearance (which specifies a deadline for the time a visa could be issued) is based on its type, and ranges between three and 48 months. During the period of validity, posts can usually issue another visa for the applicant without requesting a new SAO if the applicant's circumstances have not changed much. Issuing time The Department of State claims that 80% of SAOs are cleared within two weeks, but the general expected time for a clearance is unknown. While various diplomatics posts mention some average times (the website of the United States embassy in Ankara, Turkey, mentions up to six to eight weeks), this only reflects the recent experience of the post, and does not reflect actual statistics. The Department of State's Foreign Affairs Manual (which is a reference for diplomatic posts), dated August 16, 2006, mentions: According to a report by the United States Government Accountability Office, as of November 30, 2004, 87% of Visas Mantis cases (one of the various kinds of SAOs) has been cleared in 30 days or less, 5% were taking 31‚Äì60 days, 5% were taking 61‚Äì90 days, 1% were taking 91‚Äì120 days and the final 2% were taking more than 120 days. The average time was 15 days, which was significantly reduced, as the same report mentions that during October 2003, the average was 75 days. On February 11, 2005, the Department of State mentioned that it \\"has been able to decrease the average time to obtain Visas Mantis clearance to less than 14 days\\". A presentation attributed to the Department of State dated November 6, 2008, says that the average time the Visas Mantis clearances take as 6 to 8 weeks. According to the U.S. Department of State website, most cases applied for in Beijing should be cleared within 60 days, but 90 days are also expected. As of February 2010, the U.S. consulate in Dubai is reporting that administrative processing can delay some applications for 175 days (~6 months) or more. As reported by some Chinese media in 2019, the U.S. consulate in China delayed over 1000 Chinese F-1 applications for over 6 months, most of whom are graduate STEM students.

The game retailed for the low price of $9.99, a response by Take-Two to the recent decision of Sony to drop PlayStation licensing fees. Similar to the earlier PlayStation title Twisted Metal, players control a powerful tank-like armored vehicle, which they used to destroy enemy vehicles, weapons, and generators, solve puzzles, and collect tokens to upgrade their weapons. There are a total of twenty-three missions, and the game allows two players to battle each other in split screen multiplayer. Upon its release, Grudge Warriors was received unfavorably; critics bashed the game as having mediocre graphics, poor sounds, and botched gameplay. IGN and Gaming Age declared the game was not even worth the low price of ten dollars. Despite the overwhelmingly critical reception, there were a few points of the game that were praised, including the occasional puzzles during missions. Gameplay Screenshot of the ‚Äò‚ÄôGrudge Warriors‚Äô‚Äô campaign Grudge Warriors places the player in control of one of eleven special armored cars. Each one is equipped with five types of weaponry. Four of the weapons are similar on all the cars; the fifth weapon is unique to the vehicle. In single-player, the objective for each mission is to destroy enemy tanks, gun emplacements, vehicles, and generators; there are always eight at each base which must be destroyed. In addition, players can collect tokens as an optional objective; these tokens allow for upgrades and boost the player's score. Some generators can only be reached by solving puzzles; for example, toggling switches which lower otherwise-impenetrable shields surrounding a generator. Every player vehicle features both armor and health; powerups which replenish both can be found scattered throughout the maps. In addition, the player has only a finite amount of ammunition for each weapon. When the player's health is reduced to zero, the game is over and the mission must be restarted. In addition to the campaign, Grudge Warriors supports two-player splitscreen combat on one of seven multiplayer maps. Unlike the single-player, there are no objectives other than destroying the opponents' vehicle, and no other turrets or enemies besides the other player. Plot Grudge Warriors takes place in a dystopian future Earth, where nations and governments have been replaced with rival thugs and gangs. These gangs not only stage raids and assaults on their enemies, but also run \\"Death Rings\\", where the most powerful gangs have duels between their highly armored vehicles. There are a total of eleven gangs, who each occupy different parts of the world, operating from strongholds. Players assume the role of an upstart gang member who is attempting to defeat his rivals. Players are allowed to begin the mission by selecting a gang and car; the player then proceeds to play through the campaign using that vehicle. Each mission starts with the player being dropped off at an enemy base, then fighting through defenses to destroy the team's generators. If the player defeats all ten rival gangs, he or she will be invited to fight \\"the Crime Lord\\", head of the Death Rings. Reception The game received \\"unfavorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. IGN noted that Grudge Warriors' \\"manual reads like a Twisted Metal rip-off. The game controls mirror Twisted Metal. Even the title‚ÄîGrudge Warriors‚Äîis Twisted Metal-ish\\", yet the publication compared its gameplayer to Blaster Master. The publication praised both the bizarre setup of the game, and the fully playable nature of the game as soon as the disc was inserted; the praised ended there. IGN strongly criticized the fundamental gameplay, where it took a player thousands of shots to destroy a single enemy, which combined with poor camera control led to constant frustration. GameSpot noted that the single-player mode was essentially deathmatch with some slight semblance of objectives thrown in, and decided the title was \\"best ignored by fans of meaningful gameplay\\". The sound was similarly lambasted for being cheap and lackluster. Gaming Age found that though the added complexity and puzzle-solving to find the generators was enjoyable at first, it grew boring after all enemies on the match were dispatched, and the player was left running in circles to find the last generator.

Bredenbury is located on Highway 16 in eastern Saskatchewan. As of the 2016 Canadian Census, the population of Bredenbury was 372. The main industries in the area are farming as well as potash mining near Esterhazy. The community is known in the area for its enthusiastic Christmas light displays which have won national awards. History Bredenbury received a post office in 1890 and was incorporated in 1913. The town was named for Bredenbury Court, located near Bredenbury, Herefordshire. The court was the manor home of William Henry Barneby, who traveled three times (in 1881, 1883, 1888) to western Canada and wrote books about his experiences. Geography Bredenbury is located on the Yellowhead Highway (#16). It is 41 kilometres southeast of Yorkton and 50 km west of the Manitoba border. Bredenbury is approximately 2.5 hours from Regina and four hours from Winnipeg. The surrounding land is mainly used for agriculture and ranching. Economy Bredenbury has an economy based largely on agriculture, potash mining and the railway, along with their supporting businesses. A CPR main line runs through the town. There are railway car cleaning and fertilizer plants in Bredenbury as well. Demographics Education There are no public schools in Bredenbury itself. Students are bussed to Saltcoats for elementary school and to Yorkton for high school. Bredenbury Elementary School closed in 2001. The school building in the town is currently empty. The Mennonites operate a private parochial school: the Countryside School. Christmas lights Christmas in Bredenbury started out relatively small with a single street that dubbed itself 'Candy Cane Lane' and sported matching red and white candy canes down the length of the entire street. In subsequent years, the rest of the town has caught that same spirit, and the town is home to a special 'Light Up' ceremony at the beginning of December each year, along with elaborate displays at private homes, businesses and empty lots throughout the town. Bredenbury has won the national WinterLights competition for communities with populations under 1,000 in 2001, 2002 and 2005. As a result of the community involvement with the Christmas celebrations, Bredenbury has hosted the CPR Holiday Train, with performers such as Tom Jackson. Bredenbury hosted the Holiday Train again in 2007, when the featured performers were Wide Mouth Mason and Melanie Doane.

Research efforts at MSL focus on understanding fundamental atomic-scale properties of materials using a wide range of atomic-scale modeling techniques. These methods include first-principles density functional theory, tight-binding, classical interatomic potentials, and molecular dynamics simulations. Structural, mechanical, electronic, and transport properties of advanced materials such as diamond, silicon, organic thin films and single molecules, metal/oxide and metal/organic interfaces, and energetic molecular crystals are of particular interest. All the problems addressed have a tight connection with experimental work being performed by MSL collaborators around the world. Although the dynamical interplay between experiment and theory is the key to success in developing an understanding of the fundamental physics and chemistry of materials, the goal is to use the powerful arsenal of atomic- scale modeling and analytic techniques to attack the problems that are difficult or impossible to study by experiment. For example, the behavior of matter at extreme conditions such as shock compression of materials is studied by molecular dynamics which allows us to investigate the phenomena at sub- nanometer length and sub-picosecond time scales. These time and length scales can not be experimentally studied at the same level of detail as done by theory/modeling.

It starred Rupert Davies and Sheila Keith. The story focuses around Dorothy and Edmund Yates, who have recently been released from a mental asylum, and is one of Pete Walker's most notable films. Plot 1974, the present. Dorothy Yates lives with her husband Edmund in an isolated farmhouse in Haslemere, Surrey. They have just been released from a mental institution to which they were committed in 1957 after it was found Dorothy was a cannibal who killed and partially ate at least six people. It is later revealed that her cannibalism can be understood as an attempt to cope with a childhood trauma when she found out that she had eaten parts of her pet rabbit that her parents had cooked and served as dinner. Although her husband Edmund was convicted, it is later revealed that he only faked his dementia in order to remain with his wife. He is a truly devoted husband who loves his wife dearly and does not take part in the actual acts of murder in 1957 and in the present, only helping in covering them up. Now, it seems as if Dorothy has had a severe relapse. She secretly lures lonely young people to her home, promising tea and a tarot card reading, only with the sessions ending with a violent murder and \\"feast\\". Jackie, Edmund's daughter by previous marriage, lives in London but secretly visits her dad and stepmum at night to bring her parcels containing animal brain, thereby implicitly feigning to commit murders for her so as to contain Dorothy's murderous urges. At the same time, Jackie tries to control her 15-year-old stepsister Debbie, Dorothy's actual daughter that she and Edmund had shortly before being committed to the asylum. Debbie has been recently thrown out of the orphanage. She now stays with Jackie and rides with her boyfriend Alec, head of a violent biker gang. Debbie incites Alec to start a fight with a barman in one of London's hip nightclubs because he denied her liquor due to her being underage. When they get thrown out, the bike gang later ambush and assault the barman with a chain but leave when spotted. Debbie, however, decides to stay behind and hides the body in the trunk of a car before the police arrive. When Jackie berates Debbie for coming home late, they have a severe argument in which Debbie in turn asks where Jackie goes at night. When Jackie discovers Debbie's bloodied jacket and finds out from her that she was involved in the barman's murder, she and her boyfriend Graham, an investigative psychiatrist who has in the meantime himself found out about Jackie's family history, lead the police to the body in the trunk, which is missing an eye - a wound that could not have been inflicted with a chain and is reminiscent of the wounds inflicted by Dorothy on her victims. As it is thus revealed, Debbie and Dorothy have been secretly meeting without Jackie's knowledge, and Debbie has apparently taken on her mum's pathological urges herself. Meanwhile, Debbie escapes with Alec to the Haslemere house, where Dorothy kills Alec. Jackie suggests that Graham call on her stepmum, and he goes there alone to talk to Dorothy, with Jackie following shortly after. When Graham arrives, Debbie reveals his identity to Dorothy, who kills him. When Jackie arrives, she encounters her dad alone, who tells her they feel Debbie belongs more to them than she. She starts looking for Graham and finds Dorothy and Debbie disposing of his body in the attic. As Dorothy and Debbie circle in on her, Edmund, who has followed her there, blocks the door. As Jackie cries for his help, the film closes with a freeze frame of Edmund restraining his urges to come to her aid and looking in dismay at his daughter's imminent demise.

The problem is that there is absolutely no exposition or analysis, no flexibility about the theme; still contained within a basic formula, it tends to leave a highly unpleasant aftertaste\\"; while Allmovie wrote \\"Frightmare is a potent little chiller that is worth a look to horror fans in search of suitably grim fare from the 1970's and a worthy testament to Pete Walker's distinctive genre skills\\"; and DVD Talk wrote, \\"one of Peter Walker's best known and best remembered films, Frightmare gave the director the chance to really capitalize on his working relationship with oddball actress Sheila Keith and give her a starring role that fit her unusual looks and acting style perfectly. At the same time, Frightmare also stands as an excellent example of the type of darkly humorous and semi-satirical horror movies that Walker excelled in, the kind that weren't afraid to rub the viewers nose in the dirt a little bit or to give the establishment the big middle finger salute.\\"  References  External links Category:1974 films Category:1974 horror films Category:1974 independent films Category:1970s slasher films Category:British films Category:British horror films Category:British slasher films Category:British independent films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Pete Walker Category:Films set in Surrey Category:Films scored by Stanley Myers Category:Films about cannibalism Category:British serial killer films ","title":"Frightmare (1974 film)"},{"id":"14076943","text":"The JFK Expressway is a short freeway connecting the Belt Parkway with John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens, New York City. It interchanges with the Nassau Expressway (New York State Route 878 or NY 878) near the former proposed south end of the Clearview Expressway (Interstate 295 or I-295). The roadway is the newest expressway in New York City, opened in December 1991. Route description JFK Expressway crosses over Rockaway Boulevard The JFK Expressway begins on the grounds of John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens, New York City. The road has southbound ramps that provide access to Terminals 1-2-3, Terminal 4, and Terminals 5-6-7 along with the parking areas to Terminals 4 and 5. The northbound direction has access from all these points. The northbound direction has an exit that provides access to the I-678 (Van Wyck Expressway) that also provides access to long-term parking, rental car returns, as well as return access to the terminals. There is also a southbound entrance from I-678. North of here, the road continues north as a four-lane freeway, with a southbound exit and northbound entrance to Terminal 8. In the area, the road passes under the AirTrain JFK people mover that serves the airport. The JFK Expressway passes under airport runways in a tunnel as a six-lane road and comes to an interchange with South Cargo Road, which provides access to Cargo Areas, Medical Building, Vetport, Airport Services, as well as a return route to the terminals. The road turns to the north again and interchanges with 150th Street, with access to Long Term Parking, Rental Car Returns, and General Aviation. This interchange has no northbound exit, with the South Cargo Road interchange serving as the northbound exit. The JFK Expressway comes to an interchange with NY 878 (Nassau Expressway) with a northbound exit to the eastbound direction, which provides access to Rockaway Boulevard, and a northbound exit and entrance in both directions to the westbound direction, which also provides access to I-678 and the westbound Belt Parkway. The expressway has a northbound exit and southbound entrance with eastbound NY 27 (South Conduit Avenue) before merging into the eastbound direction of the Belt Parkway. Along the southbound lanes of the JFK Expressway just south of the junction with NY 27, there is an incomplete \\"stub\\" ramp that was to lead to the westbound lanes of NY 878, which were supposed to be built as far as Cross Bay Boulevard. The $80 million extension was cancelled in 1995. History Prior to the construction of the JFK Expressway, the right-of-way was occupied by Cornell Creek, which flowed through Beaver Pond and Baisley Pond into Jamaica Bay. 150th Street, originally Three Mile Mill Road, was later laid out along the banks of the creek. The construction of JFK Airport made the creek subterranean, depressed underground. The Van Wyck Expressway (Interstate 678) was first opened in 1950, connecting the airport to the Grand Central Parkway, and later extended north to the Whitestone Expressway. At the time, it was the only expressway connected to the airport. Consequently, traffic jams often backed up the expressway for several miles north. What is now the JFK Expressway was first proposed in the 1960s by the Port Authority, as a second short highway on the east side of the airport. The new expressway would have connected to a southern extension of the Clearview Expressway (today's Interstate 295), providing a second north-south expressway route to the airport and connecting to the Throgs Neck Bridge. The connection to the Clearview would have been direct as a single expressway, or indirect and connected by the Nassau Expressway, depending on the routing of the Clearview Extension. The existing portion of Clearview Expressway was completed in 1963 as part of Interstate 78. Due to a freeway revolt, it was only completed as far south as Hillside Avenue (NY 25); the expressway was to continue south from Hillside Avenue to NY 27 (Conduit Avenue) or the Nassau Expressway in Laurelton, with Interstate 78 proceeding west across Queens, Brooklyn, and Manhattan to the Holland Tunnel. The section of Clearview Expressway between Conduit and Hillside Avenues was deemed too disruptive to the surrounding neighborhoods. It, and the rest of I-78 between the Holland Tunnel and the existing Clearview spur were cancelled by Governor Nelson Rockefeller in March 1971. The JFK Expressway was built as part of a costly overhaul of the JFK Airport that began in the late 1980s. The highway was provisionally referred to as the 150th Street Airport Expressway or 150th Street Expressway, after the street it was replacing. The first portion to open was the junction with the Nassau Expressway and 150th Street, the second major entrance to the airport, which was completed around 1986. In 1991, the JFK Expressway was completed. The JFK Expressway, lying almost exclusively within JFK Airport, is maintained by the airport's operator, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ), along with the portions of the Van Wyck Expressway on airport grounds and all other airport roadways.

His childhood name was Taminosuke (Ê∞ë‰πãÂä©) or Sensabur≈ç (ÂçÉ‰∏âÈÉé) In 1835, when Matsudaira Naritsugu (who was his brother-in- law from his sister, Asahime) died without an heir, he was chosen by the shogunate to become daimy≈ç of Fukui Domain.

During the short period that he was daimy≈ç, Narisawa had no impact on domain affairs.

The school opened in 2006 as the only modern for-profit medical school in the United States, although several other for-profit schools have since opened. RVU's College of Osteopathic Medicine (RVUCOM) grants the degree of Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine and admitted its inaugural class of medical students at the Parker, Colorado campus in August 2008.  History  Rocky Vista University opened in 2006, and the first class was admitted in 2008. In 2017, a second campus was opened in Ivins, Utah, admitting its first class of osteopathic medical students in the fall of 2017. The college is fully accredited by the American Osteopathic Association Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation, and regionally by the Higher Learning Commission. The school graduated its inaugural class on May 19, 2012. Academics =Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine= The college in 2015. RVUCOM offers the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) degree, which follows a systems-based, 4-year (8-semester) curriculum. Years 1 and 2 of the program consist primarily of classroom-based learning, focusing on the basic health sciences. As an enhancement to the general medical education, students of the college are offered the opportunity to enroll in one of four \\"Honors Tracks.\\" Each track has a distinct emphasis on either Rural, Global, or Military Medical Practice, or on Medical Research/Academia. Years 3 and 4 of the curriculum consist of clinical clerkships (Rotations) in major medical specialties. Under the supervision of practicing physicians, these clerkships are intended to train students to become competent medical providers in a variety of healthcare settings. Clerkship sites for RVUCOM students include various hospitals and clinics in the states of Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, Arizona and South Dakota. =Physician Assistant= A Master of Physician Assistant Studies (MPAS) program is currently in development and the initial cohort of students was matriculated in September, 2018. The program is currently offered at the Parker, Colorado, RVUCOM campus only. It follows a 2-semester, didactic phase, followed by a 5-semester, clinical phase. The didactic phase provides students with core foundational concepts, while the clinical phase prepares students for competency in the \\"entrustable professional activities\\" (EPA) (competencies a student must achieve to successfully enter the physician assistant profession). The program has currently been granted Accreditation- Provisional status from the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant (ARC-PA). Admission to the program does not require completion of prerequisite academic coursework, however, the institution does provide applicants with a list of recommended prerequisite coursework, the completion of which is strongly recommended prior to submitting an application for admission. Additionally, admission to the program requires the successful completion of a bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited university with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.8 (on a 4.0 scale). Applicants will also be expected to obtain a minimum of 1,000 hours of paid, healthcare-relevant experience prior to matriculation. =Graduate Studies= Rocky Vista University offers a 9-month (30 semester hour) graduate program on both campuses leading to the Master of Science in Biomedical Sciences (MSBS) degree. The program is designed for students looking to strengthen their competitiveness and academic background for admission to professional health programs. Admission to the program requires the successful completion of a bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited college or university with a minimum GPA of 2.75 (on a 4.0 scale). All prerequisite coursework must have been successfully completed with a grade of ‚ÄúC‚Äù or better. Students completing the program, who then pursue admission to RVUCOM, are evaluated by their MSBS program director and faculty. These evaluators provide recommendations to the RVUCOM admissions committee regarding the student‚Äôs academic preparedness and aptitude of success in medical school. For-profit status RVUCOM is notable for being the first modern day, for-profit medical school operating in the United States. As such, its opening generated controversy. Critics raise concerns that a for-profit school will be beholden to investors, and lack credibility. Supporters say that the school is held to the same academic and accreditation standards as other medical schools. Rocky Vista LLC was founded by Yife Tien and his wife Lucy Chua Tien, MD in 2006 and governed by a Board of Trustees. Castle Pines Holdings LLC was established as a holding company to control the Tiens' interest in Rocky Vista LLC and provide stability in the event of Tien's death or incapacity. In 2019, the ownership of Rocky Vista University was transferred to Medforth Global Healthcare Education.

The bill was introduced by U.S. Senator Robert Packwood of Oregon, and was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan on October 22, 1986. Reasoning 'Freight forwarders' aggregate shipments from a variety of sources to be put on common or contract carriers for transportation. Such entities are also commonly called transportation brokers. They perform two basic economic functions. One is making matches between transport demands and transport capacity on a flexible basis, calling on whatever carriers are available at a given time and place instead of being limited to the capabilities on just one or a few carrier organizations. The second function is providing a means of aggregating, or massing, a number of small demands from different entities into shipment sizes which can be efficiently and economically transported. This capacity allows smaller shippers to obtain transport arrangements more nearly equivalent to the arrangements available to larger shippers. The capital requirements for this service are not, usually, great. Thus, the field is open to many entrants, and can be highly competitive as among the forwarders or brokers. In the era of close economic regulation of transportation in the United States, the interstate Commerce Commission restricted entry into the market forwarders and brokers, allowing them limited access to the transport market, and limiting substantially the extent to which they could perform the services described above. Law This Act had the following major components * Interstate Commerce Commission authority to regulate the prices charged by general commodities 'forwarders' and brokers was eliminated. * Interstate Commerce Commission Authority to require a license to conduct general commodities forwarding was eliminated, making entry into this field easy. * Interstate Commerce Commission authority to govern the contracts between general commodities forwarder (and brokers) and carriers was eliminated. Effects The 1980 passage of the Staggers Act and the Motor Carrier Act of 1980 substantially freed up both rail and motor carrier markets. The express intent of these Acts was to make carrier transport more flexible, efficient, and competitive. By the time of passage of the Surface Freight Forwarder Deregulation Act, participants in and observers of domestic U.S. transport markets had come to a judgment that there was no need to regulate the transportation intermediaries whose functions contributed to this flexibility and efficiency, and who individually had little 'market power'. The effect of this Act was to eliminate economic regulation of the general commodities transport forwarder sector. Limited ICC controls as to the entry and practices of household goods forwarders was retained. This regulatory authority related in substantial part to practices which individual citizen household goods shippers had found to be deceptive, rather than being heavily oriented to economic regulation.

It is seen as an example of early feminist literature because two female characters are able to solve a mystery that the male characters cannot. They are aided by their knowledge of women's psychology. Glaspell originally wrote the story as a one-act play entitled Trifles for the Provincetown Players in 1916.\\"A Jury of Her Peers\\" Study Guide at What So Proudly We Hail Curriculum . Retrieved 15 February 2012. The story was adapted into an episode of the 1950s TV series Alfred Hitchcock Presents. It was also adapted into a 30-minute film by Sally Heckel in 1980. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film. Plot summary \\"A Jury of Her Peers\\" is about the discovery of and subsequent investigation of John Wright's murder. The story begins on a cold, windy day in fictional Dickson County (representing Dickinson County, Iowa) with Martha Hale's being abruptly called to ride to a crime scene. In the buggy is Lewis Hale, her husband, Sheriff Peters, the county sheriff, and Mrs. Peters, the sheriff's wife. She rushes out to join them in the buggy, and the group sets off. They arrive at the crime scene: the Wrights' lonesome-looking house. Immediately Mrs. Hale exhibits a feeling of guilt for not visiting her friend Minnie Foster since she married and became Mrs. Wright (the dead man's wife) twenty years prior. Once the whole group is safely inside the house, Mr. Hale is asked to describe to the county attorney what he had seen and experienced the day prior. Despite the serious circumstances, he delivers his story in a long-winded and poorly thought-out manner, tendencies he struggles to avoid throughout. The story begins with Mr. Hale's venturing to Mr. Wright's house to convince Wright to get a telephone. Upon entering the house, he finds Mrs. Wright in a delirious state and comes to learn that Mr. Wright has allegedly been strangled. The women's curious natures and very peculiar attention to minute details allow them to find evidence of Mrs. Wright's guilt and of her provocations and motives. Meanwhile, the men are unable to procure any evidence. The women find the one usable piece of evidence: the dead bird in the box. It's stated that Minnie used to love to sing and her husband took that away from her. But now finding her bird is dead, with a broken neck (with the implication that the husband killed it), it is evident Mrs. Wright killed her husband. Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters use their knowledge and experience as two \\"midwestern rural women\\" to understand Mrs. Wright's suffering when the only living thing around her has died. The women find justification in Mrs. Wright‚Äôs actions and go about hiding what they find from the men. In the end, their obstruction of evidence will seemingly prevent a conviction. The story ends here, and does not move into the occurrences after they leave the house.  Themes  Scholars have stated that themes covered in Susan Glaspell's A Jury of Her Peers explore the concepts of good and bad, law vs justice, and the world of men vs the world of women. Scholar Leonard Mustazza has stated that in the story Glaspell explores the concept of good and bad in her writing by making the detectives out to be typical heroes of justice via their stating that they wouldn't rest until they find the murderer of John Wright. J. Madison Davis has commented on the same concept, noting that while the women's actions were not conventionally good, the cruelty inflicted by John Wright and the sheriff's choice to ignore this cruelty justify their actions and silence. Mustazza has commented on the topic of law versus justice, noting that the male characters were focused on following the law while the female characters were trying to pursue justice. He further wrote that the men's behaviors showed the differences between the characters, as they didn't acknowledge the abuse the wife suffered and instead criticized her housekeeping skills.

For most of its existence it was horse-drawn; between 1910 and 1914, the portion on the mainland operated as a monorail system. The lone operational monorail car was nicknamed The Flying Lady. History The line was incorporated as two companies on August 30, 1884; the Pelham Park Railroad Company and the City Island Railroad. The two would connect end to end at Marshall's Corner on Rodman's Neck, just short of the bridge to City Island. At the time the territory to be traversed lay entirely within the Town of Pelham in Westchester County. The Pelham Park Railroad Company was designated as the operator of the narrow gauge system. The line opened from the Bartow station to Marshall's Corner on May 20, 1887. Five days later operations were extended across the bridge to City Island and along City Island Avenue to Brown's Hotel. By 1892 the line had reached Belden's Point, its final terminal. The length of the combined system was . In 1895, the Bronx (now a New York City borough) was enlarged to its present size and the area through which the horsecars ran was included within the new boundaries. On March 14, 1902, some two years before it began operating New York City's first subway, the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) took control of the two companies. An experimental operation of a monorail by Howard Hansel Tunis at the Jamestown (Virginia) exposition of 1907 impressed the management of the IRT, and during the winter of 1908-09 permission was obtained to construct a similar electric monorail from the New York State Public Service Commission and various New York City agencies. The monorail, between the Bartow station and Marshall's Corner, opened for regular service on July 16, 1910, although the cars unofficially began carrying passengers two days earlier. The monorail car toppled over on its maiden voyage, and operation was immediately suspended. Service was ultimately restored on November 14, 1910. The monorail was not a success and the IRT forced the companies into bankruptcy on December 4, 1911. The monorail on the line's western end and the narrow gauge horsecar line on the eastern end continued to operate. In 1913, the IRT decided to convert the line to a electric trolley system and with this in mind, merged the two companies into a new entity, the Pelham Park and City Island Railroad, which took over operation on July 1, 1913. The trackage across the bridge and on City Island was converted to standard gauge, with leased New York Railways horsecars taking over the service. The monorail ceased operation on April 3, 1914, with service temporarily operated by a leased bus from Fifth Avenue Coach Lines. On July 9, 1914, the company was sold to the Third Avenue Railway by its owner, the Interborough Rapid Transit Company. After taking control on August 1, 1914 the Third Avenue quickly completed construction of the standard gauge railway, but did not install overhead wire. The last horsecar in the Bronx completed its run during the midday hours on August 18, 1914 and the first storage battery car began operation from Bartow to the line's end on City Island 15 minutes later. In 1919, the Third Avenue Railway petitioned the New York Public Service Commission to permit abandonment, on the grounds of insufficient funds to continue operation, the permission being granted. Operation ceased on August 9, 1919.

The Miladinov Brothers Award was established for the best poetry book published between two consecutive festivals. By 1966 the event turned into an international cultural festival. The Golden Wreath international award was established in the same year and its first recipient was Robert Rozhdestvensky. In 2003, in close cooperation with UNESCO, the Festival established another international award called The Bridges of Struga, for a best debut poetry book by a young author. During its long successful existence, the festival has hosted about 4,000 poets, translators, essayists and literary critics from about 95 countries of the world. The festival has awarded some of the world's most eminent literary figures, including several Nobel Prize for Literature winners such as Joseph Brodsky, Eugenio Montale, Pablo Neruda and Seamus Heaney, the first African member of the French Academy L√©opold S√©dar Senghor who was also a President of Senegal, the official royal Poet Laureate Ted Hughes, W.

Zhengyi Dao () or the Way of Orthodox Unity is a Chinese Daoist movement that emerged during the Tang dynasty as a transformation of the earlier Tianshi Dao movement. Like Tianshi Dao, the leader of Zhengyi Daoism was known as the Celestial Master. History Longhu Shan, the headquarters of the Zhengyi Daoists, in Jiangxi, China By the beginning of the Tang dynasty in 618, the term 'Celestial Master' had lost the potency it had in earlier movements such as the Five Pecks of Rice, and any prominent Daoist could be accorded the title.Kleeman (2008), p. 686. Emperor Xuanzong (712-756) canonized the first Celestial Master Zhang Daoling during his reign. This did not benefit the original territory of his followers in Sichuan, but rather benefited a temple in the Jiangnan area of Jiangxi province. This temple, located at Mount Longhu, claimed to be the spot where Zhang Daoling had obtained the Tao, and where his descendants still lived. Recognized by the emperor as the legitimate descendants of Zhang Daoling, these new Celestial Masters established a new patriarchy at their base of Longhu Shan.Schipper & Verellen (2004), p. 634. The importance of the Zhengyi school grew during the Song dynasty, with the Celestial masters frequently receiving imperial appointments. In 1239, the Southern Song dynasty's Emperor Lizong commanded the 35th Celestial Master Zhang Keda to the united Lingbao School, the Shangqing School and Zhengyi Dao. The new school was to retain the Zhengyi name and remain based at Mount Longhu. Shortly after the schools were united, the Mongols under Kublai Khan conquered the Southern Song dynasty and established the Yuan dynasty in China. He accepted the claim that the Celestial Master of Mount Longhu was descended from Zhang Daoling and granted the school the right to control affairs relating to Daoism in the Jiangnan area. In 1304, as a result of Zhengyi Dao's increased importance under the Mongols, all of the Daoist schools, with the exception of the Quanzhen School, were united under the banner of the Zhengyi School, with the 38th Celestial Master, Zhang Yucai, as leader.Chen (2008), p. 1258-1259. The founding of the Ming dynasty in 1368 marked the beginning of a long decline in the power of the Zhengyi Daoism. The first Ming ruler, the Hongwu Emperor (1368‚Äì98), suppressed the use of the title of 'Celestial Master' among the Zhengyi School, and the 50th Celestial Master Zhang Guoxiang had his title stripped by the Longqing Emperor (1567‚Äì72).Boltz (2008), p. 1226. By the Daoguang period (1821‚Äì50) of the Qing dynasty, relations between the court and the Celestial Masters came to an end. The school's activities became localized to regions in which the school was particularly important.Chen (2008), p. 1260. Despite ending association with the court, the Celestial Master himself still retained a great deal of prestige and importance among Daoists throughout China.Goossaert (2004), p. 125-126. This prestige, which arose from the belief that he was descended from Zhang Daoling, was evident when the Celestial Master traveled and attracted crowds of people wherever he went.Goossaert (2004), p. 128. Beliefs Unlike prior incarnations of the Celestial Masters, like the school based at Louguan, the Zhengyi Daoists did not venerate Laozi as a god. Instead, he was viewed as the ancestor of the school's teaching.Chen (2008), p. 1259. Practices The main gate of the residence of the Celestial Master at Longhu Shan During the Tang dynasty, the primary activity of Zhengyi Daoists was to sell protective talismans. Local cults developed around the sale of these talismans, and around guilds and associations patronized by members of the church.Robinet (1997), p. 78. One of the fundamental practices of the school was conferring registers (lu) upon people entering Daoism. A register was a way to allow that the Daoist tradition passed on to future generations by ensuring those who received them had an adequate knowledge of the school's teachings. Registers also had the names of deities written on them who could be called upon by the bearer to assist in times of need.Miller (2008), p. 41. Once one received a register, they were considered to be part of the priesthood. There were different grades of registers for laypeople with differing levels of religious knowledge. The Celestial Masters adopted the Thunder Rites during the last two decades of the Northern Song dynasty. The Five Thunders variety appeared earlier and was linked with the Celestial Masters. =Rituals= There are two main types of rituals performed by the Zhengyi Daoists the jiao (Offering) and zhai (Retreat) rituals. The zhai ritual is performed as a way to gain benefits through purification and abstinence, and usually takes place immediately before the jiao ritual. In performing a ritual, an adherent must first recite a litany of repentance, then notify the deities of the merits gained through repentance by submitting a document to heaven. Upon completion of the zhai ritual, the jiao ritual begins in which deities are given offerings and thanked.Toshiaki (2008), p. 1217. The jiao ritual is usually performed over a three-day period. Much of the ritual is performed by priests in a temple, but can also involve religious processions through the city, musical performances and a mass offering in front of the temple.Andersen (2008), p. 539. Texts The Zhengyi Daoists were particularly notable for their work in gathering Daoist texts and assembling them into collections. Zhang Yuchu (1361‚Äì1410) received an imperial commission in 1406 to gather texts, in particular those produced during the reign of the Hongwu Emperor (1368‚Äì98).

The facility's main gym (Kress Events Center Arena) hosts the UW-Green Bay women's basketball and volleyball teams. Other facilities onsite include a fitness center shared by athletes and the student body, athletic training facilities, and the administrative offices of UW-Green Bay's athletics program.  History  UW-Green Bay sought funding to renovate its aging athletic facility, the Phoenix Sports Center (built in 1975), as early as 2003. The school received $7.5 million in funding from the state, and expected an equal amount of private donations to fund the renovation. The remainder of the money was to be raised through an increase in student segregated fees, which pay for student life and other recreational activities. As of 2017, students were still paying off the facility through their segregated fees.Page 39 of budget display's UW-Green Bay's segregated fee breakdown. After receiving a large donation from the George F. Kress Foundation, the school was able to begin construction, the new facility bearing Kress' name. Officially announced on December 29, 2004, construction began November 2, 2005 and the facility opened two years later that same month. The first event hosted in the new building was a volleyball match against UW-Milwaukee. UW-Green Bay holds its spring graduation ceremony at the Kress Events Center, and three out of the four area high schools (Green Bay East, West and Southwest) hold their graduation ceremonies at the KEC.Preble High School holds their graduation ceremonies at the Resch Center in Ashwaubenon due to the school's size.

He most notably won the 1970 Scottish Cup with Aberdeen, and was inducted into the Aberdeen FC \\"Hall of Fame\\" as one of the founding members in 2003. Boel also played 15 games for the Danish national team. Playing career Boel began his footballing career, playing as a defender, for amateur club Ikast FS in his childhood town of Ikast. While at Ikast, Boel became a regular in the Danish national team, earning five Under-21 caps and 13 of his 15 full caps from 1965 to 1967. When the professional North American Soccer League was founded in 1968, Boel moved to the US, playing three games for Boston Beacons, then fifteen for the Washington Whips. As the Danish FA had a strict rule of amateurism for the Danish national team, Boel was automatically barred from playing any further national team games. He was recruited by Scottish team Aberdeen in early 1969, having been spotted during the club's tour of the USA the previous summer. During his time in Aberdeen, Boel became a favourite of the Scottish team's fans, and was a part of the Aberdeen team which won the 1969‚Äì70 Scottish Cup trophy, beating Celtic 3‚Äì1 in the final, which he himself feels is his greatest footballing achievement. Boel resumed his international career, albeit briefly, in 1971. When the Danish rule of amateurism was abolished in May 1971, Boel was a part of the first Danish national team composed of professional players. The Danish team lost 0‚Äì5 to Portugal, and Boel played his 15th and last national team game as Denmark lost 1‚Äì2 to Belgium two weeks later. An injury sustained in a UEFA Cup tie against Borussia M√∂nchengladbach in 1972 signalled the end of his time in Scotland as he found it difficult to regain his place in the Aberdeen side.

The gift, a pair of simple bare swords, was a formal invitation to the battle. After the Polish-Lithuanian victory, both swords were taken as a war trophy by King W≈Çadys≈Çaw II to Krak√≥w, Poland's capital at the time, and placed in the treasury of the Royal Wawel Castle. With time, the two swords became treated as royal insignia, symbolising the monarch's reign over two nations, the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. They were probably used in coronations of most Polish kings from the 16th to the 18th centuries. In private hands after the partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth at the end of the 18th century, they were lost without a trace in 1853. They have remained, however, a symbol of victory and Poland's and Lithuania's past, and an important part of national identity of the two nations.  Battle of Grunwald  The battle of Grunwald was part of the Great War fought during 1409‚Äì1411 between a Polish-Lithuanian coalition led by King W≈Çadys≈Çaw II and Grand Duke Vytautas (Alexander) on one side and the Teutonic Order aided by West European knights and led by Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen on the other side. It was a decisive battle of the war and one of the largest in medieval Europe. As both sides were preparing for the battle in the morning of 15 July 1410, two heralds carrying two unsheathed swords were announced to King W≈Çadys≈Çaw II. According to Jan D≈Çugosz's chronicle, they bore the coats of arms of their respective masters: a black eagle in a golden field of King Sigismund of the Romans, and a red griffin in a silver field of Duke Casimir V of Pomerania. The heralds had been sent by the grand master to W≈Çadys≈Çaw II and Vytautas, but since the latter was busy making his troops ready for the battle, it was only the king, accompanied by his closest aides, who received the envoys. The heralds spoke in German while the royal secretary, Jan Mƒô≈ºyk of DƒÖbrowa, served as an interpreter.; translated excerpts in: They delivered, according to D≈Çugosz, the following message: Two Swords by Wojciech Kossak (c. 1909). In this painting, the swords are being presented by members of the Teutonic Order, wearing their distinctive white cloaks, rather than by messengers bearing the heraldic devices described by D≈Çugosz. As they spoke, Teutonic forces did, in fact, withdraw from previously occupied positions. The king accepted the swords and, according to the letter he later wrote to his wife, responded with the following words: While sending swords as a formal gesture challenging the enemy to battle was customary at that time, adding insults was not. Hence the envoys' speech was considered grossly boastful and impudent, as can be seen from a letter sent by Jan Hus to King W≈Çadys≈Çaw II where the Bohemian religious reformer praised the Polish-Lithuanian victory at Grunwald as a triumph of humility over pride.  From war trophy to royal insignia  The king sent the two swords to Krak√≥w and deposited them, together with Teutonic army banners and other war trophies, in the treasure vault of the Royal Wawel Castle. Eventually, the \\"two Prussian swords\\", as they were described in a treasury inventory in 1633, became treated as part of Polish- Lithuanian crown jewels. They were used in royal coronations throughout the existence of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569‚Äì1795) and possibly also earlier, during the dynastic union of the two nations under the House of Jagiellon. Since the pair of swords had been given to two rulers ‚Äì of Poland and Lithuania ‚Äì each of the weapons was associated with one of the two constituent nations of the Commonwealth. monument to King W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço in Central Park, New York City, United States, depicts him brandishing two swords in victory. During a coronation ceremony, the king- elect made a sign of the Cross three times with Szczerbiec, or the principal coronation sword. Immediately afterwards, one of the bishops assisting in the ceremony handed the Grunwald Swords to the king who in turn passed them on to the Crown (i.e., Polish) and Lithuanian sword-bearers (miecznicy). After the coronation, the king returned from the cathedral where the ceremony had taken place to the royal castle, preceded, among others, by the two sword-bearers carrying the Grunwald Swords as symbols of the king's reign in the two nations. Unlike Szczerbiec and other ceremonial swords stored in the royal treasury, the Grunwald Swords were simple battle swords that would have been typical for armament of early 15th-century European knights. At some point in time they were embellished with hilts made from gilded silver. Additionally a little shield with the coat of arms of Poland, the White Eagle, was attached to the blade of one sword and, analogically, a similar shield with the Lithuanian Pursuer was fastened to the other one. Two of the elective kings of Poland‚ÄìLithuania were crowned without the use of the Grunwald Swords. King Stanislaus I Leszczy≈Ñski was crowned in Warsaw in 1705 with a makeshift set of royal insignia given to him by King Charles XII of Sweden and quickly destroyed after the ceremony. The set probably did not include an equivalent of the Grunwald Swords. During the War of the Polish Succession, Leszczy≈Ñski's supporters sequestered the Polish Crown Jewels from Wawel and hid them at the Jasna G√≥ra Monastery in Czƒôstochowa to prevent Stanislaus's rival Frederick Augustus Wettin from using them for his coronation. Hence, Augustus III used his own set of crown jewels for his 1734 coronation. His set included two sheathless ceremonial swords, described by an anonymous witness of the ceremony as \\"two huge √©p√©es\\", that were meant to replace the Grunwald Swords as symbols of Poland and Lithuania. The Polish sword had a pommel in the shape of an eagle's head, a cross-guard in the form of an eagle's talons, and a little crowned heraldic shield with the arms of Poland on the blade. Its Lithuanian counterpart had a pommel shaped like a lion's head, a lion's paws as the cross-guard, and on the blade an armorial shield of Lithuania below a grand-ducal hat. Those two swords were used again in a mourning ceremony on the third anniversary of the death of King Augustus II, Augustus III's father, in 1736. Afterwards, they were moved to the Armory (R√ºstkammer) in Dresden where they could still be seen at the end of the 19th century. Their current location is unknown.  Salvation and loss  Between 1796 and 1830, the swords were kept in the Temple of the Sibyl at Pu≈Çawy, the private museum of Princess Izabela Czartoryska (19th-century engraving). The Grunwald Swords were used for the last time in a coronation of a Polish king ‚Äì that of Stanislaus Augustus Poniatowski ‚Äì in 1764 in Warsaw. They are mentioned in the last inventory of the royal treasury of 1792. During the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising in 1794, Krak√≥w was captured by the Prussian army, which occupied the Wawel Castle and looted its treasure vault. However, the Prussians, probably uninterested in the material value of two simple iron swords and unaware of their historical and symbolic significance, left the Grunwald Swords behind. After Prussia ceded Krak√≥w, by the terms of the Third Partition of Poland, to the Habsburg Empire in 1796, the swords were retrieved from the devastated treasury by historian Tadeusz Czacki who handed them over to Princess Izabela Czartoryska. The princess was an art collector known for her interest in Polish national memorabilia. The Grunwald Swords were placed among other patriotic souvenirs in the Temple of the Sibyl, her private museum established in the garden of the Czartoryski Palace in Pu≈Çawy. The palace was seized by the Russian government during the November Uprising of 1830‚Äì1831. Most of the collection from the Temple of the Sybil had been evacuated to France shortly before the uprising broke out, but the Grunwald Swords were hidden in a parish priest's house in the nearby village of W≈Çostowice (now part of Pu≈Çawy). In 1853, after the priest's death, the house was searched by Russian gendarmes, or security police, who confiscated the swords as illegal weapons and took them to the fortress of Zamo≈õƒá. Their subsequent fate is unknown.  Symbolic use  1st class Order of the Cross of Grunwald Being reminded of Polish military victories over the Teutonic Order used to stir German sensibilities to such an extent, that inclusion of the Grunwald Swords on a 1938 postage stamp commemorating King Vladislaus Jagie≈Ç≈Ço and Queen Jadwiga resulted in a formal diplomatic protest of Nazi Germany. In the interest of \\"maintaining good neighborhood\\", Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked the Polish Post to withdraw the stamp from circulation; on the 1939 version of the stamp, the swords were replaced by a heraldic ornament. In 1943, Gwardia Ludowa, a communist resistance movement in occupied Poland introduced its own military decoration, the Cross of Grunwald, featuring the Grunwald Swords on its obverse. It was later adopted by the People's Republic of Poland as the second highest military award. The cross ceased to be awarded in 1987 and was formally discontinued in 1992. The swords featured in the Polish Navy Jack in the years 1946‚Äì1955. In modern Poland, the Grunwald Swords remain a popular military symbol, especially in Warmia and Masuria. The commune of Grunwald uses the two swords in its coat of arms.

She was used by the Union Navy as a gunboat assigned to patrol Confederate waterways to prevent the South from trading with other countries. Moose, a wooden sternwheel steam gunboat built at Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1863 as Florence Miller II, was purchased at Cincinnati 20 May 1863, and commissioned immediately, Comdr. LeRoy Fitch in command.  Assigned as a gunboat to the Mississippi Squadron  Assigned to the Mississippi Squadron, the new gunboat departed Cincinnati 2 July 1863 to patrol the Ohio River from Louisville, Kentucky, upstream. Morgan‚Äôs Raiders had captured Union ships John T. McComb and Alice Dean 7 July; Moose and responded to the Confederate threat, arriving Brandenburg, Kentucky, 9 July. Moose caught up with a guerrilla band at Twelve Mile Island 11 July; of the 1,500 Confederate troops trying to reinforce Morgan‚Äôs party, 45 crossed the Ohio River, 39 were held on the island and taken prisoner, some were drowned, and the rest driven back.  Ohio River operations  On 19 July, Moose and Allegheny Belle shelled Confederates near Buffington Island, and captured abandoned artillery. Continuing to patrol the Ohio, Cumberland, and Tennessee Rivers during the summer, Moose had convoy duty on the Cumberland in October, and joined , , , and 8 November in defeating Confederate guerrillas attempting to cross the Ohio River. Returning from Harpeth Shoals and escorting 10 transports to Nashville, Tennessee, Moose lay below Dover 9 November planning the destruction of a guerrilla camp near Palmyra, a mission carried out with Victory in December.  Kentucky River operations  She continued river patrols, reporting on construction of ships in the Tennessee River, and in April 1864 with and broke up a Confederate attack on Columbus, Kentucky. On the 16th, the Confederates attacked Fort Pillow, annihilating its 500 defenders; Moose, , and Hastings were sent there to clean up. On the 29th, Moose scouted the river to Hickman, Kentucky, bringing away Unionists while skirmishing to keep guerrillas away from the river. From May through December, Moose patrolled from Nashville to halt smuggling and control guerrilla movements. Typical operations included shelling and scattering a group of 40 cavalry at the crossing of the Memphis and Clarksville Railroads near Johnsonville 5 November, and shelling a large southern encampment above Turkey Island the same month. On 3 and 4 December, she fought field batteries at Bell's Hills, Tennessee, silencing the guns and recapturing three transports. She returned to Nashville, but hit another battery, the 15th, capturing the guns. She joined 17 December to escort transports compelled to return to Nashville by a strong southern force.  A surprise attack on guerrillas on the Cumberland River  Moose made a surprise attack on guerrillas crossing the Cumberland at Eddyville, Indiana, 30 April 1865, completely dispersing and demoralizing the party. Moose then returned to the Ohio and was ordered to Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, 2 July to discharge stores.  End-of-war decommissioning, sale, and civilian career  She decommissioned at Mound City, Illinois, 12 April 1865 and was sold at public auction to D. White 17 August 1865.

The algorithm takes a planar straight-line graph (or in dimension higher than two a piecewise linear system) and returns a conforming Delaunay triangulation of only quality triangles. A triangle is considered poor-quality if it has a circumradius to shortest edge ratio larger than some prescribed threshold. Discovered by Jim Ruppert in the early 1990s, \\"Ruppert's algorithm for two-dimensional quality mesh generation is perhaps the first theoretically guaranteed meshing algorithm to be truly satisfactory in practice.\\"  Motivation  When doing computer simulations such as computational fluid dynamics, one starts with a model such as a 2D outline of a wing section. The input to a 2D finite element method needs to be in the form of triangles that fill all space, and each triangle to be filled with one kind of material ‚Äì in this example, either \\"air\\" or \\"wing\\". Long, skinny triangles cannot be simulated accurately. The simulation time is generally proportional to the number of triangles, and so one wants to minimize the number of triangles, while still using enough triangles to give reasonably accurate results ‚Äì typically by using an unstructured grid. The computer uses Ruppert's algorithm (or some similar meshing algorithm) to convert the polygonal model into triangles suitable for the finite element method. Intermediate triangulations of Ruppert's algorithm  Algorithm description  The algorithm begins with a Delaunay triangulation of the input vertices and then consists of two main operations. * The midpoint of a segment with non-empty diametral circles is inserted into the triangulation. * The circumcenter of a poor-quality triangle is inserted into the triangulation, unless this circumcenter lies in the diametral circle of some segment. In this case, the encroached segment is split instead. These operations are repeated until no poor-quality triangles exist and all segments are not encroached.  Pseudocode  function Ruppert(points, segments, threshold) is T := DelaunayTriangulation(points) Q := the set of encroached segments and poor quality triangles while Q is not empty: // The main loop if Q contains a segment s: insert the midpoint of s into T else Q contains poor quality triangle t: if the circumcenter of t encroaches a segment s: add s to Q; else: insert the circumcenter of t into T end if end if update Q end while return T end Ruppert.  Practical usage  Without modification Ruppert's algorithm is guaranteed to terminate and generate a quality mesh for non-acute input and any poor-quality threshold less than about 20.7 degrees. To relax these restrictions various small improvements have been made. By relaxing the quality requirement near small input angles, the algorithm can be extended to handle any straight-line input. Curved input can also be meshed using similar techniques. Ruppert's algorithm can be naturally extended to three dimensions, however its output guarantees are somewhat weaker due to the sliver type tetrahedron. An extension of Ruppert's algorithm in two dimensions is implemented in the freely available Triangle package. Two variants of Ruppert's algorithm in this package are guaranteed to terminate for a poor- quality threshold of about 26.5 degrees. In practice these algorithms are successful for poor-quality thresholds over 30 degrees. However, examples are known which cause the algorithm to fail with a threshold greater than 29.06 degrees..

The term usually refers to a device for testing average power in fiber optic systems. Other general purpose light power measuring devices are usually called radiometers, photometers, laser power meters (can be photodiode sensors or thermopile laser sensors), light meters or lux meters. A typical optical power meter consists of a calibrated sensor, measuring amplifier and display. The sensor primarily consists of a photodiode selected for the appropriate range of wavelengths and power levels. On the display unit, the measured optical power and set wavelength is displayed. Power meters are calibrated using a traceable calibration standard. A traditional optical power meter responds to a broad spectrum of light, however, the calibration is wavelength dependent. This is not normally an issue, since the test wavelength is usually known, however, it has a couple of drawbacks. Firstly, the user must set the meter to the correct test wavelength, and secondly, if there are other spurious wavelengths present, then wrong readings will result. Optical power meters are available as stand-alone bench or handheld instruments or combined with other test functions such as an Optical Light Source (OLS), Visual Fault Locator (VFL), or as sub-system in a larger or modular instrument. Commonly, a power meter on its own is used to measure absolute optical power, or used with a matched light source to measure loss. When combined with a light source, the instrument is called an Optical Loss Test Set, or OLTS, typically used to measure optical power and end-to-end optical loss. More advanced OLTS may incorporate two or more power meters, and so can measure Optical Return Loss. GR-198, Generic Requirements for Hand-Held Stabilized Light Sources, Optical Power Meters, Reflectance Meters, and Optical Loss Test Sets, discusses OLTS equipment in depth. Alternatively, an Optical Time Domain Reflectometer (OTDR) can measure optical link loss if its markers are set at the terminus points for which the fiber loss is desired. However, this is an indirect measurement. A single-direction measurement may quite inaccurate if there are multiple fibers in a link, since the back- scatter coefficient is variable between fibers. Accuracy can be increased if a bidirectional average is made. GR-196, Generic Requirements for Optical Time Domain Reflectometer (OTDR) Type Equipment, discusses OTDR equipment in depth.  Sensors  The major semiconductor sensor types are Silicon (Si), Germanium (Ge) and Indium Gallium Arsenide (InGaAs). Additionally, these may be used with attenuating elements for high optical power testing, or wavelength selective elements so they only respond to particular wavelengths. These all operate in a similar type of circuit, however, in addition to their basic wavelength response characteristics, each one has some other particular characteristics: * Si detectors tend to saturate at relatively low power levels, and they are only useful in the visible and 850 nm bands, where they offer generally good performance. * Ge detectors saturate at the highest power levels, but have poor low power performance, poor general linearity over the entire power range, and are generally temperature sensitive. They are only marginally accurate for \\"1550 nm\\" testing, due to a combination of temperature and wavelength affecting responsivity at e.g. 1580 nm, however they provide useful performance over the commonly used 850 / 1300 / 1550 nm wavelength bands, so they are extensively deployed where lower accuracy is acceptable. Other limitations include: non-linearity at low power levels, and poor responsivity uniformity across the detector area. * InGaAs detectors saturate at intermediate levels. They offer generally good performance, but are often very wavelength sensitive around 850 nm. So they are largely used for single- mode fiber testing at 1270 - 1650 nm. An important part of an optical power meter sensor, is the fiber optic connector interface. Careful optical design is required to avoid significant accuracy problems when used with the wide variety of fiber types and connectors typically encountered. Another important component, is the sensor input amplifier. This needs very careful design to avoid significant performance degradation over a wide range of conditions. Power measuring range A typical OPM is linear from about 0 dBm (1 milli Watt) to about -50 dBm (10 nano Watt), although the display range may be larger. Above 0 dBm is considered \\"high power\\", and specially adapted units may measure up to nearly + 30 dBm ( 1 Watt). Below -50 dBm is \\"low power\\", and specially adapted units may measure as low as -110 dBm. Irrespective of power meter specifications, testing below about -50 dBm tends to be sensitive to stray ambient light leaking into fibers or connectors. So when testing at \\"low power\\", some sort of test range / linearity verification (easily done with attenuators) is advisable. At low power levels, optical signal measurements tend to become noisy, so meters may become very slow due to use of a significant amount of signal averaging. To calculate dBm from power meter output : The linear-to-dBm calculation method is: dB = 10 log ( P1 / P2 ) where P1 = measured power level ( e.g. in mWatts ), P2 = reference power level, which is 1 mW Calibration and accuracy Optical Power Meter calibration and accuracy is a contentious issue. The accuracy of most primary reference standards (e.g. Weight, Time, Length, Volt, etc.) is known to a high accuracy, typically of the order of 1 part in a billion. However the optical power standards maintained by various National Standards Laboratories, are only defined to about one part in a thousand. By the time this accuracy has been further degraded through successive links, instrument calibration accuracy is usually only a few %. The most accurate field optical power meters claim 1% calibration accuracy. This is orders of magnitude less accurate than a comparable electrical meter. Calibration processes for optical power meters are given in IEC 61315 Ed. 3.0 b:2019 - Calibration of fibre-optic power meters. Further, the in-use accuracy achieved is usually significantly lower than the claimed calibration accuracy, by the time additional factors are taken into account. In typical field applications, factors may include: ambient temperature, optical connector type, wavelength variations, linearity variations, beam geometry variations, detector saturation. Therefore, achieving a good level of practical instrument accuracy and linearity is something that requires considerable design skill, and care in manufacturing. With the increasing global importance in the reliability of data transmission and optical fiber, and also the sharply reducing optical loss margin of these systems in data centres, there is increased emphasis on the accuracy of optical power meters, and also proper traceability compliance via International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) accredited calibration, which includes metrological traceability to national standards and external laboratory accreditation to ISO/IEC 17025 to improve confidence in overall accuracy claims. Extended sensitivity meters A class of laboratory power meters has an extended sensitivity, of the order of -110 dBm. This is achieved by using a very small detector and lens combination, and also a mechanical light chopper at typically 270 Hz, so the meter actually measures AC light. This eliminates unavoidable dc electrical drift effects. If the light chopping is synchronized with an appropriate synchronous (or \\"lock-in\\") amplifier, further sensitivity gains are achieved. In practice, such instruments usually achieve lower absolute accuracy due to the small detector diode, and for the same reason, may only be accurate when coupled with single- mode fiber. Occasionally such an instrument may have a cooled detector, though with the modern abandonment of Germanium sensors, and the introduction of InGaAs sensors, this is now increasingly uncommon. Pulse power measurement Optical power meters usually display time-averaged power. So for pulse measurements, the signal duty cycle must be known to calculate the peak power value. However, the instantaneous peak power must be less than the maximum meter reading, or the detector may saturate, resulting in wrong average readings. Also, at low pulse repetition rates, some meters with data or tone detection may produce improper or no readings. A class of \\"high power\\" meters has some type of optical attenuating element in front of the detector, typically allowing about a 20 dB increase in maximum power reading. Above this level, an entirely different class of \\"laser power meter\\" instrument is used, usually based on thermal detection. Common fiber optic test applications * Measuring the absolute power in a fiber optic signal. For this application, the power meter needs to be properly calibrated at the wavelength being tested, and set to this wavelength. * Measuring the optical loss in a fiber, in combination with a suitable stable light source. Since this is a relative test, accurate calibration is not a particular requirement, unless two or more meters are being used due to distance issues. If a more complex two-way loss test is performed, then power meter calibration can be ignored, even when two meters are used. * Some instruments are equipped for optical test tone detection, to assist in quick cable continuity testing. Standard test tones are usually 270 Hz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz. Some units can also determine one of 12 tones,Ribbon Fiber Tone Tester for ribbon fiber continuity testing. Test automation Typical test automation features usually apply to loss testing applications, and include: * The ability to set the unit to read 0 dB at a reference power level, typically the test source. * The ability to store readings into internal memory, for subsequent recall and download to a computer. * The ability to synchronize the wavelength with a test source, so that the meter sets to the source wavelength. This requires a specifically matched source. The simplest way of achieving this, is by recognizing a test tone, but the best way is by transfer of data. The data method has benefits that the source can send additional useful data such as nominal source power level, serial number etc. Wavelength-selective meters An increasingly common special-purpose OPM, commonly called a \\"PON Power Meter\\" is designed to hook into a live PON (Passive Optical Network) circuit, and simultaneously test the optical power in different directions and wavelengths. This unit is essentially a triple power meter, with a collection of wavelength filters and optical couplers. Proper calibration is complicated by the varying duty cycle of the measured optical signals. It may have a simple pass/ fail display, to facilitate easy use by operators with little expertise. Wavelength sensitivity of fiber optic power meter is a problem when using a photodiode for voltage current measurement. If the temperature-sensitive measurement replaces voltage-current measurement by photodiode the wavelength sensitivity of an OPM can be reduced. Thus if the photodiode is reverse biased by a constant voltage source and supplied with constant current, when triggered by light the junction dissipates power. The temperature of the junction rises and the temperature rise measured by thermistor is directly proportional to the Optical power. Due to constant current supply, the reflection of power to photodiode is nearly zero and the transition to and fro of electrons between valance band and conduction band is stable.

Political beliefs Hastilow is an active member of the TaxPayers' Alliance, which campaigns for lower taxes and greater value for money in public spending. He is a supporter of The Freedom Association, and has spoken at some of its events including a debate on the future of the BBC, and he is a backer of the Drivers‚Äô Alliance, an organisation dedicated to defending the interests of motorists. He is a strong advocate of free market economics, believing high taxes and increased regulation stifle entrepreneurialism and force businesses to abandon Britain. He believes in the importance of manufacturing industry and regrets that successive governments have neglected this vital aspect of the economy. A traditionalist on education, he was for some time a member of the Conservative Party committee (chaired by John Bercow, a previous Speaker of the House of Commons) campaigning to protect the country's remaining grammar schools. Hastilow is a confirmed Euro-sceptic. It was reported in 2008 that he had been approached to stand as a candidate for the UK Independence Party (UKIP) at the European elections.

The club is currently playing in the Tweede Divisie.  History  HHC Hardenberg was founded in 1954, as the result of a merger between Hardenberg Voetbal Club of Hardenberg en SV Heemse of neighbouring Heemse. The letters HHC stand for Hardenberg Heemse Combinatie (Hardenberg Heemse Combination). The club won its first title, in the Vierde Klasse (Fourth Class), in the 1964‚Äì65 season, securing promotion to the Derde Klasse (Third Class). The club played in that division for 11 seasons, and won the title in 1975‚Äì76, clinching promotion to the Tweede Klasse (Second Class). The introduction of the Hoofdklasse changed the structure of the league. The Eerste Klasse (First Class) became the Hoofdklasse, and the Tweede Klasse, where HHC were playing, became the Eerste Klasse (First Class). HHC was relegated back to what had become the Tweede Klasse after the 1990‚Äì91 season. HHC won the playoffs in that division in 1998, securing promotion to the Eerste Klasse (First Class). In the 2000‚Äì01 season, HHC finished second in the Eerste Klasse E, qualifying for the playoffs. In the playoffs, HHC came close to being promoted to the Hoofdklasse. In the 2003‚Äì04 season, HHC finished tied on first place in the Eerste Klasse D. A decisive match against Excelsior '31 was lost, but HHC qualified for the playoffs and won both playoff matches, securing promotion to the Hoofdklasse, for the first time in the club's existence. In the first season on the highest level of amateur football in the Netherlands, the club managed to avoid relegation, finishing the season in the Saturday Hoofdklasse C in 10th place (out of 14). In the 2005‚Äì06, HHC won the third periode (period), securing a place in the KNVB Cup 2006-07. The third season of HHC in the Hoofdklasse ended with the title in the Saturday Hoofdklasse C. In the competition for the national Saturday title, HHC finished bottom of the group, behind Rijnsburgse Boys (champion of the Saturday Hoofdklasse A) and IJsselmeervogels (champion of the Saturday Hoofdklasse B). HHC managed to defend their title in the Saturday Hoofdklasse C the next season. In the KNVB Cup 2006-07, HHC defeated RKSV Oisterwijk in the first round, but were eliminated by MVV in the second round. A year later, in 2007‚Äì08, the club defeated SV Babberich 2‚Äì1 in the first round. The second round match against VVSB finished 1‚Äì1 after regular time; the score after extra time was 5‚Äì4 for HHC. The club was eventually eliminated in the third round, by professional side AGOVV Apeldoorn. KNVB Cup 2008-09 match between HHC and Feyenoord on November 13th, 2008 In the KNVB Cup 2008-09, HHC defeated Schijndel and Go Ahead Eagles in the first and second round. The third round was against professional club Feyenoord, and was supposed to be a home match for HHC. However, because of the significance of the match, it was decided that their home venue was insufficient. Therefore, the match was played in Emmen. The Univ√© Stadium in Emmen was sold out for the first time in more than ten years with 8500 visitors, most of them coming from Hardenberg. The half time score was 1‚Äì1, but Feyenoord would go on to win the match 1‚Äì5. The club qualified to the newly established third tier, called Topklasse, at the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season through playoffs.  Honours  The structure of the Hoofdklasse allows HHC Hardenberg up to three title opportunities in one season: the regular division, the Saturday title and the national title. The overall Saturday title is contested between the champions of the three Saturday leagues, and the national title is contested between the Saturday champion and the Sunday champion. *Hoofdklasse division title: 2 :: 2006‚Äì07, 2007‚Äì08  Current squad  As of 1 February 2019 References  External links  *Club website Category:Football clubs in the Netherlands Category:Association football clubs established in 1954 Category:1954 establishments in the Netherlands Category:Football clubs in Overijssel Category:Sport in Hardenberg ","title":"HHC Hardenberg"},{"id":"14077930","text":"Jennifer Camper is an openly lesbian woman American comics artist and graphic artist whose work is inspired by her own experiences as a Lebanese-American lesbian. Her work has been included in various outlets such as newspapers and magazines since the 1990s, as well as in exhibits in Europe and the United States. Furthermore, Camper is the creator and director of the biennial Queers and Comics conference.  Early life  When she was younger, Jennifer Camper did not have the dream of becoming a cartoonist and contributing to the world of queer comics. In an interview with Rob Kirby on The Comics Journal, Camper stated that she \\"sort of fell into it and just continued. From early childhood I played with all kinds of art forms, including comics and illustrated stories. In school, I made comics and illustrated stories as class assignments, or for the school paper, and sometimes just to entertain my friends and myself. My family encouraged this.\\" After gaining support and inspiration from the world around her, Camper began creating full-length comics throughout high school and college. The majority of the comics centered around \\"ridiculing school policies, teachers and other students.\\" At the end of her school career, Camper began publishing her comics in Gay Community News and started her contributions to one of the most well-known queer comic series Gay Comix. Career Camper, at right with other LGBT comics creators at a February 28, 2014 signing at Jim Hanley's Universe in Manhattan for the LGBT anthology Qu33r. Camper has been producing comics since the 1980s. Her work has appeared in many publications and is notable for tackling many issues found throughout the LGBTQA+ community. Jennifer Camper is also the editor of the comic book Juicy Mother. Of the title, Camper stated that it \\"just floated in on the wind. I like the word 'mother' because it can mean both 'Mother' ‚Äî creator and nurturer ‚Äî and 'Mutha.' I like the word 'juicy' because, well, who doesn't?\\" Her editing of this book is very significant due to it being the first anthology of queer comics to have appeared since the release of Gay Comix. She also has published two comic books of her own. Camper explores issues such as gender, race, class, and politics. Camper has written about the AIDS based on her own personal experiences as an AIDS/HIV nurse. MK Czerwiec mentions that Camper's Bearing Angry Witness was an important influence on her work. In 2015, Camper launched the biennial Queers & Comics conference, an international and inter-generational gathering of queer cartoonists. The first conference was held under the auspices of the Center for LGBT Studies at the CUNY Graduate Center in New York City, with keynote speakers Howard Cruse and Alison Bechdel. The conference was seen as a way for queer artists to \\"learn from each other and to inspire exciting future work. Queer comics offer readers a unique visual literature that reflects and critiques queer culture. The conferences brings together US and international LGBTQ cartoonists and comics writers and artists, as well as scholars, publishers, editors, journalists, and readers of queer comics.\\" Camper's work has oft been praised for the way it tackles political and social issues throughout the world, but for also how it personally affects others. \\"In times of crisis, the profound infuses what should be the mundane; everyday details of life become absurd reminders of great loss and pain. This was an important lesson I brought to my own work,\\" this is what MK Czerwiec stated in their paper Representing AIDS in Comics.  Influences  Jennifer Camper explained in an interview with Rob Kirby that she discovered Underground Comics when she was a teenager and then went on to read comics written about the LGBTQA+ community such as, Wimmen's Comix, Tits & Clits, Girl Blimp, and Gay Comix. Once she got into reading these comics she says that, \\"I never doubted that there was room for my own voice in comics.\\" Following her teenage years she began to draw comics for the Gay Community News in Boston. She then submitted her work to Gay Comix, where she developed an audience that lead to further assignments. Camper also described how Howard Cruse's work and extraordinary talent paved the way and influenced her own path into the world of queer comics in another interview. \\"After getting out of school, I began publishing cartoons and illustrations in Gay News Community and in Gay Comix, edited by Howard Cruse. Howard is the Godfather of queer comics and has mentored so many of us. He is unfailingly generous in sharing his knowledge and techniques.\\" Camper's Lebanese-American identity has had its own impact on her life as a queer artist as well. \\"I've had experiences where people have unknowingly said horrible anti-Arab things in my face. When I bust them on their racism, they fall all over themselves trying to justify what they've said, and that's always pretty amusing. I wasn't really part of an Arab community, except for my family, until the 1990s when I began to meet other queer Arabs and Iranians. I thought their experiences were amazing and I began to do comics about them. For a lot of queer Arab women it's a struggle to be a lesbian in the Arab community, and also difficult to be Arab in the gay community. When I met other Arab dykes, many of them were trying to come to terms with being queer in the context of their Arab culture. I was a half-breed dyke trying to connect with my Arab side in the context of my queer life. We sort of met in the middle. Before 9/11, Arabs and Muslims were pretty much invisible to most Americans. Now it's the flavor of the month. It's nice to have people take an interest, but frustrating that it took an attack on America to have that happen.\\"  Publications  = Showcased publications = * The Village Voice * San Francisco Bay Times * Ms. * Curve * On Our Backs * Washington Blade * The Advocate * Out * Girlfriends = Anthologies = * Boy Trouble, edited by Robert Kirby * Gay Comix * The Great Women Cartoonists and A Century of Women Cartoonists, both edited by Trina Robbins. * Two volumes of Juicy Mother **Juicy Mother: Celebration, edited by Jennifer Camper, Soft Skull Press, 2005 ** Juicy Mother: How They Met, edited by Jennifer Camper, Manic D Press, 2007 = Books = * Rude Girls and Dangerous Women, published by Laugh Lines Press in 1994 * SubGURLZ, published by Cleis Press in 1999. = Contributions = *A Century of Women Cartoonists, edited by Trina Robbins, Kitchen Sink Press, 1993, * The Great Women Cartoonists, edited by Trina Robbins, Kitchen Sink Press, 1997, * \\"A Day In The Life...Reference Librarian\\", Cathy and Jennifer Camper, Revolting Librarians Redux: Radical Librarians Speak Out, edited by Katia Roberts and Jessamyn West, McFarland and Company, Inc., 2003, * Boy Trouble, edited by Robert Kirby and David Kelly, Boy Trouble Books, 2004 * Dead High Yearbook, edited by Ivan Velez Jr., Dutton Books, (a division of Penguin Group (USA) 2007 * The Book of Boy Trouble 2: Born to Trouble, edited by Robert Kirby and David Kelly, Green Candy Press, 2008  Nominations  * Lambda Literary Award for Humor * Lambda Literary Award for LGBT Anthologies  References   External links  *Jennifer Camper's Website *\\"Drawing Diversity\\": A Discussion with Jennifer Camper * Interview with Jennifer Camper on \\"Bookslut\\" (scroll down) *Review of Juicy Mother 2 from \\"The Gay Comics List\\" *Review of Juicy Mother 2 from \\"Our Chart\\" * Review of Juicy Mother from \\"Gaydar Nation\\" Category:American comics writers Category:Lesbian artists Category:LGBT comics creators Category:LGBT artists from the United States Category:Living people Category:Underground cartoonists Category:American female comics artists Category:Female comics writers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:American people of Lebanese descent ","title":"Jennifer Camper"},{"id":"14077933","text":"The Casula Powerhouse is located in Casula, New South Wales, Australia, on the banks of the George's River within the City of Liverpool. Formerly a 1950s power station, Casula Powerhouse is currently a multi-arts facility known as the Casula Powerhouse Arts Centre. About the Powerhouse On 13 June 2006 Liverpool City Council awarded Kane Construction the contracts to re-develop Stage 3 of Casula Powerhouse. The new incarnation of the Casula Powerhouse has been designed by award winning architects Tonkin Zulaikha Greer. Casula Powerhouse is now a multi-disciplinary arts centre, located on Tharawal country. The centre boasts: * 6 galleries with a year-round exhibition program of changing exhibitions produced and presented by Casula Powerhouse * 326-seat theatre with full seasons of touring productions from some of Australia's most renowned companies * 2 artist studios including the Clayhouse Ceramics Studio * A series of permanent public artworks * Climate controlled storage facilities for the collection of over 30, 000 items * Green open spaces: Weaving Garden, Alice Klaphake Amphitheatre, and 20 hectares of parklands. A proud facility of the Liverpool City Council, and funded by Arts Council NSW, the Casula Powerhouse draws on the strengths of its community, to make work that speaks to people of all denominations. About the Building View of the Casula Powerhouse Built in 1951 by the NSW Electricity Commission, the Casula Powerhouse (then known as the Liverpool Powerhouse), was one of a series of identical buildings erected to supplement electricity production during winter and power shortages. In 1955 the 250 foot stack was erected, replacing four shorter chimneys. Residents had complained that the smoke from the powerhouse dirtied their washing. The Powerhouse was closed in 1976, and bought by Liverpool Council in 1978 for $75 000. The building became derelict over the following decade, and in 1985 the residents of Liverpool decided by plebiscite that the building should become an arts centre. By 1987 Council had appointed two staff members to oversee the first capital works program. Electricity was installed, building reviews carried out and an office space was furnished. In 1993, while Mark Latham was Mayor of Liverpool, Casula Powerhouse, as it had then become known, was allocated funding in council budgets for the very first time. An ambitious development took place, and the centre opened its doors in 1994. During the period between opening and June 2006, the Casula Powerhouse ran a busy program of exhibitions and events. Highlights include Shaghai Star, I Love Pho, Vietnam Voices and Cybercultures. After a 22-month closure, the Casula Powerhouse reopened on 5 April 2008 with significantly improved and new facilities. The centre now houses an international standard exhibition space, and a 326-seat state of the art theatre. The centre also boasts a multi- purpose theatre/performance space, artists' studios and artists' residency spaces 7 exhibition spaces. In addition, climate control has been installed in one gallery and a collection storage space, and a new office space. This capital project has been a partnership between the NSW Government, ArtsNSW, Liverpool City Council and its communities.

It was first published in Japan in 1983, and was translated into English in 2005.  Plot  It is the year 12,090 A.D. The world has all but ended, ravaged in a firestorm of man's wars and madness. But from the wreckage a few humans manage to survive. A few humans... and something else. Doris Lang knew what her fate would be when the vampire lord Count Magnus Lee bit her: an agonizing transformation into one of the undead, doomed to be stalked by her fellow villagers, or cursed to become the bride of the unholy creature and face an eternity of torment, driven by the thirst for human blood. There was but one option left, and as she watched him ride in from the distance she knew there was hope. Salvation... from a vampire hunter named D. Magnus has his own problems. His beautiful daughter Larmica refuses to let a human into her family. Enlisting the help of Garo, a werewolf retainer, she attempts to kill Doris before the wedding, only to find D standing against her. Greco Rohman, son of the chief, wants Doris for himself. The same goes for the skilled fighter Rei-Ginsei and his Fiend Corps. Both men are eager to eliminate D, as his skills and Doris' favor makes them see him as a threat. Doris knows she isn't the only one in trouble - her younger brother is perceived as her weakness, and there is more than one person out there willing to use him as leverage against her.

By the reign of Yahya Karawi he had come of age and Mas'ud's supporters were ready to install him as head of state.

The seminary serves the dioceses of Kotido and Moroto. Its foundation dates back to 1967 when the first Bishop, Sizto Mazzoldi Msgr. created it to help as a recruitment ground for priests to the then young diocese of Moroto which covered the whole Karamoja region. Students came from Namaalu to Karenga. Several of the Karamojong Catholic priests went through this institution. Such priests as Fr. Simon Lokodo of Karenga-Kapedo, now member of the Uganda Parliament, Fr. Philip Lokel of Loyoro, Fr. Lotuk Samuel from Karenga. The first product was ordained in 1979, Fr. Thomas Logiel, who was the first Karamojong priest. Then followed others like Fr. Largo Koryang, Fr. Gabriel Koryang. The institution was as stated above, started by Bishop Sizto Mazzoldi of Comboni Missionaries of the Heart of Jesus who was a group of missionaries who had been expelled from the southern Sudan, the last Comboni Missionaries were there in 1999 when the running and the administration of the school was handed over to the diocesan clergy with the first diocesan rector being Fr. Clement Othim from Morulem. Other students who reached to the Major seminary were Opio Kizito, Thomas Apurio, by now, a priest himself.

It adds an index arm and artificial horizon to the instrument. It was invented by John Elton a sea captain who patented his design in 1728Bennett, Jim, \\"Catadioptrics and commerce in eighteenth-century London\\", in History of Science, vol xliv, 2006, pages 247-277. and published details of the instrument in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 1732.Elton, John, The Description of a New Quadrant for Taking Altitudes Without an Horizon, Either at Sea or Land, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, Vol 37, No. 423, 1731-1732. Construction Drawing of Elton's Quadrant. From Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, No. 423, Vol 37, 1731-1732. This instrument is derived from the Davis quadrant, adding an index arm with spirit levels to use as an artificial horizon. The instrument is signed J. Sisson fecit - Jonathan Sisson made the instrument as drawn. This instrument clearly reflects the shape and features of the Davis quadrant. The significant differences are the change in the upper arc to a simple triangular frame and the addition of an index arm. The triangular frame at the top spans 60¬∞ as did the arc on the backstaff. The main graduated arc subtends 30¬∞ as in the backstaff. The 30¬∞ arc is graduated in degrees and sixths of a degree, that is, at ten-minute intervals. The sighting vane of the backstaff is replaced with a sight (called an eye vane) mounted on the end of the index arm. The index arm includes a noniusDaumas, Maurice, Scientific Instruments of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries and Their Makers, Portman Books, London 1989 - Daumas points out that the name nonius continued to be used instead of vernier until the beginning of the 19th century. to allow reading the large scale with ten divisions between the graduations on the scale. This provides the navigator with the ability to read the scale to the nearest minute of arc. The index arm has a spirit level to allow the navigator to ensure that the index is horizontal even when he cannot see the horizon. The instrument has a horizon vane like a Davis quadrant, but Elton refers to it as the shield or ray vane. The shield is attached to the label.Label is an older term for a long, thin device, in particular the rule on an astrolabe, circumferentor or similar instrument. It differs from an alidade in that it has no sighting vanes on it. In this latter detail, Elton's use of the term may be inappropriate. The label is an arm that extends from the centre of the arc to the outside of the upper triangle and can be set to one of the three positions in the triangle (in the diagram, it appears to bisect the triangle as it is set to the centre or 30¬∞ position). At the upper end of the label is a Flamsteed glass or lens. The three set positions allow the instrument to read 0¬∞ to 30¬∞, 30¬∞ to 60¬∞ or 60¬∞ to 90¬∞. The lens projects an image of the sun rather than a shadow of the sun on the shield. This provides an image even when the sky is hazy or lightly overcast. In addition, at the mid-span of the label there is a mounting point for a lantern to be used during nocturnal observations. There are two spirit levels on the shield. One, called the azimuth tube, ensures that the plane of the instrument is vertical. The other is perpendicular to the shield and will indicate when the plane of the shield is vertical and the label is horizontal. Usage =Solar altitude by backsight= For measuring the altitude of the sun, the Elton's quadrant can be used in the same manner as a Davis quadrant. However, with the artificial horizon, the eye vane is not required to be used. Hold the instrument in a comfortable manner with the arc towards the sun. Set the label so that the sun's image is projected on the shield at the hole with the index arm roughly horizontal. Move the index arm so that the index's spirit level shows the arm is precisely horizontal. This sets the instrument and the angle can be read with the scale and nonius. =Stellar altitude by foresight= This is a means of measuring altitude of a celestial object that is very different from what can be done with a Davis quadrant. It reveals one of the significant improvements of the Elton's quadrant over the former instrument. Set the label to a position that will put the object to be measured within the range of the instrument. Observe the object through the eye vane so that the object touches the upper edge of the shield while using the azimuth tube to ensure that the frame is vertical. Move the index arm so that the shield's horizontal tube indicates that the shield is precisely vertical. This sets the instrument and the angle can be read on the arc. Significance to navigation The Elton's quadrant is not very well known as a navigation instrument. It was used, though to what degree is not known. Elton had the misfortune to invent his instrument in the same period of time as the octant. In fact, John Hadley published details on his octant prior to Elton's article in the same volume of the Philosophical Transactions (article 37 vs 48). Given that Elton's quadrant was roughly as complex as an octant in construction, there would not likely be a significant advantage in price. The octant was an easier instrument to use and Hadley had supported the use of artificial horizons on the octant in the form of spirit levels. This would have given no advantage to Elton's instrument. In addition, there were many other instruments competing for the attention of navigators in this period. In the end, the Hadley octant and later sextant took precedence as instruments for navigators.

History Following the introduction of the Education Act 1944, the Essex Education Committee acquired the majority of the Nelmes Estate in Hornchurch, including Victorian era Ardleigh House and surrounding 15 acres of land. Ardleigh House was initially used as a community and youth centre, and as a centre for part-time day release courses. The facilities were very basic, confined to upstairs rooms, and allowed only for basic instruction. Some years later, two additional classrooms with storage space were built, and the local authority Further Education Committee started to plan for an assembly hall and craft workshops for what was then called ‚ÄòArdleigh House Centre for Further Education‚Äô. Expenditure was approved in 1949 for another 14,000 square ft. of administration and teaching facilities, as well as communal accommodation for a student population of 400. In 1958 A. W. Ebdon became Ardleigh House Centre for Further Education‚Äôs second warden and oversaw the completion of the new facilities. He then became the first Principal of a newly renamed Hornchurch College of Further Education. During the 1970s there was a commitment to improve standards of training but pressure on space remained an issue. This issue was resolved with the adoption of the Quarles School site in Harold Hill. In 1992 the College was incorporated with its current name. Havering College Today The College currently has three campuseshttps://www.havering-college.ac.uk/college/contacts; the main Ardleigh Green campus in Hornchurch, Quarles campus in Harold Hill, and the Rainham Campus Construction Centre in Rainham. A plan scheduled for 2020 is to substantially develop the capacity of Ardleigh Green and the Rainham Campus Construction Centre using the income from the concluded sale of the Quarles campus to Havering Borough Council.

Many prehistoric artefacts from Dartmoor, important Bronze Age and Iron Age material from Mount Batten and medieval and post-medieval finds from Plymouth are found in the human history collection alongside artifacts from ancient Egypt and other ancient cultures of Europe and the Middle East. The art collections include 750 easel paintings, over 3,000 watercolours and drawings, at least 5,000 prints and a sizeable collection of sculptures. A large proportion of the art was donated to the people of Plymouth in 1852 by William Cotton (1794‚Äì1863) and is known as the Cottonian Collection. It had been put together principally by the collector Charles Rogers (1711‚Äì1784), and includes works by Sir Joshua Reynolds who was born locally.

From the 10th to the 19th, Victory, , , , , and Allegheny Belle chased Morgan as he proceeded eastward along the river. Union cavalry ashore prevented him from recrossing the Ohio River to safety in the South. While Victory and three of the gunboats remained scattered downstream on the 19th to prevent the raiding party from doubling back, the Federals finally trapped Morgan at Buffington Island and forced him to attempt a crossing. The try failed miserably, and most of the Confederates surrendered. Morgan, himself, escaped with a few followers only to be caught near New Lisbon, Ohio, one week later. = Mississippi Squadron duties = Victory remained with the Mississippi Squadron for the duration of the war, performing patrol, reconnaissance, convoy, and dispatch duty. On 14 April 1864, she helped to repulse a raid upon Paducah, Kentucky; and‚Äîon 4 November, as part of a squadron of six gunboats‚Äîaided the successful defense from a carefully staged attack on Johnsonville, Tennessee, led by the famed Confederate cavalryman, Lt. Gen. Nathan B. Forrest.  Post-war decommissioning, sale, and civilian career  After the Confederacy collapsed, Victory was decommissioned at Mound City, Illinois, on 30 June 1865 and sold at public auction there to W. Thorwegen on 17 August. She was documented as Lizzie Tate on 7 October 1865 and was reduced to a barge on 22 November 1867. At this time, her service afterword is unknown.

He is one of the pioneers of house music,IMO Records. \\"Jesse Saunders Biography\\" , IMO Records, Retrieved on February 24, 2012. often cited as \\"the originator of house music\\" by critics and historians. His 1984 single, \\"On & On\\", co-written with Vince Lawrence, was the first record with a house DJ as the artist that was pressed and sold to the public. Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley declared July 17, 1997, as Jesse Saunders and the Pioneers of House Music Day in Chicago. Since his emergence as a DJ almost three decades ago, Saunders has run several of his own independent labels, and worked extensively in music and film production, as well as artist promotion and management. In recent years, through house music reunions, a pending book release and a live 'disc-jocumentary' ‚Äì where, while DJing, he visually takes the audience through the history of house and electro ‚Äì Saunders has worked towards erasing the misconceptions associated with the genre's origins. He is also a long-time member of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. Early years Saunders was born and grew up on the south side of Chicago, Illinois in the 1960s and 70s. He attended St. Columbanus for Kindergarten and Reavis Elementary School (until 5th grade) where his mother, Lois M. Saunders, was a teacher. Saunders' mother, a Roosevelt University graduate in Early Childhood Education, was his primary caregiver and a great supporter of his sporting and music pursuits. Saunders then went on to enroll in Shoesmith Elementary School (about 1 mile from Reavis) so that he could get from under his mother's watchful eye and spread his youthful wings. At Shoesmith, Saunders was selected for 2 major things that would change his life and eventually lead to him understanding his calling; being a straight \\"A\\" student and creatively gifted, he was selected to participate in the \\"Gifted\\" Program at Ray Elementary School. In the \\"Gifted\\" Program, Saunders learned to program and operate computers at the age of 10 years. He was also selected to perform and tour in the Chicago Children's Choir. Saunders eventually graduated from Charles S. Deneen Public School, then went on to study and graduate at Hyde Park's Kenwood Academy. While at High School, Saunders became a very talented Tennis Player, leading his team to 3 City of Chicago Championships and 1 Runner-Up, earning him the coveted 3 White Letters that he proudly wore around school on his Letterman's Jacket, and instantly making him a popular student. During this time, he was selected by the City of Chicago's \\"Youth Action\\" program which groomed exceptional student athletes to turn into professional athletes. During his high school years at Kenwood Academy (formerly Kenwood High School, it became an Academy due to the excellence that the students showed in their prolific test scores and high rate of graduates), Saunders was mentored by his older step brother, DJ Wayne Williams, in the art of DJing. Bringing Saunders into the fold of his Chosen Few Disco Corp. in 1977, the 2 went on to dominate the DJ industry, become a legendary force and produce the Chosen Few House Music Reunion Picnic yearly (since 1991) in Chicago to a crowd of over 30,000! Saunders eventually ended up at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles studying Communications and Film where he got his first taste of \\"Hollywood.\\" Saunders took an early liking to music, beginning with piano at age five and eventually making his way through every instrument available to him. Amongst his early musical influences were Aretha Franklin, Fleetwood Mac, Smokey Robinson and Earth Wind & Fire. He also became fascinated with sports, displaying his greatest strengths in baseball and tennis, winning multiple city championships with his team in the latter. Saunders was also an honors student, attending the same high school where the likes of Chaka Kahn and R. Kelly also attended. Career =Chicago house= House music first got its start within the walls of Chicago's Warehouse nightclub, thus attaining its name. As the music moved to the wider community, the sound significantly changed and what developed is House music as it eventually came to be known. While one of his biggest influences, and another instrumental figure in the development of house, Frankie Knuckles, confined himself to the gay nightclub scene (primarily that of the Warehouse), Saunders took the unique sounds of the Windy City to the masses. Instead of relying solely on disco and R&B; like Knuckles, Saunders expanded his musical repertoire and fused it with the turntable trickery that remains a staple to this day. As a DJ he would accentuate desired moments in songs through loops and repetition, focusing on sections that were stripped down to just the drum or bass ‚Äì a tradition he would carry on as a producer. =Touring= At the age of sixteen, Saunders became exposed to Chicago's night club scene, enthralled by the sounds of Frankie Knuckles and others in the scene. It wasn't long before he became a nightclub headliner, and in 1982, he opened up his own nightclub, the Playground. Attendance figures soon outnumbered those of the Warehouse and Saunders used the opportunity to incorporate his original material into his sets. By 1983 he was producing his own music and in early 1984 he released the first official house music record along with Vince Lawrence, \\"On & On\\", on the label they made together, Jes Say Records. Saunders composed the track with Lawrence in order to replace a record which had been stolen from Saunders' collection, the \\"On & On\\" bootleg disco megamix by Mach (1980). That megamix, a pastiche of loops from several disco records, particularly the bassline from Player One's \\"Space Invaders\\" (1979) and Lipps Inc's \\"Funkytown\\" (1980), had been Saunders' \\"signature\\" tune as a DJ; it was one that other DJs in the city didn't have or didn't play. Saunders & Lawrence added hypnotic lyrics and electronic instruments, utilizing a Roland TR-808 drum machine as electronic percussion as well as a Korg Poly-61 synthesizer and Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer. \\"Funk U Up\\" (the first house track to ever make it onto the Billboard charts), \\"Real Love\\", \\"Love Can't Turn Around\\" (the song that started the house music revolution in the UK) and \\"Dum Dum\\" soon followed. His group, Jesse's Gang was eventually signed to Geffen Records, releasing the album Center of Attraction shortly after, with the single off the album, \\"I'm Back Again\\" becoming a top ten club hit. By the late 1980s, Saunders decided to focus all his efforts on writing, producing and remixing instead of DJing. Throughout the 1990s, he made his way back to DJing, touring the world over, as well as trying his hand at producing music for television. His independent label, Broken Records, fully embraced the digital revolution by distributing music solely via the Internet. Since 1991 he has been involved in House Music Reunion Picnic, celebrated every Fourth of July weekend. The event brings together over 100 DJs and attracts upwards of 30,000 people. In 1997 he reunited with the other forefathers of house music to release Chicago Reunion Album. Saunders went on to be featured in hundreds of books including the bestseller \\"What Kind Of House Party Is This?\\" by Jonathan Fleming (MixMag) and his own semi-autobiography \\"House Music...The Real Story\\", co-written by James Cummins. He has co-starred in over 10 documentaries including the Sun Dance award-winning \\"Modulations,\\" the Channel 4 (London) mini-series \\"Pump Up The Volume,\\" the BBC audio documentary \\"The 2nd Summer of Love,\\" the TV1 Unsung: \\"Frankie Knuckles and The Roots of House,\\" the Channel 4 (London) \\"I Was There (When House Took Over The World),\\" the BBC \\"Can You Feel It\\" and the award-winning \\"Put The Needle on the Record.\\" He has had hundreds of features in every major industry magazine including Rolling Stone, MixMag, Urb and Keyboard. Saunders has lectured at top conferences, schools, colleges and universities throughout the world including The Red Bull Academy, Oxford University, Boston University, The Winter Music Conference (Miami), Popkom (Germany), The New Music Seminar (New York) and the Amsterdam Dance Event (Holland). In 2004 after touring incessantly throughout the world, Saunders revived his Broken Records label. The label releases digital content to the all major download sites and boasts featured artists such as Inaya Day, Scott Langley, Sound Syndicate, Igor Garnier, Didier Vanelli, Mia Calderon, Joe Smooth, Marshall Jefferson and of course Jesse Saunders himself. In 2009, Saunders released the critically acclaimed 25th Anniversary of House Music Album, which resulted in a worldwide tour featuring Art depicting the culture and pioneers of the genre. The tour hit all over the US and as far as Johannesburg, South Africa. After the successful 25th Anniversary of House Music Tour, Saunders founded the Electronic Music Cafe in Vegas 2010 to display the Art from the Tour. It has turned into a major broadcast network featuring DJs and fine artists interpreting their music. ElectronicMusicCafe.com. He also founded the Music & Arts Society, a non- profit entity for the advancement and preservation of the DJ culture, with the launch of the word's first DJ Culture exhibit entitled \\"SPIN ‚Äì Evolution of the DJ\\", that same year. Mayor Goodman issued a proclamation during the red carpet ceremony for the highly publicized affair for his outstanding contributions to education and the culture of Las Vegas. In that same year Saunders produced and released the first installment of the Above The Sound Cloud compilation series to critical acclaim. He also produced and released the first Chilled & UnBroken compilation series, as well the internationally acclaimed DJ Divas Album.BrokenRecords.us Personal life His maternal grandfather, Robert H. Miller, a funeral business owner and founder of the National Funeral Directors and Mortician's Association, was voted \\"Mayor\\" of Bronzeville (then the Black section of Chicago) from 1937 to 1939. He also became heavily involved in the American civil rights movement, walking with Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches, later erecting a statue in honor of King in Selma, Alabama. Miller also promoted the career of gospel singer Mahalia Jackson and owned and operated the Grand Ballroom, which showcased artists such as Cab Calloway and Count Basie. Saunders would end up back in Chicago and originate the musical phenomenon known as House Music in 1984. During an ABC TV News interview in 1984 he told Janet Davies that he wanted to be the next Motown music empire. At this time, his label Jes Say Records was distributing records locally and regionally to major record stores with a wholesale price twice as high as Madonna and Prince's releases. Eventually he would sign with Geffen Records and once again moved back to Southern California which would be his home for more than 27 years. Saunders married award-winning actress/musician Jazsmin Lewis in 1992. The couple eventually divorced in 1998. He now lives in Las Vegas, Nevada.

The sponsoring organization was the American Baptist Free Mission Society, of which Grosvenor was a vice-president. It was chartered by New York State in April 1848, laid the cornerstone of its main building on July 4, and opened in September 1849. Its \\"prominent features\\" were \\"Radical Anti-Slavery, and Equality of the Sexes\\". It has been called a predecessor of Cornell University. The college lasted about 10 years. As put by the author of a modern study, \\"A little town tried to create a place without any prejudice, and it did make a difference. It created humanitarians and heroes in a time where nothing else existed like this.\\" While Oberlin and Oneida had accepted African-American students, and Oberlin female students, New-York Central College was the first institution in the country founded to accept all students, and did so from its very first day. This was the vision of its founder, Cyrus Pitt Grosvenor. As was common in the Antebellum period, when there were no public secondary schools anywhere in America, Central had a large preparatory, or high school, division. Students at the college level were never more than a small minority of the student body. At the first commencement in 1855, there were five graduates, with a student body of well over 100. There were some students at the primary level. Yet there was no question that Central was a college, whatever the ratio of students, and not an academy, whose studies ended at the high school level (typically including Latin and Greek). It was preparing many students for college. It was a college.  The American Baptist Free Mission Society  = Abolitionism = The American Baptist Free Mission Society broke away from its parent, the American Baptist Home Mission Society, over the issue of slavery, more specifically whether slaveowners could be members, missionaries, or donors to the society. From the beginning, the College was to be open to all, whatever the \\"race\\" or gender. At the presentation to the citizens of McGrawville, its description begins saying that it will differ from the Hamilton Literary & Theological Institution (now Colgate University) in only one feature: \\"it lays down as a broad platform, the rights and privileges of all classes of citizens as of paramount importance. It will be an Institution of Learning from which no individual will be rejected.\\" Hamilton had a reputation for not opposing slavery; Gerrit Smith resigned from their Board of Trustees \\"on the grounds that the school was insufficiently anti-slavery\\". When Hamilton students sent a petition to the New York Legislature \\"in behalf of the oppressed free colored citizens of the state\\", this made them \\"guilty of the awful crime of abolitionism\\", and the Legislature almost immediately withdrew the College's $5,000 appropriation. The President and five professors, with the support of \\"citizens of Oneida County\\", informed the legislature than an outsider (a legislator) had misled the students, who \\"disclaim all sympathy with abolition societies\\". The anti-slavery petition was unauthorized by the faculty, and \\"at variance with the principles of the college government, and with the judgment and feeling of every officer of the institution\\". The appropriation was immediately restored. =Founding of its college= New York Central College at its opening in 1849 The College was founded in McGrawville because of a pledge by the village of $12,000 () towards construction costs; Perry, New York, had offered $10,000. The initial community meeting in McGrawville to discuss the proposed college was held on November 22, 1847. It already had a Board of Trustees, with Rev. Cyrus P. Grosvenor of Utica, who spoke at the meeting, as President. Its location not yet determined, it was referred to as the \\"Baptist Free Mission Institution\\".. Construction commenced on June 26, 1848, and the cornerstone was laid on July 4. In the cornerstone was a box with 20 items, many of them abolitionist newspapers or pamphlets.. By then it was referred to as the Free Central College. Speaking at the laying of the cornerstone, Grosvenor \\"vindicated the character of Women, repelled the idea of her inferiority to man, and maintained the necessity of giving to our daughters an education equal to that given to our sons.\\" Of the students whose gender can be determined, 35% were women. The Bible was \\"to be introduced as a text-book and test-book from beginning to end of the course of instruction.\\" Manual labor, including farmwork, was to be part of students' daily activities. This was not just for finances, although it brought in a little money, nor to prepare students for careers, to which the labor was usually unrelated, but was seen as psychologically and spiritually beneficial. At the time, this was an innovative view. Some opposition from those with means of the labor requirement was met with a stinging reply: New York Central College was the name decided on, and the College was chartered by the New York State Legislature on April 12, 1848. The Board of Trustees had 24 members. The College began activities on September 4, 1849. Black professor Charles L. Reason delivered an inaugural address, on the topic \\"Harmony of the Principles of the College with Man's True Destiny and the Tendencies of the Present Age.\\" It was described in the press as \\"full of clear comprehensive, philosophical thought, clothed in a neat and classical dress.\\" President Grosvenor spoke on \\"Education: Physical, Mental, and Moral.\\" The abolitionist philanthropist Gerrit Smith also spoke. There was a \\"congregation\\" of more than 2,000 at the induction of the faculty, the following day.  Overviews of the Central College experience  = A description of the people at a college dinner, 1850 = Two Onondaga Native Americans enrolled in the Preparatory Division. = Summary by a graduate = This is how the college was described by an alumna and instructor, Angeline Stickney: Faculty, students, subjects taught The affairs of the College were conducted with an informality and lack of rules that are startling seen from a modern perspective. There was no \\"mission statement\\" nor academic ranks, nor were specific requirements for a degree ever set down (and given the constantly changing faculty, they would have been hard to staff). The only records kept were the minutes of the Board of Trustees and the financial records, supplemented by correspondence and many newspaper articles. The relationship between teachers and students, while not amorous at all (save for the disastrous Allen‚ÄìKing affair, on which see below), was closer than would seem normal in the United States today. Most of the faculty's time was spent in contact with students, teaching formally or informally. All were living in a small town, where everyone knew each other. In most cases they attended the same church; all kitchens in McGrawville prepared similar food; all heard the same visiting lecturers. Students and professors were not allowed to use alcohol or (much more unusual) tobacco. =College finances= From a financial point of view, Central College was poorly run. There were no financial plans or budgets. There was little fundraising; no one went calling on possible donors. The college did not publicize itself. It was inadequately funded from beginning to end, and ended in bankruptcy. Except for Gerrit Smith, it had no wealthy donors, no alumni to draw upon. The American Baptist Free Mission Society gave what support it could, especially at the beginning, but it was a small group and its members had limited resources. There are contradictory reports about subvention(s) from the New York State Legislature, such as Union College, Columbia College, and others routinely received. If there was legislative support, it was not ongoing. The student body was relatively poor, and burdened with paying for accomodations and meals, and transportation to McGrawville, in addition to instruction. A school half made up of Negroes, most of whom were at the high school level, was not going to be financially prosperous or even self- sufficient. The 30% of the students who were female were also anything but prosperous. Well-to-do families who could easily afford to send their sons to college were not going to send them to the college for Negroes and women in McGrawville (uncharitably called, by enemies, \\"the nigger college\\"). Some money was brought in through the manual labor department, but not enough. So as to make education possible for these relatively inpoverished students, tuition was set very low. In the college division it was $30 per year (), and in the preparatory [high school] division, $15. The vast majority of students were in the preparatory program. An estimated 100 preparatory students per year, at $15 each, is $1,500. An estimated 20 college students at $30 each would bring in $600, for a total of $2,100 (). By comparison, 15 years previously the Canterbury Female Boarding School charged $75 for tuition, meaning the tuition paid by its 24 students totalled $1,800. Funds available to pay faculty, therefore, were very limited, and probably contributed to the high faculty turnover. Except for Grosvenor, whose children were grown, faculty were unmarried and did not have families; the salaries paid would not permit it. The college's expenses simply exceeded its income. In fact, it is remarkable that it lasted as long as it did. Previously schools with \\"racially\\" integrated bodies (the Noyes Academy and the Canterbury Female Boarding Academy) were quickly destroyed by mob violence. Faculty There were no written criteria for selecting faculty; some came with a college degree, but many did not. Apparently the President, Grosvenor and then Calkins, decided himself whom to hire and what they would teach. There was no public announcement of vacancies, nor was there an application process nor documents required. Personal contacts and correspondence played a big role. The difference between the courses and teachers for the large preparatory or high school division, and the smaller college division, was not rigid. Two faculty (Caldwell, Smith) began as students and joined the faculty upon their graduation; one (Stickney) was teaching in advance of her graduation. There was, therefore, a lot of turnover in the faculty, and the subjects taught varied depending on the faculty. There was not a faculty in the sense of a body of full-time employees. There are two known lists of the faculty (in newspaper announcements). The original faculty, in 1849, were: * C. P. Grosvenor, President, and Professor of Intellectual and Moral Philosophy (epistemology and ethics). He resigned at the end of 1851. He was replaced by Leonard G. Calkins, \\"a finished scholar, an accomplished orator, and a true gentleman, a deep thinker, of active temperament\\". * L. H. Waters and C. L. Reason, Professors of Greek, Latin and French Languages, and Mathematics and Natural Philosophy (science) * Victor M. Kingsley (1821‚Äì1897), Tutor * Mrs. Eliza M. Haven, \\"Matron, and Prof. French Language, Music, Drawing, &c.;\\" * Miss Sophia M. Lathrop [Bishop] (1828‚Äì1913), \\"Prof. English Literature, &c.;\\" Nothing is known about her education. She first taught in Friendship, New York. She only taught at Central for one year; afterwards she was Preceptress at the Hamilton Female Seminary in Hamilton, New York. Her sister Maria E. Lathrop [Bean] (1833‚Äì1908) studied at Central and also taught painting there. By 1852, three years later, the faculty were completely different (100% turnover): * Wm. Tillinghast, A.M., professor of mathematics * William G. Allen, professor of Greek and German Languages, rhetoric, and belles lettres (literature). After the departure of Grosvenor, who taught Hebrew, Allen was listed as teaching it. * E. R. Akin, A. M., D. M., professor of natural sciences * A. B. Campbell, A. M, professor of Latin language and Literature * George Lester Brockett (1827‚Äì1880), graduate of Hamilton College in 1851, was described in an obituary as professor of Elocution and German. However, he also taught Greek, German, and Physiology. \\"In 1852, he was also a tutor and the Librarian.\\" His father had Been a warm personal friend of abolitionists Beriah Green and Gerrit Smith. In 1857 his wife Caroline A. Campbell, \\"the former accomplished teacher in the department of Drawing and Painting\\", was rehired. * G. L. Brockett, A. B., tutor. She was still employed in 1858, when she spoke \\"forcibly\\" against the skirt at a National Dress Reform Convention (see Bloomers (clothing)). * A. J. Chamberlain, teacher of French and drawing. * Lydia A. Caldwell, enrolled as a student when the College opened in 1849. The year in which she graduated and became a teacher, if she did in fact graduate, is unknown, butshe remained until 1855 as \\"Professor of Rhetoric and English Literature\\". She died in 1857 of tuberculosis (\\"consumption\\"). Effusive prose pieces and poetry by Caldwell appeared in several newspapers; the references here are only examples. =Students= The student body has been well studied by Marlene Parks. There are 1062 known students; most were in the preparatory (high school) program. Of them, 64% were men, 35% female, 1% unknown. As no records were kept of it, the skin color (\\"race\\") of the students is not known; however, there were relatively few Blacks: Baquaqua, Edmonia Lewis, Benjamin Boseman, others. In 1856 there were 226 students and 9 faculty, and approximately 50% were African-American. Most were in the college's preparatory (high school) program. Curriculum and faculty Grosvenor \\"proposed a 'free institution,' for the 'literary, scientific, moral, and physical education of both sexes and of all classes of youth.'\\" The school's curriculum included classical education as well as agricultural science. The Rev. Grosvenor served as the school's first President, 1849‚Äì1851. In a newspaper advertisement we find that the Manual Labor Department was \\"under the supervision of Luther Wellington, a Practical Farmer, a kind and benevolent man, on a farm of .\\" Under the \\"careful training\\" of the President students took a Rhetorical Class \\"with daily exercises in Extemporaneous Speaking\\", \\"not to be overlooked in this day of 'public speaking'\\". The college was modeled after Oberlin, which in 1835 began admitting blacks and in 1837 women. However, New York Central College was the first American college founded on the principle that all are created equal: black and white, male and female. Qualified Black, female, and Native American students were all welcome. It was also the first to have African-American professors, in a position filled by three men: first Charles L. Reason. An unexplained disagreement with Grosvenor led to his departure. His replacement was William G. Allen, a graduate of the Oneida Institute, another short-lived school which was a predecessor of the college. After Allen's departure (see below) he was replaced by George Boyer Vashon, the first African-American graduate of Oberlin. Reason was the first black college professor in the country. Allen was Professor of Rhetoric and Greek; in 1850, when he was appointed, he was \\"well known as a lecturer upon the origin, literature, and destiny of the African race.\\" In May of 1850 there were over a hundred students enrolled, and college housing being full, students had to take rooms in private houses. Shortly after its opening, the College and McGrawville were hit by a smallpox outbreak. An 1851 student resolution gives the names of two, Homer Haskell and Erskine Spring. Four students died and the College had to close briefly. Another source says six students died. At that time, there were 150 students. In 1850 the students of the college published resolutions they had passed in support of William L. Chaplin, in jail for helping two slaves escape. There were those in Syracuse and Rochester who wished to move the College to their city, but nothing came of it. The Corresponding Secretary of the Trustees, A. H. Benedict, who was also editor of the Cortland County Express, said in an editorial that no such discussions had taken place, even privately. He suggested that instead of the College relocating to Syracuse, Syracuse should relocate to McGrawville, once \\"it has done with theatres and their appendages, and her other and numerous sources of corruption.... The moral atmosphere of a city is not congenial to the habits of students, nor the growth of an institution founded on the manusl labor principle, and on equality of sex and condition, as is this college.\\" In 1851 it was one of 11 colleges to receive New York State legislative funding; it received $1,500 (), the same amount as New York University, Fordham University, Hamilton College, and Madison University (Colgate). A few weeks later, another report says that the college received an appropriation of $25,000 (), but a college solicitation in 1855 said the College had received no appropriations from the state. A Baptist report of 1851 states that its Free Mission Society raised $30,000 () for the college. Samuel J. May in 1851 spoke at the college on the English abolitionist George Thompson (abolitionist). In 1852, according to Professor William G. Allen, \\"There is now a project on foot to attach a medical department to New York Central College. ‚Äî A glorious idea this, as, if it should be successful, it will afford an opening for study to the very many colored young men who are now, by prejudice and scorn, shut out of most, if not all, of the medical colleges in the land. The faculty are physicians of Syracuse, in high standing and repute.\\" Nothing came of this, although there is a reference to a Professor of Anatomy at the college. The medical college was established in New York City. Similarly, in 1850 there was an unsuccessful attempt to get the legislature to fund an \\"Agricultural Professorship\\". The college's first commencement was in 1855, with 5 graduates. One of the graduates, Azariah Smith, was immediately hired to teach Greek, remaining until 1858. In 1857 Howard W. Gilbert was hired as Professor of Modern Languages. A news article refers to his mastery of French, German, and Italian. Facilities Boys and men were in the dormitory occupying one floor the main building; girls (no adult female students are recorded) were in a separate residence, with a matron. There is no reference to any housing specifically for colored students. However, there was a separate cemetery for Black college students.Parks, vol. I, part 2, under Baquaqua. Hostility to the college Because of its equalitarian treatment of Black students and its Black professors, the \\"nigger college at McGrawville\\", as it was called, as well as the \\"McGrawville African College\\", received a lot of public vituperation. \\"It would be bad enough, in our estimation, to bring together girls and boys, young men and women, of the same race and color, under the same roof, in the same halls, and at the same table. But to mix together the descendants of Ham and Japeth [(sons of Noah)], the ebony sons of Africa with the fair daughters of the Anglo-Saxon, and the ruddy-cheeked boy with the Ethiopian maid, is stilt worse.\\" At that time, there not being any public colleges in the state, the New York State Legislature would appropriate funds to Union College, Hamilton College (today Colgate University), and others. A proposed appropiation to New York Central College in 1851 was the topic of much comment, the subject \\"the center of attractions [in the Legislature]...for some hours\\". A New York legislator said that rather than giving a state appropriation to that \\"vile sink of pollution\\", it would be better given to \\"a mob that will raze it to the ground\\", because it \\"was at war with every principle of American liberty\\". The New-York Tribune called it a \\"treasonable college\\", an \\"obnoxious edifice\\" where, \\"if things are suffered to go on at this rate, this whole region will become infected with Abolitionism; the contagion of Free Speech will spread til the Fugitive Slave law will become a nullity and the Union will collapse!\\" Others objected, with less outrage, to \\"the amalgamation of sexes, as well as of races.\\" These were, according to the Baltimore Sun, \\"very strange and dangerous notions\\". However, the appropriation passed comfortably, and was increased in size. The local hostility to the college was a factor in its demise. As it was put in a typically inaccurate newspaper column, which mistakenly puts Mary King's father at the head of the college: =William Allen affair= A scandal arose when, in 1853, an African-American professor, William G. Allen, became engaged to a white student, Mary King. To escape violent repercussions, Allen fled to New York City, where he was joined by his fianc√©e. They married‚Äîthe first black male‚Äìwhite female marriage in the country's history‚Äîand immediately left for England, never to return. This event exacerbated already lingering social and political opposition to the school. Marlene Parks has published a collection of press clippings, which show the hostility. =Decline and closure= In a circular of 1854 we find that \\"this Institution is now in prosperous condition. It has struggled through darkness, and mounted difficulties, until its permanency and success are placed entirely beyond doubt.\\" However, only a few years later it became clear that the College was in financial trouble. \\"Everything that an able faculty could do to advance the interests of the Institution has been done, and yet the College has not prospered. Its friends are discouraged, and the Board of Directors disheartened. Present appearances indicate that the College will either pass into the hands of its colored friends, or be purchased by the citizens of M'Grawville , and be renovated and reorganised into a seminary or academic institution [high school], or finally cease to exist as a College.\\" The school was later denied funding by the New York State Legislature, and it was bankrupt by 1858. President Calkins left for a position at \\"an eminent law school in Albany\\"; the trustees persuaded Grosvenor to take up the leadership again. The College faced bankruptcy, and discontinued operations. The philanthropist and abolitionist Gerrit Smith, who lived nearby, in Peterboro, became the proprietor of the insolvent college. He assumed its debts, which exceeded its assets; as a newspaper put it, \\"he became the owner of the property when the college was abandoned.\\" A modern scholar has suggested that Smith's breakdown and hospitalization after public discovery of his connection with John Brown's failed raid on Harpers Ferry, of late 1859, contributed to the college's closure.(Under Smith.) A smallpox epidemic struck McGrawville in 1860. The effects of the outbreak, coupled with the lingering social and political opposition and financial difficulties, caused the college to close that same year. Another source says it closed in 1859. The New York Central Railroad, with which there is no known connection, began in 1853. =New York Central Academy= According to the New York State Department of Education, New York Central Academy, organized by citizens of McGrawville, was chartered May 4, 1864. It operated from 1864 to 1867. It purchased the buildings and land for $6,500 from Gerrit Smith in 1864. purchasing it from Gerrit Smith for $6,500 in 1864. In 1868 it became part of the McGrawville Union School, and remained in use as a high school until a new building was constructed in 1885. Daniel S. Lamont (1851‚Äì1905), Secretary of War under President Grover Cleveland, was from McGraw, and studied as a child at the Central Academy, \\"the successor of a queer institution, known as the New York Central College, established by Gerrit Smith and other abolitionists, for the education of boys and girls without regard to color.\\" Alumni Marlene Parks has published an exhaustive collection of information about Central's alumni. *Angeline Stickney, teacher, suffragist, and mathematician.

Its name derives from the location of the Sultan's apartments in the inner courts of the Topkapi Palace; its head was the Kapi Agha. The Inner Service was divided into four departments.

Among the responsibilities of the Inner Service was also the running of the palace school, where selected young Christian boys, gathered through the dev≈üirme system (from the 17th century, however, Muslim boys were also admitted) were trained for the highest state offices. These boys served then as pages in the Inner Service, and were known as i√ßoƒülanƒ± (\\"lads of the interior\\"). The Inner Service was also notable for its employment of deaf-mutes (dilsiz), at least from the time of Mehmed II, to the end of the empire. They acted as guards and attendants, and due to their particular nature were often entrusted with highly confidential assignments, including executions. Their number varied but they were never numerous; they had their own uniforms, their own heads (ba≈üdilsiz), and although many were literate, they also communicated in their own special sign language.

In order to assure compliance with state and federal laws, the District engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the administrative team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District obtains parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents or guardians, who believe their child is eligible, may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the Carlynton School District Pupil Services Coordinator. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. Carlynton School District received a $830,449 supplemental funding to pay for special education services for its students, in 2010. For the 2011-12 school year, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. In 2009, Carlynton School District was identified by the Pennsylvania Department of Education for Least Restrictive Environment monitoring. One hundred ninety six schools districts were selected in 2008-09. The district received an alert letter from the PDE - Bureau of Special Education. School districts were placed in one of three categories: Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3. The district was placed in Tier One with students spending more than 80% of the school day, inside of regular education. Tier 1 districts received on-site LRE monitoring in spring 2010. The monitoring is a product of the PDE addressing its voluntary settlement in Gaskin V. Pennsylvania which ordered that special education students spend most of their school day (80%) in regular education classrooms with supplementary aids and services to assist. =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 56 or 3.55% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. Services designed to meet the needs of gifted students include the annual development of a Gifted Individual Education Plan, support services and specially-designed instruction designed to challenge the student. Students in the gifted education program are encouraged to compete in area intellectual competitions. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student‚Äôs building principal, requesting an evaluation. All requests should be made in writing which commences a 60-day evaluation deadline. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Bullying and safety In 2009, the administrative reported there were no incidents of bullying in the district. There were 20 incidents of fighting and 15 incidents of Harassment/ Threats. Four students were placed in alternative education. Carlynton School district has not posted its anti bullying policy online. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti- bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education.

Several findings were reported to the school board and administration. The district is funded by a combination of: a local earned income tax, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. Grants can provide an opportunity to supplement school funding without raising local taxes. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension income and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax, regardless of the income level.Pennsylvania Department of Revenue Income Taxation Guidelines. Accessed April 2010 =State basic education funding= In 2011-12, the district will receive $3,917,702 in state Basic Education Funding. Additionally, the district will receive $64,922 in Accountability Block Grant funding. The enacted Pennsylvania state Education budget includes $5,354,629,000 for the 2011-2012 Basic Education Funding appropriation.

According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 618 students in the Carlynton School District received free or reduced-price lunches due to low family income in the 2009-2010 school year.Pennsylvania Department of Education Funding Report by Local Education Agency, June 2011 For the 2010-11 budget year, the Carlynton School District received a 2% increase in state basic education funding for a total of $4,119,374. In Allegheny County, the highest increase went to South Fayette Township School District which received an 11.32% increase in state funding. One hundred fifty school districts in Pennsylvania received a 2% base increase for budget year 2010-11. The highest increase in the state was given to Kennett Consolidated School District of Chester County which was given a 23.65% increase in state funding. The amount of increase each school district receives was determined by the Governor and the Secretary of Education through the allocation set in the budget proposal made in February each year. In the 2009-2010 budget year the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 3.09% increase in Basic Education funding for a total of $4,038,738.

October 2009. Accountability Block Grant The state provides supplemental funding in the form of accountability block grants. The use of these funds is strictly focused on specific state approved programs and processes. Carlynton School District uses its $176,216 to fund all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd and to provide extra instruction for struggling students. These annual funds are in addition to the state's basic education funding. Schools Districts must apply each year for Accountability Block Grants. In 2009-10 the state provided $271.4 million in Accountability Block grants $199.5 million went to providing all-day kindergartens. Classrooms for the Future Grants Carlynton School Board received a grant from the PA Department of Education to purchase equipment to help reform the high school's core subjects instruction and to prepare students for future employment by using cutting-edge equipment and software. The district used the funds to purchase laptops for students, laptops for teachers, laptop carts and other digital equipment. The grant provided additional funding for a technology coach to instruct teachers in using the equipment to improve instruction. In 2006-07 and 2007-08 the district did not apply for funding. In 2008-09, the district received $110,540. Since 2006, Pennsylvania's Classrooms for the Future program has distributed more than $150 million for laptops, interactive boards and other high-tech tools in 543 high schools. In 2009, the Classrooms For the Future funding program was terminated due to a deep state revenue shortfall. =Federal Stimulus grant= The district received $1,031,022 in ARRA - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. Race to the Top grant Carlynton School District officials did not apply for the Race to the Top federal grant which would have brought the district hundreds of thousands in additional federal dollars for improving student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate.Pennsylvania's 'Race to the Top' Fueled by Effective Reforms, Strong Local Support Pennsylvania was not approved in the first round of the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved. =Real estate taxes= The Carlynton School Board set property tax rates in 2009-10 at 23.1500 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. *2010 - 24.1500 mills.School District Tax Millages 2009 in Allegheny County, Allegheny County Treasurer's Office. May 5, 2010 *2009 - 24.1500 mills. *2008 - 24.1500 mills *2007 - 24.1500 mills Act 1 Adjusted index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2010-2011 school year is 2.9 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.Pennsylvania Department of Education 2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines. The School District Adjusted Index for the Carlynton School District 2006-2007 through 2011-2012. *2006-07 - 4.6%, Base 3.9% *2007-08 - 4.2%, Base 3.4% *2008-09 - 5.4%, Base 4.4% *2009-10 - 5.2%, Base 4.1% *2010-11 - 3.6%, Base 2.9% *2011-12 - 1.7%, Base 1.4% *2012-13 - 2.1%, Base 1.7% For the 2011-12 school year the Carlynton School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index. Each year, the Carlynton School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is publisher each year by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district‚Äôs index. Of the districts who sought exceptions 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. For 2009 and 2010, the Carlynton School Board did not apply for any exceptions to exceed the Index limit. Property tax relief In 2010, property tax relief for Carlynton School District was set at $166 for 3,366 approved homesteads.Tax Relief per Homestead 2010, Pennsylvania Department of Education. May 1, 2010 In 2009, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Carlynton School District was $168 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 3,318 property owners applied for the tax relief. The relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Allegheny County, 60% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009.Special Report Pennsylvania Property Tax Relief, Pennsylvania Auditor General Office, 2-23-2010. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, so people who make substantially more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).New Census Data on Property Taxes on Homeowners, Tax Foundation, September 22, 2009. =Enrollment and consolidation= In 2011, the community of Rosslyn Farms initiated a process to secede from the Carlynton School District and join Chartiers Valley School District, a neighboring district. The reason cited is the chronically poor academic program outcomes at Carlynton School District. The community submitted a petition, signed by three fourths of the taxable residents in Rosslyn Farms, to the civil division of Common Pleas Court. According to district data, Rosslyn Farms sends 36 children to the district's schools and the remaining 34 children attend private schools. The state Department of Education projects a steady decline in enrollment in the district to 1374 pupils in 2020.Enrollment and Projections by LEA, Pennsylvania Department of Education, July 2010 A proposal has been put forward to consolidate Allegheny County school districts to save tax dollars and improve student services. The plan calls for a proposed district that includes Carlynton School District, Montour School District and Sto-Rox School District. In March 2011, the Pennsylvania Institute of Certified Public Accountants Fiscal Responsibility Task Force released a report which found that consolidating school district administrations with one neighboring district would save the Commonwealth $1.2 billion without forcing the consolidation of any school buildings. The study noted that while the best school districts spent 4% of the annual budget on administration, others spend over 15% on administration. In February 2009, Governor Edward Rendell proposed reducing the number of school districts in Pennsylvania from 500 to 100. He asserted that consolidation of adjacent school district administrations, in each county, would achieve substantial administrative cost savings. The proposal claimed that the savings could be redirected to improving lagging reading and science achievement, to enriching the academic programs or to reducing residents' property taxes.Pennsylvania Public School Enrollments by School District and LEA January 2009Rendell, E. & Soderberg, M. (2009). Pennsylvania school district consolidation. 2009-10 Executive Budget Fast Facts. Pennsylvania Office of the Governor. Pennsylvania has one of the highest numbers of school districts in the nation. In Pennsylvania, 80% of the school districts serve student populations under 5,000, and 40% serve less than 2,000. Less than 95 of Pennsylvania's 501 school districts have enrollment below 1250 students, in 2007.Pennsylvania Legislative Budget and Finance Committee, Study of the Cost Effectiveness of Consolidating Pennsylvania School Districts, 2007. This results in excessive school administration bureaucracy and not enough course diversity. In a survey of 88 superintendents of small districts, 42% of the respondents stated that they thought consolidation would save money without closing any schools.Study of the cost-effectiveness of consolidating Pennsylvania districts. New York: Standard & Poor‚Äôs School Evaluation Services. 2007, p. 6. Extracurriculars The district offers a variety of clubs, activities and sports. Eligibility for participation is set by school board policy and the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools.

King is considered the most respected bridge builder of the 19th century Deep South, constructing dozens of bridges in Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi.The New Georgia Encyclopedia, \\"Horace King (1807-1885)\\", retrieved November 3, 2007. In 1807, King was born into slavery on a South Carolina plantation. A slave trader sold him to a man who saw something special in Horace King. His owner, John Godwin taught King to read and write as well as how to build at a time when it was illegal to teach slaves. King worked hard and despite bondage, racial prejudice and a multitude of obstacles, King focused his life on working hard and being a genuinely good man. King built bridges, warehouses, homes, churches, and most importantly, he bridged the depths of racism. Ultimately, dignity, respect and freedom were his rewards, as he transcended the color lines inherent in the Old South of the nineteenth century. Horace King became a highly accomplished Master Builder and he emerged from the Civil War as a legislator in the State of Alabama. Affectionately known as Horace ‚ÄúThe Bridge Builder‚Äù King and the \\"Prince of Bridge Builders,\\" he also served his community in many important civic capacities.\\" J. David Dameron, Horace King: From Slave to Master Builder and Legislator, Southeast Research Publishing, LLC, 2017.  Early career  Horace King was born into slavery in 1807 in the Cheraw District of South Carolina, in present-day Chesterfield County. King's ancestry was a mix of African, European, and Catawba. Mid-20th century biographer F. L. Cherry described his complexion as showing more \\"Indian blood than any other.\\"F.L. Cherry, \\"The History of Opelika and Her Agricultural Tributary Territory\\", The Alabama Historical Quarterly 15, No. 2 (1953), pp. 193, 197. Taught to read and write at an early age, he had become a proficient carpenter and mechanic by his teenage years. Records indicate King spent his first 23 years near his birthplace, with his first introduction to bridge construction in 1824.Lupold and French, Deep South Rivers, 14, 20. In 1824, bridge architect Ithiel Town came to Cheraw to assist in the construction of a bridge over the Pee Dee River. While it is unknown whether King assisted in the construction of this bridge or its replacement span built in 1828, Town's lattice truss design, used in both Pee Dee bridges, became a hallmark of King's future work.Lupold and French, Deep South Rivers, 20 When King's master died around 1830, King was sold to John Godwin, a contractor who also worked on the Pee Dee bridge.Cherry, History of Opelika, 197; Lupold and French, Bridging Deep South Rivers, 20. King may have been related to the family of Godwin's wife, Ann Wright. In 1832, Godwin received a contract to construct a bridge across the Chattahoochee River from Columbus, Georgia to Girard, Alabama (today Phenix City). Initially living in Columbus, he moved to Girard in 1833, taking King with him.Lupold and French, Bridging Deep South Rivers, 51. The pair began many other construction projects, including house building. They built Godwin‚Äôs house first, then King‚Äôs. This was followed by many speculative houses, and the two men completed nearly every early house in Girard. The Columbus City Bridge was the first known to be built by King, who likely planned the construction of the bridge and managed the slave laborers who built the span.The New Georgia Encyclopedia,\\"Horace King (1807-1885)\\".  Rise to prominence  Between the completion of the Columbus City Bridge in 1833 and the early 1840s, King and Godwin partnered on no fewer than eight major construction projects throughout the South. The partners constructed some forty cotton warehouses in Apalachicola, Florida in 1834. Scholars believe that Godwin sent King in the mid-1830s for study at Oberlin College in Ohio, the first college in the United States to admit African-American students. The two men designed and built the courthouses of Muscogee County, Georgia and Russell County, Alabama from 1839‚Äì1841, and bridges in West Point, Georgia (1838), Eufaula, Alabama (1838‚Äì39), Florence, Georgia (1840). They built a replacement for their Columbus City Bridge between Columbus and Girard in 1841, as the original had been destroyed during an 1838 flood.Lupold and French, Bridging Deep South Rivers, 83-84; Cherry, History of Opelika, 194. Bridge completed in 1839 by King over the Chattahoochee River at Eufaula, Alabama. During a time of financial difficulty, in 1837 Godwin transferred ownership of King to his wife and her uncle, William Carney Wright of Montgomery, Alabama. This may have been done to protect King from being taken and sold by Godwin's creditors. King was allowed to marry Frances Gould Thomas, a free woman of color, in April 1839. It was extremely uncommon for slave owners to allow such marriages, since Frances' free status meant that their children would all be born free. Slave states had incorporated the principle of partus sequitur ventrem into law since the colonial period, which said that children took the social status of their mothers, whether slave or free. By 1840, King was being publicly acknowledged as being a \\"co-builder\\" along with Godwin, an uncommon honor for a slave.Lupold and French, Deep South Rivers, 83. King's prominence had eclipsed that of his master by the early 1840s. He worked independently as architect and superintendent of major bridge projects in Columbus, Mississippi (1843) and Wetumpka, Alabama (1844). While working on the Eufaula bridge, King met Tuscaloosa attorney and entrepreneur Robert Jemison, Jr., who soon began using King on a number of different projects in Lowndes County, Mississippi, including the Columbus, Mississippi bridge. Jemison would remain King's friend and associate for the rest of his life.Lupold and French, Deep South Rivers, 100, 121. King bridged the Tallapoosa River at Tallassee, Alabama in 1845. Later that same year he built three small bridges for Jemison near Steens, Mississippi, where the latter owned several mills.  Freedom  Horace King used bridge-building techniques to design the spiral staircase in the Alabama State Capitol so that a central support was not required. Despite his enslavement, King was allowed to keep a significant income from his work. In 1846, he used some of his earnings to purchase his freedom from the Godwin family and Wright. But, under Alabama law of the time, a freed slave was allowed to remain in the state only for a year after manumission. Jemison, who served in the Alabama State Senate, arranged for the state legislature to pass a special law giving King his freedom and exempting him from the manumission law. In 1852, King used his freedom to purchase land near his former master.Lupold and French, Deep South Rivers, 123-130. When Godwin died in 1859, King had a monument erected over his grave. In 1849, the Alabama State Capitol burned, and King was hired to construct the framework of the new capitol building, as well as design and build the twin spiral entry staircases. King used his knowledge of bridge-building to cantilever the stairs' support beams so that the staircases appeared to \\"float,\\" without any central support.Lupold and French, Deep South Rivers, 134-135. Around 1855, King formed a partnership with two other men to construct a bridge, known as Moore's Bridge, over the Chattahoochee between Newnan and Carrollton, Georgia, near Whitesburg. Instead of collecting a fee for his work, King took stock instead, gaining a one-third interest in the bridge. King moved his wife and children to the area near the bridge about 1858, although he continued to commute between it and their other home in Alabama. Frances King and their children collected the bridge tolls and farmed at Moore's Bridge. The earnings from Moore's Bridge generated a steady income for King and his family. He also continued to design and construct major bridge projects through the remainder of the 1850s, including a major bridge in Milledgeville, Georgia and a second Chattahoochee crossing at Columbus, Georgia.Lupold and French, Deep South Rivers, 143-150. As slaveholder In the 1850s in Columbus, King purchased a slave who eventually became known as celebrated abolitionist J. Sella Martin. When King attempted to subdue Martin by flogging him, he was disappointed by the man's resistance. He quickly sold Martin to a slave trader.Freedom and Slavery in the United States of America, 162  War times  King was conscripted to assist in the construction of Confederate ironclads, including this ship, the CSS Muscogee. As the American Civil War approached in 1860, King, like many blacks in the South, opposed secession of the Southern states and was a confirmed Unionist. After the outbreak of hostilities, King attempted to continue his business as an architect and builder, constructing a factory and a mill in Coweta County, Georgia and a bridge in Columbus, Georgia. While working on the Columbus bridge, King was conscripted by Confederate authorities to build obstructions in the Apalachicola River, south of Columbus to prevent a naval attack on that city. After completing the obstructions on the Apalachicola, King was tasked to construct defenses on the Alabama River before returning to Columbus in 1863.Lupold and French, Deep South Rivers, 163-167. By this time, Columbus had become a major shipbuilding city for the Confederacy. King and his men were assigned to assist construction of naval vessels at the Columbus Iron Works and Navy Yard. In 1863-64, King constructed a rolling mill for the Iron Works, which manufactured cladding for Confederate ironclad warships. King's crews also provided lumber and timbers for the Navy Yard. They were at least peripherally involved with the construction of the CSS Muscogee.Lupold and French, Deep South Rivers, 167-169. During 1864 King wrote to Jemison, who had also opposed secession but was then serving in the Confederate Senate. He asked what would be likely to happen if he stopped his work for the Confederacy. Jemison's response is unknown. As the war approached its end in 1864, many of King's bridges were destroyed by Union troops. This included Moore's Bridge, which King owned. Moore's Bridge was destroyed by Union cavalry in July 1864. Frances King died on October 1, 1864 at Girard, leaving King a widower with five surviving children to care for. Raiders under Union general James H. Wilson assaulted Columbus in April 1865, burning all of King's bridges in that city, including the one he had finished less than two years earlier.Lupold and French, Deep South Rivers, 174-175, 178-181. King remarried in June 1865 to Sarah Jane Jones McManus.  King and Reconstruction  King's third rebuilding of the Columbus City Bridge in 1865, six months after his previous bridge at this location was burned by Union troops. View of entrance on the Alabama side. The postwar period resulted in new opportunities for King. Within six months after the war's end, King and a partner had constructed a cotton warehouse in Columbus, and King had‚Äîfor the third time‚Äîrebuilt the original Columbus City Bridge. Over the next three years, King would construct three more bridges across the Chattahoochee: in Columbus, and two at West Point, Georgia, plus two large factories, and the Lee County, Alabama courthouse.Lupold and French, Deep South Rivers, 182-195, 210. When the Reconstruction Acts were implemented in 1867, King became a registrar for voters in Russell County, Alabama. Later that year, he attempted to establish a colony of freedmen in Georgia. While that plan was unsuccessful, King was elected to the Alabama House of Representatives in 1868 as a Republican representing Russell County. Busy in his construction business in Columbus, King did not take his seat for more than a year, in November 1869. King remained a reluctant legislator, voting 78% of the time and proposing only three bills‚Äînone of which became law. King was reelected in 1870, proposing no bills in the 1870-71 session and only five in the 1871-72 session, one of which‚Äîa prohibition on the sale of alcohol in Hurtsboro, Alabama‚Äîbecame law. King did not seek reelection in 1872.Lupold and French, Deep South Rivers, 211-221.  Final years  King in his later years. King left the Alabama Legislature in 1872 and moved with his family to LaGrange, Georgia. While in LaGrange, King continued building bridges, but also expanded to include other construction projects, specifically businesses and schools. By the mid-1870s, King had begun to pass on his bridge construction activities to his five children, who formed the King Brothers Bridge Company. King's health began failing in the 1880s, and he died on May 28, 1885 in LaGrange.Lupold and French, Deep South Rivers, 223-239. King received laudatory obituaries in each of Georgia's major newspapers, a rarity for African Americans in the 1880s South. He was posthumously inducted into the Alabama Engineers Hall of Fame at the University of Alabama. The award was accepted on his behalf by his great- grandson, Horace H. King, Jr. He was remembered both for his engineering skill and for his character.Lupold and French, Deep South Rivers, 239-240; Horace King (1807-1888) Georgia's Master Bridge Builder , retrieved November 4, 2007.

M. 'La vida de un eximio investigador cient√≠fico. Dr. Fernando Altamirano'. Revista de la Sociedad Mexicana de Historia Natural, 3¬™. 1912. P. 81-84. In 1868, Altamirano moved to Mexico City, where he studied at the newly opened National Preparatory School. A year later, he attended the National School of Medicine, Mexico, where he finished his studies in 1873. That same year, he entered the Academy of Medicine, which would be renamed a few years later as a National Academy of Medicine of Mexico. He also joined the Mexican Society of Natural History. On November 9, 1873, Altamirano married Luisa Gonzalez, in the city of Santiago de Quer√©taro.IRI - Family Search.

Fernando and Luisa soon returned to Mexico City, where they had at least ten children, among them Jos√© Maria (1874) Josefa (1877), Rafael (1879), Fernando (1881), Luisa (1881), Maria (1883), Jos√© Ignacio (1885) Alberto (1886), Carlos (1886), and Jose Salvador (1890). Initially, Altamirano worked as a temporary assistant in the departments of pharmacy, pharmacology and drug history at the National School of Medicine, Mexico. In 1876, he published the catalog of indigenous natural products submitted by the Mexican Society of Natural History to the Centennial International Exhibition in Philadelphia, in 1876.Altamirano, Fernando.

In 1877, he was employed as pharmacist, or preparer of medications, and in 1878 obtained the degree of professor in the School of Medicine. He continued as a pharmacist and as a professor of pharmacology and physiology, but also as an interim professor of therapeutic, topographic anatomy and gynecology. In addition, he worked as a physician in the Hospital of San Andres and in private practice. In the same period, he published several articles in the Medical Gazette of Mexico and in the journal of the Mexican Society of History Natural.Le√≥n, Nicol√°s.

Obtained from http://www.scielo.org.pe/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid;=S1018-130X2005000300009 During this period, he also made numerous trips of medical botany to different regions of the country, some in the company of internationally renowned botanists as Joseph Nelson Rose, Cyrus Pringle and George Russell Shaw. Additionally, Altamirano conducted numerous investigations, reported on the two journals of the institute: El Estudio and Anales del Instituto M√©dico Nacional. On the other hand, he was responsible for the Institute's involvement in the Exposition Universelle (1889), held in Paris, and in the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition, held in St. Louis, Missouri, and participated in several international conferences, such as the Ninth International Congress of Hygiene and Demography, held in Madrid from 10 to 17 April 1898.La Ilustraci√≥n Espa√±ola y Americana.

He was alderman in Mexico City in 1897, and in Villa Guadalupe on several occasions. He died on October 7, 1908, at his home in Villa Guadalupe, Mexico City, due to an internal bleeding, resulted from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. He was buried in the Pantheon of Tepeyac in the same city.IRI - Family Search. 'Mexico, Distrito Federal, Civil Registration, 1832-2005, Gustavo A. Madero, Defunciones 1907-'.

Scientific contributions Altamirano registered for the first time the cholinergic activity of seeds of the tree (Erythrina coralloides), an activity that he suggested was due to the presence of an unknown alkaloid, which he called erythroidine. He conducted studies on the properties of the erythrina coralloides with Manuel Dominguez in 1877, and individually in 1888.Altamirano, F. y Dominguez M. 'Del Color√≠n'.

'Isolation of Erythroidine, an Alkaloid of Curare Action from Erythrina americana Mill'. Journal of the American Chemical Society 59:1580. 1937. In 1878, Altamirano published his thesis for the degree of professor, entitled Contribution to the Study of National Pharmacology: Medicinal Indigenous Legumes whose illustrations were drawn by his friend, the painter Jos√© Mar√≠a Velasco G√≥mez.Altamirano, Fernando.

In 1894, along with Jos√© Ram√≠rez, Altamirano wrote an advanced report on environmental remediation, entitled: List of botanical and common names of trees and shrubs to repopulate the forests of the Republic, accompanied by an indication of the climates where they grow and how to propagate them.Altamirano, Fernando y Ramirez, Jos√©.

Ministry of Development, Mexico. 1894. 17 p. Moreover, in 1895, he discovered a species of axolotl not known before in the mountains around Mexico City. He sent a specimen to the French zoologist Alfredo Dug√®s, at that time living in Guanajuato, who identified this axolotl as a member of a new species, and named it Ambystoma altamirani, in honor of Altamirano.Altamirano, Fernando. 'Sobre algunas excursiones a las monta√±as del Ajusco y Serran√≠a de Las Cruces'. Report to the Ministry of Development, Mexico. 1895. 66 p. The next year, he published an interesting article entitled Natural History Applied to Ancient Mexicans.Altamirano, Fernando. Historia natural aplicada a los antiguos mexicanos. Anales del Instituto M√©dico Nacional, t. 2. 1896. p. 261-272. Afterwards, he translated from Latin to Spanish the work of Francisco Hern√°ndez de Toledo on plants of New Spain. In addition, in 1898, he obtained a copy of the manuscripts written by Jos√© Mariano Moci√±o, which remained in Europe. In 1904, Altamirano presented the book Materia Medica Mexicana: a manual of Mexican medicinal herbs for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, held in St. Louis, Missouri. This book was based on the numerous studies published in the \\"Data for Mexican Materia Medica\\" by the National Medical Institute, in which he contributed significantly.Altamirano, Fernando.

Comisi√≥n Nacional Mexicana en la Exposici√≥n Universal de San Luis de 1904. 1904. 78 p. One year later, in 1905, Altamirano and Joseph Nelson Rose described a euphorbiaceae from the states of Guanajuato, Quer√©taro and Michoac√°n, locally called palo amarillo. They considered it a new species and named it Euphorbia elastica, although now it also known as Euphorbia fulva.Altamirano, Fernando. El Palo Amarillo. Ministry of Development, Mexico. Instituto M√©dico Nacional. 1905 Altamirano was interested in this euphorbiaceae due to its elastic resin content, which he hoped could be profitably converted into commercial rubber, as had been previously done with guayule in northern Mexico. In the National Medical Institute, he and his colleagues conducted several studies with the palo amarillo until 1908, but they could not get commercial rubber extracted from it in a profitable way.

Cocaine overdose may result in cardiovascular and brain damage, such as: constricting blood vessels in the brain, causing strokes and constricting arteries in the heart; causing heart attacks.Cocaine Use and Its Effects The use of cocaine creates euphoria and high amounts of energy. If taken in large doses, it is possible to cause mood swings, paranoia, insomnia, psychosis, high blood pressure, a fast heart rate, panic attacks, cognitive impairments and drastic changes in personality. The symptoms of cocaine withdrawal (also known as comedown or crash) range from moderate to severe: dysphoria, depression, anxiety, psychological and physical weakness, pain, and compulsive cravings. Signs and symptoms Cocaine is a powerful stimulant known to make users feel energetic, cheerful, talkative, etc. In time, negative side effects include increased body temperature, irregular or rapid heart rate, high blood pressure, increased risk of heart attacks, strokes and even sudden death from cardiac arrest. Many habitual abusers develop a transient, manic-like condition similar to amphetamine psychosis and schizophrenia, whose symptoms include aggression, severe paranoia, restlessness, confusion and tactile hallucinations; which can include the feeling of something crawling under the skin (formication), also known as \\"coke bugs\\", during binges. Users of cocaine have also reported having thoughts of suicide, unusual weight loss, trouble maintaining relationships, and an unhealthy, pale appearance. =Withdrawal symptoms= After using cocaine on a regular basis, many users will become addicted. When the drug is discontinued immediately, the user will experience what has come to be known as a \\"crash\\" along with a number of other cocaine withdrawal symptoms, including paranoia, depression, exhaustion, anxiety, itching, mood swings, irritability, fatigue, insomnia, an intense craving for more cocaine, and in some cases nausea and vomiting. Some cocaine users also report having similar symptoms to schizophrenia patients and feel that their mind is lost. Some users also report formication: a feeling of a crawling sensation on the skin also known as \\"coke bugs\\". These symptoms can last for weeks or, in some cases, months. Even after most withdrawal symptoms dissipate most users feel the need to continue using the drug; this feeling can last for years and may peak during times of stress. About 30‚Äì40% of individuals with cocaine dependence will turn to other substances such as medication and alcohol after giving up cocaine. There are various medications on the market to ease cocaine withdrawal symptoms. Risk A study consisting of 1,081 U.S. residents who had first used cocaine within the previous 24 months was conducted. It was found that the risk of becoming dependent on cocaine within two years of first use was 5‚Äì6%. The risk of becoming dependent within 10 years of first use increased to 15‚Äì16%. These were the aggregate rates for all types of use considered, such as smoking, snorting, and injecting. Among recent-onset users individual rates of dependency were higher for smoking (3.4 times) and much higher for injecting. Women were 3.3 times more likely to become dependent, compared with men. Users who started at ages 12 or 13 were four times as likely to become dependent compared to those who started between ages 18 and 20. However, a study of non-deviantThe study's authors stated that they wanted to know which effects and consequences of cocaine use would become visible with persons who are mainstream citizens or as close to that social stratum as possible users in Amsterdam found a \\"relative absence of destructive and compulsive use patterns over a ten year period\\" and concluded that cocaine users can and do exercise control. \\"Our respondents applied two basic types of controls to themselves: 1) restricting use to certain situations and to emotional states in which cocaine's effects would be most positive, and 2) limiting mode of ingestion to snorting of modest amounts of cocaine, staying below 2.5 grams a week for some, and below 0.5 grams a week for most. Nevertheless, those whose use level exceeded 2.5 grams a week all returned to lower levels\\".Cohen, Peter; Sas, Arjan (1994). Cocaine use in Amsterdam in non deviant subcultures. Addiction Research, Vol. 2, No. 1, pp. 71-94.  Treatment  =Therapy= Twelve-step programs such as Cocaine Anonymous (modeled on Alcoholics Anonymous) have been widely used to help those with cocaine addiction. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) combined with motivational therapy (MT) have proven to be more helpful than 12 step programs in treating cocaine dependency. However, both these approaches have a fairly low success rate. Other non-pharmacological treatments such as acupuncture and hypnosis have been explored, but without conclusive results. =Medications= Numerous medications have been investigated for use in cocaine dependence, but , none of them were considered to be effective. Anticonvulsants, such as carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, and topiramate, do not appear to be effective as treatment. Limited evidence suggests that antipsychotics are also ineffective for treatment of cocaine dependence. Few studies have examined bupropion (a novel antidepressant) for cocaine dependence; however, trials performed thus far have not shown it to be an effective form of treatment for this purpose. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) of the U.S. National Institutes of Health is researching modafinil, a narcolepsy drug and mild stimulant, as a potential cocaine treatment. Ibogaine has been under investigation as a treatment for cocaine dependency and is used in clinics in Mexico, the Netherlands and Canada, but cannot be used legally in the United States. Other medications that have been investigated for this purpose include acetylcysteine, baclofen, and vanoxerine. Medications such as phenelzine, have been used to cause an \\"aversion reaction\\" when administered with cocaine. Epidemiology In the United States, cocaine use results in about 5,000‚Äì6,000 deaths annually. Research Kim Janda has been working for years on a vaccination that would treat cocaine use disorders by limiting its rewarding effects. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is being studied as a treatment for cocaine addiction. So far studies have been undertaken by Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), and Mexican National Institute of Psychiatry.

She was used by the Union Navy as a gunboat assigned to patrol Confederate waterways. Naumkeag, a wooden stern-wheel steamboat built at Cincinnati, Ohio, early in 1863, was purchased by the Navy at Cairo, Illinois, 14 April 1863 from Allen Collier; and commissioned at Mound City, Illinois, 16 April 1863, Lt. Comdr. George Brown in command.  The Union effort to control the rivers of the Confederacy  The Civil War in the west was largely a struggle to control the Mississippi River and its tributaries which united vast reaches of the Confederacy. As determined Federal forces wiped out Southern naval power on these inland waters, and finally won unbroken possession of the Mississippi Valley with the conquest of Vicksburg, the South selected cavalry raids and guerilla tactics as the most promising means of snatching their fruits of victory from the North.  The terror tactics of Confederate General John Morgan  On 7 July 1863, three days after Vicksburg surrendered, Brig. Gen. John Hunt Morgan, CSA, attacked Union positions on the upper Ohio and captured Union steamers John T. McCombs and Alice Dean. He crossed the river at Brandenburg and raced east through southern Indiana and Ohio -- burning bridges, tearing up railroads, destroying Federal public property, and terrifying the countryside.  In pursuit of General Morgan  Learning of the attack the next day, Lt. Comdr. Le Royo Fitch, the Union naval commander in the region, ordered his ships up river in pursuit of the raiders. Naumkeag joined the chase on the 10th. On the 19th, the gunboats caught up with Morgan at a ford above Buffington Island some 250 miles east of Cincinnati, Ohio, and attacked, forcing the Southerners to flee up river leaving their wounded and foot soldiers behind to be captured. The Union ships followed Morgan‚Äôs troops until stopped by shallow water.  Final operations, decommissioning and civilian career  Naumkeag continued to operate on the western rivers through the end of the war. She decommissioned at Mound City, Illinois, 11 August 1865, and was sold at public auction there to Charles F. Dumont 17 August 1865. She redocumented as Montgomery 16 September 1865 and served on the rivers of the South until destroyed by fire at Erie, Alabama, 19 January 1867.

Background James Ingraham was a 14-year-old eighth grade student at Charles R. Drew Junior High SchoolCharles R. Drew Junior High School is today known as Charles R. Drew Middle School. in 1970. On October 6, 1970, Ingraham was accused of failing to promptly leave the stage of the school auditorium when asked to do so by a teacher.Virginia Lee (1979). \\"A Legal Analysis of Ingraham v. Wright\\". In Corporal Punishment in American Education: Readings in History, Practice, and Alternatives. Irwin A. Hyman and James H. Wise, editors. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Temple University Press. Page 173. He was then taken to the school principal's office, where he stated that he was not guilty of the accusation against him. Willie J. Wright, Jr., the principal, ordered Ingraham to bend over so that Wright could spank Ingraham with a spanking paddle. When Ingraham declined to bend over and allow himself to be paddled, he was forcibly placed face-down on the top of a table. Lemmie Deliford, the assistant principal, held Ingraham's arms and Solomon Barnes, an assistant to the principal, held Ingraham's legs. While Ingraham was being restrained, Wright used a spanking paddle to hit Ingraham more than 20 times.Ibid., p. 174. The paddling was so severe that he suffered a hematoma requiring medical attention. Physicians instructed Ingraham to rest at home for a total of eleven days.United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit; 498 F.2d 248, paragraph 29, July 29, 1974. He and his parents sued the school, calling it \\"cruel and unusual punishment\\" and loss of liberty, but lost the initial trial. The Florida state court held that Florida tort laws provided sufficient remedies to satisfy Ingraham's due process loss of liberty claims. The court also held that the U.S. Constitution's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment does not apply to the corporal punishment of children in public schools, and that the constitution's due process clause does not require notice and a hearing prior to the imposition of corporal punishment in public schools. Opinion of the Court The Supreme Court declined to consider the plaintiffs' substantive due process claims in Ingraham v. Wright. Lower courts have adopted a variety of approaches to the substantive due process issue, none of which offer much protection for students who are subjected to corporal punishment at school. The Supreme Court has repeatedly denied certiorari (judicial review) on the issue of whether school corporal punishment constitutes a substantive due process constitutional violation.Deana Pollard Sacks (2009). \\"State Actors Beating Children: A Call For Judicial Relief.\\" University of California Davis Law Review, 42, pp. 1165‚Äî1229. As of 1994, Lemmie Deliford, one of the administrators involved, was still a proponent of corporal punishment in schools.

The mascot of Kingman High School is an English bulldog.  History  Kingman High School's history dates back to the beginning of Mohave County, Arizona. When the original school was built in 1917, it was named Mohave County Union High School or Mohave Union High School. It was built in Kingman on the site of an old pioneer cemetery. In later years it became known as Kingman High School. In 1936, a gymnasium was built on the Kingman High School campus. The WPA-funded project included a lamella roof, rare for Arizona and unique to Kingman. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. In 1993 a new high school outside of the Kingman city limits was built, known as Kingman High School North; it was the campus for the sophomores, juniors, and seniors. Freshmen attended the old school, Kingman High South. In 2006, all high school students began to attend the North campus (by now known as simply Kingman High School). The campus was reused as a middle school (White Cliffs) and is currently Lee Williams High School (9th and 10th grade only for 2013-2014). The historic gymnasium remains on the old campus and was not affected by the conversion. Courses The school has some 500 students in AP, honors, or dual enrollment (through Mohave Community College) courses.

As a child, he started to study piano, but at the age of eight he decided to switch to guitar, having been inspired by The Beatles. He developed a love of jazz in high school and attended Berklee College of Music in Boston. He decided to change to the harmonica because \\"I was one of a million guitarists at Berklee\\" and it was easy to carry around.NPR interview, 2004 He became Berklee's only harmonica player. He toured extensively in Europe with Billy Leadbelly (Bill Gough from Hatfield UK). Among his role models at the time were Toots Thielemans and Stevie Wonder. After Berklee, he studied at Wesleyan University, then returned to New York City in 1982. He performed at various New York venues, including The Village Gate, The Blue Note and the Lone Star Cafe with legendary jazz musicians Jaco Pastorius and Jaki Byard. He also played with his own group at Preacher's Cafe in Greenwich Village. Collaborations and recordings Galison has worked with Carly Simon, Sting, Barbra Streisand, Peggy Lee, Chaka Khan, Steve Tyrell, and Astrud Gilberto. He performed Gordon Jacob's \\"Suite for Harmonica and Orchestra\\" and toured the US in the Broadway musical, Big River. He has recorded soundtracks for films, most notably Academy Award nominees The Untouchables and Bagdad Caf√©. His harmonica is also heard on the Sesame Street theme (\\"a great honor\\") and commercials. Other television work includes Oz and Saturday Night Live.WILLIAM GALISON Jazz harmonica player One of his major influences and role models, Toots Thielemans, once described him as \\"the most original and individual of the new generation of harmonica players\\". Got You On My Mind and Madeleine Peyroux In 2002, Galison met jazz singer and guitarist Madeleine Peyroux in a bar in Greenwich Village. They started to play music together and eventually moved in together. By the end of the year Peyroux had moved out and the couple had broken up, but they continued playing together and recorded a seven-song CD called Got You on My Mind in February 2003. Peyroux and Galison maintained an intermittent relationship, and Peyroux alleged that Galison became abusive at times; Galison denied the allegation. Peyroux's contract with Rounder Records prohibited her from selling the Got You on My Mind recording, and she stopped performing with Galison. Galison continued to sell the recording and claimed that he was owed payment for canceled performances. The two artists and Peyroux's record label commenced an extended series of lawsuits and court cases.

Improved! is the third album by American rock group Blue Cheer. Released in March 1969 by Philips Records, it is their first without original guitarist Leigh Stephens. The album features songs recorded by two different group lineups: in addition to bassist and vocalist Dickie Peterson and drummer Paul Whaley, side one includes Bruce Stephens (no relation to Leigh) on guitar and Burns Kellogg on keyboards; while side two includes Randy Holden on guitar and vocals. The two lineups contribute very different material: with Holden, the approach is closer to the previous Blue Cheer albums; with Kellogg and Peterson, they explore more understated blues rock and country rock styles. Also, unlike their earlier albums, Peterson plays a smaller role. Holden wrote and sings the songs on side two, while Kellogg and Stephens contribute most of the material on side one. New! Improved! was slightly more successful than the group's previous album, Outsideinside, and reached number 84 on the Billboard 200 album chart. One single \\"West Coast Child of Sunshine\\", backed with \\"When It All Gets Old\\", was released, but did not reach the charts. The album has been reissued several times and a 1994 release by Repertoire Records includes two songs first released in 1969 on a non-album single.

Critical reception In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Mark Deming gave the album three and a half out of five stars. He emphasizes the two very different musical styles: terms such as \\"rootsy\\", \\"country rock\\", and \\"percussive boogie\\" are used to describe the songs with Kellogg and Stephens, while Holden's \\"contributions feel a lot more like the group's formative work [and] suggest an evolution from the towering proto-metal of Vincebus Eruptum and Outsideinside\\".

This was the largest military hospital in Australia, during World War II. Known as the 118 General Hospital it was planned as a hospital centre of five hospitals consisting of 490 timber barracks-type buildings, which could house a total of 4,250 beds and accommodate up to 1,250 patients and 3,500 staff. The hospital was formed by doctors and nurses from the Johns Hopkins University Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. The hospital staff arrived in Sydney during June 1942 and ran a 400-bed hospital from August 1942, with a section at the Hydro Majestic Hotel at Medlow Bath. Mrs Eleanor Roosevelt, wife of the US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, visited the 118 General Hospital on 8 September 1943. The US Army vacated the hospital in 1945 and the Royal Navy occupied many of the buildings in January 1945 and the Australian Army used the remainder of the other buildings. After World War II the site passed to the New South Wales Housing Commission from March 1946 and the huts were used to ease the post-war housing shortage.

As with a major, the college or university in question lays out a framework of required classes or class types a student must complete to earn the minor ‚Äì although the latitude the student is given changes from college to college. Academic minors and majors differ in that the former is subordinate to the latter - fewer courses are required to complete a minor program of study than a major program of study. To obtain an academic minor, a total of three years of study at a university in a selected subject is the usual requirement. Some students will prepare for their intended career with their major, while pursuing personal interests with a minor, for example, majoring in civil engineering while minoring in a foreign language or performing arts. Other students may pursue a minor to provide specific specialization and thus make themselves more attractive to employers. It is not infrequent for a physics major to minor in computer science, or an engineering or economics student to minor in mathematics. Students intending to become secondary education teachers often major in their teaching subject area (for example, history or chemistry) and minor in education. Postgraduate minors While academic minors are usually associated with undergraduate degrees as a student's secondary focus, academic minors also exist at the postgraduate level, particularly in US institutions. Sometimes this can refer to a student's minor or secondary field within their discipline, such as a political science PhD student pursuing a major field in American politics and a minor field in political theory, or a religious studies PhD student pursuing a major field in theology and a minor field in history of religion. However, as in undergraduate courses of study, outside postgraduate study minors also exist at many universities ‚Äì sometimes officially and sometimes unofficially. For example, at Oregon State University, master's and PhD students are able to pursue an official postgraduate minor in addition to the discipline of their degree. At Florida State University, postgraduate minors exist on an unofficial basis on the grounds that a master's or doctoral student takes at least 9 and at most 18 credit hours in a secondary field outside of his or her academic discipline. Typically, an outside minor at the maximum allowed credit hours or quarter credit units (typically 18 credit hours in many public universities, or 24 credit units at others) fulfills a qualifying requirement to teach the discipline as an adjunct at a community college or state college, and the research experience and connections from an outside minor can also be tailored toward pursuing a non-academic career related to the minor field. Some PhD students, pursuing an outside postgraduate minor, choose to integrate the minor field into their dissertation, with a scholar from their minor field serving as an outside committee member on their dissertation.

Aside from transporting passengers by bus, Partas offers chartered service for tour groups. Etymology The name \\"Partas\\" was derived from the term \\"Satrap\\", an ancient Persian language word for \\"governor\\" (since Luis Chavit Singson, the owner, served as governor of Ilocos Sur for many years), spelled in reverse or palindrome,. \\"Satrap\\" also refers to the name of the construction business owned and managed by Partas' owner/operator. Partas also sounds like \\"pardas,\\" an Ilocano term for \\"being fast\\" or \\"speed.\\" History Partas was founded on July 25, 1989 and started its operations in 1991, a time when Philippine Rabbit and rival Farinas Transit ruled the Ilocos routes; and with millionaire Santiago Rondaris' Times Transit shut down for good due to labor disputes which later became Dominion Bus Lines; and St. Joseph was sidelined by hard times. Partas Bus lines, as a company, was incorporated by Luis Chavit Singson and Rolito Go at Laoag (Ilocos Norte). Even as a new player in the industry back then, Partas has attracted the riding public with its state-of-the-art buses powered by Nissan Diesel and MAN engines; with the distinctive blue and white livery, and the Road Runner character from Looney Tunes, their standard emblem, adorning the front and sides of their buses. Partas is one of two bus companies in the Ilocos Region to have ever fielded a double-decker bus (the other being Farinas). The principal provincial terminals are at Laoag, Vigan, Candon, Bangued, Baguio, San Fernando, La Union, and, starting in 2014, a sub-station in Pagudpud, Ilocos Norte.

Trips to and from the majority of its provincial destinations, except for Baguio City, are available via their terminal in Pasay City. One of the latest routes added to Pasay terminal is Pasay to Pagudpud (v.v.) The latest terminal within Metro Manila was opened in Sampaloc district of Manila City. This terminal principally caters to goods traders in Binondo and Divisoria district of Manila, and students in Manila's University Belt who hail from Laoag City, Bangued, and Pagudpud.

History  The idiom can be traced back to the Upanishads, which were written between 800 BCE and 200 BCE. A similar metaphor exists in the Buddhist Pali Canon, composed in North India, and preserved orally until it was committed to writing during the Fourth Buddhist Council in Sri Lanka in 29 BCE. The expression appears in Horace: ' (\\"the blind leader of the blind\\"). Horace was the leading Roman lyric poet during the time of Augustus (27 BCE ‚Äì 14 CE) The saying appears several times in the Bible with similar stories appearing in the gospels of Matthew, Luke and Thomas, possibly via the Q source. Sextus Empiricus (160 ‚Äì 210CE) compares ignorant teachers and blind guides in Outlines of Scepticism: The phrase appears in Adagia, an annotated collection of Greek and Latin proverbs, compiled during the Renaissance by Dutch humanist Desiderius Erasmus Roterodamus. The first edition, titled Collectanea Adagiorum, was published in Paris in 1500 CE.Proverbs taken chiefly from the Adagia (1814)  Artistic depictions  The Blind Leading the Blind by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, 1568 Perhaps the most famous artistic depiction of the phrase is Pieter Bruegel's The Blind Leading the Blind. The distemper on canvas painting was completed in 1568, and is currently in the collection of the Museo di Capodimonte in Naples, Italy.

Life  Mariia Sergeyevna Surovshchikova was born in St. Petersburg, the illegitimate daughter of a milliner. She studied at the St. Petersburg Imperial Ballet School, graduating in 1854. After her graduation from the institute she entered into the corps de ballet of the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre, and in 1854 married Marius Petipa, who at that time served as premier danseur to the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres. Upon her marriage she took the name of Surovshchikova-Petipa. Her rise to the rank of Ballerina coincided with Petipa's own rise from fledgling choreographer to ballet Master of the Imperial Theatres. As Petipa was given more and more opportunities to stage his own early works, it was Surovshchikova-Petipa who danced the principal roles. Petipa also revived many already-existing ballets for her, including Joseph Mazilier's Le Corsaire in 1863. She had one daughter and one son--Marie Mariusovna Petipa (1857‚Äì1930), the noted ballerina and character dancer who danced in many of her father's works, and Jean Mariusovich Petipa (1859‚Äì1871).Garafola, Lynn.

She was used by the Union Navy as a gunboat assigned to patrol Confederate waterways.  Built in Pennsylvania in 1862  Silver Lake, a wooden stern-wheel steamer built in 1862 at California, Pennsylvania, was purchased by the Navy on 15 November 1862 at Cincinnati, Ohio, for service in the Mississippi Squadron and commissioned on 24 December 1862, Acting Volunteer Lieutenant Robert K. Riley in command.  Civil war operations  = Ordered to support Union troops at Fort Donelson = On 24 January 1863, Silver Lake and were ordered to join three other ships in the Cumberland River to stop Confederate forces from crossing. The expedition, under the command of Lt. Cpmdr. LeRoy Fitch and consisting of Silver Lake, Lexington, , , , and , proceeded up the Cumberland River to support Union forces surrounded by Confederate units at Fort Donelson. Arriving after dark on the evening of 3 February 1863, the Union ships caught the enemy by surprise. The Confederates besieging the fort had taken positions which exposed them to fire from the gunboats. Heavy casualties were inflicted. Fire was so well directed, that the Confederate force could not even carry off a captured caisson and retreated without firing a shot. The ships were then stationed in the area to prevent the return of the Southern forces. = Shelling the town of Florence, Alabama = Silver Lake, Lexington, and Robb shelled enemy forces from the town of Florence, Alabama, on 31 March 1863, destroying the cotton works. = Destroying the town of Palmyra, Tennessee = Still under the command of Lt.

On the two following days, the expedition silenced the batteries and recaptured three transports taken by the Confederates on the 2d. On 6 December, Silver Lake, , Fairplay, and the ironclad engaged enemy batteries near Bell's Mills. Seeing that the lighter armed vessels would be destroyed by enemy fire, Fitch ordered the gunboats to return to Nashville, Tennessee.

Ewango is a Congolese environmentalist, and was responsible for the Okapi Faunal Reserve's botany program in the Democratic Republic of Congo from 1996 to 2003. He was awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize in 2005Goldman Environmental Prize 2005: Corneille Ewango (Retrieved on November 5, 2007) for his efforts to protect the Okapi Wildlife Reserve in the Ituri Rainforest during the Congo Civil War. The reserve is home to the Mbuti people, and houses animals such as okapis (found nowhere else), elephants and 13 primate species. Ewango has uncovered 270 species of lianas and 600 tree species in the area. Early life and education Ewango grew up in a family of soldiers, poachers, and fisherman, and spent his early years helping to support his family by collecting elephant tusks and the meat of animals killed by his father and uncle. Corneille wanted to attend university, and began poaching elephants to pay his way through school. At first he wanted to become a medical doctor, so he could serve his village, where there was no modern health care. But after his application to study medicine was rejected three times, he began to study biology at the University of Kisangani, where he supplemented his studies with an internship with the Wildlife Conservation Society. At first his intention was just to mark time while waiting to study medicine. Within three years, however, he had become passionate about botany and conservation. He received a Bachelor of Science in 1995, and was employed as botanist and herbarium curator by the Centre de Formation et de Recherche en Conservation Foresti√®re (CEFRECOF), adjacent to the Ituri Forest Reserve. Ewango has recounted his growing interest in nature as follows: ‚ÄúCongo, my country, has the largest forest in Africa, maybe the second-largest in the world. I was born in a forest area, and when I was growing up I assisted my uncle, who was a poacher. That was good, because it grew my passion for protecting the forest and plants. When I went to university, I decided that I would like to do something related to plant ecology, because I felt that plants were so beautiful. When I am studying plants, I feel like I am talking with some kind of supernatural life, like I am talking with someone who does not speak.‚Äù Civil War During the civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 1996 to 2003, Ewango was responsible for the botany program at the Okapi Wildlife Reserve. Over the course of the war, more and more senior staff members fled the reserve, until Ewango was the only senior staff member remaining. He stayed there throughout the conflict, hiding the reserve's rare herbarium collection, its computers, books, records, and other items in trees and protecting the animals and plants from vandals, poachers, and illegal miners and loggers. ‚ÄúWhen the war blew up,‚Äù Ewango later explained, ‚Äúmy colleagues were leaving the area, but I said, my history is here. I felt like leaving would mean leaving everything, leaving my life and my work ‚Äì the work I was doing was related to my life. So I said, I think I will stay and take care of the field team, and see what is going to happen with the herbarium. If I had gone somewhere, I wouldn't have gone to my homeland -- my homeland is here. I prefer to die here, prefer that people know what I died for.‚Äù He risked his life by confronting military officials about the various illegal, anti-environmental activities in which soldiers were engaging. ‚ÄúI kindly explained that they were destroying everything, and told them that having a protected area was going to increase their reputation outside [the country],‚Äù he later explained. ‚ÄúSometimes we became friends, but sometimes they continued their activities. What I could not understand was that they killed an elephant in the village, very close to the zoo. I was very angry ‚Äì I said you are joking, what kind of liberation or democracy are you fighting for if you are without law, if you are destroying everything? I said, it's like you are killing your son and eating him, like you are not normal. They saw that I was strongly committed, and that I was serious.‚Äù At one point he was obliged to escape into the forest for three months to save his life. With the help of locals, he managed to keep the fourteen okapi at the Ipulu Zoo alive. Despite the wartime challenges, moreover, he kept making discoveries, identifying no fewer than 600 new tree species and 270 new species of lianas (tropical vine plants). Ewango later told the BBC that during the war ‚ÄúI was afraid but I didn't have a choice‚Äù other than to protect the reserve from ‚Äúsoldiers who knew nothing of conservation.‚Äù John Hart of the Wildlife Conservation Society affirmed that ‚ÄúIf no-one had taken care of the reserve nothing would have been left.‚Äù Further education When the Civil War ended in 2002, the reserve remained intact, to the astonishment of many. Partly as a result of Ewango's efforts, a number of poachers were arrested or exiled, and mining on the reserve was prohibited. In recognition of his service to the reserve, many of Ewango's international colleagues insisted that a way be found for him to continue his studies. Consequently, in August 2003 he was awarded a Christiansen Fund fellowship to study in the Department of Biology at the University of Missouri at St. Louis. He earned a master's degree in tropical botany there in 2006. Dr. Patrick Osborne of the University of Missouri said that his department was ‚Äúthrilled to have Corneille in our graduate program. He is an excellent scientist and dedicated conservationist‚Äîfew people can legitimately claim that they have put their lives on the line for conservation, but Corneille is one of these people.‚Äù Ewango later attended Wageningen University in the Netherlands, where he engaged in research about 300 different types of lianas and was awarded a doctoral degree in November 2010. Postwar career Ewango is the director of the Okapi Wildlife Reserve. He also belongs to a group that was designated by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature to develop an ecosystem management plan for the Congo. In addition, he has worked on a publication called Flore d‚ÄôAfrique Centrale (Plants (flora) of Central Africa). The herbarium he constructed at the Okapi Faunal Reserve has become a setting for training and research in tropical botany and conservation. Other professional activities Ewango delivered a TED lecture in 2007 Honors and awards Ewango received the 2005 Goldman Environmental Prize at a ceremony held at the War Memorial Opera House in San Francisco on April 18, 2005. This prize, the world‚Äôs largest for grassroots environmentalists, was founded by Richard N. Goldman and Rhoda H. Goldman in 1989 and is presented annually to environmental heroes from each of six regions: Africa, Asia, Europe, Island Nations, North America and South/Central America. On winning the Goldman Prize, Ewango told the BBC, apropos of his efforts to save the reserve: ‚ÄúIt's my contribution to advance science. Even if I die, I would be happy.‚Äù After receiving the prize, Ewango was asked what he would do with the money. He said: ‚ÄúThough my country has the largest forest in Africa, it is one of the least known ‚Äì we don't have so much research in botany in the Congo, except what we are doing. I hope to build a new herbarium for protected-area flora ‚Äì I'm thinking that this prize is an opportunity to finish that herbarium. For a long time, we have been working in the shadows, but now we see it coming into the light.‚Äù In 2011 Ewango won the Future for Nature Award, which recognizes outstanding international species protection efforts and includes a prize of ‚Ç¨50,000 (about $73,000). The award was presented at the Future for Nature Foundation Conference at Burgers‚Äô Zoo in Arnhem, The Netherlands, on April 5, 2011. Professor Frans Bongers of Wageningen University accepted the prize on behalf of Ewango, who for ‚Äúadministrative reasons‚Äù was unable to secure a visa to the Netherlands.

His controversial tenure on the Milwaukee Common Council culminated in his arrest on Memorial Day weekend, 2007. He subsequently won the primary election from jail and lost the general election for re-election. Early life McGee is the eldest of nine children of former Milwaukee alderman and community activist Michael Imanu McGee Sr.Kurt Chandler, \\"The Prodigal Son\\", Milwaukee Magazine, October 2007, pp. 75-78, 86-91 McGee attended West Division High School but transferred to Bay View High School when West Division became the Milwaukee High School of the Arts and dropped its sports programs. At Bay View, McGee was a standout wrestler, taking third in the state in the 126-pound weight class in his senior year. McGee was popular and well-liked at Bay View, where he was elected Prom King. Upon graduating from Bay View, McGee attended the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìLa Crosse where he joined the Army and served in the National Guard. In mid-1991, McGee left UW‚ÄìLa Crosse and moved back to Milwaukee. On December 31, 1991, at barely 22 years old, McGee declared his candidacy for mayor of Milwaukee, challenging incumbent mayor John Norquist. McGee finished a distant third in a primary field of six candidates. In September 1992, McGee enrolled at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee (\\"UWM\\"). He graduated from UWM in August 1999 at the age of 29 with a degree in political science and began working as an academic advisor for UWM in a program assisting middle school students. Early run-ins with the law Before being elected to office, McGee had numerous run-ins with the law. * In 1992, McGee was ticketed for disorderly conduct. * In 1993, McGee was convicted of providing false information to a law enforcement officer. McGee left the scene of a property damage accident, traveling at high speed even after officers began to pursue him. Once stopped, he provided a false date of birth and possessed an identification card with the false birth date. Court records said that he was driving with a suspended license. * In 1995, McGee was convicted of misdemeanor criminal damage to property for breaking a man's car windshield with a baseball bat.Borowski, Greg J. and Jessica McBride. \\"Aldermanic candidates dogged by trouble with the law, records show; Cases include drugs, drunken driving, damage to property, police obstruction\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, March 28, 2000, pp. 1-B He was sentenced to four months in the House of Correction and 18 months of probation and ordered to perform community service and undergo an alcohol and drug assessment. His probation was later extended because he failed to make enough payments on restitution. Aldermanic elections McGee's earliest aldermanic elections efforts were met with controversy. Following McGee's unsuccessful bid for mayor, in McGee's next electoral effort in 2000, Alderman Don Richards challenged the signatures on McGee's first election petition in 2000. Alderman Richards alleged that numerous of McGee's signatures were forged, used nonexistent addresses, or obtained by McGee when he did not live in the district.Borowski, Greg J. \\"Richards' bid to keep opponent off ballot rejected; McGee collected enough valid signatures to run for alderman, commission rules,\\" Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, January 13, 2000, pg. 3B The election commission eventually determined that he had collected two more than the minimum number of signatures. Alderman Don Richards eventually easily defeated McGee to retain his seat as the Ninth District's alderman.Election Results, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, April 5, 2000, pg. 12-B In a more hotly contested race in April 2003, McGee lost to Willie Wade for the Tenth District aldermanic seat vacated by Rosa Cameron following her conviction on federal charges of misappropriating federal funds.Pabst, Georgia. \\"Wade defeats McGee in race to replace Cameron\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, April 2, 2003, p. 9-B On primary election day, February 18, McGee ran into problems when the principal of North Division High School complained to UWM officials that McGee tried to get students at the school where he worked to help him campaign instead of attending school. UWM officials said McGee has admitted to using \\"poor judgment\\" in getting students involved in \\"inappropriate\\" campaign activity. In 2004, McGee defeated Alderman Marlene Johnson-Odom, who had served 24 years as an alderman, to become the Sixth District's alderman.Jones, Meg. \\"New Common Council smaller, younger, all male; Longtime aldermen Johnson-Odom, Gordon defeated\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, April 7, 2004, pg. 1B Once in office, his first high-profile action was the creation of what he called a Rapid Response Team, which included neighborhood and community leaders mobilized in an effort to combat increasing community violence.Borowski, Greg J. \\"Alderman forms Rapid Response Team; McGee says group will combat 'domestic terrorism'\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, September 1, 2004, p. 1-B In a press release issued at the time, McGee said: \\"The Rapid Response Team would be dispatched immediately when serious disputes between neighbors are reported, when there are complaints about police brutality and when residents and business owners have serious concerns about police response to burglar alarms. The team will respond to community concerns and will be on the scene to collect and exchange information and to document what's going on.\\" The group, which stated its intention to make citizen's arrests, was variously described as an initiative to address black-on-black crime, a monitoring program to deal with police brutality and an information source for north side residents.Borowski, Greg J. \\"Group to make citizen's arrests; Alderman says Rapid Response Team will monitor police, too\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, September 3, 2004, pg. 1-B Following an investigation of the Opportunities Industrialization Center of Greater Milwaukee which resulted in charges against two of the agency's subsidiaries, the conviction of its former head, Carl Gee, and a guilty plea from former state Senator Gary George, McGee filed a complaint against United States Attorney Steven M. Biskupic with the United States Justice Department claiming racial bias and overzealous prosecution.Borowski, Greg J. and Gina Barton, \\"Alderman accuses U.S. attorney of biased inquest; Biskupic says facts determine targets\\" Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, December 30, 2004, p. 3-B In his letter, McGee claimed that the black community sees Biskupic, who is white, as \\"a plantation overseer ... whose sole purpose is to lynch black leadership and the institutions that support us.\\" The beating of Frank Jude Jr. Following the beating of Frank Jude Jr. by off-duty Milwaukee police officers, McGee led a demonstration of about 100 people about the slow pace of the investigation. McGee called District Attorney E. Michael McCann a \\"dumb ass\\", called Jude's attackers \\"hate mongers and KKK killers\\". He said, \\"Any man that would pull another man's pants down is a straight-up sick faggot\\", while adding that he did not mean to offend all homosexuals.\\"McGee owes an apology\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, February 15, 2005, p. 10-A Numerous public officials called upon McGee to apologize for his use of the homosexual epithet, particularly State Senator Tim Carpenter, who is openly gay. When confronted by Carpenter, McGee refused to apologize and told Carpenter \\"move out the way\\" instead walked into his office and causing Carpenter to shout after him, \\"Why are you hiding?\\"Pabst, Georgia, and Greg J. Borowski. \\"More want McGee apology; He says mayor is insensitive to African-Americans\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, February 24, 2005, p. 1-B Six of McGee's fellow aldermen signed a letter asking McGee to apologize. The letter, an unusual public rebuke of a colleague, called the beating of Jude \\"heinous and despicable\\", but denounced McGee's use of \\"hateful and inflammatory speech\\" and went on to note McGee's comments \\"dipped well below the common threshold of statesmanship and civil decorum that we hold dear.\\" Milwaukee mayor Tom Barrett in reference to McGee's comments said, \\"he owes an apology to the gay community; he owes an apology to African-Americans in my office and African-American women in general\\", adding that McGee's remarks \\"go beyond what is acceptable for any mature adult or elected official.\\" McGee called for blacks to boycott downtown and central city shopping centers as a means of protesting the beating of Jude.\\"McGee's bogus boycott\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, February 24, 2005, pg. 16-A These boycotts were widely criticized on the basis that they would disproportionately affect black workers and black business owners and thus be counterproductive, and that the targeted businesses were completely unrelated to any complained-of actions in the Jude case. As the verdicts were read acquitting the three officers who were charged with beating Jude, McGee repeatedly said \\"bullshit\\" in court.Diedrich, John and Georgia Pabst. \\"'Not guilty' U.S. attorney to immediately consider federal charges; All-white jury clears officers in 4 of 5 charges\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, April 15, 2006, p. 1-A Subsequently, McGee led demonstrations calling for United States Attorney Steven M. Biskupic to bring federal charges. Biskupic eventually did bring federal civil rights charges that resulted in the convictions of seven Milwaukee police officers. Wauwatosa arrest In November 2005, McGee was arrested and was cited for disorderly conduct and resisting arrest in Wauwatosa following an incident in a Blockbuster parking lot.Johnson, Annysa and Greg J. Borowski. \\"Milwaukee Ald. McGee arrested in Tosa; he alleges racism\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, November 10, 2005, p. 1A The incident began when the Blockbuster store manager called the police concerned about a suspicious car in the store's parking lot after the store closed. Police officers responded and made contact with McGee. The officers explained why they were called and McGee responded that he understood the employees' concerns. The officers told McGee he was free to go, but as he left, McGee shouted an obscenity at the employees in the store. The police officers who were still on scene, then pulled McGee over. McGee then became combative with the officers, asking \\"What are you going to do about it, arrest me?\\" McGee's statement says he was then pulled from the car, handcuffed, struck with a closed fist on the side of his head and then had his head slammed against the hood of the squad car. The Police report, jsonline.com, November 2005; accessed November 6, 2014. police report says McGee was pushed to the hood of the car because he was struggling against the handcuffs. It said McGee claimed that he was punched in the head and was bleeding. But the police report said that there were no visible wounds and the dampness on his head was from water on the hood of the car. Following the incident, McGee issued a statement indicating he had been meeting a friend to whom he'd planned to give a DVD on non-violence, and that he'd been in the parking lot just a minute when police arrived. A rally at the Wauwatosa police department following McGee's arrest resulted in an altercation after a white male said McGee was \\"out of line\\" and a \\"racist\\", and allegedly shoved a McGee supporter as the crowd converged upon him.Johnson, Annysa and Felicia Thomas-Lynn. \\"'I made a dumb mistake'; Tosa man gets an earful from his wife, decides to apologize for his role in fight at McGee rally\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, November 12, 2005, pg. 1AJohnson, Annysa and Felicia Thomas-Lynn. \\"More protests promised after brawl; Five arrested in fight at Wauwatosa demonstration over McGee case\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, November 11, 2005, pg. 1A A McGee supporter struck the white male on the head with a bullhorn and eventually five people, the white male and four of McGee's supporters, were all arrested for disorderly conduct. McGee filed a complaint against the officers involved in the incident and following an investigation, Wauwatosa's police chief cleared the officers stating in a letter to McGee, \\"Clearly, your behavior throughout this situation caused your arrest.\\"\\"Tosa police chief blames McGee\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, January 14, 2006, pg. 3-B The police chief used McGee's own admission that he engaged in a brief \\"struggle\\" during the arrest in vindicating the officers. \\"Any type of physical resistance to a lawful arrest will result in officers utilizing tactics to gain control of the situation and to minimize force used against them\\", he said. McGee eventually agreed to plead no contest to the municipal charge of resisting or obstructing an officer and the city agreed to drop the disorderly conduct charge.Johnson, Annysa. \\"Tosa, McGee strike deal; Milwaukee alderman will plead no contest to obstructing officer\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, June 7, 2006, pg. 1B Name change In May 2006, it came to light that McGee's true surname was Jackson.Nunnally, Derrick. \\"McGee asks court for name change; Alderman's petition says his real name is Michael Jackson\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, May 25, 2006, pg. 1-A McGee filed a petition seeking to legally change his name from Michael Imanu Jackson to Michael Imanu McGee, the name he alleged he had used all his life. It was subsequently revealed the McGee had, in fact, frequently used the last name Jackson.Borowski, Greg J. \\"McGee admits affair, explains name change; Documents suggest his legal name is Jackson\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, May 26, 2006, pg. 1A For example, McGee had obtained a driver's license in the name of Jackson, which was subsequently suspended. Further, McGee was sued under the name of Jackson as a result of a traffic accident that occurred in 1996 when McGee was responsible for a three vehicle crash. McGee was subsequently investigated by agents from the Social Security Administration regarding his use of two Social Security numbers.Diedrich, John. \\"McGee admitted to falsifying Social Security number, records show\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, October 17, 2008, http://www2.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=807439 McGee later admitted that when his driver's license under the name McGee was suspended, he made up a Social Security number and got a license under the surname Jackson. Extramarital affair/restraining orders On April 4, 2006, 23-year-old Kimley Rucker filed for a Domestic Abuse Restraining Order against McGee.\\"McGee in dispute with woman\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, April 6, 2006, pg. 3B The following day, McGee filed for a harassment restraining order against Rucker. At a hearing regarding the restraining order requests, McGee testified that he never had a \\"romantic\\" relationship with Rucker.Nunnally, Derrick. \\"Alderman wins restraining order; McGee, woman trade accusations\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, April 13, 2006, pg. 1A However, Rucker claimed that she was pregnant by McGee for the second time (the first pregnancy resulted in a miscarriage). Rucker testified that she received emails from McGee from a certain email account. Although McGee testified that he never had the email account, his wife contradicted this and stated that he had the specific email account for as long as she knew him. McGee described Rucker as \\"a lying type of chick\\" and dismissed her allegations that he had impregnated her and, months later, grabbed and twisted her arm as \\"slanderous character assassination.\\" At a subsequent hearing, McGee admitted he had had a sexual relationship with Rucker but defended his earlier sworn statements against perjury accusations on the basis that although he had a sexual relationship with Rucker, the relationship was not \\"romantic.\\"\\"McGee admits to sexual contact, but denies romance\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, May 13, 2006, pg. 1-B McGee also admitted using the specific email account but claimed numerous others also had access to the account. The district attorney's office investigated McGee's contradictory statements for possible perjury but declined to prosecute on the basis that McGee's statement about the email account was not material to the proceeding and the ambiguity with respect to McGee's euphemistic explanation of his relationship as not \\"romantic\\" precluded the ability to prove falsity beyond a reasonable doubt.Nunnally, Derrick. \\"McGee won't face charges; Alderman will not be prosecuted for actions during court hearings\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, July 29, 2006, pg. 1-B DNA tests later proved that McGee was the father of Rucker's child.Garza, Jesse. \\"DNA points to McGee; Attorneys say paternity test proves north side alderman fathered child\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, September 1, 2006, pg. 3B During a hearing in which a judge dismissed the restraining order that McGee had obtained against Rucker, McGee turned around and spoke to Rucker.Nunnally, Derrick. \\"McGee arrested in courtroom dispute; Alderman accused of threatening woman after judge's ruling\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, May 18, 2006, pg. 1A Rucker reported that McGee said, \\"If you drive by my house, I'm going to kill your ass.\\" For this statement, McGee was immediately arrested by the court's bailiffs. The incident did not result in criminal charges.Nunnally, Derrick. \\"No charge in McGee remark; Threat in court against former girlfriend was not serious, prosecutor says\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, July 26, 2006, pg. 1B Recall election In October 2006, ViAnna Jordan began an effort to recall McGee.Sandler, Larry. \\"McGee recall drive gets under way; Candidate must gather 1,620 signatures on petitions\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, October 18, 2006, pg. 6-B Among the reasons Jordan listed for the recall were \\"fraudulent use of alias names to avoid responsibility for accident damages\\", referring to the discovery that McGee held driver's licenses under both names, and to other incidents, such as arrests for disorderly conduct and perjury allegations, both from a series of restraining-order hearings involving the mother of his child, as well as calling a suspect in the beating of Frank Jude Jr. a \\"straight-up sick faggot\\" at a rally. Other reasons were more general, such as \\"has become an embarrassment to our community.\\" During the recall effort, Jordan and her supporters frequently reported that they were harassed by McGee's supporters. For example, a former Milwaukee School Board member, Leon Todd, received a restraining order against McGee for what Todd called continued harassment for his support of the recall effort against McGee.Borowski, Greg J. \\"McGee told to steer clear of Todd; Ex-MPS official wins temporary restraining order\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, February 28, 2007, pg. 1B Todd was the campaign manager for recall organizer Jordan. During a radio show, McGee said that Todd should be \\"hung\\" for his \\"betrayal of the community.\\"Borowski, Greg J. \\"McGee under fire for criticism; Alderman said recall supporter should be 'hung'\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, December 13, 2006, pg. 1B He then gave out Todd's phone number over the air, leading to Todd receiving numerous harassing phone calls. Todd had long been a target of McGee and his father.Kissinger, Meg and Jessica McBride. \\"McGee applauds firebombing; He claims knowledge of attack on Todd's home\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, December 21, 1996, pg. 3B For example, in 1996, McGee's father, also named Michael McGee, congratulated the person who fire bombed Todd's home, stating, \\"They are the kind of people I would like to pin a medal of honor on\\", and \\"My whole-hearted congratulations to the guerrilla who issued a little warning shot to Todd. I know where it came from.\\" McGee made numerous attempts to block the recall effort.Borowski, Greg J. \\"McGee challenges recall bid; Alderman says 1,200 signatures on the petition are faulty\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, December 12, 2006, pg. 1-B In response to a Jordan supporter admitting in an affidavit that she misled people into signing the recall petitions, the Election Commission asked the District Attorney's office to investigate. This led to a secret John Doe hearing. Although the Election Commission found evidence of \\"widespread fraud\\" in ViAnna Jordan's recall petition, the Commission nonetheless permitted the recall to proceed.Borowski, Greg J. \\"Forecast uncertain on McGee; City election officials prove tough to read\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, February 12, 2007, pg. 3-B In the eight-person primary election, McGee earned 64% of the vote, permitting him to remain in office without a run-off election.\\"Michael McGee; Time to resign\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, May 30, 2007, pg. 14A However, the John Doe investigation continued, and, rather than uncovering evidence of fraud on the part of Jordan and the recall supporters, the investigation uncovered evidence of widespread election-related crimes on the part of McGee and his supporters. On June 4, 2007, McGee was charged with five misdemeanors and five felonies for his alleged conduct during the recall election and the subsequent investigation. According to the criminal complaint, McGee falsely reported to the Election Commission that he was approached within 100 feet of an open polling place and asked to sign a petition to keep the Malcolm X Academy open. However, two other witnesses, the person who was allegedly circulating the petition and a police sergeant who McGee contacted soon after the incident, both reported that McGee was fully aware that he was signing a petition seeking his recall when he signed the petition. McGee was charged with theft of two checks that were intended as campaign donations but instead McGee deposited the checks into an account of a local grocery store. McGee was also charged with four counts of election bribery relating to an alleged plan to pay voters or persons who recruited others to vote, including two undercover police officers, $5 for each vote. McGee was also charged with filing false campaign finance reports and electioneering for allegedly distributing campaign literature at a polling place. He was also charged with two counts of criminal contempt for allegedly violating the secrecy order related to the John Doe proceedings. These alleged breaches of the secrecy order were recorded as a result of the court authorized wiretap. Federal investigation Following complaints from various business owners in McGee's aldermanic district, the FBI launched an investigation into allegations that McGee was demanding bribes from business owners in exchange for McGee's support on various issues such as liquor licenses. As part of this investigation, business owners cooperated with the FBI in recording McGee allegedly demanding bribes. McGee allegedly demanded a bribe from an undercover FBI agent. Finally, after receiving approval from a federal judge, the FBI tapped McGee's phone. The wiretap uncovered evidence of far more criminal activities. This secret year-long federal investigation came to light over Memorial Day weekend in 2007 when agents monitoring the wiretap overheard McGee discussing a plan to harm a person suspected of burglarizing the home of a McGee friend. Concerned that McGee was plotting to murder this individual, the agents decided to arrest McGee and end their investigation. McGee and two others were eventually charged with conspiracy to commit a felony and conspiracy to commit substantial battery, both felonies. On October 30, 2007, one of McGee's co-defendants pleaded guilty and agreed to testify against McGee.Nunnally, Derrick. \\"McGee case defendant guilty, will testify\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, October 31, 2007, pg. 1-B According to the federal criminal complaint filed in the case, FBI agents using wiretaps and undercover surveillance, watched as McGee shook down a business owner who wanted to obtain or keep a liquor license and a gas station owner who sought to operate 24 hours a day. In February, an undercover agent approached McGee about putting a business with a liquor license in his district and paid a bribe, the complaint says. \\"McGee told the UCE (undercover agent) that he (McGee) is the gatekeeper for all new businesses in his area\\", the complaint says. At a fund- raiser, the agent gave McGee $1,000, most of it cash bundled in a rubber band, the complaint says. McGee told the agent, \\"I got you\\", the complaint says. At least two bribes were paid with money orders, one of which went to an attorney representing McGee in a paternity suit and another for \\"recall petition work\\", the complaint says. An affidavit in support of a search warrant alleged that McGee used his Rapid Response Team to demand bribes from business owners in McGee's district. Rather than using the money for to improve the community, the affidavit alleged that McGee used the money to pay his personal expenses.Diedrich, John. \\"McGee anti-crime group implicated in bribery; Federal investigation links organization to extortion\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, June 15, 2007, pg. 1-A After $50,000 bail was posted in the state case, McGee was promptly taken into federal custody. A United States Magistrate Judge initially granted McGee bail but imposed numerous restrictions.Borowski, Greg J. \\"Prosecutors block McGee's release; They say jailed alderman tried to intimidate witnesses\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, July 10, 2007, pg. 1-A The government appealed the grant of bail and Chief Judge Rudolph T. Randa ordered McGee detained pending trial.Diedrich, John. \\"McGee loses appeal for release; judges offer little insight on decision to keep him jailed\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, September 7, 2007, pg. 1B Randa cited concerns that if allowed home, even under severe restrictions, McGee would attempt to intimidate witnesses and sway their testimony on both state and federal charges. While in custody, McGee made recorded telephone calls in which he allegedly discussed influencing witnesses. McGee appealed the denial of bail to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which denied the appeal without comment. In his federal court case, McGee received a court-appointed attorney at government expense, despite the fact that McGee continued to receive his more-than $70,000 per year salary and a $337 per month vehicle allowanceSandler, Larry. \\"Car allowance scrutinized\\" , Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, May 12, 2007. from the City of Milwaukee until he was eventually voted out of office. McGee was subsequently indicted on nine felony counts. The indictment included five counts of bribery, three counts of extortion, and one financial-related violation, which relates to $15,000 in cash allegedly being wired out of state without the proper paperwork being done. A jury trial commenced on June 16, 2008.Diedrich, John. \\"Witness says he paid McGee\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, June 16, 2008, pg. 1A. The government presented the testimony of a McGee friend - turned informant - Jack Adel and numerous business owners in McGee's district who testified that they gave money to McGee associate - Dennis Walton - in exchange for his support in licensing matters that came before the Common Council. This testimony was corroborated by numerous recorded and videotaped conversations as well as numerous recorded telephone calls.Borowski, Greg J. \\"McGee exchange seen on video\\" , Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, June 18, 2008, pg. 1A. When asked Judge Clevert about the where abouts of Walton-the U.S. Attorney Joseph Wahl stated that the F.B.I. Could not find Walton. McGee's attorney argued that McGee was set up by a politically motivated business owner.Borowski, Greg J. \\"Defense chips away at McGee witness\\" , Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, June 20, 2008, pg. 1A, On June 24, 2008, after roughly six hours of deliberation, the jury returned its verdict finding McGee guilty of all nine counts.Diedrich, John. \\"McGee guilty\\" , Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, June 24, 2008, pg. 1-A, On October 28, 2008, McGee was sentenced to 6 ¬Ω years in federal prison.Diedrich, John. \\"McGee sentenced to 6¬Ω years in prison\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, October 28, 2008. The federal sentencing guidelines called for McGee to receive between 12 ¬Ω to 15 ¬Ω years in prison and the government called for a sentence within this range. The prosecutor called McGee's actions \\"flat-out racism\\", noting the evidence showed McGee targeted victims who were Middle Eastern or Indian. As the basis for his substantial departure from the guidelines, Judge Clevert stated that he had seen McGee become less defiant and more respectful of the law since he first appeared in court, cited the numerous good things McGee did in his one term in office, such as his gun buyback program, and noted that McGee extorted business owners to pay for rewards for information relating to crimes. Judge Clevert did not mention numerous aggravating factors such as the fact that the evidence demonstrated that McGee had also taken bribes and extorted money for his personal benefit, including for moving costs or attorneys' fees.Diedrich, John. \\"McGee's defense does a job\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, October 29, 2008. At his sentencing, McGee wept, apologized to his family, the community, victimized business owners, the Milwaukee Common Council, and black pioneers who laid the groundwork for his accomplishments, and called himself, \\"immature\\", \\"selfish\\", \\"narcissistic\\", \\"spiritually flawed\\", and \\"a very poor, broken man\\". He was also ordered to pay $107,433 in restitution. The criminal charges against McGee remain pending in state court. The state court trial began in May 2008 but was suspended when it was discovered that certain recorded conversations had not been translated.Diedrich, John. \\"McGee's state trial grinds to halt\\" , Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, May 20, 2008, pg. 1-A On the day following his sentencing in federal court, it was reported that McGee will plead guilty to one felony and one misdemeanor in state court as part of a plea deal.Diedrich, John.\\"McGee to plead guilty to some state charges, attorney says\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel; accessed November 6, 2014.

The worms are highly adapted to the hard tube they secrete. Inside the tube the animal is segmented and regionally specialized, with highly modified appendages on different segments for cutting the tunnel, feeding, or creating suction for the flow of water through the tube home. The modified segments for feeding are on the 12th segment from the head for members of this family.Ruppert, E., Fox, R., & Barnes, R. (2007). Invertebrate Zoology: A functional Evolutionary Approach. 7th Edition. Belmont:Thomson Learning. Larvae Chaetopteridae larvae are the largest among the polychaete worms. The larvae will range in size from 0.4 mm to 2.5 mm (largest polychaete larvae reported having a maximum length of 12 mm; the late stage of an unknown phyllodicid species). Chaetopteridae larvae are barrel-like in form with one to two ciliated bands at the midsection. They also have a large buccal funnel. These larvae are often long lived and effectively disseminate, although are constrained geographically to their appropriate ranges for successful adult growth. The most common form of larval developmental plan for polychaetes is the trochophore larvae. The trochophore will add segments sequentially from a posterior growth zone to produce a nectochaete larva. Chaetopterus represents a distinct deviation from this general design. At no point in larval growth stages does the metatrochophore take on the clearly segmented form of the typical nectochaete larva. The 15 segments of Chaetopterus are formed by subdivision of existing anlage. Some relevant images of adult Chaetopteridae Feeding The Chaetopteridae have several genera with peculiar and well-studied filter-feeding mechanisms. The genera Chaetopterus, Mesochaetopterus, and Spiochaetopterus feed using a thin mucus net suspended across the upper portion of their tube. The mucus net is secreted by a hooplike structure called the aliform notopodia arch. The net can grow at a rate as great as one millimeter per second as water currents generated by the notopodial fans pass plankton through the net. When the net grows large enough it contacts the ciliated cup, which rolls up the net. When the roll becomes large the net is disconnected from the aliform notopodia and is rolled into a ball before the ciliated mid-dorsal groove transports it to the mouth.  Affinity  Molecular analysis suggests that this group is basal within the annelids, below the sipunculid worms.

While Union home guards pursued him, the Union gunboats moved up the river and prevented him from recrossing to safety in the South. Finally, after a 10-day chase over some 500 miles, the pursuers caught up with the raiders and forced them to attempt to cross at Buffington Island. Federal steamers Moose and Alleghany Belle repeatedly frustrated Morgan's efforts to move his troops south of the river. Pressed from both directions, most of the raiders surrendered. Morgan and a few followers managed to retreat into the hills and rode on for another week through the North before they were surrounded and captured near New Lisbon, Ohio.  Chasing Confederates attempting to cross the Cumberland  Almost a year of routine convoy and patrol service went by before Springfield could report any more excitement. On 3 June 1864, as the tinclad was descending the Cumberland, she came upon a band of guerrillas attempting to ford the river at Shelly Island. The gunboat opened fire on the Confederates who fled on foot leaving behind four horses, a few pounds of horseshoe nails, and a \\"contraband\\" blacksmith whom they had impressed \\"to shoe rebel horses.\\" Springfield served on upper rivers through the end of the Civil War.  Post-war decommissioning, sale, and civilian career  On 29 April 1865, she was ordered down to Mound City, Illinois, where she was decommissioned on 30 June. The steamer was sold at public auction there on 17 August 1865 to R. G. Jameson. Re-documented as Jennie D. on 1 April 1866, the stern wheeler served on the Mississippi River system until 1875.

All three founding members were at the time living in Banff, Alberta, Canada and formed the band as a way to get free beer at the local establishments around the small resort town. In 1999 the band relocated to Calgary, Alberta and in early 2000 added a second guitar player, Patrick May, formerly of the band Nine Miles to Morgan, and top guitarist of all time. This lineup recorded the 4 song ep \\"A Timpani of Failure of Defeat\\", a self-released CD which is now long out of print. In the summer of 2000 Fleischhaker left the band temporarily and was replaced by Todd Harkness (formerly of Porter Hall and The Browns) on drums. This version of the band spent the better part of the year touring Western Canada. Fleischhaker returned to the band in March 2001 and Harkness moved over to third guitar and keyboard duties. This version of the band recorded and released the album Standing Inside a Shadow in the summer of 2001, which was released by Does Everyone Stare Records in North America and Boss Tuneage Records in the UK and Japan. Outtakes from this record made their way onto a split 8.5\\" vinyl record with fellow Calgary band First In Last Out. Only 300 copies were released and are hard to find as distribution was nonexistent on this release. In 2002 the band toured behind Standing Inside a Shadow and also released a split 7\\" with The Milwaukees. This 7\\" was released on Does Everyone Stare, and features two previously unreleased songs, including a cover of \\"There Is a Light That Never Goes Out\\" by The Smiths. During these sessions the band also record a cover of Shudder to Think's \\"White Page\\" for a Shudder to Think tribute album released by Engineer Records. In 2003 Lapp left the band and was replaced by Cameron Brass, also of the band Nine Miles to Morgan. The band signed to G7 Welcoming Committee and the album Outside the Unbearable Grows was released in the summer of 2003. A limited edition picture disc LP version was released in the fall of 2003 by Does Everyone Stare & Boss Tuneage. 2004 saw the band experience a period of inactivity as various members moved away or left the band. Stewart started working on the band's third full length Our Living Language, playing the majority of the instruments himself, while most of the drums were handled by Troy's brother Mark Fleischhaker. Harkness and May played guitar on three songs each, and Troy Fleischhaker played drums on one track. The album was released digitally by G7 Welcoming Committee in 2006 and a short run of CDs was made for the band's tour in support of the album. The band has since played a handful of show around their former home base of Calgary. In January 2010 the band reformed with almost all original members (Stewart, Fleishhaker, May and Harkness along with bassist Jahmeel Russel) as part of the 25th anniversary celebration of University of Calgary radio station CJSW. The same lineup also performed at the 2010 edition of Sled Island, playing a show with Ted Leo and Why? There are plans for more shows but no word on any new recordings.

In Maryland, the federal highway runs from the West Virginia state line at the North Branch Potomac River in McCoole north to the Pennsylvania state line in Dickens. Known as McMullen Highway for much of its length in Maryland, US 220 is the primary north‚Äìsouth route in central Allegany County, connecting Cumberland with its southern suburbs and Keyser, West Virginia to the south and Bedford, Pennsylvania to the north. The federal highway is part of the National Highway System between the West Virginia state line and Maryland Route 53 (MD 53) in Cresaptown and between Interstate 68 (I-68), with which it is concurrent through Cumberland, and the Pennsylvania state line. The road to Bedford was paved within the city of Cumberland by 1910 and constructed north to Pennsylvania in the 1910s. This highway comprised the southernmost portion of US 220 when the U.S. Highway System was established in 1927. McMullen Highway was constructed starting from Cumberland and finishing in McCoole in the 1920s. When that highway was completed around 1930, US 220 was extended south into West Virginia. Both the northern and southern portions of the federal highway were reconstructed in the 1940s and 1950s, including a new bridge over the North Branch Potomac River. US 220 was rerouted within Cumberland multiple times before being placed on I-68 in the early 1980s to bypass downtown Cumberland. The bypass of Bedford Road between I-68 and the Pennsylvania state line opened in 2000. A new bridge over the North Branch Potomac River was completed in 2013. In addition, relocation of the highway from I-68 south into West Virginia is under consideration. Route description US 220 northbound entering Potomac Park US 220 enters Maryland in southwestern Allegany County, crossing the North Branch Potomac River and its own old alignment on a bridge from Keyser to McCoole. The highway meets the eastern terminus of MD 135 (Paxton Street) before gaining a climbing lane and ascending a hill. US 220 crosses over its old alignment again, then meets the old alignment, unsigned MD 135A, at the top of the hill. The federal highway turns northeast as McMullen Highway, a two-lane undivided road paralleling the North Branch Potomac River north to Cumberland. The highway passes through the hamlet of Dawson, where it passes a curve of its old alignment designated MD 830A and closely parallels CSX's Mountain Subdivision. US 220 splits away from the railroad tracks to follow the valley of Deep Hollow Creek between Fort Hill immediately to the east and Dans Mountain further to the west. After passing through the hamlet of Danville, the federal highway passes into the valley of Mill Run. After passing another curve of old alignment designated MD 830B, US 220 leaves Fort Hill and Mill Run behind. View south along US 220 in Bel Air US 220 passes through the villages of Rawlings and Bier before intersecting the western end of MD 956 (Patriot Parkway) near Pinto. Beyond MD 956, US 220 enters a more densely populated area, passing through the community of Bel Air. The federal highway enters Cresaptown, where US 220 intersects MD 53 (Winchester Road), which is also the southern terminus of US 220 Truck. Access to northbound MD 53 is provided by unsigned MD 636 (Warrior Drive) shortly after. After crossing Warrior Run, Haystack Mountain flanks US 220 to the west as the federal highway passes through Amcelle, the former site of the Celanese chemical plant that is now the location of the North Branch Correctional Institution. The federal highway curves through Potomac Park, home of the Allegany County Fairgrounds. After passing the Upper Potomac Industrial Park, US 220 parallels CSX's Mountain Subdivision again before entering the city of Cumberland, where the highway is municipally-maintained. Shortly after, US 220 passes east of a park and ride lot before it meets I-68 and US 40 (National Freeway) at Exit 42. Trucks and buses are prohibited from using the ramp in the diamond interchange from eastbound I-68 to southbound US 220; those vehicles must follow US 220 Truck instead. Greene Street, the old alignment of US 220, continues north from the interchange as a municipal street toward downtown Cumberland. I-68/US 40/US 220 concurrency in Cumberland US 220 becomes concurrent with eastbound I-68 and US 40 on a four-lane freeway, passing through downtown Cumberland on a narrow, curvaceous viaduct where the highway meets the northern end of MD 51 and the east end of US 40 ALT. After passing through the eastern part of the city, US 220 exits the freeway at Exit 46 onto MD 144 (Ali Ghan Road), which it follows east a short distance before turning north over I-68 onto a two-lane limited access highway with a speed limit of . MD 144, the old alignment of US 40, continues east toward Rocky Gap State Park. The southbound direction of US 220 joins westbound I-68 via a long ramp on a sweeping curve. After crossing Evitts Creek, Mason Road, and Bealls Mill Road, the federal highway reaches the intersection with MD 807 (Bedford Road) and MD 807E (Smouses Mill Road) in Dickens, the former being the old alignment of US 220. US 220 turns northeast, passing MD 807D (Pine Ridge Road) and MD 807C before crossing the Pennsylvania state line, where the route continues north as Bedford Valley Road toward Bedford. History US 220 northbound past the split from I-68/US 40 in Cumberland Bedford Street was paved in the city of Cumberland from downtown to Naves Cross Road by 1910. Bedford Road was paved between Naves Cross Road and roughly the present intersection of US 220 and Bedford Road by 1915, with the final segment to the Pennsylvania state line completed shortly thereafter. When the U.S. Highway System was organized in 1926, Bedford Road and Bedford Street were designated the southernmost portion of US 220. The first section of McMullen Highway‚Äînamed for Hugh A. McMullen, an Allegany County miner, merchant, and banker who was Comptroller of Maryland from 1916 to 1920‚Äîwas completed between Cumberland and Cresaptown in 1920. The highway was extended to Rawlings by 1927 and to Dawson in 1928. McMullen Highway was completed to McCoole by 1930. The US 220 designation was extended south of Cumberland into West Virginia at the same time. Within Cumberland, US 220 followed Greene Street north and east to Wills Creek. The federal highway crossed Wills Creek via Baltimore Street, which the highway followed east to Henderson Avenue. US 220 was concurrent with US 40 on Henderson Avenue before turning northeast onto Bedford Street. In McCoole, US 220 followed a twisty route down to the North Branch Potomac River. The federal highway followed what is today MD 135A to MD 135, then turned east on the present MD 135 and past the present bridge to Parkland Drive, where the highway crossed the river on a bridge in line with Main Street in Keyser. The first round of improvements to US 220 began around 1936 when the highway was widened from McMullen to Amcelle. The widened highway was extended south through Cresaptown by 1938 and to McCoole by 1942, making all of McMullen Highway at least wide. A second round of widening occurred during World War II as a military access project; the highway was expanded to at least in width from Cumberland to Pinto to improve access to the many wartime manufacturing centers along the highway, including the Allegany Ordnance Plant in West Virginia across the Potomac River from Pinto. Improvements to US 220 continued after the war. Bedford Road was rebuilt between 1946 and 1950. McMullen Highway from Cumberland to Cresaptown was widened a third time in a project completed in 1950. The present bridge between McCoole and Keyser was completed in 1951, with the approach road on the Maryland side completed in 1952. Reconstruction of US 220 between Cresaptown and Rawlings occurred between 1952 and 1954. The final segment of McMullen Highway to be rebuilt, from Rawlings to McCoole, was completed in 1956. The first rerouting of US 220 within Cumberland occurred in 1956, when Frederick Street was reconstructed and became the northbound direction of a one-way pair in conjunction with Bedford Street. By 1964, the federal highway followed Mechanic Street north to the Frederick/Bedford pair instead of Henderson Avenue. In 1977, a viaduct was completed to carry US 220 over the railroad tracks and US 40 ALT. US 220 was moved off of surface streets in downtown Cumberland when the highway was placed on the Cumberland Thruway (now I-68) between McMullen Highway and Naves Cross Road in 1982. The highway used Naves Cross Road to reconnect with Bedford Road, which was designated MD 807 between Naves Cross Road and the Cumberland city line. In 2000, the two-lane, limited-access bypass of Bedford Road was completed northeast of Cumberland; MD 807 was extended north along the bypassed part of Bedford Road. The portion of US 220 between the southern city limit of Cumberland and I-68 was transferred from municipal maintenance to state maintenance in 2010. The 1951 bridge over the North Branch Potomac River between McCoole and Keyser was replaced between 2010 and 2013. The new bridge was constructed immediately east of the original, which was demolished after the new bridge was completed. Future A study is underway concerning upgrading or relocating US 220 between I-68 and the North Branch Potomac River. The proposed routing would involve MD 53 between I-68 and Cresaptown, and is part of a larger study of a highway to connect Cumberland with Corridor H near Scherr, West Virginia.

History  The see of Amyclae dates to 1082, when the Bishopric of Lacedaemon was raised to the rank of a Metropolitan see, and authorized to form three suffragan sees at Amyclae, Pissa (probably encompassing Kynouria) and Ezeroi. Despite its name, the new bishopric was not located at ancient Amyclae, a town near Sparta, but rather on the site of ancient Tegea in Arcadia, which through some unclear process had received the name of Amyklion (later usually shortened to Amykli and Nikli) by the 10th century. The bishopric of Amyclae was thus regarded as the successor of the long-defunct see of Tegea, attested as late as the Fourth Ecumenical Council in 451, but later abandoned, like much of Arcadia, as a result of the Slavic incursions of the late 6th century. The only known bishop of the see's early period is Nicholas Mouzalon in the second half of the 12th century.  Latin bishopric  Nikli and the rest of Arcadia were captured by the Crusaders in circa 1206‚Äì09, becoming part of the new Frankish Principality of Achaea, which soon came to encompass most of the Peloponnese. The Chronicle of the Morea depicts Nikli as a site of some importance and fortified, which fell to the Crusaders only after a siege. It became the seat of a secular barony, while a Roman Catholic bishop was installed in the episcopal see: the bishop Gilbert of Amyclae is attested in an act of September 1209. In 1222, the bishopric was united with the Metropolitan see of Lacedaemon. = Titular Latin see = It is a suppressed titular see of the Catholic Church, counting 18 incumbents between 1541 and the death of the last holder in 1937.

With the progressive Byzantine recovery of much of the Peloponnese in the late 13th and early 14th centuries, the Orthodox clergy was reinstated in many of its former sees, and new ones were founded; thus in the mid-14th century, Amyclae was once more made a bishopric, again as a suffragan of the Metropolis of Lacedaemonia. The Orthodox see continued in existence thereafter: in 1562 it is recorded as the first-ranked (protothronos) among the suffragans of Lacedaemon. In the aftermath of the Orlov Revolt and the invasion of the Peloponnese by Albanian irregulars, its bishop, Cyril, fled to Zakynthos and thence (along with the bishops of Lacedaemon and Monemvasia and other refugees) aboard four Russian warships to the Crimea. In 1804, the see of Amyclae was united with that of Tripolitsa into the Bishopric of Amyclae and Tripolitsa, with the bishop Nikephoros of Amyclae assuming the new see. In May 1817, the see was elevated to the rank of a Metropolis, and in 1819, the bishopric of Olena was merged into it. Following the establishment of the independent Kingdom of Greece and the autocephaly of the Church of Greece in 1833, it became the Metropolis of Mantinea and Megalopolis.

Opened by Thomas Keller in September 2006, Ad Hoc was meant to serve as a temporary cafe for six months but was retained as a permanent establishment. Early years Thomas Keller opened Ad Hoc in 2006 to serve as a temporary cafe. His intention was to have Ad Hoc serve as a six-month venture while preparing his new restaurant for the space, which would focus on hamburger and wine pairings. Ad Hoc was opened quickly, with little changes to the decor in the temporary space, and serving a nightly single four-course meal at a flat price. One menu allowed Ad Hoc to limit problems with finding and stocking ingredients, and menus were planned loosely about a week in advance, and finalized 48 hours before. Occasionally the menu would change based on seasonal ingredients or last minute ingredient availabilities. In 2006, Keller was interviewed by food critic Michael Bauer from SFGate and was asked if the venture would really be temporary. In response, he stated that he did not know and that if it was to go beyond the six-month time period they would need to change the name and \\"...Maybe we'd call it Ad Lib.\\" Bauer stated that the restaurant would become a permanent establishment, and described it having a \\"Chez Panisse sensibility.\\" Ad Hoc becomes permanent Keller decided to make Ad Hoc a permanent venture in 2007 due to the success of the concept.

The epithet urens is Latin for \\"stinging\\" alluding to the chemicals in the fruit. Common names in English include solitary fishtail palm, kitul palm, toddy palm, wine palm, sago palm and jaggery palm. Its leaf is used as fishing rod after trimming the branches of the leaf and drying. According to Monier-Williams, it is called moha-karin (\\"delusion maker\\") in Sanskrit. It is one of the sugar palms. Description Trees Unripe fruit Caryota urens species is a solitary-trunked tree that measure up to in height and up to wide. Widely spaced leaf-scar rings cover its gray trunk which culminate in a wide, 6 m tall leaf crown. The bipinnate leaves are triangular in shape, bright to deep green, long, and held on long petioles. The obdeltoid pinnae are 30 cm long with a pointed edge and a jagged edge. The long inflorescences emerge at each leaf node, from top to bottom, producing pendent clusters of white, unisexual flowers. The fruit matures to a round, drupe, red in color with one seed. Like all Caryotas, the fruit contains oxalic acid, a skin and membrane irritant. As these plants are monocarpic, the completion of the flower and fruiting process results in the death of the tree. Uses This species is called kithul (‡∂ö‡∑í‡∂≠‡∑î‡∂Ω‡∑ä) in Sri Lanka. It is the source of kithul treacle, a liquid jaggery. Toddy is extracted from the inflorescence, and is considered some what powerful compared to toddy extracted from few other palm trees. Pulp of the fully grown up plant is cut, sun dried, powdered and is edible. It is sweet in taste. This powder is considered cool and nutritious in Coastal districts of Karnataka. In Sri Lanka, the powder is mixed with coconut milk and cooked to make Kithul Thalapa (‡∂ö‡∑í‡∂≠‡∑î‡∂Ω‡∑ä ‡∂≠‡∂Ω‡∂¥). Elephants are fed both the leaf and the pulp of this plant. The leaves possess strong fibres and are used for basketry in Cambodia, where the plant is named tunsa√®. The heart of the trunk contains a starch similar to sago, as well the trunk can be used for building. The fruit, when its stiff hairs are removed, is pleasant and sweet to eat, and, as elsewhere, the Cambodians cut the stalks to make sugar, which in turn can be made into wine. Cultivation Caryota urens is cultivated as an ornamental tree, and planted in gardens and parks in tropical and sub-tropical climates. It is also used as an interior and houseplant when smaller.

Daily Express, East Malaysia Independent Newspaper The Standard Hong Kong iMOL, Indian Malaysian Online The police roadblocks began the week before the rally to create massive traffic jams across the city and the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur. Malaysian Opposition leader Lim Kit Siang of the DAP pointed out that this high-handed act by the police was unnecessary as it caused major inconvenience to everyone. Riot police used teargas and water cannon to break up the march on 25 November 2007. On the morning of the rally, an estimated twenty thousand people gathered near the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, carrying life-size portraits of Queen Elizabeth and Mahatma Gandhi, to indicate the nonviolent nature of their protest.

The prime minister further criticised the demonstrators, after he made a promise that he would listen to everyone even if they have unpleasant words to say. The government of Abdullah Badawi also attempted to link terrorism with the HINDRAF rally via the media.US defends peaceful protests in Malaysia The Straits Times As of 11 December 2007, HINDRAF leaders were all acquitted by the judicial courts due to a lack of evidence and a flimsy prosecution case against their allegations. To contain the movement while not being able to charge them according to valid evidence-based legal processes, on 12 December 2007 Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi personally signed the detention letters to imprison the HINDRAF leaders under the Internal Security Act for two years. Their detention terms are subject to infinite renewal. The reason given for this arrest was that the HINDRAF leadership has had links with international terrorist organisations such as Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and also organisations like Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in India. The invocation of the ISA to capture the HINDRAF leaders was seen as a strategic move by the United Malays National Organisation government to arrest the momentum generated by HINDRAF. The UMNO- led Government has threatened the Malaysian Indian community with sweeping arrests under the Emergency Act and ISA (similar to Operasi Lalang of the 1987, which targeted anti-BN elements in Malaysia, mostly of Malaysian Chinese extraction). This hard-line approach is also softened by the MIC reconciliatory approach to blunt HINDRAF's thrust as the champion of the Malaysian Indian community. Response to the detentions Even as Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi started threatening to use the ISA against the HINDRAF leaders for bringing Malaysia's racist policies out into the open for all to see, foreign news outlets criticised Badawi's lack of initiative to tackle the root cause of the problem. The detention without trial of the HINDRAF leaders drew negative comments in the foreign press about Badawi's administration and the poor way that the Government of Malaysia was handling the issue. The Democratic Action Party vowed to challenge the detention of the HINDRAF leaders. Despite the arrests, the opposition and most of the NGOs were unfazed and continued to challenge UMNO's deconstruction of democracy in Malaysia. The United States also voiced their disapproval of this latest round of ISA arrests. The official HINDRAF website at http://www.policewatchmalaysia.com has been allowed by Malaysian ISPs again, after a brief ban. However, this site is constantly plagued by faults and downtime. In response to the ban, sites such as http://www.hindraf.org, http://www.myhindraf.com were spawned to maintain awareness of this movement, in addition to the many blogs available. The movement started in Malaysia, has grown global and now has following in UK, Australia, Canada, and USA. There have also been candlelight vigils at Hindu temples throughout Malaysia to protest the detention of five leaders of the HINDRAF. This was condemned by Malaysian minister Samy Vellu.\\"Malaysian minister slams pro-Hindraf campaign\\", Yahoo! India News, January 28, 2008 War of the Roses The Rose to the PM campaign was mooted to present a humanistic element in HINDRAF's campaign. The central focus of this campaign was the delivery of a rose, as a symbol of love and compassion, to the Malaysian Prime Minister at the Malaysian Parliament by Vwaishnavi Wathya Moorthy (aged give). This symbolic act was to occur on 16 February 2008, but the Malaysian Lower House was dissolved for the Federal Elections on 13 February 2008. In a dramatic show of force, the police fired teargas and targeted water cannon at several hundred ethnic Tamils at the centre of Kuala Lumpur. More than 200 people were detained by the authorities after being attacked by the police near the site of an Indian temple.https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080216/wl_asia_afp/malaysiaprotestsrights_080216164742 The impact of HINDRAF on the 12th Malaysian general elections The 12th general election showed how HINDRAF had become one of the triggers for a major change in the course of the country. The general dissatisfaction with the regime ruled by UMNO had been brewing for some years and the Hindraf Rally of 25 November caused what has been called a political tsunami in Malaysian politics. The ruling UMNO-led government lost its two-thirds majority in Parliament and came close to getting just over half the seats in Parliament from the Peninsula. HINDRAF, which had barely existed for three years, and was barely known until August 2007, suddenly caught the mood of a large proportion of Malaysians, not only Tamils and Hindus but the Chinese and a sizeable section of the Malays as well, causing a major upset in the process. Hindraf declared as illegal organisation After several warnings by the Malaysian government HINDRAF was officially banned on 15 October 2008. This was confirmed by the Malaysian Home Minister Datuk Seri Syed Hamid Albar.http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/10/15/nation/20081015184431&sec;=nation In a statement issued by the ministry, Syed Hamid said the decision to declare HINDRAF an illegal organisation was made following the ministry being satisfied with facts and evidence that showed HINDRAF had and was being used for unlawful purposes and posed a threat to public order and morality. \\"Based on powers vested under Section 5 (1) of the Societies Act, HINDRAF from today is declared an illegal organisation,\\" he said. He said the order was being made as a result of monitoring and investigation of the organisation's activities, since its inception, by the Registrar of Societies and the Home Ministry. More detentions by the Malaysian government On 23 October 2008, a group comprising eight men, three women, and a child, were arrested by the police after they tried to hand a memorandum to the Prime Minister's office. It called for the release of the five HNDRAF leaders from detention under the Internal Security Act. http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/10/23/nation/20081023194129&sec;=nation Hindraf members arrested in front of PM's officehttp://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Friday/National/2384293/Article/index_html Hindraf 11 held over illegal assembly It was discovered that HINDRAF leader P.Waythamoorthy's six-year-old daughter was amongst the people arrested.http://mt.m2day.org/2008/content/view/14190/84/ Waythamoorthy's wife, daughter and 10 other Hindraf supporters detained Interlok On 27 February 2011, HINDRAF organised a demonstration in Kuala Lumpur protesting the government's decision to include the Malay language novel Interlok in the school curriculum as compulsory reading for the Malay literature subject for students in secondary 5.

It was first aired on BBC One on 4 November 2007. It is linked, by the central character of Joe, to the Poliakoff drama Capturing Mary which was aired (on BBC Two) on 12 November 2007. Plot The play revolves around the character of Joe (who is also the narrator), a teenager who has just left school and finds himself employed by Elliot Graham, an agoraphobic billionaire. Joe's task is to act as doorman/caretaker for one of Graham's houses, a palatial property in central London. Graham himself refuses to live in the house and instead resides in a more modest property over the road. Nevertheless, Graham employs a whole team of servants (including Joe's mother‚Äîhow he got the job) to keep the place spotless even though it has no apparent use. Joe is at first hired to work during the afternoons only but, following the departure of the first caretaker (played by Clive Russell), Joe takes over the whole day and is also allowed to sleep there at night if he so wishes. It becomes apparent very early on that the house is associated with bad memories. None of the staff remains for very long‚ÄîJoe's mother disappears off to Spain with her new lover, the first caretaker smashes most of the plates before very nearly throwing himself off the roof, and even a homeless person whom Joe invites back for company senses the bad vibes about the place. Joe, it seems, is much more grounded so none of this appears to affect him. Graham appears obsessed with finding out some dark secret concerning his father's wealth (Graham inherited the wealth) and has hired many accountants and historians to research this. He states that he would like to spend his money to do good, but he has to know where it came from first. He even sends Joe onto the Antiques Roadshow with a collection of gold snuffboxes worth nearly a million pounds to see if he can glean any more about their origin from the specialist Geoffrey Munn. This dark secret appears to be tied up in the bad vibes concerning the house. Meanwhile, Joe, on Graham's permission, allows the house to be used by a Richard, a self-centered cabinet minister and friend of Graham's as a place for assignations with his mistress Charlotte. Joe develops a Platonic attraction toward Charlotte, and is perturbed when Richard eventually turns up with a new mistress‚Äîthough he continues to see Charlotte on occasion as a friend. Eventually, on Joe's suggestion, Graham hires Tina, a woman who works at the local delicatessen (which both Joe and Graham frequent) to go through his paperwork, and she does eventually find the dark secret. However, just as Tina is about to reveal this to Graham and Joe at the house, Graham loses his nerve, saying he does not want to put off hearing the secret but does not want to hear it first in that house. Later, Joe joins Graham on a trip to the country castle (represented by Bodiam Castle) which Graham's father had given him, and there Graham tells Joe what Tina has told him‚Äîthe first foundations of Graham's father's fortune were in his doing business with German companies and Nazi officials in the 1930s. These dealings were not treasonous, but this nevertheless made Graham's father complicit in some of the earlier actions of the Holocaust, particularly in his non-condemnatory attitude to the abuse of Jews in a Berlin park during that time and his acceptance of the antiques as gifts from his German business partners (who had stolen them from Jews). Having told Joe, Graham attempts suicide, but Joe prevents him. The drama ends with Joe himself moving on, and Graham now using his money for good, and having traced the rightful owners of the antiques.

After ousting President Li Yuanhong from office, he openly offered $5000 to any member of parliament who would elect him president. There was massive public outrage against his plan but he succeeded despite a counter-bribe by Zhang Zuolin, Duan Qirui and Sun Yat-sen to not elect him. Inaugurated on Double Ten Day that year with a newly minted constitution, he subsequently neglected his duties as president to concentrate on defeating the rival warlord factions. One of his subordinates, the semi-Zhili-affiliated Feng Yuxiang, became increasingly dissatisfied with Cao and Wu Peifu. His sympathies lay with Sun Yat-sen's Kuomintang government in Guangzhou, and Japan had also supplied him with 1.5 million yen (via warlord Zhang Zuolin) in hopes he would agree to topple the Cao government. The Japanese wanted to remove the Zhili government due to its strong anti-Japanese policy.Waldron, Arthur, From War to Nationalism: China's Turning Point, p. 196. In the autumn of 1924 the Zhili clique went to war with Zhang Zuolin's Fengtian clique in the Second Zhili‚ÄìFengtian War. With Wu at the helm of Zhili's armies, it was expected to be victorious. If the Fengtian clique was destroyed, the Zhili clique could finish off its few remaining rivals in the south with ease. Early on 23 October, however, Feng Yuxiang's Beijing defense troops seized control of key government buildings, public utilities and the roads leading into and out of Beijing. Cao Kun was placed under house arrest and stripped of his presidency. Upon receiving news of the coup, the Fengtian commanders Zhang Zongchang and Li Jinglin used this opportunity to launch a major offensive and broke the Zhili clique's frontline, putting them in a favorable military position.Waldron, pp. 184-185. Zhang Zuolin took full advantage of the coup, pursued the Zhili army and won a major victory outside Tianjin. Wu and his remaining forces fled to central China where they met up with his ally Sun Chuanfang. All of north China was divided between the Fengtian clique and Feng Yuxiang, whose forces were renamed the Guominjun (Nationalist Army). Zhang Zuolin took the prosperous northeast while Feng was left with the poor northwest. After the coup, Feng placed Huang Fu as acting president of the Beijing government. He initiated several reforms on Feng's behalf, including the expulsion of Puyi from the Forbidden City and abolishing the role of the old bell and drum towers as the official timepiece. However, Huang refused to guarantee foreign privileges and Zhang Zuolin became despondent at his one- time ally. The only major agreement Feng and Zhang made was to dissolve the discredited National Assembly and create a provisional government with the pro-Japanese but relatively competent Duan Qirui as its head. On November 17, 1924, Zhang Zuolin invited Feng Yuxiang to talk at the home of Tianjin Ruili. He decided to hold the section as \\"temporary ruling\\" and went to Beijing to preside over government affairs. Significance Plans were made to hold negotiations for national reunification among Feng, Zhang, Duan and Sun Yat- sen. These were fruitless and Sun died in Beijing in March 1925. Feng and Zhang came to blows when Fengtian Gen. Guo Songling defected to the Guominjun on November 22 and started the Anti-Fengtian War. Six days after this Li Dazhao led a so-called First United Front movement to topple Duan's provisional government, calling it the Capital Revolution. Feng wanted to support this but changed his mind, preferring to concentrate his forces on Zhang's army. As a result, the Capital Revolution movement collapsed. While the defeat of the powerful Zhili clique paved the way for the long-term success of the Northern Expedition by the Nationalist Party, its greatest impact was to buy time for the Kuomintang to build up its National Revolutionary Army. Had the coup not happened, the Zhili clique would surely have finished off the Kuomintang after defeating the Fengtian clique. Feng was saved from losing all his power by allying with Chiang Kai-shek during the Northern Expedition, but later became disillusioned with the Generalissimo's leadership. He rebelled against Chiang and was defeated during the Central Plains War of 1930. In popular culture The coup was mentioned in Bernardo Bertolucci's film The Last Emperor, though it erroneously claims the president fled the capital instead of being put under house arrest.

The episode was rated TV-MA L in the United States. The episode parodies the Guitar Hero video games, and aired ten days after the release of Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock.Comedy Central press \\"Guitar Queer-o\\" release In the episode, Stan and Kyle are hooked on Guitar Hero, but Stan's superior skills on the video game damages his friendship with Kyle. Plot Stan and Kyle are obsessed with the video game Guitar Hero, and attempt to break the game's scoring record in front of their friends. As soon as they break the 100,000 points record on \\"Carry on Wayward Son\\", they are contacted by Charles Kincade, a talent agent, who wants to offer them recording contracts. They become Guitar Hero rock star celebrities overnight, enjoying the hedonistic \\"sex and drugs\\" lifestyle. The record company organizes a future event where Stan and Kyle will attempt to break a 1 million point record in front of a live audience. Stan is taken aside by his manager and told that Kyle is holding him back, and encourages Stan to dump Kyle in favor of another kid, Thad Jarvis, who can play many Guitar Hero songs \\"acoustically\\", having memorized what buttons to press instead of relying on the on-screen cues. Kyle discovers Stan practicing with Thad and angrily breaks up their \\"band\\". Kyle goes on to perform at a local bowling alley by its owner for free food and drink, improving as he plays. Stan becomes stressed out over the upcoming event, and tries to seek refuge using a different video game Heroin Hero where the only objective is literally chasing a dragon as the in-game player injects himself with heroin. The game somehow shortens his temper and concentration into getting into a fight with Thad, who subsequently leaves Stan. Stan, still intoxicated with Heroin Hero, is forced to play the event solo, but ends up getting a miserable score and throwing up on stage; after the audience leaves and the game audience \\"boos\\" Stan, Kincade angrily admonishes him by saying \\"You blew it! You had it all and you blew it!\\" and subsequently leaves him. Stan comes back to the video game store and decides to pick another game to play, but when offered by the game store owner Rehab Hero (which remedies the heroin-like addiction to a former player of Heroin Hero), Stan instead selects a simple driving game. While driving around in-game, Stan hears \\"Carry on Wayward Son\\" from the game's soundtrack and remembers the good time he had with Kyle. Stan goes to apologize to Kyle and after a brief spat, the two become friends again, dumping the recording contract. They go back home and go on to break the 1 million point record in front of their friends. To their shock, the game rewards them by telling them, \\"Congratulations! You Are Fags!\\". The two become upset that they have worked so hard only to be insulted, and angrily walk out; Cartman and Butters start to play the game, with Butters eagerly requesting that he gets to be the one to betray Cartman \\"after the sex and drugs party\\". Cultural references The celebrities that the boys meet at the party are real-life Colorado celebrities: KDVR news anchor Ron Zapollo (though he's recognized as being from \\"channel 4\\", where he had not worked since the late 1980s), American Furniture Warehouse President Jake Jabs, and diamond mogul Tom Shane. Jay Cutler, the then-quarterback for the Denver Broncos, was insulted by Stan in the episode (\\"You kind of suck, but my dad says you might be good some day\\"). Cutler himself responded lightheartedly, saying \\"I thought it was funny. They can make fun of me if they want to.\\" Stan's new Guitar Hero partner, Thad, saying \\"I quit!

The principal contemporary alternate spellings Farrer, Farra, '''Ferrar, Pharo occasionally, but not necessarily Farrow, and is an occupational surname for a blacksmith or ironworker - derived from the Latin ferrarius - Middle English Ferror (a smith) as an occupation, Anglo-Norman ferrur, and thus shares a common occupational derivation with the most common English surname, Smith. There are records of an Osbert le ferrur and Peter le ferrour previous to the Poll tax of 1377, but in those cases ferrur is not a name, it is an occupation i.e. Thomas the horseshoer The Subsidy roll (Poll tax) of 1379, for the town of Elland, Halifax Parish, Morley Wapentake, West Riding of Yorkshire lists a Johannes de Helistones, fferror & uxor (John of Helistones, Ferror and (his) wife, indicating that he was a \\"ferror\\"; also in the same subsidy roll is Henricus de Langfeld', ffranklayn, & uxor, which translates into Henry of Langfeld, freeman and (his) wife. By 1350 surnames were taking hold in the south of England, but it wasn't until around 1450 that surnames took hold in the north ( including Yorkshire) in the 15th centurysee note on Helistones as place name. Prior to the poll tax, surnames as such did not exist, the poll tax was a head tax, one which the poor did not have to pay, but to record the head paying the tax they were identified by origin and occupation such as John of Helistones, ferror there was also a Ricardus de Helistones, Carpenter in the same town Bearers of the surname belong to various haplogroups including E-M2, I-M233, I-M253,J-M172, R-M269, R-YP5578  Origin and Appearance of the Name  The earliest documented appearance of the surname is the Register of Freemen of York, 1410-1411 with Johannes Ferror a littestar (dyer of wool or lister, litster). Due to varying levels of literacy, and regional dialects the name morphs back and forth from Farrar, Pharo, Farra, Ferrar, Farrer, Ferrers, and Farrow, the name itself did not change, but the spelling of it depended upon the Scrivener The surname is found, in England, originally in those areas in which there were deposits of iron and thus an iron producing industry. As an example of how the spelling can change over time there is the following: Henry Ferror is listed in Halifax Wills being Abstracts and Translations 1545-1559 His son William Ferror's will His grandson John FerrarFarrer's will snd his great grandson William Farrar (settler) Another variant: Will of Henry Fareher of Halifax 1542 Lord (Thomas) Farrer of Abinger, in his \\"Farrer (and some variants) Wills and Administrations, lists many related and unrelated Farrars, with a variety of spellings who left Wills.https://archive.org/details/farrerandsomevar00farr/page/52  Armorial Bearings  Coat of arms and crest for William Farrar's father, John Farrar of Croxton and London, esquire.

A grafted tree showing two different color blossoms Grafting or graftage is a horticultural technique whereby tissues of plants are joined so as to continue their growth together. The upper part of the combined plant is called the scion () while the lower part is called the rootstock. The success of this joining requires that the vascular tissues grow together and such joining is called inosculation. The technique is most commonly used in asexual propagation of commercially grown plants for the horticultural and agricultural trades. In most cases, one plant is selected for its roots and this is called the stock or rootstock. The other plant is selected for its stems, leaves, flowers, or fruits and is called the scion or cion. The scion contains the desired genes to be duplicated in future production by the stock/scion plant. In stem grafting, a common grafting method, a shoot of a selected, desired plant cultivar is grafted onto the stock of another type. In another common form called bud grafting, a dormant side bud is grafted onto the stem of another stock plant, and when it has inosculated successfully, it is encouraged to grow by pruning off the stem of the stock plant just above the newly grafted bud. For successful grafting to take place, the vascular cambium tissues of the stock and scion plants must be placed in contact with each other. Both tissues must be kept alive until the graft has \\"taken\\", usually a period of a few weeks. Successful grafting only requires that a vascular connection take place between the grafted tissues. Research conducted in Arabidopsis thaliana hypocotyls have shown that the connection of phloem takes place after 3 days of initial grafting, whereas the connection of xylem can take up to 7 days. Joints formed by grafting are not as strong as naturally formed joints, so a physical weak point often still occurs at the graft because only the newly formed tissues inosculate with each other. The existing structural tissue (or wood) of the stock plant does not fuse. Advantages Graft particular to plum cherry. The scion is the largest in the plant, due to the imperfect union of the two. It can be seen on the enlarged trunk: this accumulation of starch is an indication of imperfection. *Precocity: The ability to induce fruitfulness without the need for completing the juvenile phase. Juvenility is the natural state through which a seedling plant must pass before it can become reproductive. In most fruiting trees, juvenility may last between 5 and 9 years, but in some tropical fruits, e.g., mangosteen, juvenility may be prolonged for up to 15 years. Grafting of mature scions onto rootstocks can result in fruiting in as little as two years. *Dwarfing: To induce dwarfing or cold tolerance or other characteristics to the scion. Most apple trees in modern orchards are grafted on to dwarf or semi-dwarf trees planted at high density. They provide more fruit per unit of land, of higher quality, and reduce the danger of accidents by harvest crews working on ladders. Care must be taken when planting dwarf or semi-dwarf trees. If such a tree is planted with the graft below the soil, then the scion portion can also grow roots and the tree will still grow to its standard size. *Ease of propagation: Because the scion is difficult to propagate vegetatively by other means, such as by cuttings. In this case, cuttings of an easily rooted plant are used to provide a rootstock. In some cases, the scion may be easily propagated, but grafting may still be used because it is commercially the most cost-effective way of raising a particular type of plant. *Hybrid breeding: To speed maturity of hybrids in fruit tree breeding programs. Hybrid seedlings may take ten or more years to flower and fruit on their own roots. Grafting can reduce the time to flowering and shorten the breeding program. *Hardiness: Because the scion has weak roots or the roots of the stock plants are tolerant of difficult conditions. e.g. many Western Australian plants are sensitive to dieback on heavy soils, common in urban gardens, and are grafted onto hardier eastern Australian relatives. Grevilleas and eucalypts are examples. *Sturdiness: To provide a strong, tall trunk for certain ornamental shrubs and trees. In these cases, a graft is made at a desired height on a stock plant with a strong stem. This is used to raise 'standard' roses, which are rose bushes on a high stem, and it is also used for some ornamental trees, such as certain weeping cherries. *Disease/pest resistance: In areas where soil-borne pests or pathogens would prevent the successful planting of the desired cultivar, the use of pest/disease tolerant rootstocks allow the production from the cultivar that would be otherwise unsuccessful. A major example is the use of rootstocks in combating Phylloxera. *Pollen source: To provide pollenizers. For example, in tightly planted or badly planned apple orchards of a single variety, limbs of crab apple may be grafted at regularly spaced intervals onto trees down rows, say every fourth tree. This takes care of pollen needs at blossom time. *Repair: To repair damage to the trunk of a tree that would prohibit nutrient flow, such as stripping of the bark by rodents that completely girdles the trunk. In this case a bridge graft may be used to connect tissues receiving flow from the roots to tissues above the damage that have been severed from the flow. Where a water sprout, basal shoot or sapling of the same species is growing nearby, any of these can be grafted to the area above the damage by a method called inarch grafting. These alternatives to scions must be of the correct length to span the gap of the wound. *Changing cultivars: To change the cultivar in a fruit orchard to a more profitable cultivar, called top working. It may be faster to graft a new cultivar onto existing limbs of established trees than to replant an entire orchard. *Genetic consistency: Apples are notorious for their genetic variability, even differing in multiple characteristics, such as, size, color, and flavor, of fruits located on the same tree. In the commercial farming industry, consistency is maintained by grafting a scion with desired fruit traits onto a hardy stock. An example of approach grafting by Axel Erlandson. *Curiosities **A practice sometimes carried out by gardeners is to graft related potatoes and tomatoes so that both are produced on the same plant, one above ground and one underground. **Cacti of widely different forms are sometimes grafted on to each other. **Multiple cultivars of fruits such as apples are sometimes grafted on a single tree. This so-called \\"family tree\\" provides more fruit variety for small spaces such as a suburban backyard, and also takes care of the need for pollenizers. The drawback is that the gardener must be sufficiently trained to prune them correctly, or one strong variety will usually \\"take over.\\" Multiple cultivars of different \\"stone fruits\\" (Prunus species) can be grafted on a single tree. This is called a fruit salad tree. **Ornamental and functional, tree shaping uses grafting techniques to join separate trees or parts of the same tree to itself. Furniture, hearts, entry archways are examples. Axel Erlandson was a prolific tree shaper who grew over 75 mature specimens.  Factors for successful graft  * Compatibility of scion and stock: Because grafting involves the joining of vascular tissues between the scion and rootstock, plants lacking vascular cambium, such as monocots, cannot normally be grafted. As a general rule, the closer two plants are genetically, the more likely the graft union will form. Genetically identical clones and intra-species plants have a high success rate for grafting. Grafting between species of the same genus is sometimes successful. Grafting has a low success rate when performed with plants in the same family but in different genera. And grafting between different families is rare. * Cambium alignment and pressure: The vascular cambium of the scion and stock should be tightly pressed together and oriented in the direction of normal growth. Proper alignment and pressure encourages the tissues to join quickly, allowing nutrients and water to transfer from the stockroot to the scion. *Completed during appropriate stage of plant: The grafting is completed at a time when the scion and stock are capable of producing callus and other wound-response tissues. Generally, grafting is performed when the scion is dormant, as premature budding can drain the grafting site of moisture before the grafting union is properly established. Temperature greatly affects the physiological stage of plants. If the temperature is too warm, premature budding may result. Elsewise, high temperatures can slow or halt callus formation. *Proper care of graft site: After grafting, it is important to nurse the grafted plant back to health for a period of time. Various grafting tapes and waxes are used to protect the scion and stock from excessive water loss. Furthermore, depending on the type of graft, twine or string is used to add structural support to the grafting site. Sometimes it is necessary to prune the site, as the rootstock may produce shoots that inhibit the growth of the scion.  Tools  Depiction of general purpose grafting knives * Cutting tools: It is good procedure to keep the cutting tool sharp to minimize tissue damage and clean from dirt and other substances to avoid the spread of disease. A good knife for general grafting should have a blade and handle length of about 3 inches and 4 inches respectively. Specialized knives for grafting include bud-grafting knives, surgical knives, and pruning knives. Cleavers, chisels, and saws are utilized when the stock is too large to be cut otherwise. *Disinfecting tools: Treating the cutting tools with disinfectants ensures the grafting site is clear of pathogens. A common sterilizing agent is absolute alcohol. *Graft seals: Keeps the grafting site hydrated. Good seals should be tight enough to retain moisture while, at the same time, loose enough to accommodate plant growth. Includes specialized types of clay, wax, petroleum jelly, and adhesive tape. *Tying and support materials: Adds support and pressure to the grafting site to hold the stock and scion together before the tissues join, which is especially important in herbaceous grafting. The employed material is often dampened before use to help protect the site from desiccation. Support equipment includes strips made from various substances, twine, nails, and splints. * Grafting machines: Because grafting can take a lot of time and skill, grafting machines have been created. Automation is particularly popular for seedling grafting in countries such as Japan and Korea where farming land is both limited and used intensively. Certain machines can graft 800 seedlings per hour. Techniques =Approach= T budding Approach grafting or inarching is used to join together plants that are otherwise difficult to join. The plants are grown close together, and then joined so that each plant has roots below and growth above the point of union. Both scion and stock retain their respective parents that may or may not be removed after joining. Also used in pleaching. The graft can be successfully accomplished any time of year. =Bud= Grafting process (Uzbekistan) Bud grafting (also called chip budding) uses a bud instead of a twig. Grafting roses is the most common example of bud grafting. In this method a bud is removed from the parent plant, and the base of the bud is inserted beneath the bark of the stem of the stock plant from which the rest of the shoot has been cut. Any extra bud that starts growing from the stem of the stock plant is removed. Examples: roses and fruit trees like peaches. Budwood is a stick with several buds on it that can be cut out and used for bud grafting. It is a common method of propagation for citrus trees. =Cleft= Successful cleft graft after 2 years' growth Same graft after 4 years' growth In cleft grafting a small cut is made in the stock and then the pointed end of the scion is inserted in the stock. This is best done in the early spring and is useful for joining a thin scion about diameter to a thicker branch or stock. It is best if the former has 3‚Äì5 buds and the latter is in diameter. The branch or stock should be split carefully down the middle to form a cleft about deep. If it is a branch that is not vertical then the cleft should be cut horizontally. The end of the scion should be cut cleanly to a long shallow wedge, preferably with a single cut for each wedge surface, and not whittled. A third cut may be made across the end of the wedge to make it straight across. Slide the wedge into the cleft so that it is at the edge of the stock and the centre of the wedge faces are against the cambium layer between the bark and the wood. It is preferable if a second scion is inserted in a similar way into the other side of the cleft. This helps to seal off the cleft. Tape around the top of the stock to hold the scion in place and cover with grafting wax or sealing compound. This stops the cambium layers from drying out and also prevents the ingress of water into the cleft. =Whip= Graft needing attention the following season Successful whip graft In whip grafting the scion and the stock are cut slanting and then joined. The grafted point is then bound with tape and covered with a soft sealant to prevent dehydration and infection by germs. The common variation is a whip and tongue graft, which is considered the most difficult to master but has the highest rate of success as it offers the most cambium contact between the scion and the stock. It is the most common graft used in preparing commercial fruit trees. It is generally used with stock less than diameter, with the ideal diameter closer to and the scion should be of roughly the same diameter as the stock. The stock is cut through on one side only at a shallow angle with a sharp knife. (If the stock is a branch and not the main trunk of the rootstock then the cut surface should face outward from the centre of the tree.) The scion is similarly sliced through at an equal angle starting just below a bud, so that the bud is at the top of the cut and on the other side than the cut face. In the whip and tongue variation, a notch is cut downwards into the sliced face of the stock and a similar cut upwards into the face of the scion cut. These act as the tongues and it requires some skill to make the cuts so that the scion and the stock marry up neatly. The elongated \\"Z\\" shape adds strength, removing the need for a companion rod in the first season (see illustration). The joint is then taped around and treated with tree-sealing compound or grafting wax. A whip graft without a tongue is less stable and may need added support. =Stub= Successful stub graft, healed Stub grafting is a technique that requires less stock than cleft grafting, and retains the shape of a tree. Also scions are generally of 6‚Äì8 buds in this process. An incision is made into the branch long, then the scion is wedged and forced into the branch. The scion should be at an angle of at most 35¬∞ to the parent tree so that the crotch remains strong. The graft is covered with grafting compound. After the graft has taken, the branch is removed and treated a few centimeters above the graft, to be fully removed when the graft is strong. =Four-flap= The four-flap graft (also called banana graft) is commonly used for pecans, and first became popular with this species in Oklahoma in 1975. It is heralded for maximum cambium overlap, but is a complex graft. It requires similarly sized diameters for the rootstock and scion. The bark of the rootstock is sliced and peeled back in four flaps, and the hardwood is removed, looking somewhat like a peeled banana. It is a difficult graft to learn. =Awl= Awl grafting takes the least resources and the least time. It is best done by an experienced grafter, as it is possible to accidentally drive the tool too far into the stock, reducing the scion's chance of survival. Awl grafting can be done by using a screwdriver to make a slit in the bark, not penetrating the cambium layer completely. Then inset the wedged scion into the incision. =Veneer= Veneer grafting, or inlay grafting, is a method used for stock larger than in diameter. The scion is recommended to be about as thick as a pencil. Clefts are made of the same size as the scion on the side of the branch, not on top. The scion end is shaped as a wedge, inserted, and wrapped with tape to the scaffolding branches to give it more strength. =Rind (also called bark)= Rind grafting involves grafting a small scion onto the end of a thick stock. The thick stock is sawn off, and a ~4 cm long bark-deep cut is made parallel to the stock, from the sawn-off end down, and the bark is separated from the wood on one or both sides. The scion is shaped as a wedge, exposing cambium on both sides, and is pushed in under the back of the stock, with a flat side against the wood. Natural grafting A Husband and Wife tree ‚Äì Natural grafting in blackthorn Prunus spinosa Tree branches and more often roots of the same species will sometimes naturally graft; this is called inosculation. The bark of the tree may be stripped away when the roots make physical contact with each other, exposing the vascular cambium and allowing the roots to graft together. A group of trees can share water and mineral nutrients via root grafts, which may be advantageous to weaker trees, and may also form a larger rootmass as an adaptation to promote fire resistance and regeneration as exemplified by the California black oak (Quercus kelloggii). Additionally, grafting may protect the group from wind damages as a result of the increased mechanical stability provided by the grafting. Albino redwoods use root grafting as a form of plant parasitism of normal redwoods. A problem with root grafts is that they allow transmission of certain pathogens, such as Dutch elm disease. Inosculation also sometimes occurs where two stems on the same tree, shrub or vine make contact with each other. This is common in plants such as strawberries and potato. Natural grafting is rarely seen in herbaceous plants as those types of plants generally have short-lived roots with little to no secondary growth in the vascular cambium. Graft chimera  Occasionally, a so-called \\"graft hybrid\\" or more accurately graft chimera can occur where the tissues of the stock continue to grow within the scion. Such a plant can produce flowers and foliage typical of both plants as well as shoots intermediate between the two. The best-known example this is probably +Laburnocytisus 'Adamii', a graft hybrid between Laburnum and Cytisus, which originated in a nursery near Paris, France, in 1825. This small tree bears yellow flowers typical of Laburnum anagyroides, purple flowers typical of Cytisus purpureus and curious coppery-pink flowers that show characteristics of both \\"parents\\". Many species of cactus can also produce graft chimeras under the right conditions although they are often created unintentionally and such results are often hard to replicate. Scientific uses Grafting has been important in flowering research. Leaves or shoots from plants induced to flower can be grafted onto uninduced plants and transmit a floral stimulus that induces them to flower. The transmission of plant viruses has been studied using grafting. Virus indexing involves grafting a symptomless plant that is suspected of carrying a virus onto an indicator plant that is very susceptible to the virus. Grafting can transfer chloroplasts (specialised DNA in plants that can conduct photosynthesis), mitochondrial DNA and the entire cell nucleus containing the genome to potentially make a new species making grafting a form of natural genetic engineering.  Examples  =White Spruce= White spruce can be grafted with consistent success by using scions of current growth on thrifty 4- to 5-year-old rootstock (Nienstaedt and Teich 1972). Before greenhouse grafting, rootstocks should be potted in late spring, allowed to make seasonal growth, then subjected to a period of chilling outdoors, or for about 8 weeks in a cool room at 2 ¬∞C (Nienstaedt 1966). A method of grafting white spruce of seed-bearing age during the time of seed harvest in the fall was developed by Nienstaedt et al. (1958). Scions of white spruce of 2 ages of wood from 30- to 60-year-old trees were collected in the fall and grafted by 3 methods on potted stock to which different day-length treatments had been applied prior to grafting. The grafted stock were given long-day and natural-day treatments. Survival was 70% to 100% and showed effects of rootstock and post-grafting treatments in only a few cases. Photoperiod and temperature treatments after grafting, however, had considerable effect on scion activity and total growth. The best post-grafting treatment was 4 weeks of long-day treatment followed by 2 weeks of short-day treatment, then 8 weeks of chilling, and finally long-day treatment. Since grafts of white spruce put on relatively little growth in the 2 years after grafting, techniques for accelerating the early growth were studied by Greenwood (1988) and others. The cultural regimes used to promote one additional growth cycle in one year involve manipulation of day length and the use of cold storage to satisfy chilling requirements. Greenwood took dormant potted grafts into the greenhouse in early January then gradually raised the temperature during the course of a week until the minimum temperature rose to 15 ¬∞C. Photoperiod was increased to 18 hours using incandescent lighting. In this technique, grafts are grown until elongation has been completed, normally by mid-March. Soluble 10-52-10 fertilizer is applied at both ends of the growth cycle and 20-20-20 during the cycle, with irrigation as needed. When growth elongation is complete, day length is reduced to 8 hours using a blackout curtain. Budset follows, and the grafts are held in the greenhouse until mid-May. Grafts are then moved into a cooler at 4 ¬∞C for 1000 hours, after which they are moved to a shade frame where they grow normally, with applications of fertilizer and irrigation as in the first cycle. Grafts are moved into cold frames or unheated greenhouse in September until January. Flower induction treatments are begun on grafts that have reached a minimum length of 1.0 m. Repotting from an initial pot size of 4.5 litre to 16 litre containers with a 2:1:1 soil mix of peat moss, loam, and aggregate. In one of the first accelerated growth experiments, white spruce grafts made in January and February that would normally elongate shortly after grafting, set bud, and remain in that condition until the following spring, were refrigerated for 500, 1000, or 1500 hours beginning in mid-July, and a non-refrigerated control was held in the nursery. After completion of the cold treatment, the grafts were moved into the greenhouse with an 18-hour photoperiod until late October. Height increment was significantly (P 0.01) influenced by cold treatment. Best results were given by the 1000-hour treatment. The refrigeration (cold treatment) phase was subsequently shown to be effective when applied 2 months earlier with proper handling and use of blackout curtains, which allows the second growth cycle to be completed in time to satisfy dormancy requirements before January (Greenwood et al. 1988). Herbaceous grafting Grafting is often done for non-woody and vegetable plants (tomato, cucumber, eggplant and watermelon). Tomato grafting is very popular in Asia and Europe, and is gaining popularity in the United States. The main advantage of grafting is for disease-resistant rootstocks. Researchers in Japan developed automated processes using grafting robots as early as 1987. Plastic tubing can be used to prevent desiccation and support the healing at the graft/scion interface. History, society and culture = Fertile Crescent = As humans began to domesticate plants and animals, horticultural techniques that could reliably propagate the desired qualities of long-lived woody plants needed to be developed. Although grafting is not specifically mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, it is claimed that ancient Biblical text hints at the practice of grafting. For example, Leviticus 19:19, which dates to around 1400 BCE, states \\" [the Hebrew people] shalt not sow their field with mingled seed... \\"(King James Bible) Some scholars believe the phrase mingled seeds includes grafting, although this interpretation remains contentious among scholars. Grafting is also mentioned in the New Testament. In Romans 11, starting at verse 17, there is a discussion about the grafting of wild olive trees concerning the relationship between Jews and Gentiles. By 500 BCE grafting was well established and practiced in the region as the Mishna describes grafting as a commonplace technique used to grow grapevines. = China = According to recent research: \\"grafting technology had been practiced in China before 2000 BC\\". Additional evidence for grafting in China is found in Jia Sixie's 6th century CE agricultural treatise Qimin Yaoshu (Essential Skills for the Common People).Shih Sheng-han, A Preliminary Survey of the Book Ch'i Min Yao Shu, and Agricultural Encyclopaedia of the 6th Century 2nd ed, Beijing: Science Press, 1982 It discusses grafting pear twigs onto crab apple, jujube and pomegranate stock (domesticated apples had not yet arrived in China), as well as grafting persimmons. The Qimin yaoshu refers to older texts that referred to grafting, but those works are missing. Nonetheless, given the sophistication of the methods discussed, and the long history of arboriculture in the region, grafting must have already been practiced for centuries by this time. = Greece and Rome, and Islamic Golden Age = In Greece, a medical record written in 424 BCE contains the first direct reference to grafting. The title of the work is On the Nature of the Child and is thought to be written by a follower of Hippocrates. The language of the author suggests that grafting appeared centuries before this period. In Rome, Marcus Porcius Cato wrote the oldest surviving Latin text in 160 BCE. The book is called De Agri Cultura (On Farming Agriculture) and outlines several grafting methods. Other authors in the region would write about grafting in the following years, however, the publications often featured fallacious scion-stock combinations. During the European Dark Ages, Arabic regions were experiencing an Islamic Golden Age of scientific, technological, and cultural advancement. Creating lavishly flourished gardens would be a common form of competition among Islamic leaders at the time. Because the region would receive an influx of foreign ornamentals to decorate these gardens, grafting was used much during this period. = Europe and the United States = Possible deliberate grafts on a sessile oak in Ayrshire, Scotland After the fall of the Roman Empire, grafting survived in the Christian monasteries of Europe until it regained popular appeal during the Renaissance. The invention of the printing press inspired a number of authors to publish books on gardening that included information on grafting. One example, A New Orchard and Garden: Or, the Best Way for Planting, Graffing, and to Make Any Ground Good for a Rich Orchard, Particularly in the North, was written by William Lawson in 1618. While the book contains practical grafting techniques, some even still used today, it suffers from exaggerated claims of scion-stock compatibility typical of this period. While grafting continued to grow in Europe during the eighteenth century, it was considered unnecessary in the United States as the produce from fruit trees was largely used either to make cider or feed hogs. = French Wine Pandemic = Beginning in 1864, and without warning, grapevines across France began to sharply decline. Thanks to the efforts of scientists such as C. V. Riley and J. E. Planchon, the culprit was identified to be phylloxera, an insect that infests the roots of vines and causes fungal infections. Initially, farmers unsuccessfully attempted to contain the pest by removing and burning affected vines. When it was discovered that phylloxera was an invasive species introduced from North America, some suggested importing rootstock from the region as the North American vines were resistant to the pest. Others, opposed to the idea, argued that American rootstocks would imbue the French grapes with an undesirable taste; they instead preferred to inject the soil with expensive pesticides. Ultimately, grafting American rootstock onto French vines became prevalent throughout the region, creating new grafting techniques and machines. American rootstocks had trouble adapting to the high soil pH value of some regions in France so the final solution to the pandemic was to hybridize the American and French variants.

In August 2005 it merged with Leeds Girls' High School to form The Grammar School at Leeds. The two schools physically united in September 2008. The school was founded in 1552 by William Sheafield to provide free, subsidised or fee-paying education to the children of the City of Leeds. Despite 1552 being the traditional date for the foundation of the school, there is some evidence to suggest that the school existed as early as 1341. In 1805, the school was the subject of a ruling by Lord Eldon that set a precedent affecting grammar schools throughout England. History Leeds Grammar School was founded in 1552, following the death of the Reverend William Sheafield in July that year. Sheafield left ¬£14 13s. 4d. in his will to maintain a schoolmaster \\"to teach and instruct freely for ever all such Younge Schollars Youthes and Children as shall come and resort to him from time to time to be taught instructed and informed\\", provided that a school house was built by the town of Leeds. The date for the school's foundation remains in doubt. Records indicate that there was a grammar school in Leeds as early as 1341. The school's first site is thought to have been in The Calls, by the River Aire, near the centre of the city. By about 1579 the school was in the New Chapel building at the head of Headingley Lane, where it remained until 1624. That year John Harrison, a great Leeds benefactor, removed the school \\"to a pleasant Field of his own which he surrounded with a substantial Wall and in the midst of the Quadrangle built the present Fabrick of the school\\". Harrison's school was on North Lane, on the site of the Grand Theatre opposite St John's Church. Through the years, the school grew steadily in numbers and reputation. Harrison's building was added onto in the 1640s by a new library, thanks to the endowment of Godfrey Lawson (Mayor of Leeds, 1669-70). The Lawson Library remains with the school (although it has moved to a number of different physical locations) making it the oldest library in Leeds. It was refurbished in 2007. Towards the end of the 18th century, demand for Latin and Greek was falling, while Leeds was growing as a centre of commerce and industry. In 1791 the trustees proposed to appoint a third master, to teach writing and accounts, and a fourth to teach French and other modern languages. The plan was opposed by the master and usher. With the two sides unable to agree, a suit in the Court of Chancery began in 1795. In 1805, Lord Eldon, the Lord Chancellor, in a ruling that set a precedent for grammar schools across the country, proclaimed, \\"There is no authority for thus changing the nature of the Charity, and filling a School intended for the purpose of teaching Greek and Latin with Scholars learning the German and French languages, mathematics, and anything except Greek and Latin.\\" He offered as a compromise that other subjects might be taught, as long as all boys also learnt the classical languages. On the death of the master in 1815, the trustees appointed one of their number as acting master, and effected the desired changes. Woodhouse Moor site (now part of the University of Leeds) By 1857, Leeds was growing prodigiously during the Industrial Revolution. The city conditions were dirty and Harrison's buildings inadequate for a Victorian education. In 1857 the decision was made by Rev. Alfred Barry (Headmaster) to move the school to new premises next to Woodhouse Moor. The building, in Gothic Revival style, opened in June 1859. The building was designed by Edward Middleton Barry, brother of the headmaster, Rev. Alfred Barry, after whom one of the eight houses was named. At that time the school roll numbered fewer than 100 boys and the buildings were planned for 200. Serious consideration was given in the 1920s to moving the school to Lawnswood - the current site of Leeds University's playing fields. Leeds Grammar School plaque 25 July 2017 The school was in the direct grant scheme in the 1950s to 1970s, and the assisted places scheme in the 1970s to 1990s. Throughout the 20th century the school continued to expand, with the building of a swimming pool, sports hall, theatre, a design and technology department, assembly hall and classroom block. By the 1990s, the roll had risen to over 1,100 boys and the school operated on three separate sites. Despite continuous improvements to accommodate increased numbers and the requirements of a contemporary curriculum, no further development of the facilities was economically viable without great detriment to the education of the pupils. The area of Leeds surrounding the school, Hyde Park, was in decline and the University of Leeds was also seeking to expand and so the decision was taken by the school governors and the university to exchange the Woodhouse Moor, Junior School and Lawnswood premises for a university-owned site in Alwoodley to the north of Leeds. The Woodhouse Moor premises are now occupied by Leeds University Business School. Main entrance to the complex at the Alwoodley Campus In September 1997, at a cost of ¬£18.5 million and after three years construction, Leeds Grammar School opened in Alwoodley Gates. In 1999 a new Headmaster Dr Mark Bailey was appointed. Following the shrinking of Leeds' child population, staff shortages and Leeds Girls' High School's need for more adequate modern buildings the decision was taken to merge with Leeds Girls' High School in 2003. The school passed out of existence on 4 July 2008, although it had been legally dissolved since August 2005. Houses Leeds Grammar School has eight houses named after individuals connected with the school or its formation. This system dates back to 1924, with the original school houses being Clarell, Sheafield, Neville and Thoresby. Currently there are eight houses: *Barry - after Rev. Alfred Barry, PhD, who planned the move of Leeds Grammar School to its site in Woodhouse Moor, which it occupied between 1859 and 1997. *Clarell - after Thomas Clarell, Vicar of Leeds from 1430 to 1469, and founder of the Clarell Chantry, in which was employed William Sheafield as chantry priest. *Ermystead - after William Ermystead, who paid for the construction of the Lady Lane site in the 1590s. *Harrison - after John Harrison, benefactor of Leeds, who built the school its third site on North Street. *Lawson - after Godfrey Lawson, Mayor of Leeds, who endowed to the school the Lawson Library - the oldest library in Leeds. *Nevile - for Sir John Nevile, one of the first trustees of the school. *Sheafield - after William Sheafield, who is traditionally thought of as the founder of the school in 1552, by virtue of the date of signature of his will, which endowed the school. *Thoresby - after Ralph Thoresby, topographer of Leeds and alumnus of the school. There are many competitions throughout the school year, the most notable of these being Sports day and House music. Any house activity, be it a win or a draw, results in the acquiring of House Points. All eight houses compete throughout the year for the coveted Bailey Cup - awarded at the end of the year for the house with the most House Points. Following the merger with Leeds Girls High School four of these houses (Thoresby, Neville, Clarell and Barry) were removed. Four houses have been created from alumnae important to Leeds Girls High School (Eddison, Ford, Lupton and Powell) thereby maintaining the current eight-house system at GSAL. Merger with Leeds Girls' High School The school administration merged with Leeds Girls' High School in August 2005, and the two schools physically merged in September 2008. At that time the Senior School (ages 11-18) and Junior School (ages 7-11) will remain at their present Alwoodley Site. The Infant School will move to the former LGHS site at Headingley alongside a new Nursery School. The merged school will be called The Grammar School at Leeds. The main Senior School site of Leeds Girls' High School will be sold to a private developer. Classes for girls and boys between the ages of 11 and 16 will remain segregated, but all extracurricular activities will be mixed. The merger of the two schools has caused some controversy due to the expected increase in traffic levels at the Alwoodley site.Ban The School Run Cars Yorkshire Evening Post, June 2006 Leodiensian Leodiensian is the name given to the school magazine of Leeds Grammar School; the first edition was published in October 1827, and it became a regular annual publication from 1882, making it one of the longest-running school publications. The name Leodiensian is derived from the Latin name for Leeds, Ledesia (and later Leodis), and in an adjectival form can be seen in the School Song, in the phrase \\"Leodenses cuncti\\". Old Leodiensian A former pupil of Leeds Grammar School is described as an Old Leodiensian.

Ropes Crossing is located west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Blacktown and is part of the Greater Western Sydney region. History Ropes Crossing was originally part of the suburb of St Marys. The suburb is named as a crossing of Ropes Creek, a watercourse which is approximately long rising near Devils Back Tunnel and flowing north into South Creek. The creek itself was named for Anthony Rope, a First Fleet convict who it is assumed was granted land fronting the creek. The area was the site of a World War 2 munitions area, now formerly known as Australian Defence Industries or (ADI). The area had its own railway line which was electrified in 1957. When the line first opened on 1 May 1942, it only ran from St Marys to Dunheved at a distance of 50.350 rail kilometres from Central railway station and on 29 June 1942 the line opened from Dunheved to Ropes Creek at 53.010 rail kilometres from Sydney. When electrification was extended on the western line in the late 1950s a new station was built and called Cochrane and was located 52.480 rail kilometres from Sydney. The station opened on 2 September 1957. The line was mainly munitions traffic with morning and afternoon passenger services for munitions workers. Towards the end of the line being open, the only traffic seen on the line was the occasional scrap metal trains that visited Sims Metal which was located off the Up line just south of Dunheved. Working of these trains meant that the trains worked to Dunheved where the locomotive ran around the train and proceeded back to the Sims Metal Siding to shunt loaded cars in and empties out as required.

It aired in the United States on the Sci Fi Channel on November 4, 2007. It is the 6th film in the Maneater Series produced under an agreement with Sci Fi. Filmed in Thailand, the film revolves around the efforts of the owner of a crocodile-farm, an animal welfare agent, and a hunter trying to kill a large saltwater crocodile that has begun killing people in the area. Plot The film begins with two dynamite fisherman working only to disturb a large saltwater crocodile which attacks, mutilates, and kills them both. Jack McQuade (Peter Tuinstra) runs a crocodile farm in Thailand with the help of his nephew Theo (Scott Hazell) and Jack's sister (and Theo's mother) Allison (Elizabeth Healey). Jack is being constantly harassed by a new neighboring resort owned by the Konsong brothers. They want to get Jack shut down because they have buildings on the land and want to steal the rest. The Konsong brothers set animal welfare, bill collectors, and tax collectors on the farm. As animal welfare investigator Evelyn Namwong (Sherry Phungprasert) refuses to shut down the farm, having found only minor violations, she is fired. After two teenagers are eaten by a crocodile, the Konsongs send goons to break in and release three of the farm's crocodiles. Jack's crocodiles are blamed and he gets orders to shut down until further notice. The beast that killed the teens reappears and eats a young boy near the docks. Its filmed by a tourist nearby and identified as a 20-foot salt water crocodile. Being much much larger and of a different species than Jack's, his farm's name is cleared and he is able to reopen. With the beast continuing to snack on the local population, Jack and Evelyn run into Hawkins (Michael Madsen), a man who has been hunting it for months to get revenge for its many victims. They join forces to find and kill the beast. While they are talking, they hear gunfire and two hunters claiming to have killed the beast which is actually one of Jack's escaped crocs. They quickly rush over, only to see the real beast kill one of the hunters. While they hunt the beast, the Konsongs send someone to kill Allison, who paid his taxes and other bills to help him out. The goon tries to run her down, but misses. He leaves behind his cell phone which links him back to Andy Konsong. Andy heads home to warn his brother that their plot has been uncovered, only to find pieces of him floating in a bloodied pool. The beast was in the pool when he was swimming and killed him. Panicked, Andy calls 911, but then gets sick to his stomach. While he's throwing up in the pool, the beast emerges and kills him. When Evelyn, Jack, Hawkins, and the crocodile farm manager go looking for the beast's pit, Allison and Theo follow in a small boat. The beast appears and snatches Allison from the boat, much to Theo's horror. Jack and the rest of the team continue searching for the pit underwater while Hawkins and Theo go to search on land. They find the pit and, to their relief, Allison, who is unconscious but still alive. She wakes up to find the beast with its jaws right in front of her head, but it leaves when it hears Jack calling for her. It comes up behind Jack, gets a hold of his foot, and drags him underwater. As it's going down, Hawkins and Theo shoot at it, with Hawkins managing to shoot it in the brain. It dies with Jack's foot still firmly clamped in its mouth and him underwater. Stuck too high to get down to help, Hawkins advises Allison to cut off Jack's leg since they can't get the beast's mouth open. Instead, the park manager uses a bang stick to blast open its mouth and Jack gets to keep his leg. Production In October 2006, RHI Entertainment made a deal with the Sci Fi Channel to produce a series of ten made-for-television natural horror films to air on the network the following year. Dubbed the \\"Maneater\\" series by RHI Entertainment, Croc was the fourth film released. Although the agreement called for the films to premiere on SciFi, the first six films in the series actually premiered in Canada on the video on demand channel Movie Central on Demand in July 2007 due to a pre-licensing agreement. Distribution Croc premiered in the United States on the SCI FI channel on November 4, 2007 for the channel's Saturday Night \\"Movie of the Week\\" premiere. Genius Products released the film to Region 1 DVD on February 5, 2008. The film was re-released on August 19, 2008 as part of the second volume of the \\"Maneater Series Collection\\" sets. The volume also included Eye of the Beast and Grizzly Rage, the fifth and sixth films in the series, respectively. In 2008, RHI Entertainment released the film to the iTunes store for downloading.

The full legislative framework of the arms control regime is defined by the Act in conjunction with: *The Arms (Restricted Weapons and Specially Dangerous Airguns) Order 1984 *The Arms Regulations 1992 The act grants the police considerable discretion in the administration of the arms control regime. Police policy in respect of the arms regime is documented in their Arms Manual 2002.

The inquiry was conducted contemporaneously with the official inquiries into the Dunblane massacre in Scotland and the Port Arthur massacre in Australia. The report made 28 broad recommendation statements, with some statements having up to 5 detailed recommendations. Among other things, the report recommended that the 1983 Act be completely rewritten in plain English, that firearms licensing be managed by an independent Firearms Authority, rather than Police, and that limits be placed on the number of firearms a person could own and that licences be specific to only those firearms that were registered against the licence. =2016 Select committee Inquiry= In March 2016, Parliament's Law and Order Select Committee announced an Inquiry into issues relating to the illegal possession of firearms in New Zealand. In its final report the committee made 20 recommendations, though the government of the day only accepted 7, Parliament was unable to pass the proposed legislation before the 2017 general election intervened and the bill lapsed because it was not supported by the new government. =Arms (Prohibited Firearms, Magazines, and Parts) Amendment Act= In response to the Christchurch mosque shootings, the act was amended to ban semi-automatic firearms, magazines, and parts that can be used to assemble prohibited firearms via the Arms (Prohibited Firearms, Magazines, and Parts) Amendment Act 2019, with the support of all parties represented in parliament except the opposition ACT Party.

Appling was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1851) at Wilmington, California, by the Consolidated Steel Corporation; launched on 9 April 1944; sponsored by famed moving picture actress, Claudette Colbert; and simultaneously acquired by the Navy and placed in commission on 22 August 1944, Lieutenant Commander Alexander Lunde Stuart in command. Operational history =World War II= Following shakedown training off the California coast, Appling sailed for Finschhafen, New Guinea, on 17 October. She was forced to stop at Purvis Bay, Florida Island, for engine repairs, but finally reached Finschhafen on 14 November. The ship then carried out training exercises in Humboldt Bay. Invasion of Luzon On 25 December, the ship embarked troops of the 6th Army at Hollandia. Appling sortied for the Philippines on 3 January 1945 with Task Group 77.9, a part of the Luzon invasion force. She anchored in the Lingayen Gulf transport area on 11 January and began discharging troops east of San Fabian. Later that evening, the transport joined other ships in splashing an enemy aircraft 2,000 yards off her starboard quarter. The next day, she retired to Leyte Gulf. Invasion of Okinawa During the next two months, the ship remained in the waters of Leyte Gulf carrying out training exercises. Late in March, she took on cargo and personnel earmarked for Operation \\"Iceberg,\\" the assault on the Ryukyus. On 27 March, the ship left with Transport Squadron (TransRon) 13 of the Southern Assault Force, bound for Okinawa. Appling arrived off that island early on 1 April and, at 0605, began lowering her boats, which were used by troops from other vessels. Appling debarked her own troops from 3 to 7 April and then retired to Kerama Retto. She served as a receiving ship there until the 12th, when she returned to Okinawa. On the 14th, the ship got underway for Hawaii. Following a brief stop at Saipan, Appling reached Pearl Harbor on 2 May and, the next day, sailed for the United States. The ship arrived at San Pedro, California, on the 10th, and began voyage repairs. On 7 June, she proceeded to San Diego, California, for refresher training. The ship set sail on 16 June for Majuro Atoll, Marshall Islands, and continued on to Guam in mid-July. She then reversed her course and returned to the west coast. Appling reached San Francisco on 29 July. =After hostilities= After almost a month of repairs, during which the hostilities ended, Appling got underway on 28 August and headed via Eniwetok for the Marianas. Following a stop at Guam, she moved to Saipan where she took on elements of the 2nd Marine Division scheduled for occupation duties in Japan. On 23 September, Appling arrived at Nagasaki in company with other units of TransRon 12. Five days later, the ship sailed to the Philippines and carried troops from Subic Bay and Manila to Sasebo, Japan. Appling left Sasebo on 19 October and set a course back to the United States carrying homecoming veterans. The transport arrived at Portland, Oregon on 27 November for upkeep. Appling sailed back to the Philippines in early January 1946 to carry more troops home to the United States. The ship left Philippine waters on 4 February and transited to Pearl Harbor. =Operation Crossroads= Appling was next assigned to the target fleet for Operation Crossroads, tests at Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands to determine the effects of atomic bomb explosions upon ships. Appling arrived at Bikini on 2 June and operated in the area of that atoll through 15 August, but was never utilized as a target. After touching at Pearl Harbor on the 15th, the ship continued on to the west coast for a series of radiological clearance tests held at San Francisco and San Pedro, California. She touched at Port Hueneme, California, on 26 September, to take on cargo for transportation to Pearl Harbor. However, before the ship was loaded, she was ordered to proceed to the east coast for deactivation. =Decommission= Appling transited the Panama Canal on 22 November and arrived in Norfolk, Virginia, on 30 November. She was decommissioned on 20 December 1946 at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, Virginia. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 4 April 1947, and the ship was transferred to the Maritime Commission on 31 March 1948. The ship was laid up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet until 9 September 1954, when she was consigned to the Arrow Steamship Company. She was returned to the National Defense Reserve Fleet on 12 December 1954 and was berthed in the James River. The ship was ultimately sold for scrapping. =Decorations= Appling earned two battle stars for her World War II service.

It was aired on BBC Two on 12 November 2007. It is linked, by the central character of Joe, to another Poliakoff drama, Joe's Palace, which was first aired on 4 November 2007. Overview The drama saw a repeat of Danny Lee Wynter's caretaker character of Joe, who encounters former socialite Mary (played by Maggie Smith in the present and Ruth Wilson in her youth) when she visits the house featured in Joe's Palace. We see flashbacks to her past links with the house. This present-day meeting between Joe and Mary overlaps with the events of Joe's Palace.  Plot  We first meet the character of Mary as an old woman (Maggie Smith) in the present. The \\"old\\" Mary, a former journalist and socialite, arrives at the house of Elliot Graham's late father. Joe (Danny Lee Wynter), the caretaker of the house, takes pity on her and invites her in. She begins to recount to Joe the significance of the house to her. Moving from room to room, she tells Joe of the 1950s high society soirees she was invited to in the house. She recalls how Mr Graham's soirees were attended by the great and the good ‚Äì the aristocracy, the nouveaux riche, industrialists, newspaper barons, editors, actors and directors. She tells Joe that she has been haunted by the memory of a sinister man named Greville White (David Walliams) whom she met one evening in the house. Greville White turns out to be a social climber whose influence reached into high society. Mary recalls that he was supremely charming but utterly evil. We see Greville and the \\"young\\" Mary (Ruth Wilson) in Mr Graham's cellar selecting fine wines for a salad that he has prepared. In the cellar, Greville tells Mary of dark secrets involving members of the British Establishment who are enjoying Mr Graham's soiree in the rooms above them. The secrets involve child abuse, sexual perversion, anti-semitism and racism amongst the great and the good. He feigns friendship with Mary but she rejects him because of his malevolence. Greville retaliates by using his influence over the newspaper proprietors to deny her work in Britain. The audience encounters subsequent meetings between the two in the 1950s and 1960s at Mr Graham's soirees and other social events. We see the sinister destruction of Mary's life as she becomes preoccupied by Greville's influence on her and her slide into despair and alcoholism. The end of the drama sees Greville re- appear in Kensington Gardens in the present. Mary is now an old woman but the sinister Greville has not aged since they first met in the 1950s.

U.S. Highway 53, U.S. Highway 169, State Highway 37 (MN 37), and State Highway 135 (MN 135) are four of the main routes in the Quad Cities. History The Quad Cities, all founded in the 1890s and early 1900s, owe their existence mainly to the mining industry that came to the area around that time. Their prosperity grew as the mines grew. Unfortunately, many of the mines shut down during the Great Depression and didn't resume full work until World War II. This was approximately the peak point for the industry in the area. Slowly the cities, though increasing in area, decreased in population. Populations According to the 2000 census, the Quad Cities have a population of 17,868. Virginia has 9,157 residents. Eveleth has 3,865 residents; Mountain Iron has 2,999 residents; and Gilbert has 1,847 residents. Economy and industry The mining industry, long lasting since the early 1900s, is declining in the area. The area focuses a lot on tourism and healthcare. Things to do Virginia and the surrounding cities have several things for public enjoyment, from swimming to shopping. Various lakes and pits across the range make swimming and boating very accessible. There is bound to be a hiking, biking, or four wheeling trail wherever you are on the Iron Range. For the winter months, there are several snowmobiling trails around the area with easy access and ice rinks all over the cities. For those that crave an indoor atmosphere, there is the YMCA in Mountain Iron, for many recreational purposes. For shoppers, there is the Thunderbird Mall in Virginia, downtown businesses in each city, and in late 2014 a Walmart Super Center opened near the Holiday Inn Express & Suites in Mountain Iron.

All sons of the family attended Santa Clara College and to this day there is an Orella Prize given at that university to the student with highest grades in the sciences. When the Orellas purchased the adobes, they became their country residence. One of the buildings served as schoolhouse to their children, and a tutor was hired to live on the ranch. Bruno's daughter, Elena Orella Covarrubias, inherited the adobes and remodeled them in the 1930s in Spanish Revival style.

He is a sociology professor at the University of Cambridge and a fellow of Jesus College.Jesus College website Education Thompson gained his first degree in philosophy, sociology and social anthropology at Keele University in 1975. His PhD was from the University of Cambridge, obtained in 1979. Work Thompson has studied the influence of the media in the formation of modern societies, a subject on which he is one of the few social theorists to focus. One of the key themes of his work is the role of the media in the transformation of space and time in social life, and the creation of new forms of action and interaction beyond temporal and spatial frameworks. Influenced strongly by hermeneutics, he studies communication and its uses, and links it closely with social context. Other key concepts are the transformation of visibility, the media and tradition, and identity and the symbolic project. His book Ideology and Modern Culture is a study of what the theory of ideology entails in modern society. William Outhwaite of the University of Sussex dubs it \\"a pathbreaking work which will undoubtedly become one of the fundamental texts in the theory of ideology.\\"Quoted on blurb, Ideology and Modern Culture. Thompson's essay \\"The New Visibility\\" is employed as the basis for the study of media at Rhodes University, while his tome Political Scandal: Power and Visibility in the Media Age has been described by Amy Binder of Clemson University as \\"excellent\\".Binder: Review. His work stands out for its recognition of the importance of the nature and development of mass communication. =Questioning 'mass communication' and its meaning= In Thompson's The Media and Modernity, he breaks down the term mass communication and questions whether it is applicable to today's current media environment. He firstly highlights the use of the word 'mass' and claims that most of the media today are not produced for the masses, rather they are produced for niche markets.Thompson: The Media and Modernity, p. 13. \\"The term 'mass' is especially misleading. It conjures up the image of a vast audience comprising many thousands, even millions of individuals. This may be an accurate image in the case of some media products, such as the most popular modern-day newspapers, films and television programmes; but it is hardly an accurate representation of the circumstance of most media products, past or present.\\"(Thompson, 1995, p13) He also criticises use of the word 'mass' in how it categorises audiences into \\"undifferentiated individuals\\"(Thompson, 1995, p13). Thompson then proceeds to talk about the use of the word 'communication' and how mass communication is often \\"overwhelmingly one-way.\\"(Thompson, 1995, p14) He contrasts this with face to face communication and the two-way process that takes place when people talk to each other. Thompson is of the belief that in the age of digital technology there are more suitable terms that can be used including \\"'mediated communication' or more simply, 'the media' which are less laden with misleading assumptions.\\"(Thompson, 1995, p15) Thompson, in The Media and ModernityThompson, John (1999) \\"The Media and Modernity\\" in Hugh Mackay and Tim O'Sullivan (eds) The Media Reader: Continuity and Transformation, Sage, London offers five key characteristics to explain the term mass communication. Thompson's first characteristic is the technical and institutional means of production and diffusion, meaning that the \\"development of mass communication is inseparable from the development of the media industries\\". Secondly, Thompson highlights what he labels commodification of symbolic forms which can be subjected into two forms of valorisation; information having economic value and information having symbolic value. Thirdly, Thompson proposes that mass communication institutes a structured break between the production of symbolic forms and their reception, meaning that the content is not produced at the same place and time as when the audience receives it. Thompson further goes on to highlight some implications with this characteristic, suggesting that due to this structured break media producers are deprived of the viewers reactions which alters the feedback they are given. Furthermore media producers are unable to obtain the audiences interpretation of their message thus making the audience and the producers unequal partners in the process of symbolic exchange. Thompson suggests that although symbols are not inherently ideological they can be readily utilised as a way of subtly promoting or maintaining ideologies.Acevedo et all. 2010. 'A Content Analysis of the Roles Portrayed by Women in Commercials: 1973 ‚Äì 2008', Revista Brasileira de Marketing Vol. 9. Universidade Nove de Julho, Sao Paulo. The fourth characteristic highlighted by Thompson is that mass communication extends the availability of symbolic forms in space and time, this examines the different contexts in which the message is produced and received. Which leads into Thompson's fifth characteristic of mass communication, which involves the public circulation of symbolic forms, this characteristic examines the availability and access of media forms to a plurality of media recipients and the blurring of the private and public domains. =Critical hermeneutics= Thompson's theoretical approach \\"seeks to sketch the contours of a critical and rationally justified theory for the interpretation of action\\".Thompson, J., Critical Hermeneutics: Paul Ricoeur and J√ºrgen Habermas, Cambridge University Press, 1981, p. 216. He calls his approach to sociological theory \\"critical hermeneutics.\\" =Publishing industry= Thompson's recent work focuses particularly on the publishing industry. Books in the Digital Age: The Transformation of Academic and Higher Education Publishing in Britain and the United States (Polity, 2005) presents an analysis of higher education publishing from 1980 to 2005. Much of the analysis is based on industry interviews made on condition of anonymity. His Merchants of Culture (Polity, 2009) is more extensive covering the entire publishing and bookselling industry from the 1960s to the present. In an interview he suggests that the challenge presented to the traditional physical book by ebooks is overstated.Brooklyn Rail In Conversation John B.

It is located on the northern (left) bank of the Yangtze River, and is the southernmost part of Taizhou City, bordering Nantong to the northeast, Suzhou to the southeast, Wuxi to the south, Changzhou to the southwest, and Zhenjiang to the west. The area of Jingjiang is 655.6 square kilometres and the population was 684,360 at the 2010 census.  History  The terrain of Jingjiang nowadays was originated as a shoal in the Yangtze River, which was known Matuosha in the ancient China. As the shoal had been extended, it was separated from then Jiangyin county to found a new county in 1471. As being looted by the Wokou for several time, it is designated Jiangjiang (means \\"pacifying the Yangzte River\\"). The county under the administration of the prefecture-level city of Yangzhou originally, was converted to a county-level city in 1993, then was transferred to the Taizhou in 1996. Geography The Yangzte had split into the north and the south distributaries at Jingjiang, but the city merged into the north bank later than the 1610s inasmuch as the north distributary was filled in by continued deposition. Transportation The city is part of the Yangtze River Delta region and has one river crossing. The Jiangyin Suspension Bridge, which carries the G2 Beijing‚ÄìShanghai Expressway to Jiangyin, is one of the longest suspension bridges in the world. The G40 Shanghai‚ÄìXi'an Expressway to Nanjing and Shanghai also passes through the city. Economy Traditionally, the city has been noted for its core manufacturing industries in electronics, auto parts, biochemicals, textiles and machinery. Emerging industries include shipbuilding and logistics (transport). Seven major local shipyards, including one of China's largest private shipyards New Century Shipyard and its subsidiary New Time Shipyard; New Yangtze Shipyard, which went public in Singapore in 2007 and it was the first ever China's private shipyard listed on overseas stock exchange. Administrative divisions The city consists of eight towns and one sub-district: * Jingcheng () * Binjiang () * Xinqiao () * Dongxing () * Xieqiao () * Xilai () * Jishi () * Gushan () * Shengci () * Maqiao () In addition the city has a provincial level economic development zone (Jingjiang Economic Development Zone).

Kolyma) was a Polish-born Russian Imperial paleontologist, osteologist, geologist, geographer and explorer of Siberia. He was exiled to Transbaikalia for participating in the January Uprising of 1863. A self-taught scientist, he eventually received three gold medals from the Russian Geographical Society, and his name was given to a settlement, two mountain ranges, several peaks and other sites. He authored the first map of Lake Baikal. Biography Son of Dominik and Xenia Czerski, members of the Polish nobility, he was born in the then Vitebsk Governorate of the Russian Empire (now in Vitebsk Region, Belarus). At the age of 18, as a high-school student of the Instytut Szlachecki (Noble Institute) in Vilnius, he took part in the January Uprising (1863‚Äì1864). He was captured and taken prisoner on 28 April 1863, and then stripped of his noble status, his lands confiscated and repossessed by another family member loyal to the Russian government. Czerski was then forcibly conscripted into the Russian Army and sentenced to be exiled to Siberia in Blagoveshchensk near the Amur River. He never made it to Blagoveshchensk, but was detached instead to serve in a formation near Omsk. During this time he was befriended by several Poles living in exile in the Omsk region, including: Marczewski and Kwiatkowski, as well as a Russian geographer, Grigory Nikolayevich Potanin. Under their influence, he became interested in the natural history of the region. They provided him with literature on Siberia and the natural sciences, so that during his free time he was able to educate himself and carry out his first research. After release from the army in 1869, he was not given permission to return home, and became a political exile. He was refused entry to university; his publications and his first attempt to join the Russian Geographical Society were also rejected. For the next two years he was forced to work as a teacher in Omsk, having been denied the right to leave the area. Chersky expeditions in Syberia In 1871 he received permission to move to Irkutsk where he met other Polish exiles, turned scholars, Aleksander Czekanowski and Benedykt Dybowski. With their help, Czekanowski is considered his mentor, he was able to join the Russian Geographical Society. He secured a job at a local museum and took part in several expeditions, gaining both experience and prominence. He took part in expeditions to the Sayan Mountains, Irkut River Valley and the Lower Tunguska River. During four expeditions (1877‚Äì1881) Czerski explored the valley of the Selenga river and published a study on Lake Baikal, explaining the origin of the lake and presenting the geological structure of East Siberia. Perhaps the most notable of these expeditions was to study of the geological structure of the coast of Lake Baikal. The result was the first geological map of that coast, for which Czerski was awarded a gold medal by the Russian Academy of Sciences. He received three medals in total during his career. He received an international award from the University of Bologna, Italy. Czerski later put forward the idea for the development of topographic reliefs (1878) and produced one of the first analyses of the tectonics of central Asia (1886) and pioneered geomorphological evolution theory. In 1878 he married Marfa Pavlovna Ivanova, a native of Siberia. In 1883 he was pardoned by the Russian government, and later regained his nobility status. He lived in Irkutsk until 1886, working in the east-Siberian section of the Russian Geographical Society. In 1886, he fell ill with progressive tuberculosis and partial paralysis. He was allowed to move to Saint Petersburg, where he joined the St Petersburg Science Academy. Despite his failing health he took time during his travel from Irkutsk to Petersburg to carefully document the geological details along the way. During this period he was appointed head of an expedition to explore the Yana, Indigirka and Kolyma river basins. He collected and catalogued over 2,500 ancient bones, publishing a large work on Quaternary Period mammals in 1888, followed by an even larger work on Siberian mammal fossils in 1891. He died on 25 June 1892 during an expedition to the Kolyma, Yana and Indigirka Rivers. He was buried near the Omolon River. Named after Czerski Several landmarks in Siberia were named in his honour, including: * the Chersky Mountain Range * the Chersky (settlement) in the Sakha Republic * the mountain range in Chita Oblast, the Chersky Mountain - highest peak (2572 m) of the Baikal Range * the Chersky Peak (2090 m) - one of the highest peaks of the Khamar-Daban Range * the Chersky Pass in the same mountains * the Chersky Stone (728 m) - a peak nearby in Listvyanka * the Chersky Valley and Chersky Plateau in the Sayan Mountains * a waterfall near the Baikal Lake, * an inactive volcano in the Tunkinsk Valley * Chersky's Place - an archeological site near Irkutsk where ancient human remains were discovered In 2016, after being acquired by Gazprom, the pipe-layer \\"Jascon 18\\" was renamed \\"\\". Three species of anomal fossis were named after him: Osteolepis tscherskii (fish), Leperditia czerskii (crustacean) and Polyptchites tscherskii](ammonite) as well as numerous extant species, including cyprinid fish Sarcocheilichthys czerskii, sculpin Cottus czerskii, char Salvelinus czerskii, Baikal endemic amphipod Eulimnogammarus czerskii and bumblebee Bombus czerskii. The Irkutsk-based Jan Czerski Belarussian Culture Society, an organization of the Belarusian minority in Russia is named after Jan Czerski. A street in Vilnius, Lithuania, is named after Jan Czerski, Jonas ƒåerskis. Works The full list of Czerski's works contains 97 positions.

The premiere was given by the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra on 14 March, 1963 under the conductor Hugo Rignold. Its BBC Proms premiere was given by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra on 21 August, 1967 under the conductor Charles Groves. The US premiere was given by the Oklahoma City Symphony Orchestra on 8 December, 1974 under its then Music Director, Ainslee Cox. The orchestration is fairly standard, except Simpson required all three flutes to double on piccolos. The work lasts about 31 minutes in performance (both recorded performances time in at a few seconds under that figure) and is in two movements: *Allegro ma non troppo *Adagio - Presto In two movements, this Symphony conflicts C major and B-flat. The first movement is a dissonant, craggy sonata-allegro in B flat which strays into the orbit of C. The model of this movement has some parallels with the first movement of Symphony No. 9 by Ludwig van Beethoven, but it is still highly individual. Simpson described the second movement as 'a huge composed accelerando, but with the dynamics repressed'. It is really a slow movement and finale, and the tempo is always increasing. The movement takes a good while to climax. There is a sort of scherzo section in the middle, and the music is always developing, with motives evolving and increasing in familiarity. The movement eventually climaxes, and at this point a great fortissimo blaze on the dominant seventh of C major is played from the orchestra. The climax subsides to a quiet close in C major (the key which eventually prevailed), although B flat can still be heard. Discography The symphony was first recorded on 5 June 1970 by the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Jascha Horenstein for the Unicorn (later Unicorn-Kanchana) label and was issued on LP in September 1970. It was reissued on CD, coupled with Simpson's Clarinet Quintet, in the 'Unicorn-Kanchana Souvenir Series' in June 1990. The recording was released again on the NMC label in 2006.
