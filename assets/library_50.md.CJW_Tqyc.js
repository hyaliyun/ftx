It was established in 1976 as a part of The Banff Centre in Banff National Park.  History and Mission  Walter J. Phillips was a printmaker and painter, from the 1930s to the 1950s, who played a seminal role in the development of the visual arts program in The Banff School of Fine Arts. The Walter Phillips Gallery was formally established at Banff Centre on August 3, 1976 with the mandate to collect and exhibit Canadian and International contemporary art.https://albertaonrecord.ca/walter-phillips-gallery After its conception, it quickly evolved into a small but dynamic gallery and became known for a contemporary art program that championed curatorial innovation with a commitment to emerging forms of art including video and performance. For contemporary artists, particularly those engaged in alternative forms of practice, the WPG remains an essential and principal site where art is presented to an audience for critical reception. In an effort to ensure a broad and balanced representation of the different areas of research at the Centre, the Gallery exhibits and collects: painting, drawing, printmaking, sculpture, ceramics, textiles, photography and new media-based works. The Gallery's substantial collection of video art is housed in the Paul D. Fleck Library at The Banff Centre and is available for public viewing. The Walter Phillips Gallery operates under the jurisdiction of the Visual Arts Department at The Banff Centre. The Gallery's publication program presents new ideas for understanding the social, historical, political and aesthetic realms in which many of today's artworks exist. Most of these publications are published as Walter Phillips Gallery Editions by The Banff Centre Press. Recent publications include: Frances Stark: My Best Thing, essay by Mark Godfrey (2012); Anthony Burnham: Even Space Does Not Repeat, essays by Diana Nemiroff, Marie-√àve Charron, and Naomi Potter (2011); Ron Terada: Who I Think I Am, essays by Cliff Lauson, Anne Low, and Tom McDonough (2010); Silke Otto-Knapp: Present time exercise essays by Suzanne Cotter, Jan Verwoert, and Catherine Wood (2009); and The World Upside Down edited by Richard William Hill (2008). Recent Exhibitions * An Ever Changing Meaning - February 2 ‚Äì April 7, 2013 - Aur√©lien Froment, Alexis Guillier, Louise Herv√© & Chlo√© Maillet, and Benjamin Seror - Curated by Fran√ßois Aubart - An Ever Changing Meaning brings together five artists who share an interest in the way historical facts, records, and anecdotes can be reshaped in a variety of contexts. Works in video, sculpture, and performance reconsider a broad range of references, from histories of the moving image, science and architecture. Borrowing the tools of the historian or the authority of the expert, the artists have the potential to willfully act as undisciplined practitioners within and across multiple disciplines. * Modest Livelihood - August 3 ‚Äì November 18, 2012 - Brian Jungen and Duane Linklater - Presented in collaboration with dOCUMENTA (13), the film Modest Livelihood (2012) enacts self-determination and the use of native land as its central concerns. Jungen, DaneZaa, is recognized internationally primarily as a sculptor; while Linklater, Omask√™ko Cree, works with moving image and performance. * BigBoxGreenScreenRefrigeratorActions - April 28 ‚Äì July 15, 2012 - Mark Leckey - For his first solo exhibition at a public gallery in Western Canada, UK-based artist and Turner Prize winner Mark Leckey presents two recent works: GreenScreenRefrigeratorAction (2010) and BigBoxNaturalAction (2012). Leckey's multi-disciplinary practice includes sculpture, performance, print-making, sound, and moving image. * Kill The Workers! - January 21 ‚Äì April 8, 2012 - Janice Kerbel - Janice Kerbel's recent work Kill the Workers! continues the London-based artist's engagement with codified language and the elements of theatrical composition. A rigged system of theatrical lights is used to portray the ambitions of a lone spotlight attempting to achieve a state of \\"open white.\\" Dramaturgy and narrative progression are alluded to through changes in beam intensity, colour, pattern and direction. With these cues, the lights become both the characters and mechanics of the composition, sharing the roles of staging and performing. * My Best Thing - September 24 ‚Äì December 11, 2011 - Frances Stark - Frances Stark's highly compelling animated video My Best Thing premiered at this year's Venice Biennale to widespread critical acclaim. Using free text-to- speech online animation software, Stark employs Playmobil-like avatars to chronicle the dialogic episodes of random video chat that are at once philosophical and absurdly funny. The story of these virtual encounters examines the shared space of sexual attraction, the creative process, and technological mediation. * The Serving Library - July 10 ‚Äì September 4, 2011 - Dexter Sinister - This summer, Walter Phillips Gallery at The Banff Centre will present the most fully realized version of The Serving Library by Dexter Sinister (David Reinfurt and Stuart Bailey). In this incarnation of the project, the travelling Library, a specific set of books and a collection of corollary artifacts, will serve as the focal point for the residency program From the Toolbox of a Serving Library, in which the books and artifacts will be put to use, specifically towards a reconsideration of the Bauhaus foundation course. * A Journey That Wasn't - April 16 ‚Äì June 19, 2011 - Pierre Huyghe - In the video installation A Journey That Wasn't, internationally renowned French artist Pierre Huyghe transports viewers from his Antarctic expedition to an elaborate re-enactment of that voyage in Central Park, New York, as he searches for an elusive albino creature rumoured to live on an uncharted polar island. Part nature documentary, part sci-fi movie, and part musical, the film shifts between scenes of breathtaking wilderness and those of the orchestrated spectacle, leaving it up to us to decide what to believe. * Even Space Does Not Repeat - January 15 ‚Äì March 27, 2011 - Anthony Burnham - In Even Space Does Not Repeat, Anthony Burnham's first solo exhibition in Western Canada, he presents a series of new paintings that develops the artist's study of replication and authenticity. Burnham's paintings are documents of experimental sculpture and actions that he transforms, through various forms of representation, into working sketches. These final paintings represent the refined moments and precise details in a measured practice of deconstruction and construction. * God's Dice - November 13 ‚Äì December 12, 2010 - Geoffrey Farmer - God's Dice is a project by Vancouver-based artist Geoffrey Farmer that inverts the typical exhibition format by foregrounding performativity, theatricality, change, and evolution. Reconsidering the supposed neutrality of the gallery space where construction, creative decision, and artistic and curatorial labour are all but invisible, Farmer brings to light an evolving process of creation and experimentation. * Popular Unrest] - August 14 ‚Äì October 24, 2010 - Melanie Gilligan - Walter Phillips Gallery presents the North American premiere of London-based artist Melanie Gilligan's newest film project Popular Unrest. A multi-part fictional narrative, Popular Unrest questions the political subjectivity today within the transforming political landscape resulting from the global economic crisis. Rather than take a documentary approach to its subject matter, the film presents surreal, satirical, and disturbing narratives based on the state of politics and the public realm. * Who I Think I Am] - May 15 ‚Äì July 25, 2010 - Ron Terada - Inspired by the memoirs of troubled American painter and conceptual artist Jack Goldstein, Ron Terada's new language-based paintings Jack (2010) narrate a chapter in the life of Goldstein, who met with an untimely death in 2003. Terada's appropriation continues in Soundtrack for an Exhibition (2010), the latest in an ongoing series of homemade playlists, in this case made especially to accompany the Walter Phillips Gallery presentation. Both are a foil for the Vancouver-based artist's exploration of contemporary artistic practice and identity. * The End] - January 30 ‚Äì April 18, 2010 - Ragnar Kjartansson - Shot in the Rocky Mountains, The End, a highly compelling video installation, depicts two musicians ‚Äî artist Ragnar Kjartansson and his collaborator Dav√≠√∞ √û√≥r J√≥nsson ‚Äî playing folk/country meets experimental music in a frigid, lonely place. Both characters are dressed as northern, Davy Crockett-type frontiersmen, an extreme example of a stereotype that persists and contributes to the countless fictions projected upon the western landscape.

It was mostly replaced by the Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) on January 1, 2013.https://www.uspto.gov/patents-application-process/patent- search/classification-standards-and-development Plant and design patents are still classified solely within USPC at the USPTO. As of December 2018, patents at the USPTO are still routed to their appropriate business and art units by their USPC, even though it is no longer assigned directly to the patents themselves.  Overview  There are over 400 classes in the U.S. Patent Classification System, each having a title descriptive of its subject matter and each being identified by a class number. Each class is subdivided into a number of subclasses. Each subclass bears a descriptive title and is identified by a subclass number. The subclass number may be an integral number or may contain a decimal portion and/or alpha characters. A complete identification of a subclass requires both the class and subclass number and any alpha or decimal designations; e.g., 417/161.1A identifies Class 417, Subclass 161.1A. The Manual of Classification (\\"MOC\\") contains ordered arrangements of the class and subclass titles, referred to as class schedules. These titles are necessarily brief, although they are intended to be as suggestive as possible of subject matter included. Therefore, it is best not to depend exclusively upon titles to delineate the subject matter encompassed by a class or subclass. Reference to respective definitions and notes is essential. If a search is to be expeditious, accurate, and complete, the Manual of Classification should be used only as a key to the class or subclass definition and appended notes. The Manual of Classification has the following parts: # A list of classes revised in the most recent revision to the Manual and the reason for the revision to each class. # A list of the contents of the Manual showing the current page date for each class and the year in which the class was originally established. # Overview of the classification system. # A hierarchical arrangement of class titles organized into four main groups by related subject matter. This hierarchy is to be used to determine document placement only as a last resort, i.e., when none of the other classification criteria, such as comprehensiveness, etc., allow placement. This part also includes an exact hierarchical listing of the synthetic resin and chemical compound classes. # A list, in numerical order, by art unit indicating the classification(s) assigned to each. # A list of classifications in numerical order by class number giving the class title, the art unit to which the art is assigned, and the examiner search room in which the art can be found. # A list of classes in alphabetical order by class title with associated class numbers. # The class schedule for PLANTS. # Class schedules for utility patent classes arranged in numerical sequence by class number. # The class schedules for the Design classes.  History and revisions  Some USPC classifications date back to at least as early as 1899.https://www.uspto.gov/page/classes-g9b-49 The Manual of Classification is usually published in full as the Basic Manual of this system every 2 years. Basic Manuals reflect current classifications as of December of even-numbered years. Revisions to the Basic Manual occur at 6-month intervals. Pages of the Manual revisions are inserted as replacements to update the previous versions.

His typically somber paintings are characterized by massive, immobile forms. Biography Painting by Sironi photographed by Paolo Monti He was born in Sassari on the island of Sardinia. His father was an engineer; his maternal grandfather was the architect and sculptor Ignazio Villa.Sironi and Ferrari 2002, p. 159 Sironi spent his childhood in Rome. He embarked on the study of engineering at the University of Rome but quit after a nervous breakdown in 1903, one of many severe depressions that would recur throughout his life.Baldacci et al. 1989, p. 99 Thereafter he decided to study painting, and began attending the Scuola Libera del Nudo of the Accademia di Belle Arti di Roma. There he met Giacomo Balla, who became \\"his first real teacher\\".Sironi and Ferrari 2002, p. 26 Sironi returned to Milan in 1905 before traveling to Paris in 1906.Braun Like his friends Gino Severini and Umberto Boccioni, he began painting in a Divisionist style under the guidance of Balla. Sironi's works from this period include self-portraits and portraits of his family. He saw Expressionist works during visits to Germany between 1908 and 1911, but mainly stayed in Rome from 1909 to 1914. By 1913, Balla, Boccioni and Severini had developed a new style‚ÄîFuturism‚Äîwhich Sironi also adopted for a brief time, although his work showed little of the characteristic Futurist exaltation of speed and modernity. In 1914 he exhibited with the Futurists at the Galleria Sprovieri in Rome. Works from this period include several abstract tempera paintings entitled Composizione futurista (1915), a series of paintings of airplanes in tempera or tempera with collage, and several paintings of lone cyclists or motorcyclists. Sironi served in World War I as a member of the Lombard Volunteer Cyclists and Drivers.Adams 1989 After the war, he abandoned Futurism and developed a style that emphasized massive, immobile forms. In paintings such as La Lampada of 1919 (Pinateca di Brera, Milan), mannequins substitute for figures, as in the metaphysical paintings of Giorgio de Chirico and Carlo Carr√†. In 1922, Sironi was one of the founders of the Novecento Italiano movement, which was part of the return to order in European art during the post-war period. Paintings such as Venere of 1921‚Äì1923 (Galleria Civica d'Arte Moderna, Turin) and Solitudine (\\"Solitude\\", 1925; Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna, Rome), with their contained, geometric forms, bear some kinship to the neoclassicism evident in works produced at the same time by Picasso.Baldacci et al. 1989, p. 20 La lampada, 1919, oil on canvas, 78 x 56 cm, Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan In the late 1920s, Sironi painted monumental figures of nudes, peasants, and family groupings in bare, mountainous landscapes. In these works‚Äîdescribed by Fabio Benzi as \\"marked by a sense of humanity burdened with history ... [and] an almost Romanesque spirit of a solemn expressionism\\"Baldacci et al. 1989, p. 22‚Äîthe pure forms of Sironi's earlier work were replaced by a primitivist form of classicism, and his style became more painterly.Cowling and Mundy 1990, p. 241 In paintings of fishermen at work or drinkers in caf√©s, he adopted a deliberately ungainly style similar to that of Georges Rouault. A supporter of Mussolini, Sironi contributed a large number of cartoons‚Äîover 1700 in all‚Äîto Il Popolo d'Italia and La Rivista Illustrata del Popola d'Italia, the Fascist newspapers. Rejecting the art market and the concept of the easel painting, he became committed to the ideal of a fusion of decoration and architecture, as exemplified by Gothic cathedrals. He felt that the mural was the proper basis of a popular national art.Baldacci et al. 1989, pp. 22-23 The state commissioned from him several large-scale decorative works in the 1930s, such as the mural L'Italia fra le arti e le scienze (Italy Between the Arts and Sciences) of 1935, and he also contributed to the Exhibition of the Fascist Revolution in 1932. Although his esthetic of brutal monumentality represented the dominant style of Italian Fascism, his work was attacked by right-wing critics for its lack of overt ideological content.Cowling and Mundy 1990, pp. 247-248 As an artist closely identified with Fascism, Sironi's reputation declined dramatically in the post-World War II period. Embittered by the course of events, he had returned to easel painting in 1943, and worked in relative isolation. His withdrawal from society increased after the death of his daughter Rossana by suicide in 1948. The paintings of his later years sometimes approach abstraction, resembling assemblages of archaeological fragments, or juxtaposed sketches. He continued working until shortly before his death on August 13, 1961, in Milan. Legacy During his lifetime Sironi exhibited internationally. It is possible that the cellular style of his compositions exhibited in the US during the 1930s influenced WPA muralists. In the postwar years, Sironi fell from favor due to his earlier association with Fascism, and was accorded little attention from art historians.Sironi and Ferrari 2002, p. 16 A revival of interest in Sironi's work began in the 1980s, when his work was featured in major exhibitions, notably Les R√©alismes at the Centre Georges Pompidou (1981) and Italian Art in the Twentieth Century at the Royal Academy, London (1989). Public collections holding works by Sironi include Galleria Civica d'Arte Moderna in the Palazzo Massari, Ferrara; Galleria Civica di Modena in Palazzo Santa Margherita; Civico Museo d'Arte Contemporanea, Milan; Museo del Novecento, Milan; Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan; Galleria Comunale d'Arte Moderna, Rome; Revoltella Museum, Trieste; Ca' Pesaro, Venice; Guggenheim Collection, Venice; Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin; Tate Gallery, London; the Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne, Paris; the Vatican Museums; and the Kunsthaus Z√ºrich, Zurich.

This species was formerly known as the western long-tailed hermit or just long-tailed hermit, but was renamed to highlight its unusual bill. The taxonomy of this group is complicated, with similar hermit populations from both sides of the Andes being originally named as one species, the long-tailed hermit, P. superciliosus. The latter name in now reserved for the species east of the cordillera. P. l baroni (Baron's hermit) Species variation There is potential separation of the paler, greyer, and slightly smaller southern subspecies P. l. baroni as Baron's hermit, P. baroni. The adult long-billed hermit is mainly dark green above with a blue-green rump. It has a dark mask through the eye, with buff stripes above and below this, and a brown face. The underparts are grey to buff in colour. The sexes are similar, although the female is slightly smaller, but young birds have buff fringes to the feathers of the upperparts and head. P. l. mexicanus (Mexican hermit) Behavior and reproduction The long-billed hermit inhabits forest undergrowth, usually near water and its preferred food plants. It is 15 cm long and weighs 6 g. The bill is very long and decurved (3.4‚Äì3.7 cm), with a black upper and pale orange lower mandible, and the central feathers of the tapered tail are long (6.3‚Äì6.8 cm) and white-tipped. During the breeding season, male long-billed hermits sing in communal leks of up to 25 birds, and also wiggle their long tails in display. Competitive lek singing can occupy half of the daylight hours to attract females. The female selects the best lek singer to mate. The song consists of high pitched squeaky of chink churr and shree sounds. The flight call is a high sweep. Upon maturity, males appear to be evolving a dagger-like weapon on the beak tip as a secondary sexual trait to defend mating areas. The female long-billed hermit is solely responsible for nest construction, incubation and feeding the young. She lays two white eggs in a conical nest of fibres and cobwebs suspended under a large Heliconia or banana leaf 1.2 to 1.5 m above the ground. The incubation period is 14‚Äì19 days, with another 18 to 28 days to fledging. Feeding Nectar is taken from large flowers, such as Heliconias and passion flowers, and small insects and spiders taken as essential sources of protein. Hatchlings are fed by the female with regurgitated invertebrates. Long-billed hermits are trap-line feeders; they do not defend territory, but visit seasonal flowers on routes through the forest up to 1 km long. They pollinate some flowers such as Aphelandra which have long flowers adapted to the hummingbirds' long curved bill.

There are also around 70 Aboriginal communities within the Shire. The major industries of the shire include sheep and cattle for export, fishing, and tourism. History It was established as the West Kimberley Road District on 10 February 1887. The first Broome Road District separated on 15 November 1901 and the Municipality of Broome separated on 30 September 1904, but were re-absorbed on 24 July 1908 and 13 December 1918 respectively; the Broome area then again separated as the second Broome Road District (now the Shire of Broome) on 20 December 1918. It was declared a shire and named the Shire of West Kimberley with effect from 1 July 1961 following the passage of the Local Government Act 1960, which reformed all remaining road districts into shires. It was renamed the Shire of Derby-West Kimberley on 11 June 1983. The area is home to many large cattle stations, One of the first established was Yeeda Station, taken up in 1880 by the Murray Squatting Company composed of William Paterson, G. Paterson, H. Cornish and Alexander Richardson. The lease for Fossil Downs Station had been issued in 1883 to Dan MacDonald, for an area of at the junction of the Margaret and Fitzroy Rivers. The station was established in 1886 when cattle arrived from the eastern states to stock the lease.

Origins Howard initially commissioned Eureka Research in 1998 to undertake an anti-racism study to \\"explore and understand the subtleties and nature of racism in the Australia of the late 1990s with a view to mounting an effective mass media and/or education anti-racism campaign‚Äù.https://andrewjakubowicz.com/publications/antiracism1998/ The research reached two major conclusions: * That there was a clear need for an explicit anti-racism campaign, with 85% of respondents recognising racism as widespread and multi-faceted in Australia. * That a focus on 'living in harmony' be promoted. However the outcomes of the research were not aligned with Howard's views that Australians were not racist, as he later stated when commenting on the racially motivated 2005 Cronulla riots, \\"I do not accept that there is underlying racism in this country.\\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/australians-racist-no-way-says- howard-20051213-gdmmg5.html To avoid a focus on eliminating racism, the Howard government instead focused on the second part of the research and developed Harmony Day as a result. The findings of the Eureka report was suppressed from public access until 2011.https://andrewjakubowicz.com/publications/antiracism1998/https://alltogethernow.org.au/news/origins- harmony-day-may-surprise/ Diversity Harmony awareness ribbon The Diversity and Social Cohesion Program has two key elements: Community Grants and Harmony Day. The Diversity Cohesion Program provides funding, education and information to help organisations create a spirit of inclusiveness, and helps ensure all Australians are treated fairly regardless of their cultural background or circumstance. Criticism Criticism of Harmony Day has focused on the multi-cultural aspect of the day and the shift in focus away from anti- racism. =Shift in focus from anti-racism= Emeritus Professor Andrew Jakubowicz was critical of the extended governmental suppression of the original Eureka research for 13 years, and the subsequent lack of research or focus on attempts to eliminate racism.https://andrewjakubowicz.com/publications/antiracism1998/ IndigenousX CEO and founder Luke Pearson has argued that the introduction of Harmony Day was an effort to find :\\"a warm and positive way of not actually doing anything about the issue of racial discrimination in an increasingly multicultural society.\\"https://www.sbs.com.au/nitv/article/2017/03/21/comment-harmony-day- perfect-day-water-down-racial-discrimination-laws Anti-racism groups have highlighted media coverage at the time Harmony Day was introduced that proposed the Australian government was not doing enough to eliminate racism.https://alltogethernow.org.au/news/origins-harmony-day-may- surprise/https://junkee.com/real-story-behind-harmony-day-john-howard- depoliticised-anti-racism/98762 Not-for-profit group All Together Now have questioned why Harmony Day was needed at all if there was no racism in Australia, describing the creation of the day as \\"Orwellian\\". The Secretary for the New South Wales Fabians, a left-wing thinktank, argued that :\\"calling it Harmony Day drains the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination of its real meaning. Rather than focusing on tackling racism and the structural barriers that continue to exist, it is instead a self- congratulatory day about how ‚Äúharmonious‚Äù we apparently are.\\"https://junkee.com/real-story-behind-harmony-day-john-howard- depoliticised-anti-racism/98762 =Multiculturalism criticism= Commercial and technology lawyer Dan Ryan, https://aip.asn.au/about/directors/dan-ryan/ writing in The Australian in 2011, criticised Harmony Day, likening it to government projects in China. He said that events like Harmony Day are aimed at oppression of liberties in China, and are therefore impossible to achieve in a democratic country such as Australia. :\\"The problem with the harmonious society is not just the disconnect between the rhetoric and the reality. The truth is, while superficially sweet-sounding, the idea is illusory and utopian. We may all wish in the abstract that everyone got along, but the reality is that free societies by their nature are cacophonous, argumentative and full of dissent.\\" He also said that multiculturalism was being whitewashed by the government and media. :\\"If it is decided that we must restrict speech or avoid discussing certain subjects to keep the peace over an apparently combustible population, might now not be the time to ask whether this type of harmony is worth celebrating?\\" Grette Toner, in an Australian Curriculum Studies Association paper titled Beyond Harmony: Rethinking Intercultural Learning for Australian Primary Schools, visited a primary school and found the day's activities to be \\"largely symbolic...difficult to gauge what students learned\\". Criticism was also aimed at the school for not involving anybody from outside of it.

History In September 1933, St Modan's High School was officially opened by Archbishop McDonald of St Andrew's and Edinburgh. It was located in Barnsdale Road, St Ninians, Stirling. It was one of the first catholic schools to be built in Scotland. When it first opened, it incorporated 410 pupils and grew to its maximum potential of 1200 pupils when the school leaving age was raised to 16 in 1972. In 2008 St. Modan's High School moved to a new site as part of Stirling Councils ¬£10 million Public Private Partnership regeneration of schools. The new site was originally planned for a field adjacent to Bannockburn High School however due to Historic Scotland objections the new site was announced as being in Springkerse Retail Park in Stirling directly opposite the Holiday Inn Hotel. This effectively meant that all children now have to be \\"bussed\\" to the new school. The school is also next door to Forthbank Stadium home of Scottish Football League Second Division side Stirling Albion which gives the school some access to new sporting activities for pupils. Academics In its 2009 inspection report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education, St Modan's was awarded an \\"Excellent\\" rating (Sector leading) for both the Curriculum and Meeting Learner's Needs, and \\"Very Good\\" ratings for all other aspects of delivery. At that time the report indicated \\"in almost all key measures of attainment, results are consistently better than they are in schools which serve young people with similar needs and backgrounds\\" and also that \\"young people‚Äôs behaviour is exemplary and they show care and concern for each other\\".

The series was developed by Red Entertainment and published by Hudson Soft. An anime version and a manga adaptation have also been released. History The series began with , which was released on March 18, 1999 for the Dreamcast. A fan disc, , was released on August 5 that same year. On October 30, 2003, the series hit the PlayStation 2 platform as was released. A sequel to Diamond Dust, Kita e: Diamond Dust + Kiss is Beginning came out October 28, 2004.Hudson Soft's product page for Kita e: Diamond Dust + Kiss is Beginning An anime series entitled was adapted from the two Diamond Dust games. The anime was released in the United States by ADV Films under the title Diamond Daydreams in three volumes and later in a thinpack re-release. White Illumination =Gameplay= The game takes place in modern Japan and (unusually for a dating sim) uses actual photographs of Hokkaid≈ç as background art, while the character sprites are illustrations. Game interaction is achieved through a menu of action options, such as sleeping, using your cell phone, waiting, saving, or going somewhere. When choosing to go somewhere, the player selects a location in Hokkaid≈ç from the menu in order to travel there. Upon arrival in the chosen area, the game shows and describes the scene in visual novel format, with text layered on a graphical background. Visiting locations at different in-game times yields different results; for example, a shop may be closed or a character may not be there if the player visits at an inopportune time. When a character is encountered, a conversation is initiated and the player can occasionally select dialogue options. As in other dating sims, the protagonist's relationships with the other characters can be affected positively or negatively by the chosen options. =Story= The player, a second-year high school student (17 years old), travels from Tokyo to Sapporo in Hokkaid≈ç (hence the basic title of the game Kita E (To The North). There, he encounters eight different girls, including the lead character Kotori Haruno, whose family he stays with during his time up north. In the game, the player explores the island, plays video games, does karaoke, goes shopping‚Äîand most of all, tries to find that special someone to share his heart with. The main period of the game is set during summer vacation (August 1 to August 14), by which, at the end, the player returns to Tokyo. The conclusion of the game falls around December 28, when the player returns to Sapporo to witness the \\"White Illumination Countdown\\" on New Year's Eve (similar to the New Year's Eve Times Square celebrations). To win the game, the player must meet his chosen one at the Countdown on New Year's Eve, then kiss her at 12:00 midnight on New Year's Day. =Characters= ; ; :Kotori is a 15-year-old high school student. Her primary hobby is that she loves to cook. She lives alone with her mother Yoko (her father is deceased). Since Yoko works so much, Kotori maintains the home.

Because of that, Hanna blamed Suomi. Suomi almost gave up skating until she meets a young boy named Haruto who is also an ice skater and had a similar fallout with his best friend Kuda. Now, Suomi hopes to get back into ice skating and complete her promise with Hanna. ; ; :Shouko hosts a radio talk show in Sapporo called \\"Cappuccino Break\\" where she discusses romantic issues with her audience. Every love story Shoko hears is fuel for her talk show. Secretly, Shouko is dating her closest friend Takeda whom she loves, but Takeda is already married with a wife and daughter and warns Shouko not to make unexpected scenes. Elsewhere, Shouko receives gifts from someone called \\"Radio Boy\\", which gets the production staff worried that Shouko might have a potential stalker after her.

Staff and Development The games are illustrated by NOCCHI. Reception White Illumination sold 25 thousand copies in its first week. The anime adaptation received positive, albeit not spectacular, reviews. Anime News Network's Theron Martin said that \\"the series as a whole is very approachable even to those who aren't normally anime fans.\\" and \\"It doesn't forge any new ground and isn't outstandingly creative in the stories it tells, but it doesn't need to be to deliver a quality product.\\" Zac Bertschy, also with ANN, called the anime unremarkable and \\"fairly banal\\", but did say that \\"It's really refreshing to watch a show based on a dating sim that doesn't make you wish you could reach through the screen and slap the characters around a little bit.\\" Zac and Theron also praised ADV Films' English dubbing, saying that the English dialogue track \\"adds a lot to an already enjoyable little show\\", and \\"ultimately enhances the story rather than being a detriment.\\" Both ANN reviewers gave the show a B+ overall. In a review for Mania.com, Mark Thomas wrote that the \\"stories are well played out, with believable actions and reactions from the characters, and despite only having two episodes each to work with, the characters are well rounded.... What makes this show even nicer is that even the secondary characters are given enough to work with that makes them real.\\" References External links =Game=  =Anime= * 1999 video games 2004 anime television series 2004 Japanese television series endings ADV Films Anime and manga set in Hokkaido Anime television series based on video games AT-X (TV network) original programming Bish≈çjo games Dreamcast games Japan-exclusive video games Manga based on video games Oji Hiroi PlayStation 2 games Red Entertainment games Seinen manga Studio Deen Video games developed in Japan Visual novels Wani Books manga ","title":"Kita e"},{"id":"4352247","text":"K.

She was official regent of Annam about 1442 - 1453 during her son's minority, and effective head of state from 1451 until she allowed a servant to kill her in 1459 to avoid being captured or killed in a coup.This history is based on the doctoral thesis of John K. Whitmore \\"The Development of the Le Government in Fifteenth Century Vietnam\\" (Cornell University, 1968). The thesis is mostly concerned with the structure and make- up of the Le government from 1427 to 1471. Queen Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã Anh was a beautiful woman of noble birth (perhaps related to general Nguy·ªÖn X√≠). In 1440 she became a consort of the young king Le Thai Tong at the same time as Ng√¥ Th·ªã B√≠nh. They both attracted the King's attention and both gave birth to sons shortly before the king, L√™ Th√°i T√¥ng, died in 1442. Although the king had an older son, Nghi D√¢n, that boy's mother was not from a noble family and he was passed over, instead the kingship was given to Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã Anh's son, now called L√™ Nh√¢n T√¥ng. Regent At the time of his elevation to the kingship of Annam, L√™ Nh√¢n Tong was just an infant (just over one year old). By tradition, the infant king's mother had great power and she was also officially named the regent on behalf of her son. In reality, the real power behind the throne was Trinh Kha, a close friend and senior advisor to L√™ L·ª£i. Together, Trinh Kha and Nguyen Thi Anh managed to rule Vietnam reasonably well, though there was some friction. This friction grew as they clashed over how the king should be educated and who really got to make decisions in the government. In 1451 Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã Anh ordered the execution of Trinh Kha and his eldest son. The reason for this is lost and just two years later, Tr·ªãnh Kh·∫£ was officially pardoned and his family was given new lands. De facto ruler Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã Anh's son, L√™ Nh√¢n T√¥ng was officially given the powers of government in 1453 even though he was only 12 years old. This was unusual and seems to have made little real difference, the queen ruled while the other noble families acted as a brake on her power. The government did not do very much during this time, one later Vietnamese historian said this was a peaceful, harmonious time. The official court history written some 30 years later said it was a time of calamity for Vietnam and that for a woman to rule was as unnatural as \\"a hen crowing at daybreak\\". In 1459, the oldest son of L√™ Th√°i T√¥ng, Nghi D√¢n, staged a coup. He and some 100 men secretly entered the palace late in October and killed the king. The next day, Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã Anh, facing certain death at the hands of Nghi D√¢n's men, allowed herself to be killed by a loyal servant. The rule by Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã Anh was far from a disaster for Annam but equally, not much happened. Certainly there was a marked contrast between her rule, and the rule of her husband's own son, Le Thanh Tong.

Description Subterranea is a network of massive caves, passages, and tunnels, some large enough to hold cities, that are inhabited by the various races of Subterraneans. The first recorded entrance to Subterranea was found at Monster Isle. Subterranea contains water in underground rivers, pools, and lakes. It has high temperatures and no weather and its atmosphere is roughly the same as Earth's surface, with fresh air supplied through passages to the surface world. In addition to the different races of Subterraneans, the Outcasts live in Subterranea and serve the Mole Man. History Subterranea is a kingdom that was built beneath the surface of the Earth. At one point, it was home to the Deviants. Subterranea did not actually lie at the center of the Earth, but instead consisted of a seemingly planet-wide network of caverns lying miles beneath Earth's surface. Around 20,000 years ago, the priests of the city of Netheria (which was located on Atlantis) foresaw that Atlantis would be attacked by the Deviants who had their empire based in Lemuria. Therefore, the people of Netheria enclosed their city in a dome of an unknown plastic-like substance and excavated and fortified their city's foundations. Consequently, when Atlantis sank, Netheria remained intact and its people survived, having discovered a means of recycling their air supply. Netheria sank more deeply over the years, until it finally came to rest in a huge sub-sea cavern. Afterwards, the Netherians renamed their realm the Netherworld and are now known as the Netherworlders. The Fantastic Four made their first journey into Subterrenea where they discovered that the Mole Man and his Moloids reside there. It is also where the Deviant Mutates from Monster Isle make their home.Fantastic Four #1 The immortal Roman scientist/sorcerer Tyrannus also makes his home in Subterranea, where he rules over the Moloid offshoots called the Tyrannoids. During the Avengers vs. X-Men storyline, Mister Sinister has built his own city (based on Victorian-era London) in the Moloids' tunnels within Subterranea. The city is inhabited solely by clones of himself and his castle is on the back of a clone of Krakoa. After disposing of a rebel clone, he explains to one of his other clones that he has foreseen that the Phoenix Force would come after Hope Summers and that the Avengers would try to stop it and clash against the X-Men, resulting in the creation of the Phoenix Five (consisting of Phoenix Force-possessed versions of Cyclops, Colossus, Emma Frost, Magik and Namor). He also knows that the Phoenix Five will soon come after him and intends to take the Phoenix energy away from them by using a group of Madelyne Pryor clones.Uncanny X-Men (vol. 2) #14 The Phoenix Five leave their teammates behind and track Mister Sinister to Anchorage, Alaska (Cyclops' birthplace) finding out that he built his city in the tunnels beneath Anchorage. Mister Sinister then orders his clones to enter into war against the Phoenix Five.Uncanny X-Men (vol. 2) #15 Points of interest There are some famous locations in Subterranea: * The Abandoned City - This was an abandoned city that was once used by the High Evolutionary. It has recently been raised to the surface world in the United States, with its inhabitants wanting their city to be declared its own independent nation. * Lechuguilla - One of the Moloid cities in Subterranea. * Meramec - An underwater city that is inhabited by aquatic Moloids. * The Valley of Diamonds - A valley made up of many diamonds that are so bright, they can blind anyone that sees it. Anyone who wants to travel through the Valley of Diamonds must wear special sunglasses. Subterraneans Subterranea has various races that live in this underground location. The races of Subterranea are referred to as Subterraneans. Among the known Subterraneans are: =Ghouls= The Ghouls (or the Demons of the Mist) are a Subterranean race of unknown origin. There were two variants of the race, distinguished by their different sizes. * The smaller Ghouls were more savage and worshipped the molten lava in their domain as some kind of fire god, where they would offer up sacrifices. * The larger Ghouls are more civilized and have constructed massive underground cities. The Ghouls first appeared in Marvel Mystery Comics #10. =Gortokians= The Gortokians were the first race of Subterraneans. They were created millennia ago by the Deviants as a slave race, but they soon rebelled. In recent years, the Gortokians were planning an invasion of the surface world, but an underground nuclear test staged by an unwitting surface nation devastated the entire race, killing them all either outright or by the resulting radiation poisoning. The only known survivor is Grotesk, who is best known for having apparently killed the X-Men's leader Professor X (but who was actually the shape-shifter Changeling). The Golden People of the Savage Land are the descendants of the Gortokians. The Gortokians first appeared in X-Men #41 (February 1968), and were created by Roy Thomas and Don Heck. =Lava Men= The Lava Men are a race of Subterraneans who were mutated by the demon Cha'sa'dra (a native of Limbo) into a lava-skinned form. The first Lava Man to visit the surface world was Jinku, who was propelled to the surface by a volcanic reaction triggered by the trickster god Loki. This Lava Man fought Thor before he was returned underground. Later, he and other Lava Men later fought Thor's teammates, the Avengers. Cha'sa'dra was among the demons of Limbo who appeared on Earth during the \\"Inferno\\" storyline, and when he was destroyed in combat with the Avengers, the Lava Men were apparently transformed into solid, non-living matter. Lava Men have red skin of rock-hard consistency. A Lava Man's body has twice the density of a normal human being's. Upon death, a normal Lava Man immediately decomposes into dust. A small number of Lava Men have undergone a metamorphosis, giving them golden skins. Grotesk has rendered all Lava Men mute under his rule. No clearly female Lava Men have been depicted to date. Less than 1,000 Lava Men are known to exist. The Lava Men formerly had a tribal government, but became a monarchy ruled by Grotesk, although the golden Lava Men remained under tribal rule. Their technology level is primitive and the Lava Men are deeply religious, and peaceful except when stirred to war by religious fervor. Lava Men were formerly nomadic. Though not a Lava Man himself, Grotesk ruled the red Lava Men. Jinku was a shaman of the golden Lava Men. Other known Lava Men have included the golden Lava Men Akor, Danka and Kelak, as well as the deceased Molto. Enemies of the Lava Men have included the Avengers, Thor, the Moloid and Tyrannoid Subterraneans, Brutus and the Deviants. Major allies of the Lava Men have included Grotesk, Captain Marvel II and formerly Cha'sa'dra. The first reported appearance of a Lava Man on Earth's surface was Molto, in Journey into Mystery #97 (October 1963) by Jack Kirby. Molto appeared on Earth's surface, and battled Thor in New York City. Molto became Thor's friend afterwards, however.Journey Into Mystery #97 The Avengers later fought the Lava Men in Subterranea when they tried to force a 'living rock' that was emitting deadly sound waves to the surface, hoping that, when it eventually exploded, it would wreck Earth and not their realm. However, the Hulk was tricked into striking the spot, which ended up destroying it. Thor allowed the rest of the Lava Men to return home.Avengers #5 Jinku plotted to use the Mole Man's machine to activate all volcanoes on the Earth. Molto was mortally wounded by Jinku, but warned Thor and the Human Torch about Jinku before dying. Thor wrecked the machine and the Torch led the Moloid Subterraneans in defeating the Lava Men.Marvel Team-Up #26 A Project: Pegasus borer probe wreaked havoc in a Lava Man settlement and the Lava Men retaliated by invading Project: Pegasus. The Lava Men clashed with the Avengers again before returning to Subterranea.Avengers #236-237 The Lava Men became involved in a war against the other Subterranean races and managed to capture the Mole Man.Fantastic Four #313 Jinku magically created a group of non-sentient Lava Men that attacked the Avengers and Hydro-Base. It was revealed how the demon Cha'sa'dra transformed a group of Gortokian Subterraneans into the first Lava Men and how Cha'sa'dra's death killed hundreds of Lava Men and placed others in an immobile \\"chrysalis\\" state. The vengeful Jinku unleashed a monster against the Avengers in Subterranea. The immobile Lava Men attained new golden forms and Jinku was similarly transformed. However, they all made peace with the Avengers.Avengers #305-306, 308 Later, the remaining untransformed red Lava Men came under the rule of Grotesk. Some of the Lava Men fled to the surface to escape the war in Subterranea, but were forced to return.Avengers Annual #20 Lava Men have a high resistance to extreme heat and flame. They continually generate intense heat from their bodies and can increase the amount of heat at will, enough to be able to melt a weapon in its vicinity. They have a mystical ability to cause large amounts of volcanic ash to appear, seemingly from nowhere, and to transform metal into ash. They also have immunity to aging. Some Lava Men can mystically transform themselves into giants composed of hardened lava. Some Lava Men can mystically command molten lava to do their bidding by performing a ritual prayer to the demons they worship. The golden Lava Men can transform their shapes, and in doing so, even merge their bodies with one another. They once formed themselves into a large sphere that could defy gravity. Jinku has mystically created non-sentient Lava Men which possess the superhuman powers of the real Lava Men. Lava Men had unusually acute hearing and night vision to enable them to function more easily in the darkness of Subterranea. =Lizard Men= The Lizard Men of Subterranea are a race of humanoid lizards created as slaves to the Deviants. When the Deviants abandoned Subterranea, the Lizard Men of Subterranea grew into an underground society. The Lizard Men of Subterranea traveled through a system of Earth's caves where one of their numbers became lost in the Himalaya Mountains. They sent a scout with a fur covering out to look for that operative where the Lizard Man in question was mistaken for a Yeti. The scout ended up coming across Victor Cartwright who was faking a documentary of a Yeti when he and his assistant Fred Cooper could not find the actual one. The scout took Victor underground with Fred in pursuit. When the Lizard Men planned to kill Victor in order to keep their society a secret, Fred came to Victor's rescue.Tales to Astonish #24 Sometime later, a hardened convict named Eric Kane serving a life sentence in an African prison camp escaped and hid in a cave behind a waterfall where he stumbled into the underground society of unrelated Lizard Men while looking for another way out. The Lizard Men ended up welcoming him and stating that a special diamond had given them light. When Eric asked the Lizard Men why they have not gone to the surface for light, they tell him that they cannot breathe the surface world's air, even in the upper regions of the cave. The Lizard Men allowed Eric to be their honored guest. Eric, however, was interested only in taking the diamond. When Eric managed to take the diamond and run, the Lizard Men went after him as they warned him to drop the diamond while he has the chance, as it was dangerous. Eric was too fast for the Lizard Men. The diamond emitted radiation that transformed him into a Lizard Man, making him unable to breathe the surface world's air, and he retreated back to the Lizard Men. The other Lizard Men shunned Eric, despite the fact that he had returned the diamond to them. While living as an outcast, Eric was left wondering if the diamond's effects will ever wear off and return him to human form.Journey into Mystery #64 Kro later dispatched the Lizard Men to the Midnight Mountains in Borneo in order to assist in the capture of Makkari (who had taken the disguise of the superhero Hurricane to serve as a member of the Monster Hunters). Makkari's teammates aided him in the fight against the mutant monster Gorgilla as Makkari is ensnared by a Bloodhound Missile launched by the Lizard Men. The Lizard Men dragged Makkari down into Subterranea with Ulysses Bloodstone in hot pursuit. The Lizard Men destroyed the entrance to their tunnel to keep Ulysses Bloodstone from following them. At least one Lizard Man was left behind and his mind was probed by Doctor Druid.Marvel Universe #6 The Monster Hunters later left the last Lizard Men under the care of Gorgilla.Marvel Universe #7 The Lizard Men of Subterranea are much different from the Lizard Men that reside in the Savage Land and the Lizard Men of Tok (from the Microverse). The Lizard Men of Subterranea first appeared in Tales to Astonish #24. =Molans= The Molans are a race that was created by the Deviants. After the Deviants left Subterranea, the Molans grew into their own distinct society. They first appeared in Avenging Spider-Man #1 when they, alongside their leader Ra'ktar, end up overthrowing the Mole Man after his Moloids had captured Mayor J. Jonah Jameson.Avenging Spider-Man #1 Spider-Man and the Red Hulk end up coming to J. Jonah Jameson's rescue, where the Red Hulk ends up fighting Ra'ktar. Ra'ktar manages to easily cut down the Red Hulk.Avenging Spider-Man #2 Spider-Man manages to get J. Jonah Jameson back to the surface while he goes back for the Red Hulk. Spider-Man later duels Ra'ktar, using a weapon that Ra'ktar had forged for him. Spider-Man managed to defeat Ra'ktar and managed to work out a treaty between the Molans and the Mole Man.Avenging Spider-Man #3 The Molans first appeared in Avenging Spider-Man #1. =Moloids= The Moloids (or the Mole People) were the next race to be created by the Deviants. The Moloids are the physically weakest of the Subterraneans and consequently they almost always act in great numbers. Due to their physical and mental weakness, the Deviants rejected them and attempted to exterminate them all. Today, they serve the Mole Man, and have frequently fought the Fantastic Four alongside their master and his monsters. The Moloids have a yellow-skinned subspecies called the Disians who live in the tunnels of the Savage Land. Moloids are seen collecting and spiriting away the Punisher's body parts, after he is dismembered and decapitated by Wolverine's son Daken, acting on the orders of Norman Osborn. They are seemingly operating under the protection of the Man-Thing.Dark Reign: The List - The Punisher #1 Four evolved Moloids named Kor, Mik, Tong and Turg are members of the Future Foundation. The Moloids first appeared in Fantastic Four #22 (January 1964), and were created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. =Tyrannoids= The Tyrannoids are an offshoot of the Moloids who serve the nearly-immortal surface world exile Tyrannus, to whom they showed the Fountain of Youth. They are not quite as weak or simple-minded as their Moloid cousins. As pawns of Tyrannus, the Tyrannoids have fought the Hulk on several occasions. The Tyrannoids first appeared in The Incredible Hulk (vol. 1) #5. Other versions =JLA/Avengers= In the crossover miniseries JLA/Avengers, Subterraneans are among the enthralled villains defending Krona's stronghold.JLA/Avengers #4 The Lava Men are among the first villains faced. The Moloids are defeated by Iron Man and Aquaman. =Secret Wars (2015)= During the 2015 Secret Wars storyline, the Mole Man of Technopolis establishes the underground kingdom of Subterranea near the Shield. The Mole Man even had the security of Subterranea by using stolen technology from Technopolis and modifying deactivated Ultron Sentinels from Perfection. The Punisher of Egyptia and the Iron Fist of the Domain of Apocalypse stumble onto this, where they help to stop a malfunctioning Ultron. Even though the Mole Man broke one of God Emperor Doom's laws, he was allowed to continue running Subterranea as the Shield's sub-domain without having to submit to God Emperor Doom.Secret Wars Journal #5 In other media =Television= * Subterranea appears in the 1967 Fantastic Four episodes \\"Menace of the Mole Man\\" and \\"Return of the Mole Man\\". * Subterranea appears in the 1978 Fantastic Four episode \\"The Mole Man\\". * Subterranea appears in the 1994 Fantastic Four episode \\"Mole Man\\". * Subterranea first appears in the Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes episode \\"De-Mole-ition\\". Here, the Moloids are fungus-based life-forms similar to the Ultimate Marvel version of them. * Subterranea appears in the Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. episode \\"Of Moles and Men\\". The Moloids hail the Hulk as their king, where they thanked the Hulk for defeating a Larvae-Beast that has been tormenting their city. The Hulk considers remaining in Subterranea to protect the Moloids in case another Larvae-Beast shows up. It was also shown that the Moloids were also defended by the Mole Man until he was captured by the Larvae-Beasts. The Queen Larvae-Beast has been using the floor that has lava underneath it to incubate its eggs. When the Queen Larvae-Beast reaches the surface, the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. end up fighting it, where they are assisted by the Mole Man and the Moloids where they used their solar-powered spears to fight the back the Queen Larvae-Beast. Upon luring it out of town, the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. use a large rock structure to crush the Queen Larvae- Beast. Afterwards, the Hulk decides to stay in Vista Verde while the Mole Man and the Moloids return to Subterranea. =Video games= * The Moloids and the Lava Men appear in Marvel Heroes.

Application The most common usage for biotelemetry is in dedicated cardiac care telemetry units or step-down units in hospitals. Although virtually any physiological signal could be transmitted, application is typically limited to cardiac monitoring and SpO2. Biotelemetry is increasingly being used to understand animals and wildlife by remotely measuring physiology, behaviour and energetic status. It can be used to understand the way that animals migrate, and also the environment that they are experiencing by measuring the abiotic variables, and how it is affecting their physiological status by measuring biotic variables such as heart rate and temperature. Telemetry systems can either be attached externally to animals, or placed internally, with the types of transmission for the devices dependent on the environment that the animal moves in. For example, to study the movement of swimming animals signals using radio transmission or ultrasonic transmission are often used but land based or flying animals can be tracked with GPS and satellite transmissions. Components of a biotelemetry system A typical biotelemetry system comprises: * Sensors appropriate for the particular signals to be monitored * Battery-powered, Patient worn transmitters * A Radio Antenna and Receiver * A display unit capable of concurrently presenting information from multiple patients History  Some of the first uses of biotelemetry systems date to the early space race, where physiological signals obtained from animals or human passengers were transmitted back to Earth for analysis (the name of the medical device manufacturer Spacelabs Healthcare is a reflection of their start in 1958 developing biotelemetry systems for the early U.S. space program). Animal biotelemetry has been used since at least the 1980s. Animal biotelemetry has now advanced to not only understand the physiology and movement of free ranging animals, but also how different animals interact, for example, between predators and prey. Current trends Because of crowding of the radio spectrum due to the recent introduction of digital television in the United States and many other countries, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) as well as similar agencies elsewhere have recently begun to allocate dedicated frequency bands for exclusive biotelemetry usage, for example, the Wireless Medical Telemetry Service (WMTS). The FCC has designated the American Society for Healthcare Engineering of the American Hospital Association (ASHE/AHA) as the frequency coordinator for the WMTS. In addition, there are many products that utilize commonly available standard radio devices such as Bluetooth and IEEE 802.11.

It originated as a language of commerce between British and African slave traders during the period of the Atlantic slave trade. about 75 million people in Nigeria, Cameroon, Ghana and Equatorial Guinea use the language. Because it is a primarily spoken language, there is no standardized written form, and many local varieties exist. These include Sierra Leone Krio, Nigerian Pidgin, Ghanaian Pidgin English, Cameroonian Pidgin English, Liberian Pidgin English, the Aku dialect of Krio, https://www.accessgambia.com/information/aku.html and Pichinglis. History =Slave trade= West African Pidgin English was the lingua franca, or language of commerce, spoken along the West African coast during the period of the Atlantic slave trade. Portuguese traders were the first Europeans to trade in West Africa in the 15th century, and some words of Portuguese origin remain in the pidgin, for example, \\"sabi\\" (to know), a derivation of the Portuguese \\"saber\\". Later, as British slave merchants came to dominate the slave trade, they and local African traders developed this language in the coastal areas in order to facilitate their commercial exchanges, but it quickly spread up the river systems into the West African interior because of its value as a trade language among Africans of different tribes. Later in its history, this useful trading language was adopted as a native language by new communities of Africans and mixed-race people living in coastal slave trading bases such as James Island, Bunce Island, Elmina Castle, Cape Coast Castle and Anomabu. At that point, it became a creole language. Some scholars call this language \\"West African Pidgin English\\" to emphasize its role as a lingua franca pidgin used for trading. Others call it \\"Guinea Coast Creole English\\" to emphasize its role as a creole native language spoken in and around the coastal slave castles and slave trading centers by people permanently based there. West African Pidgin English arose during the period when the British dominated the Atlantic slave trade in the late 17th and 18th centuries, ultimately exporting more slaves to the Americas than all the other European nations combined. During this period, English-speaking sailors and slave traders were in constant contact with native African peoples and long-distance traders along thousands of miles of West African coastline. Africans who picked up elements of pidgin English for purposes of trade with Europeans along the coast probably took the language up the river systems along the trade routes into the interior where other Africans who may never have seen a white man adopted it as a useful device for trade along the rivers. The existence of this influential language during the slave trade era is attested by the many descriptions of it recorded by early European travelers and slave traders. They called it the \\"Coast English\\" or the \\"Coast Jargon\\". A British slave trader in Sierra Leone, named John Matthews, mentioned pidgin English in a letter he later published in a book titled A Voyage to the River Sierra-Leone on the Coast of Africa. Matthews refers to West African Pidgin English as a \\"jargon\\", and he warns Europeans coming to Africa that they will fail to understand the Africans unless they recognize that there are significant differences between English and the coastal pidgin: :‚ÄúThose who visit Africa in a cursory manner ... are very liable to be mistaken in the meaning of the natives from want of knowledge in their language, or in the jargon of such of them as reside upon the sea-coast and speak a little English; the European affixing the same ideas to the words spoken by the African, as if they were pronounced by one of his own nation. [This] is a specimen of the conversation which generally passes. ..: :Well, my friend, you got trade today; you got plenty of slaves? :No, we no got trade yet; by and by trade come. You can‚Äôt go. :What you go for catch people, you go for make war? :Yes, my brother ‚Ä¶ gone for catch people; or they gone for make war.\\" =Modern Africa= West African Pidgin English remained in use in West Africa after the slave trade and, later, European colonization ended. Many distinct regional variants of the language emerged. Looked down upon in colonial times as a bastardization of proper English ‚Äì a stigma still attached to it by some ‚Äì Pidgin nonetheless remains in widespread use. In Nigeria in 2016 there was an estimated five million individuals who use Pidgin as a primary language for everyday use. As of 2017, about 75 million people in Nigeria, Cameroon, Ghana and Equatorial Guinea use the language. During decolonization, it became a \\"language of resistance and anti-colonialism\\", and political activists still use it to criticize their post-colonial political leaders. Over the last hundred years the amount of English-lexifer based creoles in West African countries currently being used as primary and secondary language has increased greatly, with speakers currently exceeding one hundred million. Because West African Pidgin English is a primarily spoken language, there is no standardized written form, and many local varieties exist. In August 2017, the BBC launched a Pidgin news service, aimed at audiences in West and Central Africa, as part of its World Service branch. As part of that effort, the BBC developed a guide for a standardized written form of pidgin. Structure Like other pidgin and creole languages, West African Pidgin English took the majority of its vocabulary from its target language (English), and much of its sound system, grammar, and syntax from the local substrate languages (West African Niger‚ÄìCongo languages). The English dialect that served as the target language (or lexifier) for West African Pidgin English was not the speech of Britain's educated classes, though, but the Nautical English spoken by the British sailors who manned the slave ships that sailed to Africa. Nautical speech contained words from British regional dialects as well as specialized ship vocabulary. Evidence of this early nautical speech can still be found in the modern pidgin and creole languages derived from West African Pidgin English. In Sierra Leone Krio, for instance, words derived from English regional dialects include padi (\\"friend\\"), krabit (\\"stingy\\"), and berin (\\"funeral\\"). Words from specialized ship vocabulary include kohtlas [from \\"cutlass\\"] (\\"machete\\"), flog (\\"beat\\", \\"punish\\"), eys [from \\"hoist\\"] (\\"to lift\\"), and dek (\\"floor\\"). Historical impact The various pidgin and creole languages still spoken in West Africa today ‚Äì the Aku language in The Gambia, Sierra Leone Krio, Nigerian Pidgin English, Ghanaian Pidgin English, Cameroonian Pidgin English, Fernando Po Creole English, etc. ‚Äì are all derived from the early West African Pidgin English. These contemporary English-based pidgin and creole languages are so similar that they are increasingly grouped together under the name \\"West African Pidgin English\\", although the term originally designated only the original trade language spoken on the West African coast two hundred years ago. Some scholars also argue that African slaves took West African Pidgin English to the New World where it helped give rise to the English-based creoles that developed there, including the Gullah language in coastal South Carolina and Georgia, Bahamian Dialect, Jamaican Creole, Belizean Kriol, Guyanese Creole, Sranan Tongo in Suriname, etc. Since the slaves taken to the Americas spoke many different African languages, they would have found West African Pidgin English as useful as a lingua franca on the plantations as they had found it back home in West Africa as a trading language. Their enslaved children born in the Americas would have adopted different versions of West African Pidgin English as their \\"native\\" languages, thus creating a series of New World English-based creoles. The similarities among the many English-based pidgin and creole languages spoken today on both sides of the Atlantic are due, at least in part, to their common derivation from the early West African Pidgin English. Note the following examples, all of which mean \\"They are going there to eat rice\\": *Sierra Leone Krio: \\"Dem dey go for go it res\\" *Ghanaian Pidgin English: \\"Dem dey go chop rais\\" *Nigerian Pidgin English: \\"Dem dey go chop rice\\" *Cameroonian Pidgin English: \\"Dey di go for go chop rice\\" *Gullah: \\"Dem duh gwine fuh eat rice\\"  See also  * Languages of Africa  References  External links * Richard Nordquist, \\"West African Pidgin English (WAPE)\\".

Common names include orchid tree, purple bauhinia, camel's foot, butterfly tree, and Hawaiian orchid tree. Description Bauhinia purpurea is a small to medium-size deciduous tree growing to tall. The leaves are long and broad, rounded, and bilobed at the base and apex. The flowers are conspicuous, pink, and fragrant, with five petals. The fruit is a pod long, containing 12 to 16 seeds. Leaves are alternate. Cultivation In the United States of America, the tree grows in Hawaii, coastal California, southern Texas, and southwest Florida. Bauhinia √ó blakeana is usually propagated by grafting it onto B. purpurea stems. Uses The young leaves and flowers of Bauhinia purpurea are edible. In the Philippines, B. purpurea is known as alibangbang (lit. \\"butterfly\\"). The leaves have a citrusy and sour taste and are used as a souring agent for sinigang and similar dishes in Philippine cuisine. Throughout Southeast Asia, B. purpurea and related species are also used in making poultices for treating swelling, bruises, boils, and ulcers. Various parts of the plant are also used in decoctions to treat fever and stomach ailments, as well as being used as an astringent. In Indian traditional medicine, the leaves are used to treat coughs while the bark is used for glandular diseases and as an antidote for poisons. The flowers are also used in pickles and curries and is regarded as a laxative. It is called as KƒÅnchan ( ‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶û‡ßç‡¶ö‡¶®) in Assamese.  Chemistry  A wide range of chemical compounds have been isolated from Bauhinia purpurea including 5,6-dihydroxy-7-methoxyflavone 6-O-Œ≤-D-xylopyranoside, bis [3',4'-dihydroxy-6-methoxy-7,8-furano-5',6'-mono- methylalloxy]-5-C-5-biflavonyl and (4'-hydroxy-7-methyl 3-C-Œ±-L- rhamnopyranosyl)-5-C-5-(4'-hydroxy-7-methyl-3-C-Œ±-D-glucopyranosyl) bioflavonoid, bibenzyls, dibenzoxepins, mixture of phytol fatty esters, lutein, Œ≤-sitosterol, isoquercitin and astragalin.

This seven-member collegial body is elected by the people for a period of four years. The cantonal constitution reserves one seat in the Executive Council for a French-speaking citizen from the Bernese Jura. The presidency, by convention, rotates annually and the position is largely that of a primus inter pares.  Current Composition  As of 2010, the Executive Council was composed as follows: * President of the Council Philippe Perrenoud, SPS: Health and Social Services Department * Vice President of the Council Bernhard Pulver, GFL: Education Department * Executive Councillor Andreas Rickenbacher, SPS: Economic Department * Executive Councillor Hans-J√∂rg K√§ser, FDP: Police and Military Department * Executive Councillor Christoph Neuhaus, SVP: Department of Justice, Municipalities and Churches * Executive Councillor Beatrice Simon, BDP: Finance Department * Executive Councillor Barbara Egger- Jenzer, SPS: Department of Construction, Transport and Energy * State Chancellor Kurt Nuspliger, SPS: State Chancellory (chief of staff with no vote in the Council)  2006 Executive Council elections  The 2006 Executive Council elections occurred on April 9. While Councillors Egger, Gasche and Luginb√ºhl ran for re-election (which they achieved easily), Councillors Andres, Annoni, Bhend and Z√∂lch resigned, leaving the field unusually wide open. The SVP, long the dominant party in Bern, unexpectedly made an attempt to seize control of the Council by fielding four candidates instead of the usual three. The parties left of center criticised this move as contrary to the tradition of concordance government. Despite the majority voting procedure and its alliance with the FDP, the SVP failed to attain its goal, losing one seat to the Social Democrats instead. As the FDP also lost one seat to the Greens, the governmental majority changed to the Left. Together with the FDP, the parties right of center (usually referred to in Bern as b√ºrgerlich, i.e., bourgeois) had slated six candidates: * Urs Gasche, SVP (re-elected) * Werner Luginb√ºhl, SVP (re-elected) * Hans-J√ºrg K√§ser, FDP (elected) * Monique Jametti Greiner, SVP (not elected) * Annelise Vaucher, SVP (for the Bernese Jura seat, not elected) * Eva Desarzens, FDP (not elected) The parties left of center, in turn, had agreed on a slate of four candidates: * Barbara Egger-Jenzer, SP (re-elected) * Philippe Perrenoud, SP (for the Bernese Jura seat, elected) * Andreas Rickenbacher, SP (elected) * Bernhard Pulver, GFL (elected) The other candidates, fielded by minor parties or groups (different Christian parties, nationalists, French-speaking quasi-separatists, joke parties) were never considered to have a substantial chance of winning a Council seat. Source: Official 2006 elections website  2010 Executive Council elections  The 2010 election on March 28 was the first without pre-printed block lists. Given this and the rather surprising left-wing win in 2006, it was widely questioned whether the Social Democrats and the Greens could hold their majority. Urs Gasche, who had switched to the newly founded Conservative Democratic Party, did not run for re-election. His party defended their seat with Beatrice Simon. The SVP sought to regain two seats with re-elected Christoph Neuhaus and first-time candidate Albert R√∂sti, who scored eighth and was therefore not elected. For the FDP, Hans-J√ºrg K√§ser successfully ran for re-election, while Sylvain Astier, who contested the Jura seat, lost to Philippe Perrenoud. On the left, Barbara Egger-Jenzer, Andreas Rickenbacher, Philippe Perrenoud (all Social Democrats) and Bernhard Pulver (Greens) were re-elected, retaining the left-wing's control over the executive. Except for Philippe Perrenoud, who defended the Jura seat, they scored the best results. Several candidates of minor parties, including Jurassian separatist Maxime Zuber (Parti Socialiste Autonome) and Marc Jost (EVP) were unsuccessful.

He was a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Center for Theoretical Physics from 1969 until his retirement. He still retains his affiliation in emeritus status in 2019. Jackiw co-discovered the chiral anomaly, which is also known as the Adler‚ÄìBell‚ÄìJackiw anomaly. In 1969, he and John Stewart Bell published their explanation, which was later expanded and clarified by Stephen L. Adler, of the observed decay of a neutral pion into two photons. This decay is forbidden by a symmetry of classical electrodynamics, but Bell and Jackiw showed that this symmetry cannot be preserved at the quantum level. Their introduction of an \\"anomalous\\" term from quantum field theory required that the sum of the charges of the elementary fermions had to be zero. This work also gave important support to the color- theory of quarks. Jackiw is also known for Jackiw‚ÄìTeitelboim gravity, a theory of gravity with one dimension each of space and time that includes a dilaton field. Sometimes known as the R = T model or as JT gravity, it is used to model some aspects of near-extremal black holes. One of his sons is Stefan Jackiw, an American violinist.

Initial operations Whitehurst (DE-634) was laid down on 21 March 1943 at San Francisco, California, by the Bethlehem Steel Co.; launched on 5 September 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Robie S. Whitehurst, the mother of Ensign Whitehurst; and commissioned on 19 November 1943, Lieutenant Commander James R. Grey in command. World War II Following sea trials, calibration tests, and shakedown off the west coast, Whitehurst proceeded to Hawaii, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 4 February 1944. Underway for the Solomons on the 7th, the destroyer escort sailed via Majuro and Funafuti in company with and SC-502, escorting SS George Ross, SS George Constantine and SS Robert Lucas, and arrived on 23 February at Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides. After shifting to Noum√©a, New Caledonia, and back to Espiritu Santo, Whitehurst joined and on 22 March to escort oilers , , and . Whitehurst and Atascosa were detached from that task unit on 26 March to proceed independently to a rendezvous with other task forces operating in the area. While Atascosa refueled ships from Destroyer Squadron 47, an enemy plane appeared. All ships present, including Whitehurst, opened fire but scored no hits as the plane climbed upward and out of sight. Once refueling had been completed, Whitehurst and the oiler returned to Espiritu Santo. At the completion of a mission escorting to Milne Bay, New Guinea, Whitehurst remained in waters off New Guinea on local escort duties until 17 May. She then participated in the amphibious operation against Wakde Island, screening the amphibious ships as they landed troops of General Douglas MacArthur's forces. Whitehurst, in company with other units of Task Unit (TU) 72.2.9, later escorted echelon S-4 of the invasion force to Humboldt Bay. The destroyer escort subsequently joined , , and , to screen echelon H-2 as it steamed toward Bosnic, Biak, in the Schouten Islands, for landings there. Arriving off Biak on 28 May, Whitehurst took up a patrol station off the western entrance to the channel between Owi Island and Biak. While there, she received an urgent message from LCI-34 which had been taken under fire by Japanese shore batteries. Whitehurst arrived on the scene in time to be shelled, herself, but the enemy's rounds fell harmlessly nearby and caused no damage to the ship. The destroyer escort soon was relieved by and Swanson in covering LCI-34, and then protected LCT-260 as that landing craft embarked casualties from the beachhead. Whitehurst subsequently screened echelon H-2 as it retired from Biak to Humboldt Bay. Whitehurst performed escort duties and trained through the summer of 1944. The tempo of the war, however, was increasing. With the Japanese being driven from one island after another, American planners looked toward the next rung of the ladder to Tokyo, the Philippine Islands. Accordingly, Whitehurst, Lieutenant Jack C. Horton, USNR, now in command, was placed in the anti-submarine and anti-aircraft screen of TU 77.7.1, a group of fleet tankers slated to supply units of the 7th Fleet on its drive into the Philippines. On 27 October, a week after American troops had landed on Leyte, two enemy planes attacked Whitehurst; but both were driven off by anti-aircraft fire from the ship's guns. Two days later, on 29 October, Whitehurst received word that, on the previous day, had been torpedoed and sunk by a Japanese submarine. While picked up survivors from the sunken destroyer escort, Whitehurst, detached from TU 77.7.1 to conduct a search, soon picked up a contact. At general quarters, the destroyer escort conducted three attacks without conclusive results. When Whitehurst pressed home a fourth depth charge attack, her efforts were crowned with success. In quick succession, five to seven explosions rumbled up from the depths. Another violent underwater burst soon followed, causing a concussion that damaged Whitehurst's detecting gear. Bull continued the search after Whitehurst, with her damaged sound gear, requested her to do so but found nothing except a stretch of disturbed water. As the waves calmed, lookouts in both ships noticed many pieces of wood and other debris bobbing in a widening oil slick. The , which had sunk the Eversole, had been destroyed. While Bull continued picking up Eversole survivors in the vicinity, Whitehurst returned to TU 77.7.1 and with that task unit headed back to Kossol Roads in the Palaus. Nearly a month later, following another stint of local escort operations, Whitehurst again came to grips with the enemy. While escorting a 12-ship convoy from Leyte to New Guinea, Whitehurst came under attack by two Japanese \\"Lily\\" medium bombers. One skimmed low and dropped a bomb that fell well clear of the ships. The second started a glide bombing attack, but Whitehurst's guns tumbled that raider into the sea. After arriving with the convoy at New Guinea on 25 November, Whitehurst spent the remainder of 1944 and the first few months of 1945 in escort operations between New Guinea and the Philippines. She did not again engage the enemy until the Okinawa campaign. When the American landings on Okinawa commenced on 1 April 1945, Whitehurst was part of Task Force 54 (TF 54), screening vessels protecting the valuable transports and cargo vessels. On 6 April, while on patrol station off Kerama Retto, the destroyer escort drove off an enemy plane that had attacked the cargo vessel SS Pierre. Three days later, the escort vessel was relieved of her escort duties off Kerama Retto, and she shifted to Okinawa to operate off the southwest coast of that island. Taking up station on the 10th, she was still steaming in that capacity early in the afternoon two days later when a low- flying enemy aircraft closed the ship only to be driven off by Whitehurst's gunfire. At 1430, four \\"Val\\" dive-bombers approached the area from the south; and one detached itself from the group and headed for Whitehurst. It circled and soon commenced a steep dive while two of its companions also commenced an attack, one from the starboard beam and one from astern. The latter two planes spun down in flames, destroyed by anti-aircraft fire, but the original attacker continued down in spite of the 20-millimeter hits that tore at the plane. This \\"Val\\" crashed into the ship's forward superstructure on the port side of the pilot house, penetrating bulkheads and starting fires that enveloped the entire bridge, while the plane's bomb continued through the ship and exploded some 50 feet off her starboard bow. Whitehurst circled, out of control, while , patrolling a nearby sector, rang up flank speed and raced toward the burning destroyer escort to render assistance. By the time Vigilance finally caught up with Whitehurst, the destroyer escort's crew had put out the most serious fires; but the minesweeper proved invaluable in aiding the wounded. The prompt and efficient administering of first aid and the injection of plasma undoubtedly saved many lives, 21 of the 23 wounded transferred to Vigilance were saved. 42 of her crew of 213 died in the attack. With a Vigilance signalman on board (Whitehurst's signal bridge personnel had been decimated) the damaged destroyer escort limped into Kerama Retto for temporary patching. Then, seaworthy enough for a voyage to Hawaii, Whitehurst reached Pearl Harbor on 10 May and was docked for repairs and alterations. Post-war Once the yard work had been completed and the ship had been converted to a floating power station, Whitehurst departed Pearl Harbor on 25 July 1945, bound for the Philippine Islands. Soon after she reached Luzon, Japan capitulated. Nevertheless, the ship supplied the city of Manila with power from August through October 1945. She was scheduled to depart Manila on 1 November, bound for Guam; but a typhoon in the vicinity resulted in a two- day delay. Whitehurst eventually reached Guam on the afternoon of 7 November. Operating as a unit of Escort Division 40, Whitehurst supplied electrical power to the dredge YM-25 into 1946. Returning to the continental United States in April 1946, Whitehurst was decommissioned on 27 November 1946 and placed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Green Cove Springs, Florida, in January 1947. Korean War Reactivated in the summer of 1950 as a result of the outbreak of war in Korea, Whitehurst was recommissioned on 1 September 1950 and soon sailed for the Far East. The destroyer escort earned three battle stars for her activities during the Korean War between 25 February and 19 September 1951. In 1952, Whitehurst collided with the submarine during antisubmarine warfare exercises south of Barbers Point, Oahu, Hawaii.http://www.de634.org/Bugara.htm After repairs, she returned to the Far East, where she remained until 1955, when she returned to Pearl Harbor via Midway. After working locally out of Pearl Harbor for a year, the destroyer escort operated between Hawaii and Guam into 1956. Early in that year, she broadened her duties and itinerary by performing surveillance duties among the islands and atolls assigned the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. She also performed search and rescue missions in the Marianas and Carolines, periodically stopping at various islands to provide medical care for the natives and to record population changes. USS Whitehurst Memorial Plaque Departing Guam on 22 February for Yokosuka, Japan, the ship sailed via the northern Marianas, the Bonins, and the Volcano Islands. She spent two weeks in Japanese waters before returning to Guam on 17 March. Returning to the Central Carolines for patrol duties in early April 1956, Whitehurst stood by a damaged seaplane at the island of Lamotrek for two weeks before she returned to Guam on 14 April, en route to Pearl Harbor. After a period of local operations out of Pearl Harbor, Whitehurst headed back to the Far East and touched at Guam, Formosa, Hong Kong, and Sasebo, Japan, before representing the United States Navy at the graduation ceremonies of the Republic of Korea Naval Academy on 10 April. She returned to Sasebo before shifting to Yokosuka en route to Midway and Hawaii. Hollywood use Arriving at Pearl Harbor on 30 April 1957, Whitehurst underwent four weeks of upkeep and repairs before beginning six weeks of duty with 20th Century Fox during the filming of the World War II adventure film The Enemy Below. During that time, she portrayed the fictional destroyer escort \\"USS Haynes (DE-181)\\". Upon completion of filming, Whitehurst operated off Oahu until late in September, when she was ordered to Seattle, Washington, for duty as training ship with the 13th Naval District. The veteran destroyer escort trained naval reservists on weekend drill cruises and, during this time, made one extended cruise to Guaymas, Mexico, in November 1957. After being overhauled at Seattle from February to April 1958, Whitehurst returned to active training duties, becoming a Group II ASW reserve ship in July. On 6 December 1958, Whitehurst was transferred to the Naval Reserve and placed in an \\"in service\\" status as a unit of the Selected Reserve ASW Force. Reserve ASW force Thereafter, into the 1960s, Whitehurst cruised one weekend per month and made one two-week cruise per year. During the fiscal year 1961, the destroyer escort placed second in the national competition and the battle efficiency competition among the west coast Group II Naval Reserve destroyer escorts. Commissioned on 2 October 1961 for duty with the Pacific Fleet, Lieutenant Commander Donald L. MacLane, USNR, in command, Whitehurst operated actively with the fleet after being \\"called to the colors\\" as a result of the Berlin Crisis that autumn. The destroyer escort departed Seattle on the 4th, bound for her new home port of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. After a period of training in the Hawaiian area, Whitehurst departed Pearl Harbor on 10 February 1962 for a deployment to the Western Pacific (WestPac). During the deployment, she operated with the 7th Fleet out of Subic Bay, Philippines, and made a goodwill visit to Sapporo, Japan. The ship also operated in the South China Sea and the Gulf of Siam. Returning to the United States via Hawaii, Whitehurst arrived at Seattle in company with on 17 July 1962. Subsequently transferred back to the Naval Reserve on 1 August 1962 and placed in Group II in-service status as a Naval Reserve training ship, Whitehurst resumed operations out of Seattle. During 1963, the ship received two major changes in her configuration when her 40-millimeter mounts and ship- to-shore power reels ‚Äî the latter items having enabled her to function as a floating power station ‚Äî were removed. Whitehurst, in subsequent years, visited San Diego, California; Bellingham, Port Angeles, and Everett, Washington; and Esquimalt, British Columbia. On 17 January 1965 while operating in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and steaming in dense fog off the Vancouver narrows, Whitehurst collided with the Norwegian freighter SS Hoyanger. Both ships then ran aground in shallow water. The destroyer escort suffered a five-foot gash in her stern above the waterline while the freighter got off with three feet of scraped bow plates. The following day, both ships were pulled off by tugs. Whitehurst operated locally out of Seattle and ranged as far south as San Diego and San Francisco into 1969. From 1966 to 1968 the Whitehurst was commanded by LTCDR Charles Bryant. One of the highlights for the destroyer escort in 1966 was the visit of astronaut Commander Richard F. Gordon, Jr., USN, in November 1966. The ship transported Gordon and his family from Seattle to his home town of Bremerton on 18 November before she returned to her home port. End of career Whitehurst sinking as a target ship, April 28, 1971. Taken through the periscope of Trigger. Soon Whitehurst's home port was shifted to Portland, Oregon, from Seattle. The ship she was to replace, , was being deactivated as a Naval Reserve Force ship as part of an economy drive due to higher priority funding requirements for the Vietnam War. However, Whitehurst's days were also numbered, and she, too, was soon deactivated. On 12 July 1969, the destroyer escort was taken out of service and struck from the Navy List. Stripped of usable equipment, she was eventually taken to sea, and sunk as a target by on 28 April 1971. Awards Whitehurst earned six battle stars for her World War II service and three battle stars for Korean service.

Career =Early career (19701979)= Akio Sato made his professional wrestling debut in 1970 in the old Japan Pro Wrestling Alliance, but left that promotion in 1972 to co-found (with Giant Baba) All Japan Pro Wrestling. During the middle of the 70s Sato went to the US and competed in various territories. He first attracted the attention of the US fans when he competed for the NWA Central States territory run by Bob Geigel as a face teaming with people like Jerry Oates and the Viking. On February 19, 1976 Sato teamed up with promoter Bob Geigel to win the \\"Central States\\" version of the NWA World Tag-Team Titles. The team vacated the titles by July, most likely so that Geigel could focus on booking the territory. Sato and new partner Pat O‚ÄôConnor were unable to win the vacant titles. Sato next attracted the spotlight in the NWA Western States territory booked by Dick Murdoch and Blackjack Mulligan in Amarillo, Texas. Working as the heel Mr. Sato along with fellow Japanese wrestler Mr. Pogo the duo would win the Western States tag-team titles twice while feuding with Mulligan, Ted DiBiase, Merced Solis and Akihisa Takachiho (the future Great Kabuki). Sato would go on to win the title twice more, first with John Tolos and then towards the end of 1979 with Mr. Kiyomoto, a new name adopted by former foe Takachiho. =All Japan Pro Wrestling (19811989)= After gaining experience in the United States, Sato returned to Japan and started working for All Japan Pro Wrestling, a company he would regularly tour with throughout the 80s. On June 11, 1981 Sato and Takashi Ishikawa beat Kerry and David Von Erich for the All Asia Tag Team Championship in Tokyo, Japan. The team would hold the titles for 18 months until they were forced to vacate the titles when Sato was injured. Sato and Ishikawa won the titles once more when they defeated Animal Hamaguchi and Masanobu Kurisu for the vacant titles on April 15, 1985. The team held the gold for 3 months before being upended by Isamu Teranishi & Animal Hamaguchi. Over the years Sato would compete on AJPW's \\"Budokan Hall\\" shows which are considered the highlight of the tours. During these tours Sato would face off against such varied competition as Nick Bockwinkel, Austin Idol and Curtis Hughes. Because Sato only toured with the AJPW and wasn't a regular, he mainly worked with the foreign talent between 1986 and 1989. =Return to the United States= Central States Wrestling (1986) In 1986 Sato returned to the U.S. and his old stomping grounds of the NWA Central States territory. Here he won a 14-man battle royal on March 13, 1986, to win the NWA Central States Television title, eliminating Tommy Wright last to win the title. Three months later he would lose the title to Mike George before moving to a new territory. Continental Wrestling Association (1986‚Äì1988) Sato found himself working in Memphis for Jerry Jarrett & Jerry Lawler‚Äôs Continental Wrestling Association. In the CWA Akio Sato and Tarzan Goto formed a formidable team that managed to win the CWA/AWA International Tag Team Championship no less than five times. The duo beat future superstar Jeff Jarrett, tag-team legends the Sheepherders. Sato‚Äôs future partner Pat Tanaka as well as future partner Paul Diamond both on separate occasions and when they joined up to form Badd Company. In 1987, he would form another team with a young Hiromichi Fuyuki. Return to Central States (1988‚Äì1989) After a brief stop in the Pacific Northwest, Sato made one last run with the Central States territory in its dying days. Sato became the last ever Central States heavyweight champion holding the belt when the promotion closed its doors in 1989. After the CWA / AWA partnership was dissolved Sato went to the AWA to compete. =American Wrestling Association (1989)= In the AWA Sato was nicknamed the \\"Asian Assassin\\" and pushed as a cold-hearted heel. On February 7, 1989 Sato participated in a very well known battle royal for the vacant AWA World Heavyweight Championship. Larry Zbyszko won the title denying Sato his biggest opportunity ever. Later on Sato would unsuccessfully challenge Greg Gagne for the AWA International Television Championship. Near the end of his time in the AWA he participated in a feud between Pat Tanaka and Paul Diamond following the breakup of Badd Company. =World Wrestling Federation (1990‚Äì1996)= Sato's next move is the one that got him the most media attention as he signed with the World Wrestling Federation for the first time in his career. In early 1990 Sato along with former rival Pat Tanaka were introduced to the WWF as The Orient Express by manager Mr. Fuji. During this run, Sato introduced the Sitout Powerbomb to mainstream American wrestling for the first time. The Orient Express kicked off a prolonged feud with The Rockers that started at WrestleMania VI and continued off and on for well over a year. The Orient Express got involved in the Legion of Doom / Demolition feud because Mr. Fuji managed both teams. Demolition was being phased out and the Orient Express took on the Legion of Doom instead. The Legion of Doom / Orient Express feud was extremely onesided due to the Legion of Doom's massive size advantage. After WrestleMania VI Tanaka and Sato only made two Pay Per View appearances while in the WWF. Firstly at SummerSlam 1990 where the team were defeated by ‚ÄùHacksaw‚Äù Jim Duggan and Nikolai Volkoff. Secondly as part of the Sgt. Slaughter led team ‚ÄúThe Mercenaries‚Äù (that also included Boris Zhukov). Sato was pinned by Butch Miller 1:46 into the match and Tanaka was pinned by Tito Santana only moments later, 2:13 into the match. When Akio Sato decided to focus on foreign markets for the WWF in the latter days of 1990, they decided to reunite the team known as Badd Company, only this time with Paul Diamond wearing a mask to hide the fact that he's not Asian and using the name of Kato. Sato wrestled his last WWF Match in 1991 to team with Tanaka and ‚ÄúKato\\" for a 6-man tag-team match at a house show. He would also wrestle a match for WAR in 1992. In 1993, Sato made an appearance at SummerSlam as Yokozuna's flag bearer prior to his match against Lex Luger. Sato did return to the WWF in late 1994 as the white faced manager Shinja who advised Hakushi during his heel run with the company. When Hakushi turned face, Shinja was quietly written out of the storyline and Sato retired to focus on non-wrestling ventures. His last TV appearance was on the July 24, 1995, edition of Raw, when he was piledriven by Bret Hart. Sato now resides in Kansas City, Missouri. He retired in 1996 after a tour in Japan, mainly wrestling for WAR. Personal life In 1976, Sato married Betty Niccoli, whom he met in Bob Geigel's promotion in the United States. The couple had two daughters.

On 6 October 2016, Fitzgerald was announced as the President-elect of the University of Limerick. He took up this role in early 2017, becoming the fifth President. Prior to this, Desmond held the positions of Vice President for Health Affairs with University College Dublin and Chief Academic Officer at Ireland East Hospital Group from 2015 to 2016. Early life Fitzgerald was born on October 30, 1953 to Maureen O‚ÄôDonovan from Limerick and Thomas Joseph Fitzgerald from Belfast. Education Fitzgerald attended Oatlands College, Stillorgan, Co. Dublin. He studied medicine at University College Dublin (UCD), National University of Ireland and graduated with a MB, BAO, BCH (Honours), in 1977, and a Diploma in Mathematical Statistics from Trinity College Dublin in 1982. He was awarded an MD from the National University of Ireland in 1994. Early career Following his graduation from medical school at UCD and medical residency in the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, the Charitable Infirmary Jervis Street Hospital and the Richmond Hospital in Dublin, Desmond completed a Fellowship in the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin. In 1983, he moved to Vanderbilt University in Nashville in the US to train in clinical pharmacology and cardiology. He remained in the US to head a large coronary care facility and a research programme into the causes of cardiovascular disease. Clinical appointments In 1991, Fitzgerald returned to University College Dublin and shortly after this he established a research laboratory and held attending physician positions at several Dublin hospitals. In 1994, he was appointed Professor and Head of Department of Clinical Pharmacology at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. Research interests Over the next 10 years, he built a research programme that bridged basic research and the clinical sciences. These included the RCSI Clinical Research Centre; the Institute for Biopharmaceutical Sciences; SurGen, a pharmacogenomics company; the RCSI Centre for Human Proteomics; Java Clinical Research, a spin-out CRO; the RCSI biobanking facility; and a bioinformatics programme that in partnership with Siemens designed the innovative ‚Äòproteomics pipeline‚Äô. He led the development of the College's translational medicine research programme, which culminated in the Programme for Human Genomics, a ‚Ç¨42m research partnership between the three medical schools in Dublin that has since grown into the national programme for translational medicine (Molecular Medicine Ireland). From 2002, he was appointed as Director of Research and a member of the senior management team at RCSI. University College Dublin In 2004, Fitzgerald was appointed Vice President for Research and Professor of Molecular Medicine in UCD. Fitzgerald developed the research strategy and oversaw its implementation through a new organisation, UCD Research. In five years, the university soared in global rankings to enter the top 100, trebled its research funding and increased its rate of academic publication by 250%. Central to the research strategy in UCD has been the development of a series of multi-disciplinary programmes with a strong translational focus. These have included six research institutes spanning humanities, social sciences, engineering, science and business; two Centres for Science Engineering and Technology; and seven Strategic Research Clusters. He developed a series of programmes in the humanities targeting major societal challenges in areas that included education and child development. Fitzgerald established 7 structured PhD programmes and a Researcher Career Framework and led the strategic recruitment of a large group of academics (the Stokes Lectureships and Professorships). Fitzgerald was criticised for his high salary on joining UCD from RCSI. In reality, his package was in all likelihood less than at RCSI. UCD consistently defended the salary on the basis that he achieved a major turnaround in research funding, amounting to ‚Ç¨1bn during his watch. UCD - Science District Fitzgerald led the development of the UCD Science Centre, a ‚Ç¨300m development that was funded through philanthropy and successive bids to the national investment fund in higher education, the Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions. Phase I opened in September 2011, with Phase II completed in September 2013, and as of October 2016, Phase III is in the planning stage. From the outset, it was envisaged that computational science and informatics would be central to the development. This ambition has been realized with an ‚Ç¨80m national data analytics centre award to UCD and its partners in 2013. The UCD Science District includes several major programmes, include The Earth Institute and INSIGHT, the national data analytics programme. It is also home to Ireland's largest and most comprehensive campus for education and research in the Health Sciences, spanning biomedical research, population science and health services research. Fitzgerald also developed a science outreach programme, including the UCD Imagine Science Film Festival and Science Expression. Biomedical and Health Research During his tenure at UCD, Fitzgerald has played a central role in the development of biomedical and health research, and building links to the hospital campuses. Central to these efforts has been the UCD Conway Institute for Biomolecular and Biomedical Research, opened in 2002, a 13,000 sq m facility that is home to 400+ biomedical researchers. Several state-of-the-art technology platforms have been developed in the Institute to support the biomedical community, including comprehensive proteomics facilities, gene sequencing and bioinformatics. Based on these capabilities, the Institute was well positioned in 2009 to establish the ‚Ç¨20m national programme in Systems Biology funded by Science Foundation Ireland. Allied to the UCD Conway Institute are facilities for translational medicine, with the core goal of improving patient care. The facilities include the Clinical Research Centres on the hospital campuses and the ‚Ç¨18m Charles Institute for dermatology research and training. Extensive resources have been built for drug development. These include the ‚Ç¨50m Centre for Molecular Innovation and Drug Discovery and the ‚Ç¨58m National Institute for Bioprocessing Research and Training. Other facilities include the Centre for Nanomedicine, which is developing technologies for stem cell therapy, drug delivery and human imaging. Strong links have been forged in nutrition between the biomedical programme and food science through the UCD Institute of Food and Health, which opened in 2011. Several programs were initiated to develop novel technologies for healthcare. These include Technology Research for Independent Living, a unique partnership with Intel and GE Healthcare that is developing health technologies for deployment in the home and the Enterprise Ireland-funded centre, Applied Research for Connected Health. Vice-President for Health Affairs, UCD and Chief Academic Officer of the Ireland East Hospital Group After 2013, Fitzgerald was appointed Principal of the College of Health Sciences, Vice-President for Health Affairs at UCD, and Chief Academic Officer of the Ireland East Hospital Group to drive the development of health sciences at UCD and their integration with the affiliated hospitals. The initiative is central to the development of the emerging Academic Health Sciences Centre, a partnership between UCD and 11 hospitals, including two major teaching hospitals, the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital and St. Vincent's University Hospital. Board membership Fitzgerald has also worked on the Boards of medical charities and national agencies. As Chairman of the health-funding agency, the Health Research Board, his key achievement was securing ‚Ç¨50m exchequer funding for national clinical research centers attached to medical schools. To date, three clinical research centres have been completed, in addition to the centre at RCSI, which he developed in 2002. University of Limerick Fitzgerald was appointed as President of UL in 2016 and took up his appointment in 2017. On 26 May 2020, he announced his intention to step down as President. In a statement, UL confirmed that Dr Fitzgerald will end his term later this year and that the Governing Authority of the University will shortly begin an international recruitment process to select a replacement. Dr. Fitzgerald said he had taken the decision to resign in the context of Covid-19. Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Industry Engagement Fitzgerald developed extensive partnerships with industry centered on UCD's key research themes. These industry partnerships are pivotal to two Centres for Science Engineering and Technology and the seven Strategic Research Clusters on campus and involve upwards of 350 companies. In addition, UCD was awarded three industry-led Enterprise Ireland Technology Centres, including Food Health Ireland, Applied Research for Connected Health and the Centre for Advanced Research in Data Analytics. Fitzgerald also developed the Knowledge Centre within the new UCD Science District to foster innovation and entrepreneurship. The Knowledge Centre is home to the Innovation Academy, which was established in 2011 to provide a unique programme in innovation and entrepreneurship to PhD students, and was extended to the Irish government's Springboard initiative. Other works Fitzgerald established the Office for EU Research to drive the university's efforts in Europe and led an International Strategic Collaboration Award to develop collaborative research in China, building on UCD's educational programs in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. Personal research Fitzgerald has published over 200 papers in cardiovascular research. His current research is in atherothrombosis. He has established several companies, including SurGen, which developed pharmacogenetics in support of clinical trials and Java Clinical Research Ltd., a company that develops technologies for the clinical investigation of drugs. Personal life Desmond Fitzgerald is married to Margaret Fitzgerald, and they have two daughters.

Professional wrestling career =Early career= Alex Pourteau was trained by Jim Star and Skandor Akbar, before he began to wrestle for World Class Championship Wrestling between 1988 and 1989. Although Pourteau won no championship gold he did get a break under the tutelage of Skandor Akbar. After wrestling for WCCW in Dallas, Texas; Pourteau left WCCW for both the United States Wrestling Association and World Championship Wrestling in 1989 Pourteau remained with both for one year, leaving in 1990. Pourteau again did not win championship gold and in 1991 began wrestling for World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico and the Global Wrestling Federation. =GWF, Puerto Rico and Japan= Pourteau, working for the GWF, won their Global Wrestling Federation Light Heavyweight Championship on four occasions. His first reign began on July 31, 1992, when he defeated Terry Simms. He would lose the title to Mike Dahl on October 23, 1991; after winning the World Wrestling Council World Junior Heavyweight Championship. Pourteau then went on tour with World Wrestling Council and whilst on the tour won the World Wrestling Council World Junior Heavyweight Championship by defeating Ricky Santana on September 4, 1991. He lost the title on September 21 of the same year and returned to the GWF. He did not return to World Wrestling Council following the tour. After returning to the Global Wrestling Federation, he again won the GWF Light Heavyweight Championship on January 22, 1993, by defeating Mike Dahl. Pourteau lost the title to Calvin Knapp but won the championship a third time after defeating Steven Dane after Knapp had vacated the title. On February 20, 1994, he lost the title, once again to Knapp, whom he defeated for the championship in August 1994 in Guatemala. Later in the same month, Pourteau lost the championship to Osamu Nishimura, with the GWF closing in September 1994. Pourteau also began teaming with Shawn Summers, in a tag team known as the Beach Bullies, although the team had no championship success. Pourteau had also begun to wrestle for Network of Wrestling in Japan for two years, beginning in 1993 and ending in 1995. Pourteau, whilst wrestling for the company, had no championship success. =World Wrestling Federation= Pourteau had worked for the World Wrestling Federation on odd occasions from 1994, but began to wrestle full-time for the company in 1996. Pourteau received a push from the WWF, under the name Alex \\"The Pug\\" Pourteau, with the gimmick of an amateur wrestler (using the theme song The Steiner Brothers used in the WWF), however his character did not last. Sometimes he teamed up with Aldo Montoya and Bob Holly.

He now works as an anchor for KVOA, the NBC affiliate in Tucson, Arizona and the National Wrestling Alliance. He was born in Rochester, New York. WWF career Mooney debuted on the May 15, 1988 edition of WWF Wrestling Challenge, replacing announcer Craig DeGeorge. During his time in the WWF, Mooney's primary duties included play-by-play announcing for matches aired on Prime Time Wrestling, WWF Mania, WWF All-American Wrestling, as host of Coliseum Video releases (where he also provided commentary for \\"exclusive\\" matches), and hosting the \\"Events Center\\" segment during the WWF's syndicated TV shows, such as WWF Superstars and WWF Wrestling Challenge. The \\"Event Center\\" was a segment used to promote feuds and house shows. During a moment where Earthquake squashed Jake Roberts‚Äô pet snake Damian, cuts were made to Mooney in the \\"Event Center\\" to censor out the moments of impact. Mooney made his pay-per-view debut at the first SummerSlam in August 1988 as an interviewer. On occasion, Mooney portrayed his fictional siblings, an identical twin sister named Betty on Prime Time Wrestling (alongside heel wrestlers including Sensational Sherri) and identical twin brother Ian Mooney while co-hosting Wrestling Spotlight. Mooney's last major appearances were at the 1992 Survivor Series and early episodes of WWF Monday Night Raw, with his actual last appearance on WWF TV as the host of the countdown show to WrestleMania IX. In April 1993, his contract expired and he opted not to renew it. He was replaced by Todd Pettengill as an interviewer and Event Center personality and by Gorilla Monsoon on WWF Mania and WWF All-American Wrestling for play-by-play. =Later appearances= He reappeared on WWE TV in October 2005, during the pre-show to WWE Raws \\"Homecoming\\" to the USA Network. The pre-show simply ran through some past moments of RAW on the USA Network, with several people involved with the WWE during the first years of Monday Night Raw, including Mooney, sharing their memories of the WWE during that period. Mooney once again returned to WWE on July 23, 2012 for the 1,000th episode of Raw by interviewing Daniel Bryan backstage. Mooney returned again on the ‚ÄúOld School‚Äù edition of The Edge and Christian Show That Totally Reeks of Awesomeness and later in a 2017 DVD release called WWE Unreleased 1986‚Äì1995 co-hosting with Charly Caruso. Mooney also appeared on the Top 25 Raw moments celebration which was shown on the WWE Network on January 15, 2018. Non-WWF career Mooney worked as an on-camera host and producer for Major League Baseball Productions in the early 1980s before working for the WWF. Following this, he became an anchorman for WWOR-TV, based in Secaucus, New Jersey. He worked there until 1997, when he was replaced by Ernie Anastos. He moved that year to WBZ in Boston where he served as anchorman for just under a year. Mooney has been a reporter with Fox Sports Arizona since July 2000 focusing on University of Arizona football and basketball. In 2010, he presented Fox Sports coverage of Rugby around the world and the Rugbyville USA camp in Glendale, Colorado. He was hired by KVOA TV in 2012 to become a weekend news anchor for News 4 Tucson. He also hosts a podcast on the MLW Radio Network called Prime Time with Sean Mooney, which was co-hosted by former WWE wrestler \\"Hacksaw\\" Jim Duggan for its first 18 episodes. On July 13, 2018, it was announced Mooney will commentate the ALL IN broadcast with Don Callis, Ian Riccaboni, Excalibur, Alicia Atout, Justin Roberts, and Bobby Cruise On January 27, 2020 it was announced that Mooney would be joining the National Wrestling Alliance broadcast team. He debuted on the January 28 episode of NWA Power interviewing Nick Aldis.

Early life Plaschkes was born in Vienna. His father, a butcher, was from Bratislava and his mother from Budapest. Plaschkes left for England at the age of ten, although he always expressed doubts about his date of birth‚Äîhis personal papers gave three different birth dates‚Äîand felt that his mother may have added a year to qualify him for the kindertransport, which enabled him to escape the Nazi regime. After arriving in England, he was temporarily adopted by a family in Liverpool, but, more fortunately than many other Jewish refugees,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/17/movies/otto- plaschkes-75-producer-of-georgy-girl-and-other-films-dies.html was soon reunited with his parents, younger brother and older sister in Salisbury, where he was to grow up and where his father started a sausage casing business. Plaschkes attended Bishop Wordsworth's School, where William Golding was amongst his teachers; many of his contemporaries have claimed that he was in fact the inspiration for the sensitive, overweight character of Piggy in Golding's Lord of the Flies, a claim which Golding never confirmed or denied. Plaschkes went on to read History at Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he was a member of the Cambridge Film Society, and then took an education diploma at Wadham College, Oxford. Career Having gained an enthusiasm for film, he wrote to Sir Michael Balcon at Ealing Studios, who offered him a job as a runner. He was soon promoted to production assistant and also worked in the cutting room. By 1960, he was assistant director to Otto Preminger on Exodus and in 1962 worked as a production assistant on Lawrence of Arabia. He went on to become a producer in his own right: in 1965 he bought the rights to the Margaret Forster novel Georgy Girl, casting James Mason and Lynn Redgrave (after her sister Vanessa dropped out) in the leads. The film went on to be a great success. Plaschkes was keen to have his favourite singing group The Seekers record the title song for Georgy Girl. The song was written by Tom Springfield (music) and Jim Dale (lyrics), and recorded by The Seekers as opening and closing credits for the film, and a second version as a composite recording for inclusion on the group's Come The Day album. When Capitol Records released it in the US as a single, it went to number one, displacing The Monkees' \\"I'm a Believer,\\" and making The Seekers the first Australian group to top the US charts. Among the other films he produced were The Homecoming (1973), Galileo (1975) and Hopscotch (1980), which was his most commercially successful film. Personal life Plaschkes met his future wife, Louise Stein, at an after shooting party for The Homecoming, and they married in 1975, later having a daughter, Valli. On Valentine's day 2005, Plaschkes, as a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, had just attended a West End screening of Kay Pollak's As It Is in Heaven, which had been nominated for the Oscar for best foreign language film. On leaving the theatre, he suffered a fatal heart attack. He was 75 and was survived by his wife and daughter.

History Holland & Barrett was formed in 1870 by Alfred Slapps Barrett and Major William Holland, who bought a grocery store in Bishop's Stortford, selling groceries and clothing.Bishops Stortford and Thorley - A History and Guide , They developed their business into two shops ‚Äì a grocery store and a clothing store. It is also evident that in 1900 they occupied a store in the High Street of Epsom. In the 1920s, Alfred Button & Sons bought the business and kept the name Holland & Barrett. Holland & Barrett has since changed hands a number of times. In 1970, Booker acquired Holland & Barrett, also acquiring Heath & Heather stores which they later renamed Holland & Barrett. Lloyds Pharmacy purchased Holland & Barrett in 1992, after which NBTY acquired Holland & Barrett in 1997. NBTY was bought by American private equity firm The Carlyle Group in 2010. The brand has become synonymous with the sale of vitamins, supplements and homeopathy, to the point that pro-homeopathy former MP David Tredinnick has been dubbed \\"The Hon. Member for Holland and Barrett\\". On 21 June 2017, it was announced that a series of negotiations had commenced by NBTY on behalf of The Carlyle Group to sell off Holland & Barrett in its entirety. A few companies showed interest in acquiring the company, namely A.S. Watson the owner of Superdrug and The Perfume Shop, and KKR the private equity firm both showed an interest in early negotiations. It was a sale that could potentially be worth $6bn. On 26 June 2017, it was reported that Holland & Barrett was sold for ¬£1.8 billion to L1 Retail, a group controlled by Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman. Advertising Singer Kim Wilde featured in Holland & Barrett TV advertising between 2004‚Äì05. Former Blue Peter presenter Gethin Jones and actor David Jason have also voiced them. A number of Holland & Barrett's advertisements and point of sale displays have been adjudicated as misleading, making unfair comparisons or claims that are unsupported by robust evidence. Franchising In the 2000s the company started to expand internationally using franchising. The first three franchise stores opened in October 2008 in Durban, South Africa and the company subsequently had nine franchise stores operating in South Africa, all by the same franchisee. In Singapore the company set up sixteen franchise stores and in Malta one store was added in 2009. A global expansion plan was set up for the Holland & Barrett brand with bigger country franchise partners, and several country additions to the franchise business were expected in 2010. \\"Workfare\\" controversy From February 2012, Holland & Barrett in the UK were subject to adverse publicity, boycotts and demonstrations at stores, due to their use of workfare participants. The company published no corporate response or interaction via social media for several months until, on 5 July 2012, Holland & Barrett announced it was pulling out of the scheme, citing the negative publicity. The Guardian reported that the company was \\"no longer prepared to face further bad press and in-store protests\\", attributing the change of mind to pressure from Solidarity Federation and Boycott Workfare. Holland & Barrett will \\"now pay all its workforce\\" and will \\"henceforth only take apprentices paid at the national rate of ¬£2.60 an hour\\".

It is located on the Island Line from Ryde to Shanklin. Owing to its secluded location and single operational platform, it is one of the quietest stations on the island.  History  The station was opened in 1864 by the Isle of Wight Railway on their initial Ryde-Shanklin line. In 1882 it became a junction station, when the Brading-Bembridge branch line opened as part of the Brading Haven reclamation scheme. The branch line closed to passengers in 1953 and completely in 1957. Under Southern Railway ownership, the passing loop was extended southwards from Brading to Sandown in 1927, forming a second section of double track on the Island Line. Brading was one of the last stations on the British Rail network to retain gas lighting, with the fittings converted to mercury vapour usage in 1985. As of 2010 some of the fittings were still in use, now using compact fluorescent bulbs. Brading station, 1985 Brading signalbox closed on 28 October 1988, and the passing loop at Brading station was removed, meaning that only one platform remained in use. This meant trains could no longer run at even 30-minute intervals on the line. By 1998 the signal box and branch platforms were very overgrown and the buildings were threatened with demolition. In August 2007 Brading Town Council announced a plan to revamp the exterior of the station buildings and former signal box,The News, Portsmouth, 3 August 2007 and have used grants and volunteers to gradually reopen different parts of the station, with the whole of the station and signal box fully opening to the public in March 2010 for the first time in 40 years. Both the signal box and main station building are Grade II listed, along with the station building on the east platform, the footbridge, and the station house.  Services and facilities  Exterior of station in 2017 right The restored signal box and station buildings are now home to a heritage centre, caf√©, museum and a Tourist Information Point along with a bike hire shop. No railway staff are present at the station, with tickets available from an automatic machine or from the guard on board the train. Trains for both directions leave from the same platform, as since 1988 the line has been single track. The present level of service is normally two trains per hour each way. In common with the rest of Island Line, trains currently run separated by a 20 or 40 minute gap.  Future  An announcement on 16 September 2019 confirmed that a passing loop will be reinstated at Brading to allow trains to run at regular half-hourly intervals. Isle of Wight MP Bob Seely said: I am... pleased that a new passing loop will be introduced at Brading. This will improve connectivity with cross- Solent sailings at peak times, and complements the allocated funding from Network Rail to renew Ryde Railway Pier. ¬£1m to fund building the passing loop is from local sources with ¬£300,000 from the Isle of Wight Council and the remainder from local businesses through the Solent Local Enterprise Partnership. A second platform will be opened to passenger use, according to the brief given to potential contractors for the work on the upgrade and the level crossing to the south of the station will be upgraded to give step-free access to the southbound platform.

He most recently served as head coach of HC Fribourg-Gott√©ron of the Swiss top-flight NLA.  Playing career  Huras turned pro in 1975, when he was picked by the New York Rangers in the NHL draft (5th round, 84th overall). He spent some time in the International Hockey League (IHL) and American Hockey League (AHL), before his National Hockey League (NHL) debut on February 27, 1977 with the Rangers, for whom he played his only two NHL games. In the following three seasons, he strengthened the roster of Salt Lake Golden Eagles and Dallas Black Hawks of the Central Hockey League (CHL), followed by a stint with the Port Huron Flags in the IHL. In 1980, Huras signed with Grenoble m√©tropole hockey 38 in France. He spent three years with the club, before heading to another French team, Gap Hockey Club. He transferred to the Dragons de Rouen in 1988 and captured four French national championships in six years with the club, three of them as a player-coach.  Coaching career  After his Rouen player-coach tenure, including three French championships, Huras was named head coach of Z√ºrcher SC of the Swiss elite league NLA in 1994, where he remained at the helm for two years. During the 1996-97 season, he was hired by fellow NLA side HC Ambri- Piotta. Under his guidance, Ambri completed the 1998-99 regular season on top of the table before losing the finals to HC Lugano. He received Switzerland Coach of the Year honors that season. Huras guided the team to semifinal appearances in 1997-98 and 1999-00 and also established the club on the international stage, winning two IIHF Continental Cup titles (1998 and 1999) as well as the 1999 IIHF Super Cup with the team. Ambri and Huras did not come to terms on a new contract in 2000, so he accepted an offer to return to Z√ºrcher SC for a second stint in charge at the club. At ZSC, he added to his title haul, winning the 2001 Swiss national championship and the IIHF Continental Cup. He was sacked in November 2001, after suffering defeat in eleven of 23 games since the beginning of the 2001-02 campaign. Huras stayed in the Swiss NLA and was appointed head coach of HC Lugano prior to the 2002-03 season. He led the team to the Swiss championship his first year and to the finals in 2003-04. Huras was relieved of his duties during the 2006 playoffs quarterfinals and replaced by Harold Kreis, who went on to win the title with the team. For a second time in his career, he took over head coaching duties at HC Ambri-Piotta in November 2006. He pulled the team away from the bottom of the National League A and managed to keep Ambri in the league. After stints with the Stavanger Oilers of Norway (2007‚Äì08) and Villacher SV of Austria (2008‚Äì09), Huras was back in Switzerland, taking the helm of SC Bern in 2009. He had immediate success, guiding SCB to the NLA title his first year. In his second season, Bern reached the semifinals. Huras was removed from the position in October 2011, his third year at the helm, because the club executives wanted a \\"more attractive style of ice hockey\\". Only a couple of days later, he returned for a second spell at HC Lugano. His tenure ended at the end of the 2012-13 season. In November 2013, Huras joined the coaching staff of EHC M√ºnchen of the German DEL, serving as an assistant to Pierre Pag√©. He was named head coach of then reigning German champion ERC Ingolstadt for the 2014-15 season and guided the Panthers to another appearance in the DEL finals, where they fell short to Adler Mannheim. Huras parted ways with Ingolstadt after one year and took the head coaching job at Modo Hockey in Sweden's SHL. Following a bad start to the 2015-16 season, collecting ten points from the opening 15 games and losing seven straight games, Huras and his staff were sacked in November 2015. In late September 2016, he was named head coach of HC Fribourg-Gott√©ron of the NLA, replacing Gerd Zenh√§usern. Huras guided Fribourg to a semifinal appearance in the Champions Hockey League in the 2016-17 season where they fell short to Fr√∂lunda HC. In the NLA, his team did not qualify for the play-offs, Huras and Fribourg parted company after the season. Private life Huras is married and has two sons and one daughter. His hobbies are water skiing, skiing, golf, fishing, reading and music.

'Woronora' is an Aboriginal place name. Records show the spelling of the name has varied since it first appeared in the 19th century, the earliest being Wooloonora (Dixon, 1827, quoted in Walker 1974:66, followed by Wolonora (Dixon, 1837, and Woronora Mitchell, 1835). The name was first applied to the Woronora River, a tributary of the Georges River, before being given to an electoral district, a local road east of the river, and finally the suburb itself. The Woronora River rises on the northwestern slopes of the Illawarra escarpment and has its origin from Waratah Rivulet, near Darkes Forest, and flows generally north for approximately 36 kilometres (22 mi), joined by three minor tributaries, before reaching its confluence with the Georges River, between Como and Illawong. Location and features It has its origin from Waratah Rivulet, near Darkes Forest, and flows generally north for approximately , joined by three minor tributaries, before reaching its confluence with the Georges River, between Como and Illawong. The total catchment area of the river is approximately and the area is generally administered by the Sydney Catchment Authority in its upper reaches and the Sutherland Shire Council in its lower reaches. Much of the course of the river is through the Dharawal State Conservation Area, Heathcote National Park and the Royal National Park as it descends from source to mouth. The river is impounded by the Woronora Dam, opened in 1941. The impoundment is Lake Woronora, formed to augment water supply for southern Sydney and the northern Illawarra region. The Woronora River is traversed by high level and low level road bridges and a footbridge in the suburb of Woronora. A road bridge on Heathcote Road, linking Heathcote and Holsworthy also provides a crossing over the river. At the area known as \\"The Needles\\", near Woronora Road in , a footbridge links the suburb to Barden Ridge. Comment from an ex resident: \\"The Needles\\" were considered the \\"head of navigation\\" where there was relatively deep water with pointed vertical rocks, mostly just below the surface, hence the name. There was a causeway there which was part of \\"The Old Illawarra Rd\\". This area is below the Heathcote Rd bridge by about 3/4 km. Just above this road bridge was \\"Woronora Wier\\" which was demolished in the mid 1900s for safety reasons. Etymology In the Australian Aboriginal Dharug language the river draws its name, meaning \\"black rocks\\". 'Woronora' is an Aboriginal place name.

It was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2013. Jaipur, Principal Street, c. 1875 Hawa Mahal, and the Principal Street of Jaipur, c. 1875 Jaipur, 1907. Jaipur the capital of Rajasthan state in India was founded in 1727 by Maharaj Jai Singh II, who ruled Jaipur State from 1699‚Äì1744. Initially his capital was Amber, which lies at a distance of 11 km ferest while designing this city of victory. He consulted several books on architecture and architects before making the layout of Jaipur. Overview Jai Singh was keen on the security aspect of the City because of the increasing foreign threats towards northern India. Due to this reason, he focused on his scientific and cultural interests to make a brilliant city. Being a lover of mathematics and science, Jai Singh sought advice from Vidyadhar Bhattacharya, a Brahmin scholar of Bengal, to aid him to design the city architecture. Vidyadhar referred the ancient Indian literature on astronomy, books of Ptolemy and Euclid, and discussed the plan with the King. With a strategic plan, the construction of the city started in 1727. It took around 4 years to complete the major palaces, roads and square. The city was built following the principles of Vastu Shastra. The city was divided into nine blocks, out of which two consist the state buildings and palaces, whereas the remaining seven blocks were allotted to the public. In order to ensure the security, huge fortification walls were made along with seven strong gates. According to that time, architecture of the town was very advanced and certainly the best in Indian subcontinent. In 1876, when Prince of Wales visited Jaipur, the whole city was painted pink to welcome him and after that Jaipur was titled ‚ÄòPink City‚Äô. Still, the neat and broadly laid-out avenues, painted in pink provide a magical charm to the city. Jaipur is rich in its cultural and architectural beauty, which can be traced in the various historical and aesthetic places that reside in the city. In the 19th century the city grew rapidly and became prosperous; by 1900 it had a population of 160,000. The city's wide boulevards were paved and lit with gas. The city had several hospitals. Its chief industries were in metals and marble, fostered by a school of art founded in 1868. The city also had three colleges, including a Sanskrit college (1865) and a girls' school (1867) initiated under the reign of the enigmatic Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh II.sir jadunath sarkar Post- Independence See also * Dhundhar References ","title":"History of Jaipur"},{"id":"4352677","text":"Punched card turnaround document included as part of a phone bill in 1983 A turnaround document is a document that has been output from a computer, some extra information potentially added to it, and then returned to become an input document.

He is best known for his appearances with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in the late-1980s under the ring name Siva Afi.  Early life  Max Taogaga was born in Samoa on 28 April 1949. He attended Avele Agricultural College in Apia. As a young man, he relocated to New Zealand where he worked in a slaughterhouse. Professional wrestling career = Early career (1975‚Äì1978) = After deciding to become a professional wrestler, Taogaga went to Steve Rickard and Peter Maivia who trained him for two years. In his debut match in 1975, Taogaga defeated one of New Zealand's top light heavyweights, Del Adams. For the next four years Taogaga continued to work his way up through the ranks, wrestling the majority of foreign visitors to the country. Finally in 1978 he earned his big break, defeating Big John Da Silva in the final of an elimination tournament to decide the new, New Zealand Heavyweight Champion. Over the next few months, Taogaga successfully defended the title before heading to the U.S. at the end of 1978. = International appearances (1978‚Äì1986) = For the next seven years Taogaga split his time between the U.S., New Zealand, Australia and Japan. However, it was in Hawaii that Taogaga would be the most successful. It was here, in 1985, where he wrestled Ric Flair to a one-hour time limit draw for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in front of 12,000 people. =World Wrestling Federation (1986‚Äì1988)= In January 1986, Taogaga signed with Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation (WWF), making his debut on January 23rd at a house show in Anaheim, CA in a win over Tim Patterson. He would later make his debut on Prime Time Wrestling, where he was billed as \\"'Superfly' Afi\\", and deemed to be the cousin of Jimmy Snuka. On the March 8th episode of The Body Shop, Afi was introduced to viewers of WWF All Star Wrestling as Snuka's cousin. Afi was undefeated initially, albeit against lower level competition such as Rene Goulet, Barry O, Ron Shaw, and Matt Bourne. On March 6th, 1986 he gained his first significant victory when he pinned Bret Hart at a house show in Buffalo, NY. Afi's undefeated streak ended three days later when he lost to Hart's partner Jim Neidhart in Landover, MD, but he continued to be pushed. Afi gained victories in April over Hercules Hernandez and Paul Roma. However fans were unaccepting of Afi as the replacement for the departed Jimmy Snuka, and openly heckled him in matches. He began to slide down the card, losing that spring to Bret Hart, Don Muraco, and Jake Roberts. By the summer all momentum had ceased. Now billed as \\"Sivi Afi\\", he became a near enhancement talent and lost to the likes of Bret Hart, Randy Savage, Harley Race and Ted DiBiase. In the summer of 1986 he formed a short lived tag-team with King Tonga, but the duo was generally unsuccessful.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/86.htm Toagaga entered 1987 firmly established as an upper-level enhancement star, losing regularly to Hercules and others but continuing to gain victories against other opening-level talent such as Frenchy Martin and Terry Gibbs. He was used frequently as a substitute when other wrestlers could not make house shows, teaming with others such as Raymond Rougeau. In the summer of 1987 he entered a lengthy losing streak, falling to preliminary competition such as Steve Lombardi and Frenchy Martin. Following a loss to Ted Dibiase on December 9 at a Wrestling Challenge taping in Fort Myers, Toagaga went on a hiatus.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/87.htm In 1988, after teaming for a short time with Haku as one half of The Islanders, he also wrestled in six man tags with the original Islanders, Haku and Tama. He debuted a new gimmick, that of \\"High Chief Afi\\", a Samoan chieftain. As part of his gimmick, Taogaga had gotten his legs and abdomen heavily tattooed (ala High Chief Peter Maivia). Unfortunately for Taogaga, it was all for naught; Tama would shortly thereafter depart from the WWF and Haku was repackaged as \\"King Haku\\" to replace the injured Harley Race, leaving Taogaga without a team or manager. His last match came on August 27th, 1988 in Burlington, VT against SD Jones.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/88.htmTaogaga left the WWF and went on to work for Burt Reynolds as a stuntman and bodyguard. = Late career (1988‚Äì1997) = Taogaga made his return to New Zealand in 1990 to appear for Steve Rickard's \\"The Main Event\\". Taogaga defeated all comers during the short-lived show, becoming the new Commonwealth Heavyweight Champion in the process. After the cancellation of \\"The Main Event\\", Taogaga resumed touring the world appearing in areas as far flung as Palestine, Israel, England and Africa. in 1991 Siva found Jeff Miller aka The Metal Maniac, realizing his gift of Gab and athletic ability Siva broke Metal Maniac into the business, training him in the basics and securing a spot to travel and work with Superfly Jimmy Snuka. In 1997, after over 23 years on the road, Taogaga retired from the business, wrestling his final match in South Africa.  Personal life  Upon receiving a traditional pe'a Taogaga adopted the honorific Papali'itele. In October 1997, Taogaga was indicted by the Cuyahoga County, Ohio Grand Jury for acting as the \\"getaway driver\\" for a robbery, burglary and kidnapping carried out in January 1996. He was subsequently convicted of one count of aggravated burglary, two counts of aggravated robbery, and seven counts of kidnapping, and sentenced to 15 to 40 years' incarceration. Following a series of appeals against his original sentence, Taogaga was released from the North Central Correctional Institution in 2007 and deported back to Samoa.
