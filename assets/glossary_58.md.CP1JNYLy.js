Biography Son of former President of the Brazilian Republic Jo√£o Goulart and Dona Maria Thereza, he lived his childhood and adolescence in exile in Uruguay with his parents. He was one of the founders of the Democratic Labor Party, alongside his uncle Leonel Brizola. He is the founder and current president of Instituto Jo√£o Goulart (Jo√£o Goulart Institute), which aims to promote historical research and reflection on the Brazilian political process in favor of national sovereignty. During his lifetime, he served as a deputy at the Legislative Assembly of Rio Grande do Sul in 1982, elected by PDT. In 2002, he ran for federal deputy for PGT,Candidatos a Deputado Federal a party that merged with the Liberal Party together with PST in 2003. He returned to PDT, where he remained until early 2017, when he left in opposition to party support for the Rodrigo Rollemberg (PSB) government in the Federal District after the governor barred construction of the Memorial da Liberdade e Democracia Presidente Jo√£o Goulart (President Jo√£o Goulart Freedom and Democracy Memorial). =Lawsuit against the United States= During the promotion of his book on Brazilian territory in November, 2002, Lincoln Gordon, former U.S. ambassador to Brazil in 1964, admitted that the CIA had bought Brazilian congressmen for five million dollars for the coup against Jo√£o Goulart, in addition to the logistical and military support. This led the Goulart family to raise a lawsuit for moral, property and image damages against the United States, with the desire to eventually take the case to the World Court. The 3rd Panel of the Superior Court of Justice, under the report of Nancy Andrighi's minister, would have to decide whether the act was an act of empire (\\"anyone who contains an order or a co-active decision of the administration for the administered, such as an expropriation decree, an interdiction order or a requisition of assets\\") or an act of management (\\"act of management are those that the administration practices without using its supremacy over the recipients. This occurs in acts purely of administration of public goods and services and in negotiations with private parties, which do not require coercion over the interested parties\\"). This action was an appeal after the federal judge of the 10th Circuit Court of Rio de Janeiro extinguished the case, under the interpretation that it was an act of empire. The Federal Regional Court of the 2nd Region considered that the competence to handle the case lies with the STJ. Nancy Andrighi considered that the United States has committed an act of management, thus, welcoming the appeal. However, there was no consensus among the ministers of the 3rd Class. In March 2008, Minister Sidnei Beneti of the Supreme Court of Justice postponed the analysis of the action. The trial was returned on 24 June of 2008. The STJ finally dismissed the case, considering that the United States has immunity under Brazilian law and the STF finally denied the request in 2010, recognizing that the United States has immunity against Brazilian law. =Presidential Campaign 2018= He was launched by the Free Fatherland Party (PPL) as a candidate for the presidency of Brazil for the 2018 elections, with L√©o da Silva Alves as his running mate. His campaign aimed to resume the labor and social reforms (pt) that, according to him, \\"were being developed and the process was interrupted with the military coup of 1964\\". In the election, he received 30,176 votes (0.03% of the votes), ranking last and not qualifying for the second round. In December 2018, since it did not reach that year's election threshold, Goulart Filho's PPL joined the Communist Party of Brazil (PCdoB).PCdoB e PPL aclamam e celebram a uni√£o em grande ato pol√≠ticoPPL ser√° incorporado ao PCdoB, anunciam presidentes dos dois partidos Published works * A finalist of the Pr√™mio Jabuti. * =Text= * References Category:Living people Category:1956 births Category:Communist Party of Brazil politicians Category:Democratic Labour Party (Brazil) politicians Category:Free Fatherland Party (Brazil) politicians Category:Workers' General Party politicians Category:Members of the Legislative Assembly of Rio Grande do Sul Category:Brazilian people of Azorean descent Category:Brazilian people of Flemish descent Category:Children of Presidents of Brazil Category:Candidates for President of Brazil ","title":"Jo√£o Goulart Filho"},{"id":"61461586","text":"Susan Buchanan (born 6 January 1952) is a Canadian gymnast.

He is the son of Sol Penner, an aerospace engineer.  Biography  Robert Clark Penner received his B.S. degree from Cornell University in 1977 and his Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1981, the latter under the direction of James Munkres and David Gabai. In his doctoral studies, he solved a 50 year old problem posed by Max Dehn on the action of the mapping class group on curves and arcs in surfaces, developed combinatorial aspects of Thurston's theory of train tracks and generalized Thurston's construction of pseudo-Anosov maps. After postdoctoral positions at Princeton University and at the Mittag-Leffler Institute, Penner spent most of the period of 1985‚Äì2003 at the University of Southern California. From 2004 until 2012, he worked at Aarhus University, where he co- founded with J√∏rgen Ellegaard Andersen the Center for the Quantum Geometry of Moduli Spaces. Since 2013 Penner has held the position of the Rene Thom Chair in Mathematical Biology at the Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques. Throughout his career Penner held various visiting positions around the world including Harvard University, Stanford University, Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Mathematik at Bonn, University of Tokyo, Mittag-Leffler Institute, Caltech, UCLA, Fields Institute, University of Chicago, ETH Zurich, University of Bern, University of Helsinki, University of Strasbourg, University of Grenoble, Nonlinear Institute of Nice-Sophia Antipolis. Contributions to mathematics, physics, and biology Penner's research began in the theory of train tracks including a generalization of Thurston's original construction of pseudo- Anosov maps to the so-called Penner-Thurston construction, which he used to give estimates on least dilatations. He then co-discovered the so-called Epstein-Penner decomposition of non-compact complete hyperbolic manifolds with David Epstein, in dimension 3 a central tool in knot theory. Over several years he developed the decorated Teichm√ºller theory of punctured surfaces including the so-called Penner matrix model, the basic partition function for Riemann's moduli space. Extending the foregoing to orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of the circle, Penner developed his model of universal Teichm√ºller theory together with its Lie algebra. He discovered combinatorial cocycles with Shigeyuki Morita for the first and with Nariya Kawazumi for the higher Johnson homomorphisms. Penner has also contributed to theoretical biology in joint work with J√∏rgen E. Andersen et al. discovering a priori geometric constraints on protein geometry, and with Michael S. Waterman, Piotr Sulkowski, Christian Reidys et al. introducing and solving the matrix model for RNA topology. Main journal publications * The decorated Teichm√ºller space of punctured surfaces, Comm.

The gorge still keeps the name, \\"–•–æ–≤—Ä –±–æ—å—Ä–∞\\", which translates roughly as \\"Khovr's gorge\\". In 1944, after the genocide and deportation of the Chechen and Ingush people and the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was abolished, the village of Belgatoy was renamed to Shaitli, and settled by people from the neighboring republic of Dagestan. From 1944 to 1958, it was a part of the Vedensky District of the Dagestan ASSR. In 1958, after the Vaynakh people returned and the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was restored, the village regained its old Chechen name, Belgatoy.  Population  * 2002 Census: 231 * 2010 Census: 621 * 2019 estimate: 542 According to the 2010 Census, the majority of residents of Belgatoy were ethnic Chechens.

The campus was originally operated for the purpose of ministering to troubled young women. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. History In 1904, a convent of the Sisters of Good Shepherd was founded in Grand Rapids for the purpose of ministering to troubled young women.\\\\, providing them with a home and skills to help them to a new start. A farmstead property where Villa Maria now stands was purchased later that year; the farmhouse on the property was used as convent. The first new structure, the Industrial Building, was constructed the following year. It was used both as a dormitory and work space for the women living there, known as penitents. By 1910, Villa Maria housed eight sisters and 71 women needing assistance. The campus was expanded in the 1920s, with the 1922 construction of the Penitent Building and Chapel (designed by architects Wernette & McCarthy). The Monastery Building was added in 1926-27, after which the original farmhouse was sold off. In 1938, the Sisters of the Cross, an affiliated convent, took up residence in the Industrial Building. They remained there until 1951, when a new building was constructed for them. In 1974 the original Industrial Building was remodeled. However, through the 1970s the number of penitents in the program declined, and in 1985 the program was ended. The Sisters of the Good Shepherd decided to sell the facility, specifically to a developer who would adapt the buildings for senior citizen housing. In 1987, the Villa Maria Retirement Community opened. Description Villa Maria consists of nine buildings, six of which contribute to the historic character of the complex. These include: *Industrial Building (Built in 1905): A three story steel structure with brick exterior walls, originally with a hipped roof covered with clay tile. A flat roof was installed during the 1974 renovation. *Penitent Building (Built in 1921): A three story masonry wall building with a hipped roof covered with green clay tile. The building has distinctive arched window walkways and porches. *Chapel Building (Built in 1921): A two story masonry wall building with a gable roof covered with a green clay tile. The windows are stained glass. Two small wings were added in 1959. *Monastery Building (Built in 1926): A two story masonry wall building with a hipped roof covered with green clay tile. The main entrance has decorative stone columns, and an arched doorway with a statue of the Good Shepherd. *Boiler Room (Likely early 1920s): A one story masonry building with a steel framed flat roof. *Enclosed Walkway (Built in 1959): A flat-roofed concrete and brick structure connecting the Chapel and Monastery Buildings.

It is a retelling of a number of Ancient Greek myths selected by Fry. Mythos was followed by Fry's 2018 book Heroes, a retelling of myths about Greek heroes. as well as a play titled Mythos: A Trilogy, which premiered at the Shaw Festival in Ontario, Canada, in 2018 and was set to tour the UK, starting from August 2019.  Synopsis  Fry states at the beginning of the book that no background knowledge is necessary to appreciate the stories and that \\"there is absolutely nothing academic or intellectual about Greek mythology; it is addictive, entertaining, approachable and astonishingly human\\". The stories are mostly retellings of myths derived from Hesiod's Theogony, Ovid's Metamorphoses and Apuleius's The Golden Ass.  Reception  British scholar Edith Hall criticised Fry's limited selection of myths in her review for The Guardian. and said that the book's lack of a contents page or index means that the reader is not warned of its uncomprehensive nature. She goes on however to commend Fry for putting his fame to constructive use and to say that his \\"distinctive voice undoubtedly adds something lively, humorous and intimate to myth's psychological dimension. People who enjoy his media personality and particular style of post‚ÄëWodehouse English drollery are in for a treat\\". Mythos received a rating of 4/5 in a review titled \\"What kind of a book is Stephen Fry's Mythos? Who knows ‚Äî but it's clever and fun\\" in the culture section of The Telegraph. The Scotsman praised the book's accessibility as well as Fry's knowledge and enthusiasm about the subject but criticised the inconsistency of the book's style, saying that it shifts between being erudite and \\"deliberately downmarket\\". As of August 2019, Mythos held a score of 4.2/5 on Goodreads.com and a score of 4.7 out of 5 on Audible.com.  Stage tour  The premiere of Mythos: A Trilogy occurred at the Shaw Festival in Ontario, Canada and received positive reviews. The UK tour was set to premiere on 19 August 2019 at the Edinburgh International Festival and was also scheduled to be performed in Salford, Liverpool, Birmingham, London, Oxford and Gateshead. The play consists of three shows performed on separate nights. The shows were written and performed by Stephen Fry and directed by Tim Carroll. They are reported to be loosely scripted and involve input from the audience to help choose which stories Fry will tell on any given night.

It is part of the benefice of the Hartland Coast Team Ministry. This falls within Hartland Deanery, in the Archdeaconry of Barnstaple in the Diocese of Exeter.Buckland Brewer: St Mary & St Benedict - Church of England Church Heritage Record 615448 Begun in the 14th-century with 15th-century additions and retaining several architectural features from the first church of about 1100, the building was much restored in the 19th-century and has been a Grade II* listed building on the Register of Historic England since 1958.Church of St Mary and St Benedict at Buckland Brewer - Historic England databaseSt Mary and St Benedict - The Hartland Coast Mission Community website History The carved Norman doorway dates to about 1100 while the image niche above the doorway dates to about 1200 The third church to stand on the site, the first was probably built in about 1100. The earliest recorded incumbent, Sir Walter de Denetone, was appointed in 1279. This first church was destroyed by fire in about 1390 apart from the carved and decorative Norman arched doorway which survived and which continues to serve as the main entrance to the church on the south side. Rebuilt in about 1399, the living originally belonged to Torre Abbey but was seized by Henry VIII in 1539 since when it has remained in the gift of the sovereign. The church was struck by lightning and almost destroyed by fire in 1769, (pillars near the Orleigh Chapel in the north-east corner still show fire damage). The church was hit by severe storms in 1877 leading to the restoration work of 1878 to 1880. Design The 16th-century moulded stone priest's door was deliberately damaged during the English Civil War The present church was begun in about 1399 and is built of squared and coursed slatestone with ashlar to the tower. The nave, south aisle and chancel were extensively restored by architect Samuel Hooper of Hatherleigh in 1878-80. Beside the chancel is the north chapel (the \\"Orleigh Chapel\\" - one of the oldest surviving parts of the church along with the tower) featuring several interesting wall monuments while the nave has a south aisle and porch. The east end of the south aisle is connected via a 16th-century moulded stone priest's door carved with decoration of leaves, branches and shields (partially deliberately damaged during the English Civil War) leading to a late 19th-century passageway with a crenellated wall. At the end of this passage is located the former 15th- century parish schoolroom (said by some to have been a chapel dedicated to St. Stephen) restored in 1880 and used today as a parish hall. This large room is fitted with a Perpendicular-style east window dating to the restoration of 1880 and a two-bay south front with a pointed-arched doorway of 1880 and two 15th-century two-light cinquefoiled windows. The rest of the church has windows dating to the Victorian restoration of 1878-80. View from the nave towards the chancel with the Orleigh Chapel in the corner Demi-figure memorial to Phillip Vening who died in 1658 aged six In the chancel are two 19th- century piscinae, that on the right being fitted with part of a 14th-century cusped head; the nearby panelled reredos is late Victorian, as are the boarded waggon roof to the chancel and the arch-braced roofs to the nave and the south aisle. The chancel has a two-bay arcade to the north leading to the Orleigh Chapel dating to the 14th-century while the chancel arch is of the 19th- century. The nave has a 15th-century five-bay arcade on its south side. In the chancel are 19th-century choir stalls, benches, pulpit, lectern and tower screen. The pulpit contains eight oak panels from a previous three-decker pulpit in the church. The unusual urn-shaped font is carved from local stone with gadrooning and dates to 1771. The south aisle has five bays to the nave and is fitted with Decorated-style windows with the string course continuing above the 16th-century stone chamfered and carved pointed-arched priest's door. The gabled porch dates to the 15th-century while an 18th-century sundial is fitted above the 15th-century doorway. Inside the porch a 14th-century stoup can be found to the right while an image niche above the Norman doorway dates to about 1200. This doorway is decorated with a round arch of three orders with carved beakhead and chevron ornamentation. The three-stage church tower to the west of the building is 76 feet high and it and the three-light Perpendicular window are 15th-century. The peal of six bells were recast in the village in 1825 and again in 1899 by John Taylor of Loughborough, the founder of which was born in the village and who is commemorated by a brass plaque in the church.

In the churchyard are three burials from World War II with their distinctive Commonwealth War Graves Commission headstones.St Mary and St Benedict churchyard Buckland Brewer - Commonwealth War Graves Commission databaseCommonwealth War Graves St. Mary and St. Benedict Churchyard - Traces of War database Monuments Wall monument to John Davie (died 1710), tobacco merchant of Bideford The mural monument of 1643 in the \\"Orleigh Chapel\\" to Anthony and Gertrude Dennis In the Orleigh Chapel is the elaborate and decorative wall monument to John Davie (1640-1710) who as an alderman in 1682 took statements in the Bideford witch trial. The monument also commemorates his wife Mary (died 1709) while the lower inscription records the death of their daughter-in-law Juliana Davie who died in 1720 of smallpox. In 1684 he bought Orleigh Court in Buckland Brewer. Nearby is the mural monument to Anthony Dennis (died 1641) of Orleigh Court and his second wife Gertrude Grenville flanked by Ionic columns. Beneath them are figures of his eleven children, eight of whom are kneeling and three lying down, indicating their deaths in infancy. The tablet was erected in 1643. Between these monuments is the demi-figure memorial to Phillip Vening, son of Phillip and Elizabeth Vening, who died in 1658 aged six and which is of coloured marble with inscriptions in black slate. He is shown leaning his head on his right hand, the right elbow being supported by a skull. There are also monuments to, among others, John Taylor (1827-1906), the Loughborough bellfounder, who was born in the village. The south aisle has a stone tablet monument to Midshipman William Radford Caddy who drowned in 1823 while attempting to rescue a colleague while serving on HMS Windsor Castle and above is another to his father John Caddy (died 1822). In the south-east corner of the church are memorials to the men of the village who died during World War I and World War II.

The generic name for this type of device is field olfactometer. Design and applications The Nasal Ranger works via dilution. The device has a filtration system that can produce nearly pure air. During operation, the user breathes this filtered air for at least one minute in order to cleanse their 'nasal palate'. The user then turns a dial which allows in a tiny amount of ambient air alongside the filtered air. Next, the user inhales twice and turns the dial to the next step, this one delivering solely filtered air, to cleanse the palate again. Each subsequent step increases the amount of unfiltered ambient air taken in, and is always followed by a cleansing of the palate. The step on the dial where the user first smells the problem odor determines the dilution-to-threshold ratio (D/T). Strong smells have a high D/T. In its standard configuration, the highest D/T the Nasal Ranger can measure is 60 (60 parts filtered air to 1 part ambient air). A D/T this high would be associated with a very strong odor. In cases where an odor with a D/T stronger than 60 must be measured, the Nasal Ranger can be configured to quantify a higher D/T. Strong odors only require the introduction of a tiny amount of ambient air to be detected. A D/T of 2 would be associated with a weak smell. https://www.fivesenses.com/equipment/nasalranger/nasalranger/ ODOR TRACKR, a web-based application, is available for use with the Nasal Ranger. ODOR TRACKR is a data logging tool which stores D/T values for each sample taken, as well as other information such as odor characters, sample time, date, and geographical position determined via the Global Positioning System. The Nasal Ranger was introduced in 2000. Designed by St. Croix Sensory, the Nasal Ranger was created to help determine the seriousness and validity of complaints of bad smells from animal farms, sewage plants, landfills, compost piles, factories, and other industrial and agricultural activities likely to generate strong odors. Many local governments have used the instrument to help regulate recreational marijuana's use and production. Operators of the Nasal Ranger must be screened for olfactory capability before use.https://www.fivesenses.com/equipment/olfactometry-equipment/odor- sensitivity-test-kit/ The manufacturer offers an \\"Odor School\\" to train operators on proper use of the Nasal Ranger. With training and additional accessories, a Nasal Ranger package costs approximately $3,400.https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2020/01/09/upper- peninsula-town-bessemer-buys-marijuana-odor-device/4420990002/ Users Many state and local governments use the Nasal Ranger. The Denver, Colorado municipal Department of Environmental Health has purchased several Nasal Rangers to help determine if the smell of marijuana or other substances at any given location is strong enough to merit a fine or other regulatory action. Denver treats any smell, with exemptions for rodeos, stockyards, and tarring operations, with a D/T above 7 as a violation. A Denver official said it is rare to find smells so strong as to exceed this standard. California uses the Nasal Ranger to help regulate landfills. South Saint Paul, Minnesota uses Nasal Rangers to regulate the odor of its stockyards. Yolo County, California and Las Vegas, Nevada are also known to use the device. In popular culture The Nasal Ranger was featured on an episode of The History Channel's program Modern Marvels called \\"Stink.\\" Many commentators in the media have noted that the Nasal Ranger strongly resembles the \\"Smell-O-Scope\\" created by Professor Farnsworth, a character in the animated comedy Futurama.

It was released into the Steam Early Access program in February, 2017. The game allows players to maneuver through environments and open space in the absence of gravity as well as move about the interiors of spaceships or stations with or without artificial gravity. As a first- person game, players must manage their resources in the interest of their survival, discover other resources and space station modules which can be salvaged and assembled into larger more complex stations. On October 15, 2019, development on Hellion was suspended,https://steamcommunity.com/games/588210/announcements/detail/2667745625174448409, Steam, Retrieved 2019-10-16 on Oct 21, 2019, the game was officially released, and on April 1, 2020 it was removed from Steam.  Gameplay  Broadly set in a zero-gravity environment, player and spacecraft movement in the game follows the traditional Newtonian physical vectors while stations adhere to orbital mechanics. Players may define and travel into orbits around planetary bodies and other large naturally occurring astronomical phenomena. The player begins the game equipped with only a bottle of oxygen and a jet pack for maneuvering. As a multiplayer game, Hellion challenges players to collect and safeguard resources and assets from destruction and potential capture by other players since players may attack and claim their assets. The single-player aspect of the game focuses the player on the in-game story and space station expansion. In both modes, the player must perform ship or station repairs which involve resources which must be discovered and accumulated from within the fictional universe. As non-upgraded equipment deteriorates significantly faster than upgraded elements, this becomes a repeating process with progressive sustainability. Ultimately the player is free to explore and discover the fate of Hellion or achieve a notion of champion status among other players.  Decommissioning  During the final 3 days of its presence on Steam, ZeroGravity made the game available to own by Steam users for free. For a brief period on March 31, the price returned to its previous usual price and then was removed from the online Steam Store at midnight, GMT. Owners of licensed copies of Hellion will continue to be able to play the game via Steam, as well as operate their own community servers for the foreseeable future. However, the community anticipates the official servers will be shut off sometime in the future.

Jammu and Kashmir is roughly the left half of this region. Pakistani- administered Kashmir is shown in green, and Chinese-administered Kashmir in brown. On 5 August 2019, the Government of India revoked the special status, or limited autonomy, granted under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir‚Äîa region administered by India as a state which consists of the larger part of Kashmir which has been the subject of dispute among India, Pakistan, and China since 1947. Among the Indian government actions accompanying the revocation was the cutting off of communication lines in the Kashmir Valley, a region gripped by a prolonged separatist insurgency. Several leading Kashmiri politicians were taken into custody, including the former chief minister, Government officials described these restrictions as designed for preempting violence, and justified the revocation for enabling people of the state to access government programmes such as reservation, right to education and right to information. The reaction in the Kashmir Valley was effectively reduced to silence because of cut-off communication. Many nationalists celebrated, declaring the move to herald public order and prosperity in Kashmir. Among political parties in India, the revocation was supported by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, and, among others, by the Bahujan Samaj Party, the Aam Aadmi Party, AIADMK, Telugu Desam Party, YSR Congress Party, BJD and the Shiv Sena. It was opposed by the Indian National Congress, Jammu & Kashmir National Conference, Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party, Trinamool Congress, Janata Dal (United) and the DMK. In Ladakh, people in the Kargil area, who are Shia Muslim and form the plurality of the population of Ladakh, protested; however, the Buddhist community in Ladakh supported the decision. The President of India issued an order under the power of Article 370, overriding the prevailing 1954 Presidential Order and nullifying all the provisions of autonomy granted to the state. The Home Minister introduced a Reorganisation Bill in the Indian Parliament, seeking to divide the state into two union territories to be governed by a lieutenant governor and a unicameral legislature. The resolution seeking the revocation of the special status under Article 370 and the bill for the state's reorganisation was debated and passed by the Rajya Sabha ‚Äì India's upper house of parliament ‚Äì on 5 August 2019. On 6 August, the Lok Sabha ‚Äì India's lower house of parliament ‚Äì debated and passed the reorganisation bill along with the resolution recommending the revocation.  Background  Article 370 of the Indian constitution gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir ‚Äî a state in India, located in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, and a part of the larger region of Kashmir, which has been the subject of dispute between India, Pakistan and China. The Article conferred power on Jammu and Kashmir to have a separate constitution, a state flag and autonomy over the internal administration of the state. The Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir, after its establishment, was empowered to recommend the articles of the Indian constitution that should be applied to the state or to abrogate the Article 370 altogether. After consultation with the state's Constituent Assembly, the 1954 Presidential Order was issued, specifying the articles of the Indian constitution that applied to the state. The Constituent Assembly dissolved itself without recommending the abrogation of Article 370, the article was deemed to have become a permanent feature of the Indian Constitution. This article, along with Article 35A, defined that the Jammu and Kashmir state's residents live under a separate set of laws, including those related to citizenship, ownership of property, and fundamental rights, as compared to resident of other Indian states. Under various Indian National Congress party- led central governments and locally elected state governments ‚Äî such as those of the National Conference ‚Äî between 1954 and 2011, India used the provisions of Article 370 to issue presidential orders to extend the Indian constitution to Jammu and Kashmir with the concurrence of the State Government, and reduce the state's autonomy. These past Presidential orders under Article 370 are also controversial and a subject of the Kashmir dispute. Political scientist Sumantra Bose, a Kashmir scholar, sums up the politics of the period 1953‚Äì63, during which Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad served as the Prime Minister of Jammu and Kashmir in these words: > Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed‚Äôs term in office lasted a full decade, until October > 1963. The sequence of events during that decade strongly suggests a > contractual relationship between Bakshi and the government of India, whereby > he would be allowed to run an unrepresentative, unaccountable government in > Srinagar in return for facilitating IJK‚Äôs ‚Äúintegration‚Äù with India on New > Delhi‚Äôs terms. The result was twofold: a crippling of rule of law and > democratic institutions in IJK; and an erosion of IJK‚Äôs autonomy, achieved > (as required by Article 370) with the ‚Äúconcurrence‚Äù of IJK‚Äôs > government‚Äîwhich consisted of a motley clique of New Delhi's client > politicians.\\" Further, in Bose's view, the 1954 Presidential order and the subsequent orders began \\"the end for the Article 370\\" and it has \\"effectively been dead in letter and in spirit since that time\\". Since the partition of India and Pakistan on religious lines, the Hindutva organizations in India have stated that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral, inseparable part of India. As in past election manifesto, the Bharatiya Janata Party included the integration of Jammu and Kashmir among its campaign promises for the 2019 Indian general election. The BJP and its allies won a landslide majority in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament. On 5 August 2019, India issued a Presidential order superseding the 1954 order that made all the provisions of the Indian constitution applicable to Jammu and Kashmir. Following the resolutions passed in both houses of the parliament, the President of India issued a further order on 6 August declaring all the clauses of Article 370 except clause 1 to be inoperative.  Legal aspects  Article 370 of the Constitution of India was a 'temporary provision' inserted on 17 October 1949 which gave special powers to the state of Jammu and Kashmir, lawfully authorising it to have its own constitution. Accordingly, the provisions of only Article 1 and Article 370 of the Indian Constitution applied to the state. So, for the Central government to extent the coverage of a central law to the state on subjects included in the Instrument of Accession (IoA), it needed \\"consultation\\" while for extending the coverage of laws on other subjects, it needed \\"concurrence\\" of the state government. Similarly, Article 35A of the Constitution of India, introduced through a constitutional order in 1954, authorised the state legislature to define 'permanent residents'. Those defined as permanent residents were entitled to property rights, employment, scholarships and other social benefits in the state. = Legal path taken by the government = In April 2018, the Supreme Court of India ruled that Article 370 had attained permanency since the state constituent assembly has ceased to exist. To overcome this legal challenge, the Indian government instead rendered Article 370 as 'inoperative' even though it still exists in the constitution. On 5 August, a presidential order was issued ‚Äì the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 2019 ‚Äì which superseded the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954. After the 1954 order, forty-seven Presidential orders were issued between 11 February 1956 and 19 February 1994, making various other provisions of the Constitution of India applicable to Jammu and Kashmir. All these orders were issued with the 'concurrence of the Government of the State' without any Constituent Assembly. Some of these Presidential orders were issued when the state was under President's rule and had \\"no Kashmir government at all\\", states Jill Cottrell. The effect of the Presidential orders issued between 1954 and 1994 had been to extend 94 of the 97 subjects in the Union List (the powers of the Central Government), and 260 of the 395 Articles of the Constitution of India to the State of Jammu and Kashmir. The August 2019 Presidential order stated that all the provisions of the Indian Constitution applied to Jammu and Kashmir. This in effect meant that the separate Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir stood abrogated, and a single constitution now applied to all the Indian states. The President issued the order with the \\"concurrence of the Government of State of Jammu and Kashmir\\". This in effect meant the concurrence of the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir since President's rule was imposed at that time in the state. The order was issued using the third clause of Article 370, which authorised the President of India to declare the article inoperative with exceptions and modifications, if recommended by the (non- existent) state constituent assembly to do so. To circumvent the legal issue of the non-existent state constituent assembly, the President used the Clause (I) of Article 370, which conferred him with the power to modify the Indian Constitution on subjects related to Jammu and Kashmir. So he first added a new clause to Article 367, which deals with interpretation of the Constitution. He replaced the phrase 'Constituent Assembly of the State' with 'Legislative Assembly of the State'. Since the state legislative assembly has been suspended, the order says that any reference to the legislative assembly will be construed as a reference to the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir. The governor is an appointee of the Central government. Therefore, the Indian Parliament now functions for the state legislative assembly. Hence, the Indian Home Minister moved a resolution in the Rajya Sabha to give the President the necessary recommendation he needs to declare Article 370 as inoperative. Subsequently, the statutory resolution seeking the revocation of the special status under Article 370 and the bill for the state's reorganisation was debated and passed by the Rajya Sabha on 5 August 2019 with 125 (67%) votes in its favour and 61 (33%) against it. On 6 August, the bill for the reorganisation was debated and passed by the Lok Sabha with 370 (86%) votes in its favour and 70 (14%) against it, and the resolution recommending the revocation was passed by 351 votes in favour and 72 against. = Petitions against abrogation = On 28 August 2019, the Supreme Court of India agreed to hear multiple petitions challenging the abrogation of Article 370 and the subsequent bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories. It constituted a five-judge bench for the same. The court issued notices to the government, seeking a reply to the petitions, despite pleas by the government arguing that the notices could be cited in international forums such as the United Nations against India. Additionally, the court ordered the government to reply within seven days to a petition seeking an end to the restrictions on communications as well as other restrictions in the region. The Supreme Court heard the petitions on 30 September 2019. It allowed the central government to submit its replies to the petitions in 30 days and fixed 14 November 2019 as the next date of hearing. The petitioners wanted the court to issue an injunction against reorganisation of the state into two union territories but the court declined to issue any injunction. This means that the two union territories came into existence on 31 October 2019 as planned.  Government clampdown  Prior to the revocation of the status, the Ministry of Home Affairs granted approval for the mobilization of thousands of paramilitary security troops into Jammu and Kashmir, citing reason to maintain law and order in the area. On 2 August, Indian Army said that the Pakistan Army and terrorists are \\"planning to upscale violence\\" and tried to \\"target the Yatra recently.\\" The Government of India notified students and tourists, both local and foreign, to leave Jammu and Kashmir. These actions sparked fears that India would soon be revoking Jammu and Kashmir's special status. However, on 3 August, Omar Abdullah said that Governor Satya Pal Malik \\"assured him there was no initiative in progress to dilute Article 35A of the Constitution, start delimitation or trifurcate.\\" On 4 August, satellite phones were distributed in central, north and south Kashmir among the security forces. The government thereafter ordered a total communication blackout, shutting down cable TV, landlines, cellphones and the Internet. Many news sources reported an effective curfew (although The Telegraph of Kolkata reports that the government did not officially announce a curfew). Doctors and district administrators were advised to remain on standby. Prior to the 5 August revocation announcement, Section 144 curfew was imposed in the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley, the Hindu-majority Jammu region and the Buddhist-majority Ladakh region. The current lockdown was far more intense in the Srinagar (Kashmir) region, where \\"people are used to curfews and living under a heavy security presence\\", according to The Guardian newspaper. Concrete barricades blocked roads every few hundred meters. Shops and clinics were closed, as were all educational institutions and a red alert was sounded across Jammu and Kashmir. The government lifted Section 144 curfew and reopened schools in some Jammu region districts effective 10 August 2019. Many Indian media reported that they had no information coming from the Kashmir Valley and could not even ascertain if their correspondents were safe or not. Journalist were not issued curfew passes. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reported that Qazi Shibli ‚Äì a local journalist and editor of news website The Kashmiriyat Walla, was arrested by the Jammu and Kashmir Police on 28 July 2019 on unspecified charges, but it was unclear on 5 August 2019 if he is still under arrest. Many journalists reported being stopped by soldiers and others stated they had to send photos out of the state via USB flash drives. A local journalist told CPJ that \\"I fear that they will arrest journalists, especially those who will report what is happening\\". CPJ later reported that at least 2 journalists were detained amid tensions in Jammu and Kashmir. In addition to local Kashmiri journalists, editors of several Indian newspapers and television stations complained that their teams have not been able to send in their reports from most of the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley, except for a few blocks in Srinagar. However, the managing editor of the Indian Times Now English news channel, Navika Kumar said, \\"her channel had not faced much restriction broadcasting from Kashmir and reporters were sending feeds through satellite- linked outside broadcasting vans\\", according to Reuters. The Times Now and other media groups of India have been criticized as \\"conformist\\" and alleged to \\"look like they are afraid of the government\\" by H. K. Dua ‚Äì a former media advisor of two former Indian prime ministers. More than 4,000 Kashmiri protesters were reported to be arrested by 18 August, including several Kashmiri leaders to prevent any protest or outbreak of violence. This figure was about 500 by 9 August. Jammu and Kashmir's former chief ministers Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah, and MLAs Mohammed Yousuf Tarigami and Engineer Rashid were among those placed under \\"preventive detention\\" by the security forces. In January 2020, the Human Rights Watch reported that the Indian government- imposed clampdown in Kashmir is being slowly and gradually eased of restrictions, but to a large extent continues to fail in preserving the rights of the Kashmiri people. The lawyers, shop keepers, rights activists, students, who had been under arrest have been released, but on the condition of never criticising the government in the future again. Meanwhile, some notable political figures including former chief ministers, too, continue to remain in custody. = Government's rationale = India's Foreign minister S Jaishankar defended the clampdown saying that this was done to prevent an outbreak of violence and civilian casualties, citing the unrest caused after the death of militant Burhan Wani in 2016. He said that it was not possible to stop communication among militants without putting the entire region under a blackout. The Government of Jammu and Kashmir stated that the restrictions on Internet access, among other restrictions, were imposed to preempt the disruption of public order by various ‚Äúanti-national‚Äù elements. It said that the misuse of data services and internet by ‚Äúterrorists‚Äù to conduct terrorism and to incite people by spreading fake news necessitated such restrictions, which will be gradually reduced. =Restoration of services= On 16 August, B. V. R. Subrahmanyam ‚Äì the chief secretary of Jammu and Kashmir, announced that the government will lift lockdown and remove some restrictions in a phased manner in the Kashmir Valley. According to Reuters, phone services resumed in parts of Srinagar on 16 August 2019. Landline phone services, indicated Subrahmanyam, would be restored in most of Srinagar by 18 August 2019. Schools in the valley will reopen in the week of 19 August 2019. However, when some schools were opened in the valley, several media reported that children did not go to schools at all. According to Subrahmanyam, \\"12 of 22 [Jammu and Kashmir] districts were already functioning normally, and measures have been put in place to ensure zero loss of lives on any side or serious injuries to anyone. Telecom connectivity will be eased and restored in a phased manner keeping in mind the constant threat by terror organizations\\". As of 25 August 2019, landline services have been restored in most places in the Kashmir Valley. On 14 October 2019, postpaid mobile phone services were fully restored in the region. As of 3 Jan 2020, mobile internet has still not been fully restored in the region. At 153 days and counting, this has become the largest internet shutdown in India.

This is a reversal from an earlier policy, where the Indian security forces had to request special permission to buy land in the area. Only locals were able to buy land in Indian administered Kashmir, however, with the government scrapping Kashmir's autonomy, Indian security forces can buy land and live in Kashmir.http://www.aljazeera.com/amp/news/2020/07/india-eases- rules-security-forces-acquire-land-kashmir-200728100807478.html On August 16, 2020 high speed mobile internet services(4G/LTE) were restored in two districts of the union territory of J&K; on a trial basis, after Supreme Court of India ruled last month that indefinite shutdown was illegal. = Legal scrutiny = In a verdict delivered on petitions filed against the restrictions imposed in Jammu and Kashmir, the Supreme Court ordered a review of all the curbs on usage of Internet services. The court pointed out that freedom to access Internet services is a fundamental right as per Article 19(1) of the Indian Constitution. It also noted that Section 144 of India's Code of Criminal Procedure is not to be used for suppressing people's expression, ordering the local administration to publish every usage of that provision to enable its public scrutiny. = Reactions to clampdown = * - Alice Wells, the Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs, said in a statement that the US hopes \\"to see rapid action - the lifting of the restrictions and the release of those who have been detained\\". She added that the US is \\"concerned by widespread detentions, including those of politicians and business leaders, and the restrictions on the residents of Jammu and Kashmir\\". US lawmakers Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have also called for an end to the communications blockade. *Amnesty International - The NGO for human rights started an online petition titled Let Kashmir Speak demanding a lifting of \\"the blackout of communications in Jammu and Kashmir\\" while letting \\"the voices of the people of Kashmir be heard\\" and allowing \\"unconditional and unconstrained access to news and information from the valley\\". Reactions from the affected areas =Opposition= The most recent Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Mehbooba Mufti called it the \\"blackest day of Indian democracy\\". She felt that the Indian Parliament snatched away everything from the people of Jammu and Kashmir. In a tweet on 4 August 2019, she said that the decision of Jammu and Kashmir leadership to reject two-nation theory in 1947 and align with India had backfired. Former chief minister Omar Abdullah called the government's move on the Article 370 \\"unilateral and shocking\\". He deemed it a \\"total betrayal of the trust that the people of Jammu and Kashmir had reposed in India when the state acceded to it in 1947\\". Asgar Ali Karbalai, former Chief Executive Councillor of Kargil's Hill Development Council, said people in Kargil considered any division of the state on the grounds of \\"religion, language or region\\" as undemocratic. Certain religious and political organisations in Kargil, including the Imam Khomeini Memorial Trust, condemned the Indian government for acting \\"without the consent from the people\\" and called for a general strike in the Kargil district. Kashmiri politician Shah Faesal denounced the move, saying that \\"This is being seen as the biggest betrayal by the Indian state in last 70 years. It was not possible to reach Omar Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti, Sajjad Gani Lone or send a message to them. In other districts, curfew is all the more strict. You can say that the entire eight-million population has been incarcerated like never before,\\" and in an interview with The Guardian, described that the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status was \\"an insult to the dignity of the people. My belief is that it will have immediate and long-term consequences. We will see ground mobilisation in the coming days and in the long run you will have sentiment of alienation going further and [it will] erupt. The common refrain is that everything has finished. Everything has been snatched from us. These are the common lines on every Kashmiri's lips these days. We have no choice left but to resist.\\" Faesal was apparently detained by Indian security forces on 14 August 2019, leading to a statement by over 100 people associated with Harvard University (his alma mater) condemning the detention and calling for the release of Faesal and other Kashmiri leaders. =Support= The member of the Lok Sabha for Ladakh constituency, Jamyang Tsering Namgyal, praised the abrogation of Article 370 and the proposed formation of a separate Ladakh union territory, hoping the move will encourage jobs and development. He added \\"Under Kashmir, our development, our political aspiration, our identity, our language, if all of this got lost, it is because of Article 370‚Äîand the Congress party is responsible for that\\". Namgyal also said that the move had support from all regions of Ladakh, including Kargil. The move to abrogate Article 370 and establish a union territory in Ladakh was welcomed by the Ladakh Buddhist Association who then organised a thanksgiving celebration in Leh to on 8 August 2019, which was attended by political and religious leaders. The Buddhist community in Leh and Ladakh stated they have been long ignored, the revocation and reorganisation will help them steer their own destiny. It was reported that celebrations had taken place in Jammu with people distributing sweets, dancing and playing drums. Representatives of the Kashmiri Hindu community, who were displaced from the Kashmir Valley as a result of ongoing violence welcomed the move and hoped that members of their community, numbering between 300,000 and 400,000 people will be able to return. The day of 15 August was marked by Ladakh as its 'first independence day'. Banners were put up thanking the prime minister Narendra Modi and commemorating the four youth activists who died while agitating for union territory status. Similar celebrations were also noticed in Jammu among the Gujjar Bakarwals, Sikhs, Valmikis and West Pakistan refugees, who were all victims of Srinagar's discriminatory laws. The residents of Jammu felt that Jammu was always ignored for funds and resources, and they hoped the reorganisation would bring in development. Kashmiri Pandit refugees in Jammu hoped for rehabilitation. Indian reactions = Opposition = The historian Ramachandra Guha said that the President of India had apparently acted in \\"haste\\" and the revocation is an \\"arbitrary misuse of state power\\". The constitutional scholar A. G. Noorani said that the Indian government's decision to abrogate Article 370 through controversial means was \\"utterly and palpably unconstitutional\\", even fraudulent. It is headed for a \\"showdown in India's Supreme Court\\". Nobel laureate Amartya Sen criticized the government and said that he was \\"not proud as an Indian\\". He regarded the detention of Kashmiri political leaders as \\"a classical colonial excuse\\" to prevent backlash against the Indian government's decision and called for a democratic solution that would involve Kashmiri people. Indian novelist Arundhati Roy criticized the Indian government in her opinion piece in The New York Times. Wajahat Habibullah said the government's decision was a \\"regressive and unwise\\" step. The leaders of the Indian National Congress ‚Äì India's main opposition party ‚Äì was divided on the revocation of Article 370. Some Congress leaders such as the Chief Minister of Rajasthan Ashok Gehlot, a congress leader condemned the government's arrest of Kashmiri leaders Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah. Other leaders of Rajasthan Congress and Gehlot's cabinet welcomed the revocation. Chief Minister of Punjab Amarinder Singh, a congress leader also termed the revocation of Article 370 as \\"totally unconstitutional\\" and said \\"this will set a bad precedent as it would mean that the Centre could reorganise any state in the country by simply imposing President's rule.\\" The Punjab chief minister also banned any form of celebrations or protests in his state in matters relating to Article 370, ordering increased security to some 8,000 Kashmiri students studying in Punjab. Rahul Gandhi criticized the Indian government for arresting the Kashmiri political leaders and called the detentions \\"unconstitutional & undemocratic.\\" On 24 August, a delegation of opposition leaders had attempted to visit Jammu and Kashmir to take stalk of the situation. The delegation was a 12-member team composed of Rahul Gandhi, Ghulam Nabi Azad, K. C. Venugopal, Anand Sharma, D. Raja, Sitaram Yechury, Dinesh Trivedi, Tiruchi Siva, Manoj Jha, Sharad Yadav, Majeed Memon, and D. Kupendra Reddy. However, the team was sent back upon reaching Srinagar. Hundreds of people protested in New Delhi to protest against the Indian government decision and called it a \\"death of Indian democracy\\". The protestors asked Indian government to reconsider its decision. D. Raja, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, called the Indian government move \\"an assault on Indian constitution\\". The Tamil Nadu-based regional Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party leader M. K. Stalin, along with West Bengal-based All India Trinamool Congress party leader Derek O'Brien opposed the revocation. Stalin called the move as \\"murder of democracy\\", while O'Brien called it a \\"procedural harakiri\\". The Indian National Congress party members filed two petitions in the Supreme Court of India, requesting an urgent hearing. One challenged the revocation, while the other challenged the communications blackout and curfew in Kashmir region in which approximately 500 people were arrested, including several Kashmiri leaders. The Supreme Court rejected the \\"urgent hearing\\" request, placing the petitions to its normal proceedings. Arjun Sharma, a noted freelance journalist from Jammu penned in his article that while Ladakh was rejoicing the UT status it got after disintegration of J&K;, Jammu was suspicious of whether the perceived discrimination towards Jammu will end or not. = Support = The Indian Government justified its action by saying that this will help end violence and militancy in the state and enable people to access government schemes such as reservation, right to education and right to information among other schemes. The constitutional expert Subhash C. Kashyap, according to BBC News, states that the revocation was \\"constitutionally sound\\" and that \\"no legal and constitutional fault can be found in it\\". The revocation of Article 370 was passed by an \\"overwhelming majority\\" of support in the Indian parliament. It has attracted not only the support of the Hindu nationalist parties such as the BJP, but many other Indian political parties that typically oppose the BJP. Some senior Congress leaders openly came out in support of the action. Former Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh said that the revocation had an in-principle support from the Congress party but its execution was not appropriate. Bhupinder Singh Hooda, former Chief Minister of Haryana, supported the government's decision saying that the Congress party has \\"lost its way\\". Jyotiraditya Scindia, also supported the government's action to remove article 370. He wrote on Twitter, \\"I support the move on #JammuAndKashmir & #Ladakh and its full integration into union of India.\\" Similarly, Congress leader Deepender Singh Hooda contended that the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir \\"is in the interest of national integrity\\". Congress Rajya Sabha chief whip, Bhubaneswar Kalita resigned over Congress's stand on revoking special status of Jammu and Kashmir and stated that, \\"The ideology of Congress today looks like it is committing suicide and I do not want to be a part of it.\\" Congress politician Janardan Dwivedi welcomed the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, saying even though it came late, a \\"historical mistake\\" had been corrected. The Bahujan Samaj Party and its leader Mayawati, as well as Aam Aadmi Party leader (and Chief Minister of Delhi) Arvind Kejriwal supported the revocation of Article 370. Explaining her decision to support the revocation, Mayawati stated that Article 370 and 35A had caused social, economic and political injustice in Jammu and Kashmir, and the people ‚Äì including the Buddhists ‚Äì will now get the long-pending benefits that was denied to them. She stated, \\"the Buddhist followers of Ambedkar were feeling happy\\". The Telangana and Andhra Pradesh-based YSR Congress Party's parliamentary party leader V. Vijayasai Reddy supported the scrapping of Article 370 and termed the step as a \\"courageous and daring\\" step by Amit Shah. Member of Parliament from Telugu Desam Party, Kanakamedala Ravindra Kumar said, \\"I must congratulate the Home Minister and PM as by strong implementation of this, the people of J&K; must be relieved from all this tension and live happily and become a part of the country\\" and welcomed the move. The Odisha-based Biju Janata Dal and Tamil Nadu-based All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party also supported the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir special status. Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, a prominent Indian Muslim organisation, supported the decision to abrogate Article 370 saying that the integration of Kashmir with India is in the interest of Kashmiri people. Calling it a dynamic place for tourism, the MEPs who visited Kashmir also said that all protests should be against terrorism in the valley, which is mostly from people of foreign countries. During their two-day-stay, the parliamentarians also interacted with the people in the valley, and pointed towards the integration of Kashmir with the beginning of their engagement with the civil society. Pakistan's response  6 August onward, Pakistan responded in numerous ways. The Foreign Office issued a statement stating India's revocation was an illegal \\"unilateral step\\". Pakistan's army chief said that the Pakistan Army would \\"go to any extent\\" to support the people of Kashmir. On 7 August, an emergency joint parliamentary sitting passed a resolution to condemn India's move. A meeting of the National Security Committee decided to downgrade Pakistan's diplomatic relations with India. The Samjhauta Express train service and the Thar Express were suspended.

On 11 August 2019, prime minister Imran Khan compared the Indian government to \\"Nazis\\", warning that global inaction over Kashmir would be same as \\"appeasing Hitler\\".

Pakistan's foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi issued a statement on Tuesday 13 August 2019 that he had written a letter to the president of the United Nations Security Council with a request to convene an emergency meeting of the council to discuss India's \\"illegal actions that violate UN resolutions on Kashmir\\". The foreign minister also called for circulation of the letter among members of the Security Council. On 20 August 2019, Pakistan announced that it will take the dispute to the International Court of Justice, adding that its case would centre on alleged human rights violations by India. On 4 August 2020, Pakistan's government released an updated political map which included Pakistan's territorial claims on Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, the Siachen Glacier, the eastern banks of Sir Creek, as well as Junagadh and Manavadar in India's Gujarat region. The map also annotated Ladakh's boundary with China as \\"frontier undefined\\", whose status would be formalised by \\"the sovereign authorities concerned after the settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute.\\" The map was adopted for official use throughout Pakistan. The government renamed the Kashmir Highway, which runs through Islamabad, as Srinagar Highway. On the occasion of the one-year anniversary of the revocation of Kashmir's special status, Pakistan also observed 5 August 2020 as Youm-e- Istehsal (\\"Day of Exploitation\\") nationally. Rallies and seminars were arranged to express solidarity with Kashmiris. China's response Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying opposed the integration of the Ladakh Union Territory into India's administrative jurisdiction, saying \\"it undermined China's territorial sovereignty\\" she went on to say: \\"India's action is unacceptable and would not have any legal effect,\\" regarding disputed territory on the China‚ÄìIndia border. Regarding Kashmir in general, Hua affirmed that \\"the Kashmir issue is an issue left from the past between India and Pakistan\\".

The Taliban states, \\"Linking the issue of Kashmir with that of Afghanistan by some parties will not aid in improving the crisis at hand because the issue of Afghanistan is not related nor should Afghanistan be turned into the theatre of competition between other countries.\\" The Taliban statement released by Zabiullah Mujahid for the \\"Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan\\" also expressed \\"deep sadness in this [revocation of the autonomous status of Kashmir] regard and urges both India and Pakistan to refrain from taking steps that could pave a way for violence and complications in the region and usurp the rights of Kashmiris\\". Demonstrations =Kashmir Valley= On 9 August, according to a Reuters report, over 10,000 people protested in Srinagar against the Indian government's decision to revoke Article 370, with some protesters pelting stones at government security personnel. In response, Indian police used tear gas and pellets against the protesters to disperse them. According to Al Jazeera, it has been receiving information from Srinagar residents via satellite phones and Wi-Fi available in the Kashmir region. They have reported protests on Friday. Clashes were occurring between the protesters and Indian forces, accompanied with pellet gun attack and the firing of tear gas shells by the Indian Forces.Some report that the pellet gun attacks have severely wounded and lacerated civilians. The Indian government called the Reuters report \\"completely fabricated and incorrect\\", but acknowledged that after the Friday mosque prayers, there were \\"a few stray protests in Srinagar/Baramulla and none involved a crowd of more than 20 people\\". The Wire said that the visuals published by BBC belie the Government reports. According to the BBC, it witnessed the police opening gunfire and using tear gas to disperse a crowd in Srinagar after Friday prayers on 9 August 2019. This witness report contradicts the Indian government statement that the \\"protest never took place\\". On 11 August, the Jammu and Kashmir director general of police, Dilbag Singh told Reuters, \\"between 1,000 and 1,500 people were returning from praying at mosques on Friday when 'some miscreants' started pelting stones at security officials\\", and in a reaction to the stone-pelting, rounds of pump- action gun was fired that caused injuries to a few people.

A large number of protesters demonstrated outside the Indian High Commission in London on 10 August 2019 to express anger over Indian action. There was another demonstration outside the Palace of Westminster on 14 August. A large protest took place outside the Indian High Commission in London the following day, in which Indians celebrating Indian Independence Day were attacked. Eggs, glass bottles, shoes and other objects were thrown at the High Commission and the people celebrating by the anti-India protesters, who were mostly British Pakistanis and Sikh extremists. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson later expressed \\"regret\\" over this violent incident, and assured that all necessary steps will be taken to ensure the safety and security of the embassy, its personnel, and visitors. On 3 September, another violent protest took place outside the Indian High Commission in London, when pro-Pakistan protesters pelted stones and eggs at the High Commission building, causing damage to the premises. London Mayor Sadiq Khan tweeted, \\"I utterly condemn this unacceptable behaviour and have raised this incident with the Metropolitan Police to take action.\\" The Metropolitan Police made two arrests for causing criminal damage at the Indian High Commission following the incident. British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab condemned the violence towards British Indians while addressing Parliament. There were protest demonstrations outside the Indian consulate in Birmingham on 9 August to denounce the Indian revocation of autonomous status of Jammu and Kashmir. Former Member of the British Parliament George Galloway was also part of the protest gathering and demanded a plebiscite in Kashmir. = Canada = A large number of protesters took to streets in Toronto, Canada on 11 August 2019 in support of the people of Jammu and Kashmir.

Protesters also gathered outside the White House on 10 August 2019 and urged Washington to help the people of Kashmir. Pakistan's ambassador Asad Majeed Khan held community events asking the United States to \\"inject some more sanity on the Indian side\\". Ghulam Nabi Fai, a Kashmiri diaspora alleged that the Indian plan is \\"not only to deprive them [Kashmiris] of their rights but to subjugate them through widespread killings and torture\\", while another protester originally hailing from Srinagar stressed that now was the time for the United States to mediate. On 25 August 2019, according to the India Today, the Kashmiri Pandit community in the US held a rally supporting the decision, saying that Article 370 was \\"discriminatory\\" towards minorities in the Kashmir region. At their rally, they told personal stories of their minority status in the Kashmir valley, the religious discrimination against them, their forced exodus in the 1990s, and they wanting to \\"go back to their homeland [valley]\\" which they left due to Islamic militancy. At an Atlanta rally, the protestors alleged that the Article 370 was high discriminatory against the resident \\"Shias, Dalits, Gujjars, Kashmiri Pandits, Kashmiri Sikhs\\" in the state, according to India Today. =Bangladesh= Many protest demonstrations have been reported in Bangladesh against the change of autonomous status of Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan's Abb Takk News channel reported that hundreds protested in Dhaka on 6 August 2019 against the Indian move. Again on 7 August 2019, there was another demonstration in the city of Dhaka where the protesters criticized Narendra Modi and his scrapping of autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir.

The protest was conducted after Eid al-Adha prayers in Bahrain illegally. The official Twitter handle of the country's Interior Ministry tweeted about the action taken by the local police to contain the protests and also about the legal proceedings being taken against them. Bahrain authorities further requested its citizens to not exploit religious gatherings to further political motives. =France= Protests were held in Paris, France on 9 August 2019 to denounce Indian step of abrogation of autonomous status of Jammu and Kashmir. The protesters alleged that India was conspiring to change the demography of Kashmir by expelling Kashmiris from their homes and bringing in Hindu settlers from other parts of India. =Australia= Pro-India and anti-India protesters faced off each other in Melbourne, Australia. Kashmiri Pandit groups welcomed India's decision, but the Pakistani community in Australia expressed \\"deep concern\\" regarding the situation in Kashmir. Indian groups in Australia said that this is something India has done internally and Pakistan has no right to interfere in India's internal matters. =Germany= Geo News reported that the Kashmiri diaspora gathered at the Pariser Platz of Berlin's Brandenburg Gate and protested against India on 11 August 2019. =South Korea= In South Korea, a group of protesters in Seoul who waved Pakistani flags and shouted anti-India slogans‚Äîalong with abuses towards Modi‚Äîwere confronted by an Indian delegation including Indian activist Shazia Ilmi. The Indian delegation started to counter the protesters, following which the local police intervened and escorted Shazia Ilmi and her associates from the location. Social media, activism and misinformation Several human rights activists and world leaders also commented on their social media accounts about the Kashmir situation. On Twitter, the hashtags such as #KashmirBleeds became top trends. According to India Today and other Indian media sources, several fabricated images and videos have appeared on social media such as Facebook, Twitter and other platforms. A closer examination of these photos and videos established that these are fabricated propaganda that utilized old photos or videos and the posters misrepresent them to be \\"current situation in Kashmir\\". According to Dawn, a Pakistan-based newspaper, the Kashmir blackout has led to an \\"online misinformation war\\". The Nation, in its editorial said, \\"The lack of coverage in Kashmir has increased the likelihood of misinformation and panic being spread, all of which puts the lives of Kashmiris in danger and uncertainty.\\" The Indian Home Ministry alleged that \\"several Pakistani handles are spreading fake news\\", and asked Twitter to block a list of accounts. Separately, the Jammu and Kashmir superintendent of police has demanded Twitter to block an account that allegedly is spreading rumors. The demand letter states that such rumors harm the law and order situation and is a \\"threat to lives\\". They allege that the platform is posting \\"objectionable and malicious\\" content. Twitter has blocked four of these accounts, and its officials stated that they are reviewing some others. This included the Twitter account of Syed Ali Shah Geelani who is a Kashmiri separatist Hurriyat leader. Indian government accused the BBC and Reuters of lying and fabricating news about large scale protests in Kashmir, even though they were recorded on video. According to India Today, the authenticity of the BBC video about the protest has been questioned because it is an edited combination of a series of clips and it shows an absence of police and security personnel almost everywhere the edited video, even though Kashmir was under a lockdown with heavy security deployment on 9 August 2019 ‚Äì the day the video was recorded and posted by BBC. According to India Today, a portion of the video is authentically from Dullbagh Road in Srinagar, but it is unclear if it is a fresh video or an old video clip inserted in. Some Indians allege that parts of this video are from Pakistan- administered Kashmir.  Impact  Impact of the Revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir encompasses a year without high-speed internet, changes in the politics and bureaucracy of the region, priority of counter- insurgency operations, new domicile rules, talks of restoration of statehood, judicial lethargy, decline in stone-pelting among other things.

Upon the introduction of devolved government the environment and built heritage were not listed as reserved issues, and so for the most part conservation is the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament, the Scottish Government, and the public bodies that report to them. Although originally reserved, responsibility for all planning and nature conservation matters at sea up to 200 miles from the Scottish coast was transferred to the Scottish Government in 2008.Scotland handed sea planning role BBC News, 27 November 2008 Some matters related to conservation, such as international treaties and border controls on prohibited species, remain the responsibility of the UK Government. Much environment legislation in Scotland is based on the adoption into Scots law of European Union directives, such as the Habitats Directive. As such there may be changes to the structure and nature of conservation activities in Scotland following the UK's departure from the European Union. Scottish Government =Scottish Government directorates= Conservation matters are dealt with across a number of directorates of the Scottish Government: *Environmental protection, forestry and biodiversity are the responsibility of the Environment and Forestry Directorate. *The Marine Scotland Directorate is responsible for the integrated management of Scotland's seas. *The Energy and Climate Change Directorate covers measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. *Cultural Heritage is the responsibility of the Culture, Tourism and Major Events Directorate. =Scottish ministers= Three Cabinet Secretaries hold portfolios with responsibility for conservation issues: *The Cabinet Secretary for Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform has ministerial responsibility for many conservation issues, including climate change and environmental protection, biodiversity, Crown Estate Scotland, environmental and climate justice, flood prevention & coastal erosion, land use and land reform, animal welfare, wildlife crime and water quality. *The portfolio of the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Economy and Tourism includes ministerial responsibility for agriculture and crofting, fisheries and aquaculture, and forestry. *The portfolio of the Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Fair Work and Culture includes ministerial responsibility for architecture and built heritage. =Public bodies= Neptune's Staircase on the Caledonian Canal is looked after by Scottish Canals. The following are public bodies of the Scottish Government, with notes on their areas of responsibility. Executive agencies *Forestry and Land Scotland is responsible for management of the national forest estate. *Scottish Forestry is responsible for forestry regulation and support. Executive non-departmental public bodies *Cairngorms National Park Authority *Historic Environment Scotland is responsible for cultural and built heritage. *Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park Authority *NatureScot is responsible for landscape protection and wildlife conservation. *The Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh undertakes scientific study into plants and their conservation. *Scottish Environment Protection Agency is responsible for waterways, pollution and waste management. Public corporations *Crown Estate Scotland is responsible for managing a range of rural, coastal and marine assets that are held 'in right of the Crown'. *Scottish Canals manages Scotland's inland waterways. United Kingdom Government Within the UK Government, environmental protection is the responsibility of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). Two UK-wide executive agencies with responsibility for conservation matters include Scotland within their remit: *The Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) co-ordinates the work of the UK's nature conservation bodies (SNH being the Scottish body). *The Forestry Commission co-ordinates international forestry policy support and certain plant health functions in respect of trees and forestry.

Most processors use a form of speculative execution, this feature allows the processors to make educated guesses about the instructions that will most likely need to be executed in the near future. This speculation can leave traces in the cache, which attackers use to extract data using a timing attack, similar to side-channel exploitation of Spectre. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ID issued to this vulnerability is .  History  SWAPGS is closely related to the Spectre-V1 vulnerability, which used similar side-channel vulnerabilities to access privileged cache memory in an operating system. The vulnerability was discovered by Andrei Vlad Lutas of Bitdefender and was reported to Intel. Intel coordinated with industry partners to address the issue on a software level. The first patches for SWAPGS were released on 9 July 2019 as part of the Microsoft Patch Tuesday. However, details regarding the vulnerability were not disclosed until 6 August 2019. SWAPGS itself is an instruction to swap the GS register with a value stored in MSR. This is typically used to store kernel data.  Affected systems  Any Intel-based processor that support SWAPGS and WRGSBASE instructions is affected. This includes every Intel processor starting from the Intel Ivy Bridge CPUs up to the most recent Intel processors. Devices equipped with AMD processors are not affected, according to the company's product security update.  Mitigation  For Windows operating system-based devices, Microsoft's security advisory lists the patches released in July 2019, which fix the vulnerability. For Linux distributions, it is advised to check whether there are SWAPGS-specific patches that need to be applied. The kernel documentation describes the nature of the attacks and the in-kernel mitigations. Bitdefender mentions in its original report that Apple devices are unlikely to be at risk.

The shell contains 6 whorls, convex, longitudinally ribbed and crossed with transverse ridges that become sharply and prominently nodulous upon the ribs. The spire is sharp with a light brown apex. The aperture is narrowly quadrate. The outer lip is varicose and denticulated. The posterior sinus is moderate. Angas, G.F. 1877.

Vict., xii., 1900, p. 176.. But P. rufozonata is only two-thirds the height of P. tincta, is of a more slender build, and lacks the peculiar excavate base of that tropical species. The latter feature is shown in Reeve's figure, and is mentioned by Hervier Hervier -Journ. de Conch., xlv., 1897, p. 92 as the \\" depression circulaire autour de son canal basal.\\" The records by Melvill and Standen Melvill and Standen‚ÄîJourn. of Conch., viii., 1897, p. 403. and by Bouge and Dautzenberg Bouge and Dautzenberg‚ÄîJourn. de Conch., lxi., 1914, p. 204. of P. rufozonata, from the Loyalty Islands, are doubtless due to the confusion between this and P. tincta. P. rufozonata is indeed more nearly related to P. albifuniculata Reeve, but is smaller, more fusiform, and has the radials more prominent owing to the spirals being slighter. A more distant relation is P. barnardi, easily separable by the heavier sculpture and striking colour pattern. Distribution This marine species is endemic to Australia and occurs off New South Wales, South Australia, Tasmania and Victoria. References * Verco, J.C. 1909.

History Gardiki existed as a settlement before the 13th century. Its name, which derives from a Slavic term for \\"small fort\\", demonstrates the naturally fortified nature of the site, even before the construction of the castle. The castle of Gardiki was built sometime after 1284, and was in Byzantine hands by 1297, when the Princess of Achaea, Isabella of Villehardouin, constructed the fortress of Chateneuf to protect the inhabitants of the plains of Messenia and Arcadia from the raids of the Byzantine troops based in the region around Gardiki and Mystras. Indeed, it is likely that the castle was built by the Byzantines, as it is not recorded that it was ever held by the Latins of Achaea. In 1374, the new bailli (viceroy) of the Principality of Achaea, Francis of San Severino, attacked Gardiki, captured the village and defeated a Byzantine relief force, but was unable to capture the strongly fortified castle and had to withdraw. In 1422, the Republic of Venice considered taking over the two fortresses, along with much of what remained of the Principality of Achaea and parts of the Byzantine Despotate of the Morea, as part of a defensive alliance to protect the Morea from the Ottoman Empire, but nothing came of the negotiations with the local Latin and Greek leaders. As a result, when the Ottomans under Turahan Bey invaded the Morea in 1423, several towns, including Gardiki, were captured and pillaged. In 1460, during the Ottoman conquest of the Despotate of the Morea, the population of the town of Leontari sought refuge in the Castle of Gardiki. The castle, commanded by Manuel Bochalis, surrendered on condition of safety, but the Ottomans massacred the entire population of 6,000. Only Bocharis and his family escaped this fate, as they were relatives of the Ottoman grand vizier, Mahmud Pasha Angeloviƒá. Location The exact site of the medieval castle is unknown. The descriptions in the medieval sources do not match with the village of Gardiki (modern Anavryto) to the east of Leontari, where furthermore no traces of fortifications survive. It is more likely that the medieval site is to be found southwest of Leontari, some north of Kalamata, at the ruins of Kokla or Kokkala (close to Ellinitsa), where already Pietro Antonio Pacifico and Jean Alexandre Buchon had proposed as its likely site.

He was also a principal investigator on the Spitzer Large Area Survey with Hyper-Suprime-Cam (SPLASH) project. Before joining IPAC, he was a postdoctoral fellow on the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) and a graduate student at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Capak joined Caltech, in 2004, to work on the COSMOS project where he led the multi-wavelength data processing and analysis effort. As part of this work he developed a way of estimating redshifts from photometry (photometric redshifts) that accounted for the signal strength of weak lensing, enabling the first 3-dimensional map of dark matter. He subsequently led the development of new technique based on manifold learning that significantly reduced the number of observations required to calibrate photometric redshifts for dark energy measurements. This made it practical to carry out the calibration observations in a reasonable amount of time on the Keck and VLT telescopes with the C3R2 survey. Capak has also worked on improving galaxy modeling techniques using more advanced statistical methods and machine learning including leading the development of the fitting pipeline for the SPHEREx mission. In 2010, Capak took over leadership of the COSMOS collaboration which he led until 2018. The COSMOS data set helped to develop the concept behind several experiments to measure the properties of dark matter and dark energy including the Dark Universe Explorer (DUNE), which was incorporated into the Euclid mission. Capak consulted on the design of NASA's Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST). He was also a co-investigator on the team that developed NASA's SPHEREx mission. Capak's work has been featured in the media including his work on Abell 520, the Baby Boom Galaxy. He also discovered the most distant known cluster of galaxies and carried out the first large study of the interstellar medium in the distant universe. In 2017-2019, he was identified as one of the top 1% of cited researchers in space sciences.. Since 2017, Capak has been an associate of the Cosmic Dawn Center (DAWN) in Copenhagen, Denmark, a center focused on high-z research.

It is a simple stone hall church built in the 9th or 10th century. Located at about above sea level on a mountain ridge‚Äîthe watershed between the Ksani and Aragvi valleys‚ÄîLomisa is the principal shrine for the highland province of Mtiuleti and neighboring communities as well as the scene of an annual festival in the seventh week after the Easter, which features a mass sacrificial slaughter of animals. Due to its historic and cultural significance, the church is inscribed on the list of Georgia's Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance.  Location and architecture  The Lomisa shrine tops a high mountainous pass in the Dusheti Municipality, some 7 km south of the village of Kvemo Mleta and 18 km northwest of the small town of Pasanauri as the crow flies. The Lomisi or Alevi mountain, on which the church is located, overlooks the Aragvi valley in the historical district of Mtiuleti, now administratively part of Georgia's Mtskheta-Mtianeti region, to the north and a portion of the Ksani valley to the south, which fell under the control of breakaway South Ossetia during the Russo-Georgian War of August 2008. Lomisa is a simple hall church, measuring 14.5 √ó 7.8 m, built of undressed stone. The original edifice dates to the 9th or 10th century. There are two annexes which were constructed later, to the south and to the north. Parts of the church have fallen to ruin, making the building partly buried in the soil and debris. The interior has been remodeled several times in the course of history. In the extant church, the vaulted ceiling rests on the arch sustained by pilasters. The longitudinal walls feature niches. The church building is surrounded by ruins of various structures, including the ragged columns of what once was a two-storey bell- tower to the south of the church.  History  The Lomisa church during the 2011 festival. Ruins of a bell-tower at Lomisa. Lomisa features in many local legends and folktales. It is said that the church was built here to commemorate the deliverance of 7,000 Georgians from the Chorasmian captivity through the miraculous intervention of the icon of Saint George which was mounted on an ox called Loma (\\"a lion\\"). Another legend has it that a captain of a royal detachment incurred the wrath of the icon when he chopped the church door for firewood: the soldiers were blinded and their eyesight would not return until the captain promised to donate an iron door to the church. An ironclad oakwood door‚Äîwith the 16th‚Äì17th-century Georgian inscriptions‚Äîis still kept inside the church. The church also features an old massive iron chain which believers put around the neck and walk round the shrine three times counterclockwise to make a promise or a wish. Lomisa has historically been the most sacred Christian shrine for the eastern Georgian mountaineers and their most binding oath was by Saint George of Lomisa. It was the place where the locals would gather and deliberate on the matters of war and peace. The church enjoyed patronage from the Georgian royalty and nobility. It also appears to have owned serfs. In the 1320s, King George V of Georgia stopped at Lomisa to pray before St. George on his way back from a journey to the Darial Gorge. This king specially issued a set of laws to regulate conditions in the mountain valleys; one of the clauses had it that a murderer of a peasant of Lomisa presented thereto by the king or by anyone was to be fined with 1,500 pieces of silver. The Lomisa shrine preserved many church items, such icons, crosses, banners, and various utensils. Prince Vakhushti, compiling his geography of Georgia around 1745, wrote that the church safeguarded \\"numerous icons and crosses, of gold and silver\\". Some of these surviving items have been removed for preservation to safer and more accessible places, such as a church in Mleta or museums in Tbilisi. Among them are utensils donated by the eristavi (\\"dukes\\") of Aragvi and a silver candle holder presented to the Lomisa church by Princess Ketevan (1744‚Äì1808), wife of the Georgian royal prince Vakhtang, praying St. George of Lomisa to grant them children in an inscription on the item.  Lomisoba  Georgian pilgrims at Lomisi look over the Ksani valley, separated from the rest of Georgia by the Russian border guards since 2008. The Lomisa church hosts an annual festival, known as Lomisoba (literally, \\"of/related to Lomisa\\"), probably a remnant of an ancient pre-Christian cult superimposed by the veneration of St. George. Every year, on Wednesday in the seventh week after the Easter, thousands of people from various regions of Georgia, especially Mtiuleti, Khevi, and Khevsureti, make a pilgrimage up to the Lomisa church. The festival features a large-scale ritual animal sacrifice, in which hundreds of livestock, especially sheep, are slaughtered down in the valley, not far from the church. In the 2010s, the tradition has been increasingly criticized by animal rights activists, but the locals have rejected the calls to abandon it. The Georgian Orthodox clergy have stated that the Church \\"prefers unbloody sacrifice\\" but does not forbid the tradition of animal killing and concomitant supra (feast).

He was the 10th Duke of Medinaceli, an Ambassador of the King of Spain, Majordomo and Stable master of the queen, and a knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece. Family Nicol√°s Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba y de la Cerda was born in Madrid on 24 June 1682. He was the second son of Luis Mauricio Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba y Figueroa (1650‚Äì90), 7th Marquis of Priego and 7th Duke of Feria. His mother was Feliche de la Cerda y Arag√≥n (1657‚Äì1709), sister of the 9th Duke of Medinaceli, Luis Francisco de la Cerda (1660‚Äì1711), . His uncle was the last male descendant of the second line of the Cerda house, descendants of Prince Ferdinand de la Cerda (1255‚Äì75), first son of King Alfonso X of Castile (1221‚Äì84). His older brother was Manuel Luis (1679‚Äì1700), 8th Marquis of Priego and 8th Duke of Feria, whom he succeeded in 1700. His other siblings were Mar√≠a Francisca (1677‚Äì99), Mar√≠a de la Encarnaci√≥n (1696‚Äì1746), who married Vicente √Ålvarez de Toledo y Portugal, 10th Count of Oropesa, and Luis Mar√≠a (1708‚Äì1717). Career Before the death of his older brother, Nicol√°s served as the page of Queen Maria Anna of Neuburg (1667‚Äì1740), second wife of Charles II of Spain (1661‚Äì1700), and then served as the gentleman of the chamber of Philip V of Spain (1683‚Äì1746). He participated in the Battle of C√°diz (1702) and in the defense of El Puerto de Santa Mar√≠a. In 1711 Nicol√°s succeeded his uncle Luis Francisco de la Cerda y Arag√≥n, 9th Duke of Medinaceli, who had died without issue. He ordered the transfer to Madrid of the library created by Antonio de la Cerda, 7th Duke of Medinaceli (1607‚Äì71) in El Puerto de Santa Mar√≠a, which consisted of 1,474 works according to an inventory of 1673, and of the Seville library of what today is called the Casa de Pilatos, in order to create a centralized library. However, the collection was later sold to the friars of San Martin de Madrid by the Duchess of Cardona (possibly his wife). The Duke of Medinaceli as a young man At the start of 1714, the King chose the palace of the Duke of Medinaceli to retire after the death of his first wife. The king appointed Nicol√°s as an Ambassador Extraordinary in charge of taking jewels to the intended new Queen Elisabeth Farnese (1692‚Äì1766) in Parma and receiving her in the king's name. He served as the queen's Majordomo and Stable master. By Royal Decree of 10 January 1724 he was honored with the Collar of the Fleece, which was given to him by King Louis I of Spain (1707‚Äì24). Nicol√°s Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba endowed many of his estates with churches, chapels and oratories. On 7 May 1727 he gave a license for the establishment of the Capuchin Order in El Puerto de Santa Mar√≠a. He ordered construction of the granaries of Montilla and Aguilar de la Frontera. The Montilla granary is dated in 1722 and was designed by the Cordoban architect Juan Antonio Camacho de Saavedra. The same architect may have designed the Tercia de Aguilar for Nicol√°s, sometimes called the Tercia del Duque, which stands on the site of a previous building. He died in Madrid on 19 March 1739, and was buried at the Monastery of Santa Mar√≠a de Huerta in the Province of Soria. Marriage On 30 September 1703 he married his first cousin, Jer√≥nima Mar√≠a Sp√≠nola y de la Cerda (1687‚Äì1757), in the San Sebastian Church, Madrid. His wife was the daughter of Carlos Felipe Sp√≠nola y Colonna, Marquis of Los Balbases and Duke of Sexto, and of Isabel Mar√≠a de la Cerda y Arag√≥n, daughter of Juan Francisco de la Cerda, 8th Duke of Medinaceli.

She specializes in phonology, morphophonology, stress systems, vowel harmony, syllabic structure and word-structure, focusing on Altaic languages, Turkish, and French.  Education and career  Charette earned her BA from Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al (UQAM), and her MA and PhD from McGill University, graduating in 1988. By 1989 she was working as a Training Fellow in Linguistics at the University of London School of Oriental and African Studies; by 2010 she was a reader in linguistics there, and later became a senior lecturer, teaching courses on phonology at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. She was also associate dean for postgraduate matters at the Faculty of Languages and Cultures. Charette retired and moved back to Canada in 2019.  Research  Charette is one of the founders and first proponents of Government Phonology, the phonological adaptation of Government and Binding Theory in syntax, with work done on vowel-zero alternation in French, on government-licensing, on headedness in element theory, on empty and pseudo-empty categories, on Turkish word-structure, among many others. Government Phonology she contributed the concepts of government-licensing and licensing constraints; in 1989 she was the first to propose a phonological version of the Minimality Condition. With Asli G√∂kse, Charette conducted research on licensing constraints (LC's);\\"The phonology of empty categories\\". Thesis by Paul John at the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al, April 2014Edmund Gussmann, The Phonology of Polish, Oxford University Press 2007, pages 117 and 128 later research on LC's refers to their work as the \\"Charette-G√∂ksel Hypothesis\\". Together with Jonathan Kaye, she led the research at SOAS, London, aimed at reducing the number of elements in Element Theory, concluding in the emergence of the so-called Revised Theory of Elements. Charette's most cited work is her monograph from 1991, Conditions on Phonological Government, published by Cambridge University Press, which is the first extended study written within the framework of phonological government.Lingua. 1995. p. 28. In her analysis of French, she contributed to the general understanding of the relation between skeletal positions and higher prosodic structure in the form of her \\"pointless onsets\\" in h-aspir√© words. She participated in the preparations of the festschrift for Jonathan Kaye, Living on the Edge, eventually edited by Stefan Ploch alone and published in 2003. In 2001, Charette spoke at the Ninth Manchester Phonology Meeting in the session Phonology and syntax - the same or different?, where she presented the Government Phonology perspective. In 2009, she co-edited, with Peter K. Austin, Oliver Bond, David Nathan and Peter Sells, the volume Proceedings of Conference on Language Documentation and Linguistic Theory 2, London: SOAS. Her contributions to the understanding of the syllable in phonological theory, of Turkish vowel harmony and of schwa in French are acknowledged in handbooks and companions to phonology.

As a WASP, she was a civilian pilot, working for the military. Her assignment was ferrying new aircraft of many different types from the factories where they were built to airbases. This freed up male pilots for combat. She died in 2019, at the age of 103. Early life She was born in Woodburn, Oregon, on July 10, 1916 to Ralph and Frances (Zimmering) Kocher, and grew up on the family's small farm. She decided she wanted to fly airplanes when she was eight, after reading The Red Knight of Germany, Floyd Gibbons's biography of World War I flying ace, Baron von Richthofen. Her initial introduction to flight was when she took a biplane ride at a state fair, which inspired her to take flying lessons. Olsen earned her private pilot's license as a civilian in the 1930s, taking her checkride in a Taylorcraft. Three years later, she was flying twin-engine P-38s, with a total of . Prior to joining the WASPs, Olsen flew with the Woodburn Flying Club, the Civil Air Patrol in Portland and The Dales and worked as a dance instructor in Portland. She was reportedly one of only three women in the Portland area to have a private pilot's license.  Woman Airforce Service Pilot (WASP)  Olsen joined the WASPs in 1943 when the program was created. A petite woman, tall Olsen embarked on a weight-gaining regimen to make the required minimum. There were more than 25,000 applicants, of which 1,879 were accepted and 1,074 graduated. Olsen was a member of class 43-4 (43-W-4 in some sources), which included 152 students. Her training began in February, 1943, at Houston Municipal Field (now named William P. Hobby Airport) along with half of her class. The other half of the class reported to Avenger Field in Sweetwater, Texas. She initially hated her training, but stuck with it to avoid the embarrassment of dropping out. She encountered difficulties when her fianc√© died and she took time off to attend his funeral, putting her behind the rest of her class. Despite being sick with a cold on her return, she passed a checkride; this avoided her being put back a class, although she continued to struggle to catch up. She graduated on August 7, 1943. After graduation, her assignment was to the Sixth Ferrying Group in Long Beach, California. She flew 61 missions, and was one of only twelve women certified for night flight. Olsen would take a pair of good shoes with her on ferry flights, so she could go on dancing dates with men at her destination before having to take off on her next flight. She would leave her name and address in the cockpits of planes she had ferried, to be found later by the combat pilots. Two such pilots wrote her postcards, one reporting that the plane \\"performed perfectly\\", in spite of having been previously flow by a woman. Dorothy Olsen, seen on a P-38 Lightning, during her time with the Women Airforce Service Pilots F-22 pilot Capt. Jammie Jamieson at McChord AFB. WASPs were not, at the time, considered military personnel; she is listed in the Sixth Ferrying Group personnel book with the title of \\"Civilian Pilot\\". When the WASP program ended in 1944, the pilots were discharged at their home base, with no transportation allowance to get back home. WASPs were retroactively granted veteran status as part of the GI Bill Improvement Act Of 1977. According to Olsen, she flew more than 20 different aircraft models, both Army and Navy types. Her favorite type was the P-51. A friend, Debbie Jennings, said she disliked flying bombers because in fighters, \\"she was by herself and could do whatever she wanted\\". Jennings mentioned that Olsen enjoyed scaring farmers on their tractors by flying close to them and at railroad stations also. For her actions, she was reprimanded by her superiors. According to her son, \\"She felt bombers were like driving buses\\" and her daughter noted that Olsen felt the P-38 was \\"an old woman's plane\\".  After the war  The extent of her post- war flying is unclear. One source says she flew commercially for Western Skyways. Other sources state she never flew commercially, and not at all after having children. Olsen is reported to have never flown privately after the war; she is quoted as saying, \\"Why would I want to fly a Cessna when I've flown a P-51?\\" After the war, she married Harold W. Olsen, and moved to University Place, Washington. The couple had a daughter, Julie (Stranburg), and a son, Kim. Olsen ran antique shops after raising their children. Nerve damage from a dental procedure left her deaf for many years. At the age of 80, she received cochlear implants which restored her hearing. In 2010, Olsen (along with all other WASPs) was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal to commemorate her service. In 2015, she was honored with a flyover of Seattle's Boeing Field by vintage aircraft for her 99th birthday. In 2016, Olsen celebrated her 100th birthday at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. Also in attendance were fellow WASPs Alta Thomas, Betty Dybbro, and Mary Jean Sturdevant. Olsen died on July23, 2019, at her home in University Place, Washington, aged 103, and was given military honors at her funeral. Prior to her death, she was one of 38 WASPs still alive.

It is constructed using a mortar (the kind typically used to crush grain) with a drumhead made from goatskin stretched over it, with tension applied to the drumhead by way of two long wooden pestles (ca. 1.25 meters long). On either end the skin is rolled around the two pestles, and then stretched over the mortar and fastened with a rope. Frequently the pestles are kept in place; they can serve to tighten the skin and thus tune the instrument. The skin needs to be moistened periodically; sometimes water is simply applied during the performance, but another method is to keep water in the mortar and moisten the skin from the inside by tilting the instrument. Imzad music is held in higher esteem, but tende is played more frequently--during camel festivals, ceremonies, and certain types of dance. Its music is for ordinary people and requires no great skill or specialization to master, and is highly communal, involving singing, dancing, and clapping. History Tende as a musical instrument might be relatively new, dating to the beginning of the twentieth century; Francis Rodd described one in 1926, in the A√Ør area.

Standifer Construction Company of Vancouver for the United States Shipping Board as part of the wartime shipbuilding program of the Emergency Fleet Corporation (EFC) to restore the nation's Merchant Marine. In March 1920, only on her second voyage, the vessel caught fire and had to be abandoned by the crew. The ship was subsequently towed to Baltimore where she was broken up in 1924. Design and construction After the United States entry into World War I, a large shipbuilding program was undertaken to restore and enhance shipping capabilities both of the United States and their Allies. As part of this program, EFC placed orders with nation's shipyards for a large number of vessels of standard designs. Design 1015 cargo ship was a standard cargo freighter of approximately 9,400 tons deadweight designed by Moore Shipbuilding Co. and adopted by USSB. Olockson was part of the order for 10 vessels placed by USSB with Guy M. Standifer Construction Co. on 8 January 1918 and was laid down at the shipbuilder's yard on 3 January 1919 and launched on 11 September 1919 (yard number 6). The ship had two main decks as well as forecastle and poop deck and was built on the Isherwood principle of longitudinal framing providing extra strength to the body of the vessel. The freighter had five main holds and also possessed all the modern machinery for quick loading and unloading of cargo from five large hatches, including ten winches and a large number of derricks. She was also equipped with wireless apparatus, had submarine signal system installed and had electrical lights installed along the decks. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, a depth of . Olockson was originally assessed at and and had deadweight of approximately 9,419. The vessel had a steel hull with double bottom throughout with exception of her machine compartment, and a single 2,800 ihp triple expansion steam engine, with cylinders of , and diameter with a stroke, that drove a single screw propeller and moved the ship at up to . The steam for the engine was supplied by three single-ended Scotch marine boilers fitted for both coal and oil fuel, with latter one being the main source. Operational history While the steamer was still under construction she was allocated by the USSB to Pacific Steamship Company for Oriental service. However, with ever changing trade conditions, Olockson and another Shipping Board steamer, Wawalona, were later reassigned to carry a cargo of flour for the Atlantic Coast with further delivery to Europe. On 17 November 1919 the freighter finally moved from the builder's yard and was berthed at the municipal dock in preparation for loading. She then took on board a large cargo of flour for Europe and lumber for Panama Canal Zone discharged from damaged steamer Siletz which was scheduled to go into drydock for repairs. Following an established USSB policy the Shipping Board ship could only continue with cargo to Europe if an equivalent amount of cargo space would be allocated by a foreign shipping operator, so Olockson were to discharge her cargo in one of the East Coast ports. The cargo transfer was completed by December 3 and the steamer then proceeded to load additional cargo eventually departing Portland on December 6. After an uneventful journey Olockson arrived at Balboa on Christmas Day discharging 953 tons of lumber there and then continuing on to the ports in the Northeast with the remaining cargo consisting of 7,128 tons of flour. She reached Philadelphia on 10 January 1920 where she unloaded part of her cargo before continuing on to New York. She returned to Philadelphia on February 3 after being chartered by Barber Line to transport cargo to the Far East. After taking on board 2,500 tons of steel rails and 1,594,100 gallons of gasoline in cases and drums she cleared from Philadelphia on March 2 bound for Japan and Japanese-occupied Vladivostok. The freighter reached Crist√≥bal in the afternoon of March 11, and exited from the Panama Canal into the Pacific at 18:58 on March 12. The ship was under command of captain Thomas Endreson and had a crew of forty five. At approximately 06:10 on March 13 a fire was discovered by the first assistant engineer while Olockson was approximately southwest by south off Punta Mala lighthouse and about from Balboa in approximate position . The fire was well under way and the engineer could barely escape the quickly spreading flames. A wireless call for help was sent out and U.S. Navy cruiser and tug Gorgona were dispatched to the ship's aid. Due to severity of the fire and considering the nature of the ship's cargo the captain ordered the crew to abandon ship. Several lifeboats were lowered and about half the crew of forty-five disembarked the burning vessel without any issues while the captain and the other half remained on board to try to fight off the fire. At about 9:00 some gasoline exploded in the aft hold tearing off the wireless house. A series of gasoline explosions followed forcing the rest of the crew to abandon the burning vessel by 11:00. The survivors were then picked up by steamer SS Salvador which responded to Olocksons call for help and was standing by. After picking up all the survivors, Salvador took course towards Balboa. In the afternoon of March 13 she encountered Tacoma and transferred all the survivors on board the cruiser. The tug reached the area in the morning of March 14 and took the burning freighter into tow bringing her to Balboa outer harbor by about 18:00 on March 17 where Olockson was immediately beached. Holes were cut in the steamer's hull while she was lying at low tide, and after arrival of high tide they were plugged by divers to ensure the water stays inside the burning holds. The fire was finally extinguished by approximately 17:30 on March 21. Olockson was then floated on April 19 and brought into inner harbor next day where she was berthed to unload any undamaged cargo. The unloading was finished by May 26 and in total all 2,500 tons of steel and 593,832 gallons of gasoline were salvaged from the burned vessel. After examining the vessel USSB decided not to rebuild the ship but rather offered it for sale in \\"as is, where is\\" condition in September 1920. However, as no bids were received that matched USSB expected price of about 100,000 the sale fell through and the ship remained moored in Balboa for the next several years. USSB continued offering the vessel for sale, for example they did so in June 1922. Olockson was eventually sold to the Boston Iron metal Company of Baltimore. In April 1923 the vessel was loaded with scrap iron at Balboa and towed 2,239 miles by collier to Hampton Roads. She was then brought from there by tug Joseph D. Wood to Baltimore on 9 May 1923 and remained moored at the bottom of Fallsway for the next several months. The ship was eventually broken up and scrapped in February 1924.

The disease accounts for 1.5% to 2% of all the lymphomas that occur in the pediatric age group. Initially, PTFL was found only in children and adolescents and termed Pediatric follicular lymphoma. More recently, however, the disease has been found to occur also in adults. This lead the World health Organization (2016) to rename the disorder pediatric-type follicular lymphoma. (The disease is also referred to as pediatric-type nodular follicular lymphoma.) At the same time the World Health Organization also recognized PTFL as a clinical entity distinct from the follicular lymphoma disorders in which it was previously classified. This reclassification was based on fundamental differences between the two diseases. PTFL differs from follicular lymphoma in its clinical manifestations, its pathophysiology including the genomic alterations (i.e. chromosome abnormalities and gene mutations) which occur in the diseases malignant cells, and its clinical course. Relative to the last point, PTFL often presents histologically as a high-grade malignancy but unlike the small percentage of follicular lymphoma cases that similarly present as a high grade malignancy, it almost invariably takes an indolent, relapsing and remitting course without progressing to a more aggressive and incurable form. Recognition of PTFL as a distinct disease separate from follicular lymphoma is critical to avoid mistaking it for a more aggressive lymphoma that requires potentially toxic chemotherapy treatments. This appears to be particularly the case when PTFL occurs in children, adolescents, and perhaps very young adults. A significant percentage of cases that were once diagnosed as PTFL are now regarded as being large B-cell lymphoma with IRF4 rearrangements, a very rare disease that was provisionally defined by the World Health organization (2016) as distinctly separate from PTFL. PTFL is here described based on this recently formulated and important distinction.  Presentation  PTFL occurs in male (male to female ratio ~10;1) children or adolescents (ages 1‚Äì17 years, median age ~13-14), less frequently in young adults (ages 18‚Äì30 years), and occasionally in older adults. In ~90% of cases, the diseases is diagnosed in an early stage (i.e. stage I or II) and localized to one or two adjacent lymph node chains. Historically, PTFL has been described as commonly presenting with swollen lymph nodes and/or tonsils in the head and neck regions, less commonly as swollen lymph nodes in the axillary and/or inguinal regions, and/or rarely as swollen lymph nodes in the abdomen and/or infiltrations of the malignant cells into the testes, bone marrow, and/or central nervous system. However, many if not all of the latter rare cases as well as cases that exhibit tonsil involvement are now regarded by the World Health Organization (2016) as due to a provisional entity termed large B-cell lymphoma with IRF4 rearrangement. This diseases is a follicular-type large B-cell lymphoma that also afflicts children, adolescents, and young adults but is otherwise distinguished from PTFL by its lack of a strong predominance in males, its common occurrence in extra-nodal sites, its histology, its clinical course, and the genomic alterations carried by its malignant B-cells, particularly the hallmark translocation of the IRF4 (interferon regulatory factor 4) gene (also termed the MUM1 or melanoma associated antigen (mutated) 1 gene) on the short (i.e. p) arm of chromosome 6 at position 25.3https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3662 near to the IGH@ immunoglobulin heavy locus on the long (i.e. q) arm of chromosome 14 at position 32.33https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3492 This acquired genomic abnormality forces the overexpression of interferon regulatory factor protein. Excluding cases now regarded as being large B-cell lymphomas with IRF4 rearrangement, PTFL presents almost exclusively with enlargement of lymph nodes in the head, neck, axilla, or groin.  Pathophysiology  PTFL is the proliferation of a clone (i.e. a group of genetically identical cells that share a common ancestry) of B-cells that act non-physiologically by invading and disrupting the structure and function of lymphoid tissues. This cell clone forms, increases in size, and spreads to other lymphoid tissues in association with its progressively increasing accumulation of numerous chromosome deletions and gene mutations, although different sets of these alterations occur in different individuals with the disease. These alterations are thought to promote the survival of the malignant cells by inhibiting their programmed cell death, blocking their maturation, increasing their ability to evade the immune system, and/or creating conditions favorable for the development of other genomic alterations that have these pro-malignancy effects. The most common chromosome deletion is the 1p36 deletion which occurs in 20-50% of PTFL cases. This alteration is a deletion in the q arm of chromosome 1 at position 36 that results in the lose of TNFAIP3, a gene that encodes tumor necrosis factor, alpha-induced protein 3. This protein functions to inhibit the activation of NF-Œ∫B, to block programmed cell death, and to regulate lymphocyte-based immune responses through its ubiquitin ligase activity. Other alterations repeatedly seen in PTFL include mutations in the following genes: 1) TNFRSF4 (30-50% of cases) which encodes tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 4, a receptor that stimulates immune responses in T-cells, a set of non-B-cell lymphocytes; 2) IRF8 (10-50% of cases) which encodes the interferon regulatory factor 8 protein, a protein that contributes to the maturation and function of B-cells;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3394 3) MAP2K1 (10-40% of cases), which encodes mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1, an enzyme which activates the MAPK/ERK cell signaling pathway that regulates cell proliferation and the expression of various genes;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5604 and 4) scores of other genes that are found in up to 15% of cases. Recent Whole exome sequencing studies in children and adolescents with PTFL have confirmed these results, found that many of these genomic alterations result in suppressing either the MAPK/ERK or G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways, and suggest that the suppression of these pathways contributes to the development of PFFL.  Diagnosis  The diagnosis of PTFL depends on a constellation of findings related to its presentation, tissue distribution, histology, and expression of certain proteins and genomic abnormalities. The disease occurs in males (~90% of cases) that are more often children, adolescents, or young adults who have enlargement of lymph nodes located in one or two nearby sites of the head or neck or less commonly, armpit or groin regions. Histopathological examination of the involved lymph nodes reveals medium- to large-sized lymphoblasts mixed with occasional macrophages and rare centrocytes and centroblasts that together form follicular structures that partially or completely replace the nodes' normal structure with irregularly shaped and merged follicles, abnormally attenuated mantle zones, and the presence of helper T-cells that are pushed to the periphery of the follicles. Its histology is most often rated as high grade and by this criterion defines the disease as an aggressive grade III lymphoma (see follicular lymphoma grading). Nonetheless, PTFL almost always behaves as a non-aggressive or minimally aggressive malignancy. Immunohistiochemical analyses of the involved tissues indicates that the malignant cells express CD20, CD10, and BCL6 but not BCL2 or interferon regulatory factor protein. Genomic analyses of these cells indicate that they have a clonal rearrangement in their IgH genes in all cases and in many cases the Ip6 deletion and gene mutations cited in the above pathophysiology section. These cells lack the t(14:18)(q32:q21.3) translocation which is characteristic of malignant cells in follicular lymphoma but in a small percentage of cases still overexpress the TNRSF14 gene product which is a consequence of this translocation. The exact cause for this overexpression is unclear. = Differential diagnosis = The following lymphocyte disorders may be confused with but can be distinguished from PTFL based on the following points: *Follicular lymphoma does not have a strong male-predominance; is most common in older adults; is usually associated with the involvement of other tissues (e.g. bone marrow) in addition to lymph nodes; and has a histology that is usually dominated by centrocytes and centorblasts; that in >85-90% of cases have the t(14:18)(q32:q21.3) translocation; and in 10-40% of cases MAP2K1 mutations. *Large B-cell lymphoma with IRF4 rearrangement often occurs in females (male to female ratio 1-1.2 to 1:1.5); has not yet been reported to occur in adults; almost always involves non-nodal tissues in addition to lymph nodes; has a histology in involved tissues that is similar to diffuse large cell lymphomas; and has malignant cells that overexpress interferon regulatory factor protein in almost all cases, frequently express BC10, and in most cases exhibit overt rearrangements of the IRF4 gene. *The pediatric form of Marginal zone B-cell lymphoma has lymph node lesions consisting of a mixed population of monocyte-like cells, plasma cells, and lymphoblasts; its malignant cells do not to express CD10 and BCL6 and have relatively few genomic abnormalities except for trisomy 18 (up to 20% of cases). *Benign reactive lymph node and follicular hyperplasia's lymph nodes do not exhibit irregularly shaped and merged follicles, abnormally attenuated mantle zones, or the presence of helper T-cells that are pushed to the periphery of the follicles.  Treatment  Virtually all cases of PTFL, even if treated with minimal interventions such as surgical removal or a watch-and-wait approach, have had a relatively benign and sometimes remitting and relapsing course. Thus, past recommendations that these patients need to be evaluated by bone marrow biopsy, lumbar puncture, or other invasive and/or expensive procedures requires revaluation. The evaluation of therapeutic regimens used to treat PTFL is complicated by their purely retrospective nature and inclusion of cases which in retrospect were likely cases of large B-cell lymphoma with IRF4 rearrangement. In any event, many of these cases were treated with chemotherapeutic regimens, principally, CHOP (i.e. cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) or R-CHOP (i.e. CHOP plus rituximab) while others, which likely excluded large B-cell lymphoma with IRF4 rearrangement, were treated with surgical removal, localized radiation therapy, and/or watch-and-wait strategies. All of these treatments have yielded in pediatric patients overall survival rates of 100% and relapse rates of 0 to 6% as observed over variable observation periods of up to 5 years. Among this group, 36 pediatric patients were treated with surgical resection alone followed by observation with all patients surviving and only one having a relapse. Most adults with PTFL have been treated more vigorously with regimens consisting of immunochemotherapy (e.g. R-CHOP) and/or radiation therapy. This more vigorous approach has been used because the distinction between PTFL and aggressive follicular lymphoma is not as clear in adults as it is in younger patients. Thus, current recommendations for the treatment of pediatric PTFL patients is watch-and-wait following radiation therapy or complete surgical resection; in cases were surgical resection is incomplete, immunechemotherapy is added to the regimen. The recommended treatment of adults with PTFL is less clear. Currently used regimens rely on immunochemotherapy but might change if the issue of discriminating PTFL from follicular lymphoma can be resolved.

The machine was conceived by Italian designer Giorgetto Giugiaro and based on the previous 350 B Sport Elettronica model. 1,991 \\"Sports\\" and 350 ‚ÄúTurismo‚Äù machines were produced. Background Following the death of Count Domenico Agusta in 1971, the financial situation of MV Agusta suffered a rapid decline, brought on by competition from low cost, high quality Japanese motorcycles and ongoing labour problems. Giorgetto Giugiaro (who had previously designed the Suzuki RE5) of design studio Italdesign Giugiaro was commissioned to produce an attractive, more modern design to increase MV's competitiveness in the middle- weight sector. The prototype had striking horizontal lines and sharp contours. The concept machine was first shown at the 1973 Milan EICMA Motorcycle Show. Features Developed from the 350 B models, the 350 cc four-stroke OHV parallel twin featured new casings to match the styling of the machine. The angular cylinder heads, matching the straight lines of the machine, completed the then state-of-the-art concept. Power output was increased from 27 hp (20 kW) @ 7,800 rpm to 34 hp @ 8,500 rpm. A new frame was produced using steel tubing only (previous models had used tube and sheet steel). Tank, seat and side panels were all new. The seat had the rear mudguard attached and the side panels were slotted, mimicking the cooling fins of the engine. Scarab disc brakes were fitted, twin at the front and single rear. Ceriani forks and cast alloy wheels were also fitted. This was the first Italian production bike with 3 disc brakes and alloy wheels. A full fairing was also available as an option. 350 Ipotesi GT MV Agusta 350 Ipotesi GT A touring version, the 350 Ipotesi GT, which was also known as the 350 Ipotesi Turismo was also produced. A more conventional rear seat was used, with a separate rear mudguard and higher handlebars were fitted. The mudguards and exhaust were finished in chrome, as opposed to painted on the sport model. A different tank was fitted, which was finished in gold and blue. The twin front discs were retained, but a drum brake was used on the rear. Wire wheels were fitted. Hansen & Schneider special models German MV Agusta importer Hansen & Schneider, obtained rights to manufacture MV Agusta motorcycles in the mid-1970s. They produced two 500 cc variants of the Ipotesi. * MV Agusta 500 S (1976-77): The 350 cc engine's bore was increased to 75 mm, giving a displacement of 472 cc and a power output of 53 hp (39 kW) @ 8,900 rpm. Larger 3.00x18 front and 3.50x18 rear tyres were fitted. An optional reduced-power version with 43 hp (32 kW) @ 8,200 rpm was available. *MV Agusta 500 SS (1977): a racing version was offered to special order. The machine had a completely revised engine with double overhead camshafts and produced 66 hp @ 11,100 rpm. Five examples were built.

The series will consist of 46 episodes. Lucy Raffety continues her role as series producer, while Simon Harper continues his role as the show's executive producer; this is Raffety's final series as producer, and she was replaced by Loretta Preece. Production on the series was postponed in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which also resulted in one episode being pulled. The theme of the series is reflecting how the National Health Service (NHS) is \\"under pressure\\", with elements focusing on \\"the hierarchy of pressure on the doctors\\". The series is also promoted through multiple trailers. Sixteen regular cast members reprised their roles from the previous series and five actors joined the cast. Additionally, Neet Mohan reprised his role as Rash Masum in the opening episode and Amanda Mealing returned to her role as Connie Beauchamp in episode 18 after a break from the series. Four cast members departed the show during the series, including original cast member Cathy Shipton (Lisa \\"Duffy\\" Duffin). Jane Hazlegrove reprised her role as Kathleen \\"Dixie\\" Dixon for two episodes and American actress Sharon Gless appeared as her recurring character, Zsa Zsa Harper-Jenkinson.  Cast  Shaheen Jafargholi appears in the series as nurse Marty Kirkby. The thirty-fourth series of Casualty features a cast of characters working in the emergency department of Holby City Hospital. The majority of the cast from the previous series continue to appear in this series. William Beck and George Rainsford appear as Dylan Keogh and Ethan Hardy, both consultants in emergency medicine. Jack Nolan portrays Will Noble, a consultant in pediatric emergency medicine, and Genesis Lynea features as Archie Hudson, an emergency medicine registrar. Longest-serving cast member Derek Thompson stars as Charlie Fairhead, the department's clinical nurse manager, senior charge nurse and emergency nurse practitioner, and Charles Venn portrays Jacob Masters, a charge nurse. The cast portraying the department's staff nurses are: Amanda Henderson (Robyn Miller, Jason Durr (David Hide), Gabriella Leon (Jade Lovall) and Shaheen Jafargholi (Marty Kirkby). Michael Stevenson and Maddy Hill play Iain Dean and Ruby Spark, both paramedics. Di Botcher plays operational duty manager and paramedic Jan Jenning, and Tony Marshall appears as Noel Garcia, the ED receptionist. Jacey Sall√©s portrays hospital porter Rosa Cadenas and Cathy Shipton stars as former nurse Duffy. In May 2019, it was confirmed that Stevenson had finished filming and would be leaving the series. The actor expressed his pleasure at portraying Iain. Harper said he was \\"proud\\" of the actor's work on the show. Despite the departure originally being publicised as a break, Stevenson confirmed that he had left the cast, but the character was not killed off and could return. His final scenes were broadcast in episode 5. Shipton's departure from the show was announced on 9 October 2019, her final day of filming. The character was reported to leave at the conclusion of her dementia story. Shipton expressed her sadness at leaving and commented, \\"With sadness, but a sense of completion, I say goodbye.\\" Harper praised Shipton for making Duffy \\"a comforting Saturday night icon, the caring, ideal NHS nurse millions grew up with\\". Shipton did not plan to stay for a long stint when she returned in series 31, and confirmed that the plot, which had been developing for two years, suited her decision not to stay. The character is killed off in episode 22. On killing-off the character, Harper said that he was proud to have \\"shone the most powerful light on a cruel disease\\". Rainsford confirmed on 20 November 2019 that he would be taking a short break from the drama; Ethan departs for a volunteer post in Costa Rica in episode 17. Rainsford explained that the timing of Ethan's departure was poor, but Ethan decides that \\"his needs [are] greater\\" and takes a break from the hospital to \\"clear his head\\". The character returns in episode 24 and receives a hostile response from Rash, which Rainsford confirmed is related to the series' theme. Lynea quit her role as Archie after a year on the drama and the character made her exit in episode 27. Her departure was not publicised prior to broadcast. After two years of appearing in the programme, Hill announced her departure from her role as Ruby in April 2020. Her final scenes aired in the thirty-first episode. Neet Mohan returned to the drama in the opening episode, portraying Rash Masum, a foundation doctor, after a four-month break during the previous series.

On 3 February 2020, it was announced that Stirling Gallacher had joined the cast as Ffion Morgan, a police officer and the wife of Jan. Gallacher expressed her delight at joining the cast and Harper stated that he was \\"excited\\" to explore the character and to have Gallacher portraying her. He confirmed that Ffion would be involved in \\"pretty turbulent\\" storylines. Fenisha Khatri (Olivia D'Lima) appears in episode 25 as a love interest for Ethan. She returns in episode 28 as a new paramedic, billed as \\"spirited, enthusiastic and brave\\". The series features several recurring characters and multiple guest stars. Episode one features the return of David's son, Oliver Hide (Harry Collett), and former wife, Rosalene Hide (Lorraine Pilkington), as well as the first appearance of Kriss Dosanjh as Rash's father, Ashok Masum. The third episode of the series features an appearance from Rosie Marcel as Jac Naylor, a character in Casualty spin-off series, Holby City. Established actress Abigail Hardingham was cast in the series as guest character Effie Laurence, a love interest for Ethan. Effie is the daughter of Ethan's university friend, Theo Laurence (Jim Sturgeon), and has cystic fibrosis. Rainsford noted that the relationship would not be \\"without its issues as well\\". Hardingham and Sturgeon made their first appearances in episode two, and departed in episode 12 and 11, respectively. In November 2019, it was announced that actress Anna Savva had been cast to play Rosa's mother, Xiomara. Sall√©s described the character as \\"absolutely fabulous ‚Äì but she's very meddlesome\\". The actress confirmed that Xiomara would arrive to put pressure on Rosa and David's relationship and soon befriends Ollie, who joins her in trying to get the pair married. That same month, a clip for Children in Need that was filmed by cast members teased the return of American actress Sharon Gless as Zsa Zsa Harper-Jenkinson, who has made three previous appearances on the drama. Her return was confirmed on 30 January 2020 by TVTimes, who reported that Dylan would call Zsa Zsa for help with Luka's brain tumour. Zsa Zsa makes a cameo appearance in episode 25, before guest starring in episode 26. Gless admitted that she did not expect to be invited back again as the timings were different to previous stints, so was pleased when the producers asked her. Kelly Gough was cast in a recurring role as Ruby's sister, Violette Spark, who was introduced in episode 16 for a new story for Ruby. Gough's stint on the drama ends in episode 25 when her character is killed off. As part of Duffy's story, actor Clive Wood reprised his role as Bill Crowthers, having appeared across five episodes in the previous series. Bill appears in episode 20. Episode 29 features an appearance from Alex Walkinshaw as director of nursing Adrian \\"Fletch\\" Fletcher, a character in Holby City.

Lucy Raffety continues her role as series producer while Simon Harper remains as the executive producer. Raffety's resignation from her position was announced on 16 April 2019, and she was replaced by Loretta Preece. Raffety and Preece were co-credited as series producer from episode 5, and Raffety confirmed that her stories would be broadcast until December. Raffety previewed the series in an interview with Elaine Reilly of What's on TV, where she confirmed the theme of the series is \\"The NHS Under Pressure\\" and how the staff are working in a struggling environment. Harper echoed this, stating that the theme would be about \\"an NHS at critical breaking point\\". Preece also told Sophie Dainty of Digital Spy that the series would follow \\"the hierarchy of pressure on the doctors\\", in particular junior doctors such as Rash and Mason. Raffety told Reilly that the series would feature new stories for Dylan, Ethan and David, while Preece mentioned that Rash would experience a \\"moving journey\\" during the series. She also divulged that the series would also explore whether the NHS would be able to help Charlie and Duffy after they have \\"invested their whole adult lives\\" into the service. Preece stated that her plans for Casualty included \\"contemporary\\" guest artist stories and more comedy in the ED, while also creating more \\"action and drama\\". It was announced on 18 March 2020 that production had been suspended on Casualty and other BBC Studios continuing dramas in light of government guidelines following the COVID-19 pandemic. A BBC Studios statement confirmed that there would be no impact on the immediate broadcast of episodes, but the \\"long-term ramifications are still unclear\\". The programme's Twitter account confirmed that episodes would broadcast for \\"as long as [they] can\\". An episode, which was planned to be episode 33 of the series and broadcast on 2 May 2020, was pulled from airing after being deemed \\"inappropriate\\" because of the pandemic. The following episode was brought forward to air in the slot. The pulled episode features the ED team dealing with a viral outbreak; scenes considered important to storylines were included in the catch-up section of the aired episode. The BBC will now broadcast the episode as episode 43, and will air on 26 September 2020. No episodes of Casualty were transmitted between 30 May to 11 July 2020, in order to preserve the number of episodes filmed before production was suspended. Cast member Gabriella Leon suggested that storylines relating to the pandemic could be explored when filming resumes. Digital Spy reported that the series would go into hiatus after episode forty-two had aired and that production is due to resume in September.https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/casualty/a33631482/casualty- schedule-off-air-break-date/ The series returned to filming at the end of August 2020 with the first episode back being directed by Steve Hughes. = Promotion = The series was promoted through multiple trailers and each episode received a preview clip before broadcast. A trailer for the series was released on 14 August 2019, three days before the series premiere. It features segments from the early episodes of the series and Caitlin Butler of Digital Spy named the returns of Dixie and Rash, and a \\"tragic\\" story involving David and Oliver as highlights.

It is bordered to the south-west by Covington Way, to the south-east by Gibson's Hill and to the north-east by Copgate Path, itself also referred to as 'Norwood Grove', and also by Ryecroft Road. To the north-west the grounds adjoin those of The Rookery (managed by the Borough of Lambeth) which itself adjoins Streatham Common of which Norwood Grove was once a part. The main entrances are on Covington Way and Gibson's Hill but access is also available from Copgate Path as it effectively forms part of the park for much of its length. History The site was formerly part of the Great Streatham Common, recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as 'Lime Common' which occupied much of the land between Norbury and Tulse Hill. It was partly enclosed in 1635 to form an estate around a 'shooting box', although some sources dispute this. In 1746, a house known as 'Copgate' had been established on the site and by 1800, the estate was known as 'Norbury Grove' and was owned by a Mr. T Mills. In 1847, the site was leased to Arthur Anderson who was a founder of the P&O; shipping company. After Anderson died, ownership passed to the Nettlefold family and subsequently to Frederick Nettlefold the brother of Joseph Nettlefold and a member of the family that founded the Nettlefolds Ltd. engineering firm which later became GKN. Nettlefold is commemorated, as a result of his charitable works, by a blue plaque on the south elevation of the house. The Nettlefold family sold the mansion and grounds to Croydon Corporation in 1913 and by 1924 it was proposed that it be used for housing. However, a committee formed in 1910 by a Mr. Stenton Covington, to oppose development of The Rookery and which included the Archbishop of Canterbury among its supporters, raised enough funds to purchase the land linking Norwood Grove and The Rookery and an additional 32 acres from the Nettlefold family. The site was declared open by the then Prince of Wales in November 1926. Several residential roads in the area are named after Covington and there is a large oval bird-bath forming part of the ornamental grounds surrounding the house, which is dedicated to him. To the north-east of the house there is a bowling green and to the west a former stables area, which acted as a plant nursery for Croydon's Parks Department but as of 2019 is disused. The White House The White House at Norwood Grove in September 2019 The build date of the current house is uncertain but its style and finish suggests that it is from the early 19th-century. From October 1987 the building has been Grade II listed. In the past, although the date is uncertain, the house was enlarged with a similar bow frontage to the west of the current building but this was bombed in World War II and was not restored. At the eastern side of the house is an 'orangery' which was used for the display of soft-fruits and half-hardy plants but as of 2019 contained visitor facilities.

The series follows Dr. Lisa Sanders as she attempts to help patients with rare illnesses and searches for a diagnosis and cure using wisdom of the crowd methods. The show is based on her column for The New York Times Magazine. It was released on August 16, 2019, on Netflix.  Author  Lisa Sanders was born on July 24, 1956 in South Carolina. Sanders grew up loving the idea of mystery and grew very fond of Arthur Conan Doyle‚Äôs fictional character, Detective Sherlock Holmes. Not much more is known about her younger life. Sanders went to the College of William & Mary where she majored in English, after her graduation in 1979 she was hired by ABC News as a journalist. During her 10 year career as a journalist Sanders won an Emmy award for her reporting of Hurricane Hugo yet she found herself drawn to stories that focused around both mysteries as well as medicine. After about 10 years of reporting Sanders decided to pursue a career within the medical field. She got accepted into the post-baccalaureate pre-medical program at Columbia University, after completing her pre-medical requirements she got accepted into Yale Medical School. She went on to complete her residency with Yale and became her class‚Äô Chief resident. Sanders became an attending internal medicine physician for the Yale-New Haven Hospital, as her new career progressed she became part of Yale‚Äôs Department of Internal Medicine while also teaching primary care at the school of medicine. In 2002, a friend of hers working at The New York Times sparked a conversation about what doctors could provide in a literature perspective. This conversation led to an idea, and from this idea Sanders started writing a column for The New York Times called Diagnosis. The column would highlight medical mysteries that she would encounter within her own patients as well as her colleagues, she would set up the stories as a mystery case revealing the diagnosis within the following week's column. The column then became inspiration for the 2004 TV series House M.D., where Sanders became a medical consultant for the show. Alongside writing her column for The New York Times, Sanders has also written 4 books all related to medicine. On August 16, 2019 a Netflix series titled Diagnosis was released and it follows Dr. Lisa Sanders as she looks to hopefully diagnose patients with difficult symptoms. Cast * Lisa Sanders - physician, narrator and columnist for the New York Times * Angel Parker- A 23 year old nursing student from Las Vegas, NV. Her symptoms are expressed through severe muscle pain episodes that render her immobile. * Sadie Gonzalez- A 7 year old little girl from Queens, NY.

She is not able to keep down any foods or liquids, her symptoms mistakenly resemble that of Bulimia. * Matt Lee- A 20 year old college student from Mt. Airy, MD. He suffers from frequent fainting spells that only come when he feels a sense of Deja Vu, these fainting spells will also cause his heart to momentarily stop. * Joe- A 61 year old optimistic patient from Wallingford, CT. He was struck with a sudden and unexplained paralysis starting from his waist down, leaving him paraplegic. * Ann- A 42 year old skeptic patient from Wallingford, CT. She has intermittent paralysis where she could spend days with the right side of her body immobile. She will then regain mobility but the paralysis always occurs again. Episodes  Episode 1: Detective Work  Angel Parker is a 23 year old nursing student at the time of filming the episode. The earliest memory Angel has of the beginning of her illness was when she was 14, she remembers waking up in the middle of the night not being able to move. Since then her illness has progressed into daily severe muscle pain episodes, where the pain will start at the bottom of her legs and grow its way up to jaw. These episodes render Angel immobile for hours, her pee is pitch black, and very frequently she has to be admitted to the hospital. Angel expresses that any increase in physical strain or exercise will make her symptoms worse but she doesn‚Äôt let that stop her from pursuing her athletic nature. Each time she is admitted physicians are unable to find a cause for her pain; She has been tested for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Lupus, Multiple Sclerosis, and Autoimmune diseases with all negative results. Angel‚Äôs story was sent to Dr. Lisa Sanders by a colleague, where she decided to take on her case in an attempt to help Angel find answers. Dr. Lisa Sanders published Angel‚Äôs story on her column, Diagnosis, asking readers to help find a diagnosis for her symptoms. One big medical anomaly that physicians are able to record during Angel‚Äôs episode is a rise in her Creatine Kinase levels. Creatine Kinase is muscle protein that at this point for Angel is leaking into her body at high levels, her highest CK level recorded during an episode was 57 thousand U/L in comparison to average levels at 22-198 U/L. After Dr. Lisa Sanders published Angel‚Äôs story, they received thousands of responses on possible diagnosis based on her symptoms. The most common response was the possibility of a Metabolic Myopathy that translates to a metabolic muscle illness and are usually caused by the muscle inability to breakdown nutrients and in turn the muscles begin to break themselves down for energy usage. As Angel gets closer to possibly having a diagnosis she starts to think about her future with children, she expresses that if her disease is something she can pass down genetically she wouldn‚Äôt want to put her children at risk. A Medical student from Italy reaches out to Dr. Lisa Sanders and expresses her 4th year thesis on metabolic gene testing that could be beneficial in narrowing down a diagnosis. Angel takes the leap of faith and travels to Turin, Italy for both blood and urine testing. The testing showed that Angel had a normal metabolic gene profile resulting in the elimination of many possible metabolic disorders. The physicians in Italy submitted her genomes into a sequencing trial that could take up to two months to process but could hopefully result with a diagnosis. After the two months, Angel receives a call from the Physician with a complete result and a solid diagnosis of Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase II Deficiency.  Episode 2: Second Opinions  Sadie Gonzalez is a 7 year old little girl from Queens, NY, with a severe brain disorder. Sadie suffers from very frequent seizures that have resulted in a slight speech and mobility impediment. Her mother recounts the first time Sadie had a seizure being the morning of the 29th of December, when Sadie was 6 years old. The seizures stopped for two months and in late February Sadies seizures started to violently progress into daily visible seizures that will affect different parts of her body at a time. At the time of recording the episode, Sadie was having a motor seizure almost every couple of minutes. Sadie was admitted into the Columbia Presbyterian where multiple MRI‚Äôs were done showing no signs of brain damage or brain tumors. These results along with her symptoms led some physicians to believe she had Rasmussen‚Äôs. Rasmussen‚Äôs Encephalitis, explained by Dr. Lisa Sanders, is characterized by the chronic inflammation caused by T-Lymph white blood cells to invade half of the brain and destroy it. The only sure treatment for Rasmussen‚Äôs is a hemispherectomy, where the corpus callosum is severed and separated the diseased side of the brain from the healthy side. Direct consequences from this procedure is loss of vision in one eye, losing the ability to move one entire half of her body, one can also lose the ability to speak. If Sadie actually does have this disorder and does have the procedure then half of the brain can spread into the second half, causing the brain to deteriorate. The parents of Sadie reach out to Dr. Lisa Sanders in hopes of getting a second opinion, a different diagnosis, or a different treatment. Essentially looking for any route that could lead to a better life for Sadie that doesn‚Äôt have to hinder her more than her disease hinders her now. Dr. Lisa Sanders put their story out onto her column and awaited for the responses. Many of the responses from the audience agreed with the diagnosis of Rasmussen‚Äôs, others suggested that the seizures could be controlled with electro stimulation therapy, and a third group suggested it was a neurologic version of Lyme Disease. She was tested for various diseases under different conditions and one specific test came back strongly positive, resulting in a diagnosis that led to a manageable treatment.  Episode 3: The Wisdom of the Crowd  Willie Reyes is a 46 year old Army Veteran who is slowly losing his memories as a result of frequent seizures. Willie‚Äôs wife recounts the first time he had a seizure when he was 44 and he just fell to the floor one day without any explanation. Since the first seizure, he has developed multiple brain lesions, progressive memory loss, hearing loss, and violent/emotional mood swings. Willie says that because of his memory loss he forgets a lot of things and constantly repeats himself, making him feel like a child. He tells his biggest fear being waking up one day and completely forgetting about his family. His daughter highlights the fact that recently he‚Äôs been starting to forget major memories, from her childhood such as her birth. Dr. Lisa Sanders took a look at Willie‚Äôs MRI scans and noted a huge lesion at the base of his brain with finger-like deterioration rooting up from it. She has a theory that the deterioration reaching the memory region of his brain could be the reason for his memory loss and mood swings. His wife states that in June 2019, he had a biopsy done with a piece of brain matter and the results came back as having unspecified inflammation. Dr. Sanders says that one of the biggest reasons that his condition is hard to diagnose is because it has very similar symptoms to a lot of common brain disorders, with no response to steroids. Dr. Lisa Sanders took out to publish Willie‚Äôs story and awaited the response with a possible diagnosis. Dr. Sanders expresses her disappointment in the fact that even if they are able to find a diagnosis or treatment for his illness, he may not be able to recover all the memories he has already lost. From the hundreds of responses Dr. Sanders highlighted 2 very interesting possibilities one caused by a virus and the other caused by an autoimmune disorder. The first possibility is Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy that is caused by a virus and destroys the brain's ability to translate information. The second possibility is a very rare autoimmune disease by the name of Neuro-Behcet‚Äôs that causes inflammation and ulceration in different types of the body. Neither of these diagnoses seemed to fit Willie exactly because of key features such as Willie‚Äôs very strong immune system and the fact that he had no response on steroids. Due to Willie‚Äôs background in the Army, the suggestion of the Gulf War Illness was brought up. When Dr. Sanders brought this idea to another physician for a second diagnosis, they highlighted key similarities of symptoms between Willie and the Gulf War Illness despite his being much more severe. The idea of the Gulf War Illness was tossed around as a possibility and brought up too many Physicians for second opinions, each one highlighting his symptoms are much more severe, and suggesting the possibility of testing for further clarity. To better understand the chances of Willie having GWI, they need to know if he was exposed to the toxins present during the Gulf War. However, the military provided him with no records of any medical discrepancies caused by actions during war. If Willie was to be diagnosed with Gulf War Illness he would not have a course of treatment, he would have to learn to cope with the disease until a treatment becomes available in the hopeful near future. Willie and his wife go to visit a Marine Veteran who was diagnosed with Gulf War Illness to be able to relate any similarities and narrow down the possibilities.  Episode 4: Looking for a Village  Kamiyah Morgan is a 6 year old little girl who suffers from a very unusual set of fainting episodes that will leave her unresponsive and immobile, and they can happen up to 300 times a day. When she experiences a fainting episode she will become completely paralyzed affecting everything in her body including her lungs, her mother states that every day that passes her ability to breathe diminishes. Kamiyah‚Äôs mother said that these fainting episodes started when she was about 8 months old as she would be crawling and suddenly tip over and go limp. At first their pediatric physician said the episodes looked like she was having a seizure, but after running an EEG there was no seizure being detected during the episodes. They then tried testing with MRI for any brain tumors or malignancies but again there was nothing. They were then referred over to the NIH or the National Institute of Health where their entire purpose is to be able to research and hopefully diagnose very strange cases. They NIH tested every system and every symptom and they were unable to find anything, they submitted her blood in for testing and they have yet to hear of anything from them for over two years. When Dr. Lisa Sanders asked the NIH for Kamiyah records; they were reluctant to release them even though she had her mother's permission, very shortly after this interaction Breteni, Kamiyah‚Äôs mother, received an email from NIH to discuss Kamiyah‚Äôs results. Breteni was upset over this interaction because it took them two years to be able to come out with her daughter‚Äôs results and only after an interaction with Dr. Lisa Sanders. Dr. Sanders believed this was because they might have initially forgotten to share the results and didn‚Äôt want to ligate any misinterpretations. Once Breteni received the results it was shown that Kamiyah had a break in a gene that wasn‚Äôt inherited from her mother or father, it created itself. Specifically a break within the KCNMA1 gene, and she was the first patient of her kind, she‚Äôs ‚Äúgroundbreaking‚Äù. The NIH said that it would take more patients with the same illness and a doctor to ‚Äúpeg‚Äù it to be able to create a disease grouping for diagnosis. When Dr. Lisa Sanders created the column for Kamiyah, instead of asking for the readers to chime in for their diagnosis, she went out looking for readers who would have the same symptoms/gene break as her. From the publication of the column, Breteni was able to find dozens of people who themselves or their children had the same KCNMA1 gene mutation. There was also a scientist who reached out to Dr. Lisa Sanders, who had based the last 20 years of her career on researching the specific ion pathway for the KCNMA1 gene. The scientist goes into detail about the gene and how it regulates the amount of potassium that enters the cells and as a result this affects the brain wave levels corresponding to movement and in theory would create the fainting episodes. Kamiyah as well as all the patients found through the column became the breakthrough needed to begin proper human research towards a diagnosis and treatment of the gene mutation. While Kamiyah was not able to technically receive a diagnosis for her illness, she created the pathway for research into possible treatments for patients in the future.  Episode 5: A Question of Trust  Lashay Hamblin is a 16 year old high school student at the time of filming the episode. She suffers from an illness with similarities to Bulimia, only she has no control over her actions. Everything that Lashay eats or drinks is almost immediately thrown up and she had very bad stomach cramping because of it. She expresses her bad experience with physicians who did not want to diagnose her because at only 16 years old she shows an almost exact reflection of an eating disorder. During her adolescence in 2014 her family went on a trip to Costa Rica where she had an encounter with a wild raccoon that tore at her skin. When she got back home from the trip only two days later she had severe symptoms of vomiting, headaches, neck pains and stomach pains. At first physicians thought it was rabies and immediately gave her the rabies vaccination, this however made everything extremely worse and all her symptoms progressed. Since that day in the emergency room she has yet to recover or improve from any of the symptoms. She‚Äôs not able to walk straight up, sit in a chair, and has a constant throbbing headache. Due to her conditions doctors decided to implant a chest port to be able to provide her with the nutrients and hydration she needs to survive. One physician the family met with suggested she might have a Cerebral Spinal Fluid Leak that would only explain her constant headaches and dizziness. The treatment for the CSF leak is an extremely invasive procedure that only has a 30% success rate, the family took the chance with the procedure and Lashay had an extremely rough recovery period. Since the treatment none of her symptoms had improved at all. Dr. Lisa Sanders took her story and published it into the Diagnosis column awaiting response from the audience. The audience came up with three general groups of possibilities, she could have a parasitic infection caused by the raccoon attack, POTS, or Rumination syndrome. POTS also known as Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome is essentially a problem with the nervous system, specifically the nerves that control the blood vessels causing improper circulation and rapid heart rates resulting in dizziness, light-headedness, and at times vomiting. Rumination syndrome is a rare chronic functional disorder that affects the digestive system where the patient will automatically regurgitate the food and liquids consumed, this syndrome has no cure/treatments. The audience aside from the possible diagnosis also provided Lashay with hope and guidance through tough times. When Dr. Lisa Sanders went to consult with the family about the 3 possibilities, they automatically ruled out both POTS as well as any parasitic infection as they had been tested for almost every kind of parasite as well as received POTS treatment with no effect. The family then mentioned how Lashay had been tested for Rumination's via a M spike testing, which is testing the pressure at the lower esophageal sphincter, with results that are strongly suggestive of Rumination's. With this information, the family had a very strong denial in the fact that Lashay might have a chronic illness with no treatment instead of just a simple parasitic infection.  Episode 6: Deja Vu  Matt Lee is a 20 year old college student who suffers from fainting spells that only occur when he has a sense of Deja Vu, these fainting spells at times can cause his heart to stop all together. Matt states that when he was around 19, one day he just started feeling very light headed and had a sense of Deja Vu then shortly after he blacked out. When he woke back up and realized he had blacked out, he immediately went to the hospital, the next time he fainted had flatlined. Specifically his symptoms include a sense of tingling in his head that is followed by light-headedness, nausea, heart palpitations, loss of control, and then finally the Deja Vu before he faints. Matt is extremely afraid that these random fainting episodes could happen at any time during the day and he might not have someone to help him out, because of these he stays at home as much as he could. He expresses his disappointment in not being able to follow his goals in wanting to study computer science and wanting to find a cure or treatment that would allow him to be ‚Äúfree‚Äù again. Matt was admitted into Johns Hopkins Hospital for in depth testing of all his symptoms, the only definitive diagnosis known is that fact that Matt is experiencing Syncope. Syncope is essentially fainting spells that are caused by a decrease of blood reaching the brain, the only question is what is causing the decreased blood flow along with the other symptoms. Multiple testing was done to be able to narrow down whether his form of Syncope is caused by mental factors or cardiac abnormalities, the results are still pending. Dr. Lisa Sanders took Matt‚Äôs story to the column and awaited for responses from the audience with ideas. Out of the hundreds of responses, only two were the most cohesive towards Matt‚Äôs symptoms. The first possibility was Vasovagal Syncope, where the nervous system will send an incorrect message too slow down the heart and can cause it to stop, the tilt table test performed on Matt could provide a definitive answer to this theory. The second possibility is Temporal lobe epilepsy which is a kind of seizure that is correlated to a sense of ‚Äústrange‚Äù thoughts, feelings, or sense of Deja Vu. Matt was subjected to an EEG which did not show any preliminary seizure disorders, however the specialist who reviewed his results noted that the EEG might not express any deep temporal lobe seizures. The tilt table test performed on Matt came back negative for Vasovagal Syncope, however Matt was fitted with a heart tracker to be able to detect any abnormal signals within the heart during an episode. Matt finally had an episode with his heart loop tracker, the tracker was able to detect a 6 second heart stop during his episode. On the same day Matt had this episode he had another one once his stress level started to rise, this was the first time in the entire duration of his illness that he‚Äôs had two episodes in one day. Dr. Lisa Sanders then questions if the episodes could be caused by an increase in stress, rooted by a traumatic stress episode within his early childhood involving custody actions between his mother and father. To help Matt out with the stress and psychological aspect of his illness, he was referred to a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins that started him on cognitive behavioral therapy. While the cognitive therapy would help Matt out with his internal stress it might also help alleviate the severity of his episode until he is able to secure a valid diagnosis.  Episode 7: Paralyzed  Joe is a 61 year old optimistic patient from Wallingford, CT. He was struck with a sudden and unexplained paralysis starting from his waist down, leaving him paraplegic. Ann is a 42 year old skeptic patient who is also from Wallingford, CT. She has intermittent paralysis where she could spend hours with the right side of her body immobile. She will then regain mobility but the paralysis always occurs again. Around the age of 59, Joe started to get pin & needles in his legs and at first he thought nothing of it until a year later he had numbness up to his knees that progressed to his waist. Eventually, the numbness turned into paralysis and Joe became a paraplegic at the age of 61. Shortly after becoming paralyzed, Joe went into a state of organ failure that doctors were able to get him out of but ever since he hasn‚Äôt been able to leave the hospital. Despite visiting many hospitals such as Yale, Mayo, and Boston with no prevail, he states he is still a firm believer in western medicine and is willing to try anything. Around the age of 40 Ann had a recurring pain in her chest that resembled heartburn and a month later noticed that the right side of her face looked off. When she brought this up to her primary care physician, he explained that she had full right side facial paralysis and needed to visit the emergency room as she might be having a stroke. When she got to the emergency room, her facial paralysis was coming in and out, because of this she was placed into the stroke ward for observation and a CAT scan and MRI was ordered that resulted negative. A neurologist came in and told her it was all just a psychosomatic response to stress and nothing more. A big reason she does not trust doctors is for the fact that she is a woman of color, and she feels she's not heard by the generic privileged doctor complex. When reaching out to Dr. Lisa Sanders, both Joe and Ann had already been tested and ruled out for dozens of diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's, and Lupus. Joe specifically has two very serious illnesses, the first one being his unexplained paralysis and the second being an incurable form of blood cancer he was diagnosed with 15 years back. Joe thought he only had a few years to live, but he was placed on a clinical trial that has kept him alive until this day. Dr. Lisa Sanders now wants to know if his blood cancer has anything to do with his paralysis, especially now that he has movement in his toes. Dr. Lisa Sanders published both Joe and Ann‚Äôs stories on different columns to gain different traction from the audience and to not create confusion. The first column published was for Joe‚Äôs symptoms and this generated hundreds of responses. The two most reasonable possibilities are CIDP, Chronic Inflammatory Polyneuropathy, aka Guillain-Barre syndrome or the paralysis is a side effect of the clinical drug, Ibrutinib, he is taking to control his blood cancer. CIDP is a neurological disorder caused by an injury to the protective coating of the nerves as they leave the brain. However, this was almost immediately ruled out by his physicians as testing was already done against the possibility of CIDP. Leaving the paralysis to be a rare side effect of the clinical drug, Ibrutinib Joe was taking to control his blood cancer, only he hasn‚Äôt been taking the medication since a blood clot almost killed him. Dr. Lisa Sanders suggests that his regaining feeling in his toes is a result of Joe being off the medication, as it could take up to a year for the medication to fully leave his body and for the nerves to rebuild themselves. This raises the issue that if Joe stays off the medication he might be able to walk again but if he doesn‚Äôt get back on he will have nothing controlling his blood cancer. Dr. Lisa Sanders later published Ann‚Äôs story on the column and awaited the response from the audience. The audience presented with many possibilities but Ann‚Äôs doctors had tested and ruled them all out except for two. The first possibility is Lyme Disease which is an infection caused by a bacteria transmitted through ticks. While Ann‚Äôs symptoms are not in line with that of Lyme Disease, the disease is known for causing all kinds of strange and interesting neurological problems. The second possibility is that Ann has a Functional Neurological Disorder, where simply her body is not transmitting the correct signals. Since Ann is very much a skeptic when it comes to western medicine she did not take the thought of a functional neurological disorder lightly, she immediately denied the possibility and moved on to get tested for Lyme disease. Ann went to a specialist near her and was able to get tested for Lyme Disease but the results came back negative. Even with this evidence in front of her Ann kept denying the possibility of having a Functional Neurological Disorder, yet she still received a call from Dr. Schneider who may be able to help her get closer to a diagnosis. Production  The Netflix docu-series Diagnosis was a production created and produced by Netflix and The New York Times together. The idea was brought about by Dr. Lisa Sanders initiative to embark on a quest to help undiagnosable patients. Sanders was able to use her column, Diagnosis, in The New York Times to publish each one of the patient's cases probing readers to help solve each medical mystery. With help from the readers, Dr. Lisa Sanders, and doctors from all around the world, she was able to provide each patient with a diagnosis, a treatment, or just the sense of belonging and hope. Each patient‚Äôs journey through their diagnosis was documented into a 40 minute episode, where we‚Äôre able to see the progression of a life changing movement. The result from this project was a 7 episode docu-series, Diagnosis was released on August 16, 2019 on Netflix.

It was highly anticipated by fans, and succeeded their earlier hit singles, which turned Hep Stars into one of Sweden's top acts. It appeared on shows such as Drop-In and having three songs on Kv√§llstoppen simultaneously, a feat never achieved before.Carl Marcus Palm, Hep Stars 1964-1969, p. 113. In Sweden alone, the Hep Stars had accumulated an ever-growing female fanbase, just like the Beatles did with Beatlemania just two years prior. The album contains Benny Andersson's first original composition, \\"No Response\\", which was written by him after the band was criticised by contemporary Swedish acts such as Tages for not being able to write original material. The song, clocking in at 1:37, it is the shortest track on the album. Despite this, It was issued as a single in September, and reached number 2 on Kv√§llstoppen shortly thereafter. However, in later interviews, Andersson has considered it imperfect and a \\"rush-job\\". In contrast to their later works, guitarist Janne Frisk shares lead vocal duties with Svenne Hedlund on 4 of the album's 12 tracks. This is due to the fact that Frisk was the group's lead singer and guitarist up until Hedlund's invitation to the band in mid-1964. Tracks on the album includes a re-recorded version of their hit song \\"Cadillac\\", which would go on to be heavily associated with the group, and become on of their signature songs. It became the first album release on the label, and the majority of tracks were cut on a three-track recorder.

His best-known novels are The Praying Mantises and Return from the Ashes which have been adapted into TV and motion pictures. His works are characterized by their literary sophistication and mordant wit while exploring moral and philosophical issues. He was called \\"one of the more eclectic and diversified dabblers in crime\\" and \\"the most literary of all the French crime novelists.\\"  Biography  Born to a family of a magistrate, Monteilhet was educated by the Jesuits at the Saint-Louis-de-Gonzague, a private Catholic school in Paris. During the Occupation, he lived in Auvergne at the family estate in Nouara, near Ambert. He was tutored by Jean Recanati, a communist and future editor of L‚ÄôHumanit√©, whom Monteilheit‚Äôs parents had taken in. After the war, Monteilhet received his degree in history at the Sorbonne. He first taught history in Normandy, and then at the Lyc√©e Carnot in Tunisia from 1959 to 1970. Monteilhet‚Äôs debut novel The Praying Mantises was an instant success. It became the winner of the 1960 Grand Prix de Litt√©rature Polici√®re in France and received Simon & Schuster's Inner Sanctum Mystery Award for 1962. In the crime novels that followed--Return from the Ashes, The Road to Hell, Prisoner of Love and others‚Äîhe established himself as a master of psychological suspense with a very personal style, showing great imagination in his choice of themes and plot twists. In the 1976 novel Sophie ou les Galanteries exemplaires, for the first time, Monteilhet set his story in a distant past ‚Äì the 18th century. In 1981, he briefly ventured into the science fiction genre with Les Queues de Kallinaos, both a philosophical tale in the style of Pierre Boulle and a tragedy of paternal love pushed to extremes. Beginning from the 1980s, Monteilhet dedicated himself mostly to historical fiction. He covered a vast array of subjects: the Spanish Inquisition in Les Derniers Feux (1982), Emperor Nero‚Äôs Rome in N√©ropolis (1984), Joan of Arc in La Pucelle (1988), the times of Louis XIII and the Musketeers in De plume et d'√©p√©e (1999), and the French Revolution in Les Bouffons (2004). He continued writing crime novels from time to time: Le Proc√®s Filippi (1981), La Perte de Vue (1986), Arnaques (2006) and others. For many years, Monteilhet was a food columnist for the regional newspaper Sud Ouest Dimanche. He explored his gastronomic preoccupations in the witty crime thrillers La Part des anges (1992), ≈ídipe en M√©doc (1993), √âtoiles filantes (1994), and Le Taureau par les cornes (1994). His last novel, Une vengeance d'hiver, was published in 2012. In 2015, he also wrote the non-fiction book Intox : 1870-1914, la presse fran√ßaise en d√©lire. Monteilhet died on May 12, 2019 in Garlin, a small town in southwestern France where he resided for many years. He is survived by his wife Genevi√®ve, five children, 12 grandchildren, and seven great grandchildren.  Writing style  Monteilhet‚Äôs early novels are written in the form of letters or diaries, or a combination of both, which is unusual for the crime genre. The writer returns to this technique in Murder at the Frankfurt Book Fair (1975) where the narrative is presented as alternating entries in the diaries of the two protagonists, and the same event is often depicted from two contrasting points of view. Jean Tulard remarks that Monteilhet is \\"the only author, or almost the only one, who cares to write and use all the resources of literature: correspondence, personal diary, interior monologue, press clippings... to punctuate his narrative.\\" He also calls Monteilhet \\"the most literary of all the French crime novelists.\\" Monteilhet occasionally makes himself a character in his novels. In A Perfect Crime or Two, he is a crime writer approached by an attractive lady seeking his advice on how to commit a perfect murder. He is also a minor character in Murder at Leisure and Murder at the Frankfurt Book Fair.  Literary influences  Monteilhet was influenced by the French libertine writers of the 18th century. His first novel The Praying Mantises brought comparisons with Choderlos de Laclos‚Äô Dangerous Liaisons, due to the use of the epistolary form, and the cruelty and amorality of the characters. Jean Bourdier notes these classical influences in Monteilhet‚Äôs first three novels, saying that the elegance is there, and ‚Äúthe insolence too.‚Äù And just like in the 18th century, morality is present ‚Äúunder the graceful and deceptive mask of amorality.‚Äù Thus Monteilhet joins the great libertines ‚Äúon their privileged ground.‚Äù  Religion  Monteilhet was a devout Roman Catholic with traditionalist views. He rejected the reforms instituted by the Second Vatican Council and denounced them in the polemical essay Rome n'est plus dans Rome (‚ÄúRome is no longer in Rome‚Äù). He defended his literal interpretation of the Gospels in another essay, Ce que je crois, et pourquoi (‚ÄúWhat I believe and why‚Äù).

In July of that year, Lubbock City Council granted the land on Mac Davis Lane soon to be vacated by Department of Public Safety Headquarters as the site for the new building. Initial plans for the building put construction costs at $85 million and then $116 million, however after collaborating further with community partners, scope for the building increased to level requiring the construction of a 220,000 square foot venue at the cost of $153 million.

Ryazanov was responsible for the development of tactics that consisted of the ground-attack aircraft being directed from a command post on the ground close to the frontline, and he was praised by Marshal Ivan Konev for having the best attack aircraft in the Air Force.  Early life  Ryazanov was born on to a Russian peasant family in Bolshoye Kozino village, where he completed his fifth grade of school in 1913 before attending a school in Balakhna until 1916. He then returned to his hometown to work at a co-op before getting a job at a post office in Sormovo, but returned to Kozino in 1918 when he was hired as a primary school teacher. In December 1919 he was promoted to a higher position in the education department, and the next year he graduated from a provincial school. He became a member of the Communist Party in 1920.  Military career before World War II  After entering the Red Army in May 1920, Ryazanov worked as a lecturer in the political department. In 1921 he left the position, and the next year he completed assigned courses at Moscow State University. In 1924 he graduated from the Sverdlov Communist University, after which he was made political instructor of the 17th Rifle Division. In March 1925 he was made party head in a training unit at the Borisoglebsk Military Aviation School of Pilots. There, he became a student and graduated from the flight courses. In 1926 he became the party head of the education department of the Leningrad Higher Military Aviation School of observer pilots, and the next year he graduated from the Serpukhov Higher School of Aerial Firing and Bombing before being made squadron commander of a training unit back at the school in Leningrad; in 1928 the school was relocated to Orenburg. Ryazanov stayed there until being sent back to Leningrad in 1929 for a post as flight commander at a military theoretical school of the Air Force. In February 1930 he was promoted to assistant head of the training department. In December that year he graduated from the advanced training courses for commanding officers at the Zhukovsky Academy. In 1931 he was posted to the Odessa Military Aviation School of Pilots as a squadron commander, but transferred in December to the Moscow School of Special Services of the Air Force. In 1933 he was made commander of a light bomber squadron, and later that year he was promoted to commander of a brigade in Zhukovsky. Three months after graduating from the operational department of the Zhukovsky academy in April 1936 he was put in command of the 44th Attack Aviation Brigade, which was based in Krasnoyarsk. During the Great Purge he was arrested on 12 March 1938; he was then dismissed from the military on 19 April 1938, but reinstated in August 1939. While under arrest he was kept in Krasnoyarsk prison and subjected to prolonged interrogations, but eventually the charges were dropped. After his reinstatement he began working as a teacher at the Zhukhovsky Academy in the tactics department. During the Winter War he was the chief of intelligence of the 13th Air Army, after which he returned to teaching. In July he was made the head of the training department of the Monino Air Force Academy, where he remained until the German invasion of the Soviet Union.  World War II  Starting in June 1941 Ryazanov became the head of the operational department of the 62nd Bomber Aviation Division due to the launch of Operation Barbarossa. He was only there briefly, since later that month he became the deputy commander of the 5th Air Army. In August he was transferred again, being made the head of the control group of the Air Force Directorate on the Southwestern Front. Then from December 1941 to March 1942 he commanded the 76th Mixed Aviation Division, after which he commanded an air group until June; in March 1942 he was promoted to the rank of major general and one year later he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general. For about a month he was the commander of the 268th Fighter Aviation Division, which was his last command assignment on the Southwestern Front. There, he led his units in the battles for various parts of Ukraine including Kiev, Donbass, and Kharkov. In July he was briefly made commander of the 2nd Fighter Aviation Army, but before the end of the month it was split into two groups of aviation divisions, each assigned to a different air army. Starting in September he commanded the 1st Assault Aviation Corps, where he remained for the rest of the war. In February 1944 it was awarded the \\"Guards\\" designation, but it was not given a new number, so it simply became the 1st Guards Assault Aviation Corps. During his tenure the unit was stationed on the Kalinin, Northwest, Voronezh, Steppe, 1st Ukrainian, and 2nd Ukrainian fronts, under the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, and 6th Air Armies. For his leadership of the corps in the battle of the Dnieper he was awarded his first gold star, and the second one was awarded after the war for leadership in the offensive on the Vistula. Other operations he participated in as corps commander included the Berlin, Kirovograd, Kursk, Belgorod, Lvov, Lviv-Sandomierz, and Silesian offensives.  Later life  After the capitulation of Nazi Germany he remained in command of the 1st Guards Assault Aviation Corps until February 1947 when he was made commander of the 14th Air Army. From that year until 1951 he was a member of the Supreme Soviet of the Belarusian SSR. At the time of his death in Kislovodsk on 8 July 1951 he was the commander of the 69th Air Army, which he had been since 1949.

The explosion occurred in the early morning, in a predominantly Shia neighbourhood in western Kabul. At least 14 people were killed and 145 injured, mostly civilians. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, citing that one of their suicide bombers attacked \\"a recruitment centre\\". The attack occurred as ongoing negotiations between the Taliban and the United States were being conducted.  Background  Following the September 11 attacks, the United States requested that the Taliban hand over Osama bin Laden, the leader of the terrorist group Al-Qaeda. After the Taliban refused, the US and other nations invaded Afghanistan. The Taliban still has control over 59 districts. Over the years, the US has negotiated with the Taliban to end the war, with a likely solution that involves the withdrawal of US troops before the 2020 US presidential election being proposed in July and August 2019. Despite these ongoing peace negotiations, the Taliban has targeted civilians that would participate in the 2019 Afghan presidential election in various attacks carried out in the first half of 2019. The group has threatened to disrupt the elections on August 6, calling the elections \\"worthless\\" because they have no legitimacy. This is not the first time in which a police station was targeted. In April 2019, a large attack was carried out by the Taliban in western Afghanistan in which 30 soldiers and police officers were killed. A similar event occurred on July 27, 2019, when a suicide bomb near a police headquarters in Ghazni Province killed three police officers and wounded 12. The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan has stated that the month of July 2019 was the deadliest in Afghanistan since May 2017 due to a rise in civilian casualties. The military training school that was targeted also served as a recruitment center for security forces. Attack The bomb was detonated around 9:00 am AFT on August 7, 2019, when a vehicle targeted the gates of District 6 police headquarters. The vehicle was stopped at a security checkpoint outside the building. The police headquarters was located in Golaee Dawa Khana, a Shi‚Äôite neighborhood. The police headquarters and a military training school were the main targets. The explosion left thick smoke in the sky and formed a large crater. The police station, a nearby military training school, and all windows in a radius of a mile were destroyed. The explosion left 14 people dead, including four police officers, and 145 wounded, mostly women and children; 92 of the wounded were civilians. Two of the attackers were killed, however one was arrested. The bomb used has been identified as a car bomb, with the Taliban claiming that a larger truck bomb was used instead. The attack occurred days before the Islamic holiday of Eid Al Adha. Aftermath Afghan chief executive Abdullah Abdullah condemned the attack, stating that it was aimed at disrupting the upcoming Afghan presidential elections. American envoy Zalmay Khalilzad also condemned the attack on Twitter.

The movement and the party were founded by the euro-nationalist magazine Europe-Action, escorted by militants from the Federation of Nationalist Students.  History  = Background = The political movement was initially founded in January 1966 as the \\"Nationalist Movement of Progress\\" (Mouvement Nationaliste du Progr√®s, MNP) by head members of the nationalist magazine Europe-Action, escorted by leaders of the Federation of Nationalist Students and elements from the \\"Tixier-Vignancour Committees\\". Many of them, especially Dominique Venner, had been deceived by the electoral failure (5.2%) of far-right candidate Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour in the 1965 presidential election. The first congress was held on 30 April and 1 May 1966, for the movement to reclaim this date, until then \\"reserved to [their] communist adversaries\\" in their views. Dominique Venner introduced the agenda of the movement behind a crowd of 300 delegates: the \\"defence of the Occidental civilization\\", which was facing three perceived dangers: \\"the work of falsification\\", set up by the elites to make the people forget its own identity and history; the \\"power of technology\\", accused of uniforming the planet; and the \\"demographic tide of the coloured world\\", which would lead to a \\"universal brewing\\" and the \\"disappearance of [Europeans] genetic specificity, the end of the white world and its civilization\\". The aim of MNP leaders was therefore to make white people realize this \\"state of full submission\\", and persuade them to \\"fight\\" and \\"refuse this death\\". The white minority government of the breakaway country Rhodesia sent a Rhodesian flag which was prominently displayed throughout the conference. = 1967 legislative elections = The political party \\"European Rally for Liberty\\" (REL) was launched in November 1966 to serve as a political showcase for the MNP for the forthcoming elections, Venner asserting that they would benefit from the campaign to promote their view on the public radio and television. Europe-Action had a weekly publication, Europe-Action hebdomadaire, which served as an organ for the party and where the main essayists of the magazine‚ÄîDominique Venner, Jean Mabire, Alain de Benoist, Fran√ßois d'Orcival‚Äîwrote political articles during the campaign. The party was however only able to run 27 contenders in the legislative election of March 1967 and fared poorly in the results, receiving 2.5% of the national votes with no elected candidate. = Dissolution = Following this failure, Venner left the leadership and the REL was reorganized under the iron rule of Pierre Bousquet and Pierre Cl√©menti, two former members of the Waffen-SS. This takeover, along with the relations maintained with the German neo-Nazi NPD and seminars held on Mein Kampf, triggered a wave of resignations. In March 1968, an extraordinary session of the REL's nation council excluded Bousquet and Venner from the movement. The party was only able to run one candidate, √âdith G√©rard, in the subsequent legislative election of June 1968. Despite the few illusions shown by REL members before the vote‚ÄîVenner declared to Rivarol before the election that \\"[their] aim should not be to have deputies elected, but to get [themselves] known, to impose [their] existence\\"‚Äî, the electoral debacle of the party confirmed the theories developed by Venner and de Benoist in 1962‚Äì1965 about the need to achieve cultural dominance before gaining the popular vote. The REL eventually disappeared in 1969 after a financial scandal.  Legacy  The electoral debacles of the European Rally for Liberty, along with the previous failure of Tixier-Vignancourt, are cited as conducive to the foundation of the ethno-nationalist think tank GRECE and the development of its meta-political strategy. Alain de Benoist, a member of the national council of the REL, founded the think tank in 1968, along with other adherents of the party and former members of the Federation of Nationalist Students. Another group, led by Pierre Bousquet and Jean Castrillo, created the nationalist magazine Militant in December 1967, then entered the Front National (FN) in 1973 where they represented the more radical fringe of the party. They broke with the FN in 1979 due its supposed \\"conservative and Zionist stance\\". REL's security personnel joined Occident in October 1967. Other members chose to support far-left parties during the May 1968 events. The MNP was suspected of receiving financial aids from the governments of Rhodesia, South Africa, Spain and Portugal. Despite the claimed 300,000 members, the estimated membership was no more than 2,500. The REL participated in accustoming the far right to contesting elections in the Fifth Republic. Following the successive routs of the Vichy state, poujadism, and the OAS in bringing down the republic, Dominique Venner indeed recognized in January 1967 that the far right \\"[had to] take part in the only great political battles of the moment: elections.\\"  Views  The party was anti-communist, anti- immigration and defended pan-European nationalism. The REL's program included \\"state control over the banks\\", a \\"national convention formed outside established parties to define fundamental laws\\", the \\"removal of all aids for developing countries\\", an \\"end to North African immigration and ‚Äòthe expulsion of elements that pose a danger to public safety and health\\", \\"resist American or Soviet hegemony and stem the demographic tide from the Third World, and a \\"politically unified Europe, with respect for national traditions.\\" When compared to definitions and terminologies given by its theorists in the 1960s, the \\"defense of the Occident\\" agenda must be understood as a \\"defense of the white race\\". The REL, like Europe-Action, also disguised racialism under \\"biological realism\\". The REL's unique candidate in the 1968 legislative election, √âdith G√©rard, advocated for instance the \\"friendship among peoples of the world, in the recognition of the biological fact and the right to stay faithful to one's ethnic group and traditions.\\"  See also  * Europe-Action and the Federation of Nationalist Students; creators of the party * GRECE, Militant and Occident; main organizations joined by REL members after its dissolution  References  ; Bibliography : : : : : : Category:Defunct political parties in France Category:French nationalist parties Category:Far- right politics in France Category:Far-right politics in Europe Category:Pan- European nationalism ","title":"European Rally for Liberty"},{"id":"61463844","text":"Tanvir Hasan Soto Monir is a Bangladesh Awami League politician and the incumbent Member of Parliament of Tangail-2.

Their training turns out to be very specific so that they can face a possible offensive to the island. They were officially created at the end of the 80's of the 20th century, but a previous decade, there were already special mission units that acted as part of the Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces (MINFAR), called \\"Tigers\\" and \\"Lions\\" in Angola, so it is considered that it was in 1977, when the MINFAR decided to have its own special forces, after relying on the special troops of the Ministry of Interior, MININT in the Battle of Quifangondo, Angola, in late 1975. Training and structure The \\"Black Wasps\\" work in sub-groups consisting of 5 members, which can be male or female. Its main bases are in the old military prison \\"El Pitirre\\", located at Km 8 of the National Highway, and in the unit of \\"Baracoa Beach\\", near the area of El Mariel port, current province of Havana, and With smaller units in \\"El Bosque de la Habana\\", this is where the MINFAR Special Troops Department and \\"El Reloj Club\\" are located, the latter near the Rancho Boyeros airport. Its main training camp is called \\"El Cacho\\", in the province of Pinar del R√≠o, also named \\"Academia Baragu√°\\". His training is highly rigorous. Upon graduation, soldiers and professional officers of this force perform exercises in the Ci√©naga de Zapata, south of Matanzas province, near to Bay of Pigs, or in the swamps south of the Isle of Pines, huge wetlands located both west of Cuba, under strict survival conditions. Approving these exercises means graduating. The \\"Black Wasps\\" have received training from Vietnamese, North Korean, Chinese, as well as Russian VDVs and Spetsnaz, they learned to communicate and move silently through narrow tunnels. The official clothing consisted of a camouflage suit, with a red beret, which as of 2011, became a green beret, leaving the red beret only for the Prevention Troops (Military Police) and the shield of a black wasp with the sting ready to attack, in a bracelet. In the case of the professional members, an indicative of \\"Professional\\" is added on the bracelet. These troops are also experts in masking techniques, use of jungle environments to set deadly traps and various martial arts. Armament The armament is very varied and is largely the same as the rest of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba (FAR), although in recent years they have been seen (in military parades since the FAR has a jealous secrecy about its technology) new weapons that include nationally manufactured weapons and old modernized Soviet weapons with accessories such as, Vilma optical sight glasses and mufflers, as well as anti-material rifles of which their characteristics are kept secret. *AKMS (nationally manufactured with polymer cylinder head and guard instead of wood and bakelite loader) *AKMSB (as the letter \\"B\\" indicates this version is the same as the AKMS, but it has a silencer and the Cuban-made red-dot sight \\"Vilma\\") *AKML *AKS-74U *MP5 *AMD-65 (Hungarian assault rifle based on the AK-47, with folding stock and used by paratroopers) *SVD Dragunov *PKM machine gun *RPK light machine gun *Mamb√≠ (14.5 mm anti-helicopter rifle, designed and manufactured in Cuba) *Alejandro (bolt sniper gun used by territorial militia troops, MTT, snipers and wasps) *RPG-7V (anti-tank rocket launcher) *RGD-5 (anti-personnel hand grenade) *RKG-3 (anti-tank hand grenade) *9K38 Igla (portable anti-aircraft launcher) *PM Makarov (Russian-designed personal use gun, manufactured under license in Cuba) *Stechkin APS, 9 x 18 Makarov (machine gun with 20 bullet magazine) * 9 x 18 Makarov pistol, version with silencer of the Stechkin APS (this weapon can also be classified as a submachine gun) *CZ 75, 9 mm. In addition to western armament, another of national manufacture of which details and secondary equipment such as 60 mm, 120 mm mortars and demolition loads are not known. Vehicles The \\"Black Wasps\\" have a series of vehicles of different types to make this force as mobile as possible in case of an attack on the island, among which are: *Fiero: highly mobile and well-armed all-terrain vehicle with AGS-17 grenade launcher on the roof and a PKM machine gun. *Iguana: a kind of Cuban Hummer, armed with a 12.7 mm NSV machine gun on the roof. The name of Iguana is unofficial, since data on this vehicle is very scarce and its exact name is unknown. *UAZ: is the all-terrain standard of the FAR. The Black Wasps have different versions of this vehicle, including a very well armed with a PKM machine gun, an ASG-17 grenade launcher and a SPG-9 recoilless cannon. *BRDM2: they are used by the Black Wasps exploration bodies and have the standard armament such as the PKT machine gun and the KVPT heavy machine gun. *BTR-60: Also used with scan bodies in small quantities.

Cecilia Crofts took part in Walter Montagu's masque The Shepheard's Paradise at Somerset House in 1633. Sir Robert Ayton's poem, Upon Platonic Love: To Mistress Cicely Crofts: Maid of Honour, has been connected with the treatment of neo-Platonism in Montagu's masque, but may have been written in earlier years.

In 1636 she married Thomas Killigrew a courtier and playwright, son of Robert Killigrew and Mary Woodhouse.

Houghton Mifflin Company, 1994. The Allmand 31 design was originally marketed as the Sail 31 and was later sold as the Allmand 312, with the same deck and hull, but a different interior layout. Production The design was built by Allmand Boats in Hialeah, Florida, United States from 1978 to 1985, but it is now out of production. Design The Allmand 31 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim. The deck has an end-grain balsa core. It has a masthead sloop rig with aluminum spars, a raked stem, a near- vertical transom, a skeg-mounted rudder controlled by a wheel and a short fixed fin keel. It displaces and carries of iron ballast with the standard rig or lead with the tall rig. The boat has a draft of with the standard keel fitted. A tall rig was optional, with a mast about higher than standard for use in locations with light winds. The boat is fitted with a Universal M16 or M35 diesel engine of . Some sources state the standard engine was a Universal M-20 diesel, with a Universal M-25 optional. The fuel tank holds and the fresh water tank has a capacity of . The design has a galley on the starboard side, including an 8 icebox and pressure water. The head is located forward on the port side, just aft of the bow \\"V\\"-berth. Additional sleeping accommodation includes an aft cabin under the cockpit, a port side main cabin settee that converts to a double and a starboard side settee/berth for total sleeping space for seven people. The dinette also seats seven people. Ventilation is provided by hatches over the aft cabin, main cabin and bow cabin, plus seven opening ports. Two winches are provided in the cockpit for the genoa sheets and a winch on the mast for the mainsail halyard, plus another winch for the genoa halyard. The design has a Portsmouth Yardstick racing average handicap of 85.5. Operational history In a review Richard Sherwood wrote, \\"the Allmand is claimed to have a tacking angle of 84 degrees. Because beam on deck is 11 feet 4 inches and 8 feet 6 inches at the water, after initially heeling she picks up a large amount of buoyancy and is stiff. The long water line allows for additional internal volume.\\" Gregg Nestor wrote a review of the design in Cruising World in 2013, noting its sailing qualities, \\"under sail, the boat accelerates quickly, but windward performance is hampered by its wide beam and shoal draft. Although the 31 will tack through about 90 degrees and is extraordinarily stiff and sails almost level, it makes noticeable leeway. Its best points of sail are off the wind.\\" He concluded, \\"the strongest features of the Allmand 31 are its generous interior and its spacious cockpit. Its moderate rig is easily managed, but the shoal draft and the smallish sail area make the Allmand 31 a better candidate for coastal cruising than bluewater sailing. The boat is solidly constructed and doesn‚Äôt look that dated, but the builder wasn‚Äôt known for sailboats, and this probably accounts for the 31‚Äôs current depressed price\\" A review in Practical Sailor, stated, \\"this 1970's era cruiser is beloved for its roomy, tri-cabin interior, but it does not sail close to the wind and the shoal keel makes excessive leeway.\\".

The peak lies west of Mount Terror and the small Mustard Glacier lies on its northern slope. The first ascent of Himmelhorn was made on September 8, 1961, by Ed Cooper, Glen Denny, Joan and Joe Firey, and George Whitmore. Originally called Himmelgeisterhorn, Himmelhorn means Horn of the Sky Spirit. Climate Himmelhorn is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

According to the late High Orator Nanai Afuola Kalasa, the most senior chief authority, the island is directly linked to a legend about the village's creation. A couple sailed westward from the Manu'a Islands with their daughter, with the hopes of reaching Upolu Island. A few days later, they struggled with rough seas and the raft gave up on them. All the three perished and mutated into rocks. The couple was Pola and Pola, while the daughter was Faleofia. These rock forms are named after this couple. Uta translates to ‚Äúcloser to land‚Äù, and Pola'uta is the name of the ridge on the opposite side of the strait. ‚ÄúTai‚Äù translates to ‚Äúfurther from land‚Äù, and Pola Tai is a name used for Pola Island. Avifauna With the exception of Rose Atoll, Red-footed boobies are only found in the Pola area of American Samoa. The Pola region of Vatia is the most important roosting and nesting sites in American Samoa for numerous species of seabirds.

Hunting of Brown boobies, known as A'ega o le Pola, was a tradition in the past. However, the birds were over- hunted due to the use of shotguns and remained gone from the Pola area until recently. The eggs from Brown boobies were considered a delicacy for nearby Vatia residents. Geology Pola Tai, Pola'uta Ridge and Vatia as seen from the Mount Alava Adventure Trail. Erosion by the sea has sculpted the cliffs and sea arches in the rocks of the huge volcanic plug known as Pola Island. The rock formations of Pola Island resemble a dinosaur tail jutting 3,500 feet out into the sea. It is a rugged and sharp igneous basaltic outcrop. Accessibility Passing east through the village of Vatia, the Pola Island trailhead is located at the end of the road.

Plot On her first day at a new school, a young transfer student named Saeko Mizuno is seen leaving the last stall in the girls' bathroom. Students at the school believe that a young girl named Hanako-san committed suicide in that stall, and that her spirit remains there. Since the students who believe in the Hanako-san legend avoid using that stall, rumors begin to spread that Mizuno is actually Hanako-san herself. Many of the students also believe that Hanako-san is responsible for a series of child homicides which have been occurring in the area around the school, and so they assume that Mizuno has come to their school in search of victims. The real murderer decapitates the school goat one day, which raises further suspicions against Mizuno, since she was the one appointed to feed the animal that day. Wanting to see if Mizuno truly is Hanako-san, Mizuno's classmates decide to lock her in the last stall in the girls' bathroom over night, surmising that, if she is still there in the morning, she must not be Hanako- san. Unbeknownst to Mizuno's classmates, the child killer is lurking around the school, and he eventually confronts Mizuno and one of her friends. The real Hanako-san appears, and is revealed to be a benevolent spirit. She summons a mob of students to the school, and they surround the killer, preventing him from escaping until the police and other adults arrive.

The EP was released in Japan on June 6, 2018 by Victor Entertainment, and in Europe and North America two days later by JPU Records. It reached number 20 on the Oricon chart and number 24 on Billboard Japan. Background and release Shocked by the amount of praise they received for their October 2017 first album Awakening from Abyss, Lovebites wanted to quickly put out new music. Battle Against Damnation is their first release since guitarist and keyboardist Miyako changed her stage name from Mi-Ya. While composing for it, Miyako was thinking of Irish guitarist Gary Moore and Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninoff. Several songs that began during the making of this EP were later included on their second album, Clockwork Immortality, released six months later. Like all of their releases, Battle Against Damnation was mixed by Mikko Karmila and mastered by Mika Jussila at Finnvox Studios in Helsinki, Finland. Also returning, The EasyRabbit CreArtions provided the cover art of a wolf howling at a black sea and red sky, references to two of the EP's song titles; illustrated by Spanish artist David L√≥pez G√≥mez and designed by G√≥mez and Carlos Vincente Le√≥n. The wolf, which first appeared on the band's previous release, symbolizes that by playing the non-mainstream genre of heavy metal Lovebites are a \\"lone wolf\\" in the music scene. Battle Against Damnation was released in Japan on June 6, 2018 by Victor Entertainment. It was released in the United Kingdom and North America by JPU Records two days later. The EP was supported by a tour with a single concert on June 28 at Tsutaya O-East, which was filmed and released as a concert video later in the year with the limited edition of Clockwork Immortality. Days after the EP's release, Lovebites won the 2018 Metal Hammer Golden Gods Award for Best New Band. They performed in Germany at Wacken Open Air on August 4, and in England on the main stage at Bloodstock Open Air on August 10. In November, the band held their first European tour that saw them visit the Netherlands, Germany, France and the UK. Victor released a limited edition vinyl record version of the EP, titled in Japanese, on October 2, 2019 with new liner notes by Masanori Ito. Themes Miyako described the last two songs on the EP as a love letter to Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninoff and very personal for her. Although they had several songs in contention for opening track of the EP, \\"The Crusade\\" was chosen as soon as Miyako composed it and played the band the demo. Bassist and leader Miho wrote the foundation of \\"Break the Wall\\" while Miyako then \\"added color\\" to the composition. Miyako wrote the guitar solo in the middle with Gary Moore in mind, whom she identifies with the blues guitar sound. Drummer Haruna called it their most aggressive song to date with a simple lyrical verse that live audiences can sing along to. The last two tracks, the Miyako-composed \\"Above the Black Sea\\" and the Mao-composed \\"Under the Red Sky\\", together make up a love letter to Sergei Rachmaninoff. Unable to play his Piano Concerto No. 2 on piano, Miyako created a \\"guitar concerto\\" with these songs instead. They are linked by their titles and lyrical themes about war, which also connect to the EP's title. \\"Above the Black Sea\\" has a neoclassical metal feel and Midori played one of her guitar solos in a Yngwie Malmsteen-style at the suggestion of producer Steve Jacobs. Although the lyrics have no clear story, Asami imagined a Japanese Special Attack Unit when writing. When writing the lyrics to \\"Under the Red Sky\\", Asami approached it as a sequel to \\"The Apocalypse\\", from both their debut EP and first album, which is about the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. Reception Battle Against Damnation reached number 20 on the Oricon Albums Chart and stayed on the chart for four weeks. It peaked at number 24 on Billboard Japans Hot Albums chart. However, it reached number 18 on Billboard Japans Top Albums Sales chart, which is based only on physical sales. At the end of June 2018, readers of Loudersound voted Battle Against Damnation the 10th Best Album of the Year (So Far). Giving the EP a perfect rating and calling it essential listening, music journalist Leon TK claimed \\"These four tracks are superior to entire swathes of metal albums from the present day and decades past.\\" He wrote that \\"The Crusade\\" unleashes nearly every trick in the book and is \\"far more solid, aggressive, and generally heavy\\" than Lovebites' previous work, while \\"Break the Wall\\" shows Metallica- and Queen-influences, proving they \\"are no one-trick ponies.\\" Noting \\"Above the Black Sea\\" and \\"Under the Red Sky\\" as stylistic changes that keep things fresh and engaging, he felt the former draws from Yngwie Malmsteen and symphonic metallers Nightwish, while the latter is \\"a true progressive voyage\\" blending everything that came before. James Weaver of Distorted Sound gave the EP a near-perfect 9/10, stating it \\"encapsulates everything that LOVEBITES are becoming revered for; a hurricane of riffing and soaring operatic heavy metal.\\" He noted a \\"brilliantly executed mid-tempo switch\\" in \\"Break the Wall\\" and claimed \\"Under the Red Sky\\" features Asami's best vocal deliveries to date. Weaver finished with \\"Technically brilliant and utterly emphatic, this EP offers a solid insight into The Land of the Rising Sun's hottest new export.\\" Reviewing the EP for Metal Forces, Neil Arnold gave it an 8/10 and had strong praise for Asami's vocals drifting effortlessly from \\"full-on soaring power metal volcanic eruptions to an almost clean-cut and poppy design.\\" He wrote that the beauty of the band is that \\"Lovebites can provide seemingly innocent structures to draw you in, but once inside, you're blasted with a sonic panorama of fully cranked New Wave Of British Heavy Metal-styled velocity.\\" Giving the EP four out of five stars, Classic Rocks Dannii Leivers called the first two songs \\"immediate crowd-pleasers, cross-pollinating British heavy metal with power metal, defiantly in thrall to Iron Maiden, Manowar and DragonForce\\" and the final two songs dense with \\"theatrical symphonic influence.\\" They finished by saying \\"This is Lovebites throwing absolutely everything at the wall and watching it all stick.\\" Sophie Maughan of Metal Hammer also gave it four out of five stars. She compared \\"The Crusade\\" to 80s New Wave of British Heavy Metal, \\"Break the Wall\\" to early Metallica, and felt that the \\"grandiose\\" final two songs show their penchant for a more European sound. Writing for The Soundboard, Luke Nuttall felt that although it is not a large departure, the EP does see the band growing and branching out from simply playing classic power metal. He cited \\"Above the Black Sea\\" as the best example of this, with its \\"choral and symphonic punctuations breaking through the constant stream of miles-per-hour fretboard dashes.\\" Although seeing a \\"relative lack of solid songwriting,\\" Nuttall wrote that Lovebites are untouchable at \\"crafting a sound brimming with pomp and circumstance stemming from their supreme technical wizardry.\\" Track listing Personnel Lovebites *Asami ‚Äì vocals *Midori ‚Äì guitars *Miyako ‚Äì guitars, keyboards *Miho ‚Äì bass guitar *Haruna ‚Äì drums Other *Mao ‚Äì keyboards and programming *Steve Jacobs ‚Äì production *Mikko Karmila ‚Äì mixing *Mika Jussila ‚Äì mastering References External links Category:2018 EPs Category:Lovebites albums Category:EPs by Japanese artists Category:Victor Entertainment EPs ","title":"Battle Against Damnation"},{"id":"61464882","text":"Gazi Mohammad Shahnawaz, also known as Milad Gazi, is a Bangladesh Awami League politician and the incumbent Member of Parliament of Habiganj-1.

It is the third laboratory on board the ISS to study complex plasmas, after the PKE Nefedov and PK-3 Plus experiments. In contrast to the previous setups, the geometry was significantly changed and is more suited to study flowing complex plasmas. Technical description The heart of the PK-4 laboratory consists of a direct current (DC) discharge tube. A plasma is generated by applying an electric field between an anode and a cathode. Microparticles are then injected into the plasma and move through the tube into the working area where their motion is recorded with two cameras, the images of which are joined for analysis. The movement of the microparticles inside the fields of view of the cameras is followed by experimenters. The polarity of this electric field can be switched at a high frequency, so that the microparticles can be trapped in the working area. A variety of manipulation techniques are available, for instance a manipulation laser that can produce shear flow, and a thermal manipulator which can trap microparticles with a thermal gradient. The optical observation of the microparticles is complemented by other diagnostics methods: a spectrometer and a glow camera that records the plasma glow in several spectral lines. Scientific goals As its predecessors, PK-4 Plus studies complex plasmas, which are low temperature plasmas that contain highly charged microparticles. The microparticles interact with each other and with the plasma and can be used to study a variety of topics, for instance waves , the influence of microparticles on the plasma, string formation, and shear flow.

It took place during the Battle of Kuhmoinen, when the Whites executed 11 Red Guard patients and two male sanitaries. The Whites belonged to the 1st company and its battalion commanded by the Estonian born Hans Kalm. Kalm was not part of the incident and did not know anything about it, as he was engaged in the defense of the Kuhmoinen parish center at the time, against the Red Guards offensive in the direction of J√§ms√§.Kai Donner, T. H. Svedlin, Heikki Nurmio: Suomen Vapaussota osa 5, p. 92‚Äì93. These claims are based on the stories by two survivors, reports by the Whites and other materials. The \\"Putsch\\" was led by Artturi Paimela and Lauri Pihkala, and involved were the Kalm Battalion, including Albert Gyllenb√∂gel and Hans Holopainen. Researcher of political history Jaakko Paavolainen thinks that \\"it is possible that shots were fired from the sick room, as the Whites have reported, but the claim that the snipers would have retired to the beds inside, is a rather fantastic one.\\"Paavolainen 1967 The starting point The Battle of Kuhmoinen was at its height on 10 March. The area was in the eastern protection zone of Tampere (and a former rebellion center during the Cudgel War). The Reds were trying to occupy the parish center, but the attempt came to naught in the end. In the southern extremity of the parish, in the Harmoinen village, the local sick room was used as a hospital for the Reds, and it was claimed it worked under a \\"leftist Red Cross\\".Paavolainen 1967, Ylikangas 1993. The \\"leftist Red Cross\\" in this story is a completely unknown one, and such a term is not found in any other connection with respect to the Finnish Civil War. The Reds had originally considered seeking help from the Red Cross, but in the end they had decided against it, and they founded their own organization, which was not dependent on the medical doctors of the bourgeoisie. On 8 November 1917, a medical organ named Ensi-Avun Osasto (‚ÄòFirst Aid Department‚Äô) had been founded for the Working Class Guards, but its activities proved to be rather insignificant. On 5 February 1918, the Finnish Red Guards general staff had its meeting in which its organization was agreed upon. The meeting founded an ambulatory (i.e. medical) department, and F. A. Hyrsky was appointed as its head. In financial and organizational matters, it was subjected to the Red Guards supervisory board, and on 22 February 1918, on the orders of Commander in Chief Eero Haapalainen, it was transferred to the authority of the general staff.Romo Anna Elina: Master‚Äôs thesis in Finnish history. January 2007 Joensuu University, p. 77. Retrieve 30 March 2017 A kind of a competition existed between the Red Guards First Aid Unit and the Red Cross. The First Aid Unit wanted to be independent of the Red Cross and of Finnish medical doctors, although in Lahti they were not successful in this. According to Ros√©n, the wounded and sick members of the Red Guards ‚Äî including Russians ‚Äî strove to become treated by the Red Cross doctors and hospitals, preferring them to Red Guards first aid units. The relations between the First Aid Units and the Red Cross suffered from the murder of Candidate of Medicine G√∂sta Schybergson in early February, 1918. Commander-in-Chief Haapalainen published on 31 January a communiqu√© to the Red Guards, stating that the Red Cross had promised to remain neutral between the two parties of the war and to treat the wounded of both sides, but various kinds of incidents nevertheless took place. In the beginning of the war the Red Guards took the view that the wounded of both parties should be treated in the same way. Although the Red Guards were in many places, e.g. in the central front, sympathetic to the Red Cross, the leaders of the Red Guards units that fought in Harmoinen, i.e. the Lahti Red Guard Regiment, remained unequivocally negative in their attitudes towards the Red Cross. The activities of the Lahti section of the Finnish Red Cross were in trouble right from the beginning, when it was not possible to reach an agreement on cooperation between the Red Cross doctors and the Red Guards First Aid Unit.Arno Forsius: Medical care in Lahti during the fighting in 1918. Part one.  The events The 1st Company of the Kalm Battalion was engaged in a swing into the rear of the Kuhmoinen Reds, and some of their troops made a surprise attack against the Kuhmoinen village, and the Reds had to retreat from there. 13 wounded men and a few sanitaries were left behind in the sick room. Around 5 p.m. a detachment of White soldiers arrived there, led by secondary school graduate Artturi Paimela, accompanied by Sergeant Major of the 1st Company, Master of Arts Albert Gyllenb√∂gel. The executions were conducted immediately. According to a survivor, the executioners told those to be executed to \\"prepare for hell, because you will meet your deaths in 5 minutes!\\" The sanitaries, who had tried to hide but had been found, were taken to the courtyard, and the male sanitaries were shot. The patients were shot one by one in their beds. Also two of the women found in the sick room are said to have been executed. Two were spared on the grounds that they could speak the Swedish language.Meriluoto, V.: K√§rsimysten teilt√§, p. 189 KA. One of the two survivors got two bullets, one in the neck and one in the chin. He played dead and threw himself on the floor and later fled through a window and went to a near-by barn, where he found laundry hanging, and used it to bandage his wounds. Another survivor, K. Nuutila, was lying in the farthest bed. He was shot in the face, which he tried to shield with his hand, and he lost his consciousness and only came to several days later. During the events he did came to for a while, and he could see that others, lying in their beds half dead, where being executed. He covered himself with a sheet, but it was torn away, however, it seems that the dried blood on his face made him look like he was already dead. Nuutila was able to escape, and some local people helped him to reach Padasjoki. One patient, who groaned in agony, was spared, because the attackers thought that he would die later anyway. He had earlier been shot in the head. The events after the skirmish The White company left the village the following day, and it seems that many outsiders went to the sick room and saw what had happened. The Whites came to the village again two days after the skirmish. Only two weeks later, the locals were given the order to bury the victims, on pain of being put in front of a firing squad. The locals were faced with the problem that there were only 11 bodies, but they found two bodies at the roadside, and thus the number of 13 was met. Were the two bodies those of the sanitaries is not known. The bodies were buried in a field that belonged to a family named Nikula. According to Jaakko Paavolainen, the report written later by the Whites seems not credible. The report was written by Sergeant Major Albert Gyllenb√∂gel of the 1st Company for the memorial book of the Kalm Battalion. Kalm: Kalmin pataljoona Suomen vapaussodassa (‚ÄòThe Kalm Battalion in the Finnish Civil War‚Äô. The reports says that shots were fired from the sick room and that when the Whites arrived there, they found healthy, armed men in the hospital beds, and they were given their sentences without further ado. Paavolainen surmises, that \\"it is possible that shots were fired from the direction of the hospital, but the claim that snipers had retreated to the hospital beds is a rather fantastic one.\\" The Red press made use of the incident in its propaganda. Observations from Sweden The incident was noticed in Sweden, and Secretary of State Samuli Sario telegraphed to the chief of staff and asked for a report in hopes that \\"we could inform a Swedish cabinet minister, who had asked about information on the incident, and tell him that the news regarding it were without base.\\" No such report to a Swedish minister can be found in the Finnish archives.Finnish Army Headquarters Archive 1918, folder 7, SA (Finnish Army) Sources References Category:White terror in the Finnish Civil War Category:Kuhmoinen Category:Massacres in Finland Category:March 1918 events Category:1918 in Finland Category:Attacks on hospitals ","title":"Harmoinen sick room mass murder"},{"id":"61465010","text":"Ashim Kumar Ukil () is a Bangladesh Awami League politician and the incumbent Member of Parliament of Netrokona-3.

He previously worked for Barack Obama at The Pentagon, where he launched the Defense Innovation Unit. Holliday was Project Manager for Pioneer, a robot which helped to map the inside for the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.  Early life and education  Holliday was born in Providence, Rhode Island. He watched Star Trek as a child, and wanted to become an astronaut. He grew up in Scarsdale, New York. Holliday studied mechanical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, where he was one of only fifteen African American engineers in his class. During his studies he became interested in robotics, as the nuclear meltdown at Three Mile Island resulted in the launch of a Carnegie Mellon spin off company called RedZone Robotics, with Red Whittaker as the Chief Scientist. Holliday worked with Red Whittaker who was designing robotic systems to explore the contaminated reactor. He was selected to attend the International Space University in 1991 and reached the finals of the United States astronaut corps in 1994 and 1996. Holliday withdrew his application to NASA after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster.  Research and career  Holliday joined Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory as a robotics engineer. He realised that the advanced assignments were given to people with advanced degrees, so took a career break. He was awarded a scholarship to work on robotics and international security at Stanford University, and started their graduate program in mechanical engineering design. Holliday worked on the target positioning systems of the National Ignition Facility. In 1995 Holliday was awarded an American Association for the Advancement of Science Science Engineering and Diplomacy Fellowship, and moved to Washington, D.C. to work on science and technology policy at United States Agency for International Development. During his fellowship he pitched that the international funding for the Chernobyl disaster should include support for the development of robotics. After his fellowship he worked for the United States Department of Energy in the Russia Nuclear Materials Taskforce, in which he and help implement nuclear material security upgrades at Russian nuclear cities. He worked with the Institute of Special Mechanical Programs in Ukraine on the Pioneer robot design, which, during the Cold War, designed guidance and control systems for Soviet ballistic missiles. Holliday's efforts on securing tons of weapons grade nuclear material were recognised with the Meritorious Service Medal, the DOE‚Äôs highest civilian award. Holliday served as Project Manager for the Pioneer robot, which helped the Ukrainians map the inside of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. He collaborated with Whittaker's RedZone Robotics and delivered the finished product in 1999. The robot, which cost $3 million, was designed to withstand considerably more radiation than humans could tolerate and stay inside the nuclear reactor for up to two years. It used the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Vision System to identify and document properties of materials inside the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, a system which became a prototype for the Mars Pathfinder. During the development of Pioneer, Holliday travelled to the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone four times. After leaving the United States Department of Energy, Holliday returned to Silicon Valley, where he helped develop pattern recognition for Evolution Robotics. He contributed to the design and development of High Definition (HD) camera systems for Intuitive Surgical‚Äôs da Vinci telerobotic surgery robot. Holliday joined Sandia National Laboratories in 2011, where he worked in the Systems Analysis Group. During Barack Obama's second term in office, Holliday was appointed as Senior Technical Advisor to Frank Kendall the longest serving Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (AT&L;) in the history of the Pentagon. He worked inside The Pentagon and helped to establish the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx). DIU contracts with non traditional Silicon Valley companies to solve Pentagon problems in areas where the commercial sector is moving faster than the government. This includes projects in areas like autonomy, artificial intelligence, space and cyber. It was established to provide pilot contacts for commercial innovation that helped United States Department of Defense problems quickly, and helped provide access to test environments. The DIUx had fast contract-to-prototyping processes. He served as an advisor for the Defense Science Board in 2015. Holliday was awarded the Defense Medal for Exceptional Public Service. Holliday left The Pentagon in January 2017. He joined RAND Corporation in February 2017, where he leads autonomous vehicle research. = Outreach and engagement = Holliday works on various projects that teach young people about science and engineering. His motto is the popular, \\"you learn it, earn it, and return it\\". Holliday was involved with Barack Obama's My Brother's Keeper program, a scheme which supported young people in accessing science and engineering initiatives. He co-founded Robot Garden, a community makerspace in Livermore, and remains on their Board of Advisors. In 2012 he was named the Citizen Schools Volunteer of the Year for his efforts at Elmhurst Community Prep school. He has also taught advanced robotics classes at San Ramon Valley High School.

Creation and design The characters of Bungo Stray Dogs were created by Kafka Asagiri and designed by Sango Harukawa. Asagiri noted that in the making of the story, the character designs were developed first rather than their plot lines since the restrictions of the plot might cause the characters to become too flat.

Reception The characters of Bungo Stray Dogs have been popular in Japan with Crunchyroll noting that most of them appeared in a Newtype poll when the anime premiered in 2016. Manga.Tokyo enjoyed Osamu Dazai due to his appealing interactions with Doppo Kunikida while also enjoying Mamoru Miyano's performance as his voice actor. Atsushi's characterization has earned mixed responses The Fandom Post noted that his power of becoming a tiger gave him potential to make goods rather than the curse he fears. On the other hand, Reel Run Down considered Atsushi as one of the weakest characters due to his constant insecure thoughts despite having multiple achievements in the storyline. As a result, the reviewer found his abusive background became more of a stale running joke than a terrifying experience. Otaku USA noted that while Atsushi becomes a hero during the story, he is overshadowed by others character he found more interesting. Nevertheless, Atsushi's and Akutagawa's rivalry has also resulted into positive reaction due to how each character balance the other in terms of personality and how they become allies for a short for one of the most entertaining fights in the series. Anime News Network still enjoyed the new bond he formed with former Guild member Lucy Maud Montgomery; the reviewer noted Lucy became attracted to him and thus expected a form romance or love triangle would be composed between these two characters as well as Kyoka as this character also formed a strong bond with Atsushi. Concluding this comment, the reviewer expected this would happen the story would be benefitted from this type of subplot since Bungo Stray Dogs barely handled romance.

The first ascent of Twin Needles was made on August 17, 1932, by William Degenhardt, James Martin, and Herb Strandberg. Twin Needles can be seen from the 100 meter Sterling Munro Trail located behind the park's Newhalem Visitor Center. Climate Twin Needles is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Precipitation runoff from the peaks drains into tributaries of Skagit River. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. Picket Range from the Sterling Munro Trail overlook, with Twin Needles left of center The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Background The Republic of Artsakh (; , '), or simply Artsakh, also known by its second official name, the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (), is a breakaway state in the South Caucasus that is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan. The region is currently populated mostly by Armenians and the primary spoken language is Armenian. Artsakh controls most of the territory of the former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast and some of the surrounding area, giving it a border with Armenia to the west and Iran to the south. Its capital is Stepanakert. The predominantly Armenian-populated region of Nagorno-Karabakh was claimed by both the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic and the First Republic of Armenia when both countries became independent in 1918 after the fall of the Russian Empire, and a brief war over Nagorno-Karabakh broke out in 1920. The dispute was largely shelved after the Soviet Union established control over the area and created the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (NKAO) within the Azerbaijan SSR in 1923. During the fall of the Soviet Union, the region re-emerged as a source of dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan. In 1991, a referendum held in the NKAO and the neighbouring Shahumian region resulted in a declaration of independence based on its right of self-determination. Large-scale ethnic conflict led to the 1991‚Äì1994 Nagorno-Karabakh War, which ended with a ceasefire. Artsakh is a presidential democracy (in the middle of transforming from a semi-presidential one, after the 2017 referendum) with a unicameral legislature. Some have said that its reliance on Armenia means that, in many ways, it functions de facto as part of Armenia. Artsakh Jewish connection to Armenia The history of the Jews in Armenia () dates back more than 2,000 years. There are historical records that attest the presence of Jews in pagan Armenia, before the spread of Christianity in the region by St. Gregory the Illuminator. Early medieval Armenian historians, such as Moses Khorenatsi, held that during the conquest of Armenian King Tigranes the Great (95‚Äì55 BC), brought with him 10,000 Jewish captives to the ancient Kingdom of Armenia (which encompassed what is commonly known as Greater Armenia) when he retreated from Judea, because of the Roman attack on Armenia (69 B.C.). Tigranes II invaded Syria, and probably northern Israel as well.Jan Rets√∂, The Arabs in Antiquity: Their History from the Assyrians to the Umayyads, 2003. p. 347. A large Jewish population was settled in Armenia from the 1st century BC. One city in particular, Vartkesavan became an important commercial center.Movses Khorenatsi II, 65 Thus, Armenia's Jewish community was established. Like the rest of Armenia's population, they suffered the consequences of regional powers trying to divide and conquer the country.Advocates on Behalf of Jews in Russia, Ukraine, the Baltic States, and Eurasia: Armenia and Jews By 360‚Äì370 AD, there was a massive increase in Jewish Hellenistic immigration into Armenia; many Armenian towns became predominately Jewish. During this period (4th century AD), after the conquest of Armenia by the Sassanid King Shapur II he deported thousands of Jewish families from Persian Armenia and resettled them at Isfahan (modern Iran). =Modern times= In 1828, the Russo-Persian War came to an end and Eastern Armenia (currently the Republic of Armenia) was annexed to the Russian Empire with the Treaty of Turkmenchai. Polish and Iranian Jews began arriving, as well as Sabbatarians (Subbotniki, Russian peasants who were banished to the outskirts of Imperial Russia during the reign of Catherine II. They were Judaizing Christians and mostly converted to mainstream Judaism or assimilated). Since 1840 they started creating Ashkenazi and Mizrahi communities respectively in Yerevan. Up to 1924, the Sephardic synagogue, Shiek Mordechai, was a leading institution among the Jewish community. According to the 1897 Russian Empire Census, there were some 415 people in Alexandropol (Gyumri) and 204 in Erivan (Yerevan) whose native language was \\"Jewish\\" and significantly smaller numbers elsewhere 6 in Vagharshapat, 15 in Novo-Bayazet. The number of self-reported Jewish-speakers was the following in other Armenian-populated areas of the Russian Empire that now lie outside Armenia: 4 in Shusha (Karabakh), 93 in Elizavetpol (Ganja, Azerbaijan), 4 in Igdir (now Turkey), 424 in Kars (Turkey), 111 in Ardahan (Turkey), 189 in Akhalkalaki (Georgia), 438 in Akhaltsikhe (Georga), 72 in Shulaveri (Georgia). There are about 300‚Äì500Vandals deface Holocaust memorial in Armenia. Michael Freund, The Jerusalem Post, December 23, 2007 Jews presently living in the Republic of Armenia, mainly in the capital Yerevan. They are mostly of Ashkenazi origin, while some are Mizrahi and Georgian Jews. Artsakh Jewish connection to Azerbaijan The history of the Jews in Azerbaijan dates back many centuries. Today, Jews in Azerbaijan mainly consist of three distinct groups: Mountain Jews, the most sizable and most ancient group; Ashkenazi Jews, who settled in the area during the late 19th-early 20th centuries, and during World War II; and Georgian Jews who settled mainly in Baku during the early part of the 20th century. Historically, Jews in Azerbaijan have been represented by various subgroups, mainly Mountain Jews, Ashkenazi Jews and Georgian Jews. Azerbaijan at one point was or still is home to smaller communities of Krymchaks, Kurdish Jews and Bukharian Jews, as well Gerim (converts) and non-Jewish Judaistic groups like Subbotniks. In those days, Jews used to live in and around the city of Shamakhi (mainly in the village of M√ºc√º), but the community has been non-existent since the early 1920s. In 2002, the total number of Jewish residents in Azerbaijan was 10,000 people with about 5,500 of them being Mountain Jews. Ethnic Composition of Azerbaijan According to the 1999 Census by Arif Yunusov. Demoscope.ru A few more thousand descend from mixed families. The Electronic Jewish Encyclop√¶dia: Azerbaijan In 2010, the total Jewish population in Azerbaijan was 6,400., based on Jews mainly reside in the cities of Baku, Ganja, Sumqayit, Quba, Oƒüuz, Goychay and the town of Qƒ±rmƒ±zƒ± Q…ôs…ôb…ô, the only town in the world where Mountain Jews constitute the majority (and the only fully Jewish town outside of Israel). Archaeological excavations carried out in 1990 resulted in the discovery of the remains of the 7th-century Jewish settlement near Baku, and of a synagogue 25 kilometres to the southeast of Quba. The first religious meeting-house in Baku was built in 1832, and was reorganized into a synagogue in 1896; more synagogues were built in Baku and its suburbs in the late 19th century. The first choir synagogue in Baku opened in 1910. The Electronic Jewish Encyclop√¶dia: Baku From the late 19th century, Baku became one of the centres of the Zionist movement in the Russian Empire. The first Hovevei Zion was established here in 1891, followed by the first Zionist organization in 1899. The movement remained strong in the short-lived Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan (1918‚Äì1920) marked with the establishment of the Jewish Popular University in 1919, periodicals printed in Yiddish, Hebrew, Jud√¶o-Tat and Russian, and a number of schools, social clubs, benevolent societies and cultural organizations. Beginning in the 1960s, Azerbaijan's Jewish community experienced cultural revival. Jewish samizdat publications started being printed. Many cultural and Zionist organizations were reestablished in Baku and Sumqayit since 1987, and the first legal Hebrew courses in the Soviet Union were opened in Baku. As of 2017, there are seven synagogues in Azerbaijan: three in Baku (one for each community, the Ashkenazi, Mountain and Georgian; the second one being the largest in the Caucasus), two in Qƒ±rmƒ±zƒ± Q…ôs…ôb…ô near Quba, and two in Oƒüuz.

Post millennium, a portable vaccine cooler unit has been proposed by several technologists. The WHO Performance, Quality and Safety (PQS) programme is a driver of the technology. Technology development In 2005 Ian Tansley of Sure Chill designed an ice-chest vaccine cooler regulated by the density of water. Since water has greatest density at around 4 ¬∞C, putting the vaccine chamber at the bottom of a thermo-syphon regulates the temperature at between 2 ¬∞C and 8 ¬∞C, as long as there is ice and the heat-exchange capacity is not overloaded. Sure Chill claimed to be WHO approved and in use for vaccine storage in 46 countries. A refrigeration device was shown for this purpose by Adam Grosser at a TED Talk in 2007, but had not made it into production as of 2015. Grosser's proposed device uses exposure to a cooking fire for 30 minutes to store heat. After a cooling period of an hour, the device is placed into a 15-litre container, which contains the vaccine. His concept calls for a 24-hour re-cycle period. It was revealed in March 2008 that another class of long-term Vaccine Cooler is based around an Ice Box with separate Ice and Vaccine chambers. Using ice as the energy storage device allows the Vaccine Cooler to operate for long periods without power: separating the vaccine chamber from the ice chamber allows temperature regulation while avoiding the need for special packing and conditioning of the cold packs. Suggestions have included the use of a regulated heat pipe to connect the vaccine chamber and the ice chamber. In September 2008 it was reported that Malcolm McCulloch of Oxford University was heading a three-year project to develop more robust appliances that could be used in locales lacking electricity, and that his team had completed a prototype of his renewal of the Einstein refrigerator. He was quoted as saying that improving the design and changing the types of gases used might allow the design's efficiency to be quadrupled. The three working fluids in this design are water, ammonia and butane. The Free Piston Stirling Cooler, a type of mechanical refrigerator, was brought to market before 2010 by Twinbird Corporation of Japan. In 2016 Will Broadway won the James Dyson Award for a vaccine cooler based on a miniaturisation of the bi-fluid Icyball technology. Broadway's design uses electricity or propane as the heat source. As of August 2019, Broadway claimed an 88-hour cool-life under WHO PQS test conditions, whereas competitor products could only meet a nine-hour cool-life.

During this pilgrimage, Lisiard took the habit (wearing the robes of monks), studied from the extensive library of religious texts that had been assembled there, and made a written pledge of lands that would later pass to the monastery of Saint-Beno√Æt-sur-Loire.Collection of the charters of the abbey of Saint-Germain-sur-Loire.

Originally a PhD thesis, the author adapted it into a book. According to Jones, neoliberalism began after the Great Depression as a movement of intellectuals committed to protecting liberal values of individual liberty and limited government, which they believed were threatened in Britain and the United States by expanding government. They aimed to construct a distinctly new liberalism (hence \\"neo\\"-liberalism) by charting a middle way between the laissez-faire economics of the pre- Depression era and the \\"collectivism\\" of New Deal liberalism and British social democracy. He argues that between the 1950s and 1970s this commitment evolved into one of greater conviction in the superiority of the free market, such that by the 1980s neoliberal policy proposals centered almost entirely around market liberalization. Modern neoliberalism, according to Jones, is associated with economic liberalism, monetarism, and a staunch support of free market capitalism, and advocates political policies of deregulation, privatization, and other market-based reforms. Jones structures the book around what he argues are the three phases of the history of neoliberalism. In the first, lasting from roughly 1920 until 1950, he details how early European neoliberal thinkers like Friedrich Hayek, Ludwig von Mises, and Karl Popper, motivated by expanding government and later the rise of totalitarian regimes in Europe during World War II, developed critiques of \\"collectivism\\", which to them included British social democracy and American New Deal liberalism. Particularly influential during this time was the formation of the Mont Pelerin Society, which brought together intellectuals committed to the defense of liberalism and individualism. In the second phase, lasting from roughly 1950 until 1980, the locus of neoliberal thought moved to the United States, where academics like Milton Friedman and George Stigler built upon the earlier neoliberal foundation by developing new academic and political arguments and introducing a range of neoliberal policy prescriptions. It was during this time that Jones contends neoliberal thought evolved from its more moderate early stance into a \\"faith\\" in the power and efficiency of markets. Jones argues that during this period a transatlantic network of intellectuals, businessmen, journalists, and think tanks arose to promote neoliberal ideology, slowly moving neoliberalism out of the political fringes and into the mainstream. The third phase, taking place after 1980, is the period of neoliberal political prominence. After a decade of stagflation in the United States and the United Kingdom, the neoliberal alternative to the Keynesian economic consensus that had dominated politics was adopted by politicians, finding particular influence with US president Ronald Reagan and British prime minister Margaret Thatcher. This era, Jones notes, was characterized by sweeping deregulation, market liberalization, and tax reductions. Structure The book is divided into an introduction, seven chapters, and a conclusion. * The introduction summarizes the history of neoliberalism and lays out the structure of the book. * Chapter one (\\"The Postwar Settlement\\") provides context for the rise of neoliberalism by briefly describing the development of embedded liberalism and Keynesianism after the Great Depression. * Chapter two (\\"The 1940s: The Emergence of the Neoliberal Critique\\") discusses the critiques of social democracy by the early neoliberals Karl Popper, Ludwig von Mises, and Friedrich Hayek, and outlines the birth of the Mont Pelerin Society. * Chapter three (\\"The Rising Tide: Neoliberal Ideas in the Postwar Period) discusses the two Chicago Schools, the relation of Adam Smith to neoliberalism, the early ideas of Milton Friedman, the ordoliberals in West Germany, and the economic theories of regulatory capture, public choice, and rational choice theory. * Chapter four (\\"A Transatlantic Nework: Think Tanks and the Ideological Entrepreneurs\\") discusses fusionism in the United States, conservatism in Britain during the 1950s, the growth of neoliberal organizations and think tanks from the 1950s through the 1970s, and the spread of neoliberal thought to journalists and politicians. * Chapter five (\\"Keynesianism and the Emergence of Monetarism, 1945‚Äì71) discusses Keynesianism, American economic policy in the 1960s, and the development of monetarism by Milton Friedman. * Chapter six (\\"Economic Strategy: The Neoliberal Breakthrough, 1971-84\\") discusses the stagflation of the 1970s in the United States and United Kingdom and how it set the stage for the political rise of monetarism, which ushered in further neoliberal reforms; it continues with a description of the neoliberal policies of British prime ministers James Callaghan and Margaret Thatcher, Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey, US presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, and Chair of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker. * Chapter seven (\\"Neoliberalism Applied? The Transformation of Affordable Housing and Urban Policy in the United States and Britain, 1945‚Äì2000\\") considers the effects of neoliberal policies on housing and urban policy in the United States and the United Kingdom. * The conclusion (\\"The Legacy of Transatlantic Neoliberalism: Faith-Based Policy\\") discusses the lasting effects of neoliberalism and lays out the author's belief in the need to return \\"reason-based policymaking\\" to political and economic debates. Summary The author divides the history of neoliberalism into three phases. In the first phase, lasting from 1920 to 1950, Jones contends that the crises of the Great Depression and Second World War produced two competing economic ideologies: Keynesianism and neoliberalism. Keynesianism, developed by economist John Maynard Keynes and motivated by the widespread unemployment during the Great Depression, viewed government intervention in the economy as a means to alleviate economic downturns and achieve full employment. Neoliberalism, promoted by economists like Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, and Ludwig von Mises, and arising out of fears of totalitarian regimes like the Nazis, Soviet communists, and Italian fascists, viewed increasing government intervention as a threat to economic and political freedom. Early neoliberal thought, according to Jones, focused on defending liberalism and critiquing all forms of collectivism, and in particular on critiquing New Deal liberalism and British social democracy, which they believed posed a \\"grave threat to the continued existence of Western civilization\\". In the second phase, lasting from 1950 to 1980, Jones notes that Keynesianism dominated political policy while neoliberal thought was mostly confined to universities and think tanks. However, it was during this time that neoliberal thought was refined and spread, creating a transatlantic network of intellectuals, businessmen, journalists, university departments and think tanks promoting neoliberal ideas. The locus of neoliberal thought shifted from Europe to the United States, with the American intellectuals Milton Friedman and George Stigler, as well as the larger Chicago school of economics they were a part of, becoming increasingly influential. Neoliberal thought evolved: whereas the neoliberalism that had emerged during the interwar years had been a \\"nuanced response\\" to war, depression and totalitarian regimes, late-twentieth-century neoliberalism became dominated by market liberalization and globalization, and galvanized around a defense of the superiority of free markets to government economic planning. The third phase, lasting from 1980 onward (the book was released in 2012), is the period of neoliberal political hegemony. Jones suggests that the high inflation and low economic growth in the United States and United Kingdom during the 1970s chipped away at the Keynesian political consensus, which seemed unable to address the decade's stagflation. Jones argues that the transatlantic neoliberal network provided a compelling alternative economic ideology‚Äîone that conveniently included monetarism, an economic theory dealing with inflation. Jones asserts that this led to the widespread political acceptance of neoliberal policies in the 1980s, which brought with it a greater acceptance of neoliberal ideology. Jones maintains that, contrary to the opinion of some observers, the adoption of neoliberal policies was not an inevitability; they were not necessarily the \\"right\\" policies for the challenges of the era, but instead found political power through an \\"unpredictable, patchy\\" process that had \\"luck and historical contingency\\" as central players. The left-leaning Carter administration and Callaghan government were the first to implement certain neoliberal policies, but neoliberalism would find its greatest impact with US president Ronald Reagan and British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, who would each successfully advance agendas of deregulation, tax cuts, and market liberalization. Jones argues that while these incremental policy changes did not require a wholesale acceptance of neoliberal philosophy, by the late 1980s that is exactly what had happened. Neoliberal ideas on the superiority of the market and individual liberty became widely accepted by politicians and academics, and Jones contends that this \\"boundless belief in markets and deregulation\\" ultimately led to the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. =First phase: Early history (1920‚Äì1950)= According to Jones, neoliberalism traces its earliest beginnings to the establishment of the Colloque Walter Lippmann in 1938. The Great Depression left the reputation of economic liberalism in tatters, and the scholars at the society sought to \\"reconstruct a theory of liberalism\\" because they believed that \\"classical liberalism was under assault\\". They called this reconstruction \\"neoliberalism\\" to signify that they were not simply accepting laissez-faire economics but were developing a new vision of economic liberalism. Ultimately, however, the ideas promoted at the colloquium did not take political hold, and at the outset of World War II the colloquium was largely forgotten. The destruction wrought by totalitarian regimes during World War II would, however, energize a number of liberal thinkers in their opposition to collectivism. From this fear of collectivism emerged the early influential neoliberal texts critiquing social democracy, and led to the formation of a new neoliberal organization by many of the same individuals present at the Colloque Walter Lippman: the Mont Pelerin Society. Mont Pelerin Society Trygve J. B. Hoff, editor of Farmand, (left) and Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises (middle) at the Mont Pelerin Society in 1947 Jones outlines how, after the catastrophes of World War II, Friedrich Hayek convened a group of intellectuals to combat the trend of increasing government intervention in the United Kingdom and the United States and \\"develop an organizational and intellectual strategy\\" to \\"defend the core tenets of...the freedom of the individual.\\" This group called itself the Mont Pelerin Society, after the venue of its first meeting in Vevey, Switzerland. The society set out to develop a neoliberal alternative to, on the one hand, the laissez-faire economic consensus that had collapsed with the Great Depression and, on the other, New Deal liberalism and British social democracy, collectivist trends which they believed posed a threat to individual freedom. A distinct neoliberal worldview, Jones contends, emerged \\"on the foundations of the critique of New Deal liberalism and social democracy\\" developed by the intellectuals of the Society. Jones finds three Mont Pelerin individuals particularly influential: Karl Popper, Ludwig von Mises, and Friedrich Hayek. Popper, in his book The Open Society and its Enemies, criticized thinkers from Plato to Karl Marx for valuing the collective over the individual and derided teleological historicism (a theory which holds that history unfolds inexorably according to universal laws) as a threat to individualism‚Äîwhich he believed underpins Western civilization‚Äîbecause it reduces the individual to \\"a cog in the machine\\" of history and empowers governments to engage in the sorts of \\"Utopian engineering\\" that has motivated communists, socialists, and Nazis. Mises, in his book Bureaucracy, argued the superiority of the private market motivated by profit over the bureaucratic management inherent in government. Hayek, in his book The Road to Serfdom, argued effective central planning was impossible because no individual or group could ever possess the requisite knowledge to direct the economic activity of millions of people. The early Mont Pelerin Society, Jones notes, had little effect on political policy. Instead, it acted as \\"a siren call, a warning about the tragic possibilities of moving in the direction\\" of greater collectivist government intervention \\"which Western politics, economy, and society seemed to be moving.\\" Importantly, Jones argues it helped to \\"create a transatlantic neoliberal network that would...combat the New Deal and social-democratic political establishments in Britain and the United States\\", \\"combat the forces of collectivism\\", and refine neoliberal thought into a workable set of policies. =Second phase: Emergence of a transatlantic neoliberal network (1950‚Äì1980)= Jones outlines how a transatlantic network of neoliberal intellectuals, businessmen, journalists, university departments, and think tanks arose between 1950 and 1980 and, building on the foundations of the critiques of New Deal liberalism and social democracy of the early neoliberals, refined and popularized neoliberal ideas to the point that \\"they eventually seemed the natural alternative to liberal or social democratic policies\\". This network would serve \\"almost like a kind of Neoliberal International\\" that would be highly influential in the later adoption of neoliberal policies by the governments of the United States and United Kingdom. During this time, the locus of neoliberal thought shifted from Europe to America, with the American economist Milton Friedman becoming its most influential proponent‚Äîits \\"beating heart\\", as Jones describes it. Neoliberalism, according to Jones, evolved from an attempt to find a middle way between laissez-faire capitalism and collectivism into a \\"faith in free markets\\", often articulating \\"individual liberty in apocalyptic terms as a struggle between free societies and communist totalitarianism\\". Neoliberals of the era emphasized the need to recover \\"lost truths\\" from classical liberalism, including the value of individual liberty, the invisible hand of the free market, and the virtues of limited government. By the 1960s, Jones contends, neoliberal thought had established a \\"distinct and coherent identity\\" centered around \\"individual liberty, free markets, spontaneous order, the price mechanism, competition, consumerism, deregulation, and rational self-interest\\". Additionally, during this period a body of policy prescriptions was injected into neoliberalism. Jones points to an early essay by Milton Friedman entitled \\"Neoliberalism and its Prospects\\" as a \\"bridge\\" between the first phase of neoliberal thought‚Äîdominated by European conerns‚Äîand the second phase, centered in the United States and concerned more with economic freedom and the superiority of markets. Jones considers the essay a \\"useful marker of the moment when neoliberalism became a self- conscious political and economic concept in the United States\\", as it was one of the first instances in which an American writer claimed the neoliberal moniker. In the essay Friedman makes a quintessentially first-phase argument for a \\"new faith\\" between collectivism, which he believed leads to an over- mighty state, and laissez-faire economics, which he believed fostered the development of over-mighty individuals. However, the essay marked a \\"symbolic cutting off point\\" in neoliberal thought, signifying the point in time when neoliberalism began to shift away from the early \\"middle way\\" arguments to a more strident belief in free markets. Friedman himself advocated a level of government intervention in the essay that he would never again publicly support. Academic thought According to Jones: \\"After 1945, a distinct neoliberal worldview was built on the foundations of the critique of New Deal liberalism and social democracy synthesized in the writings of Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek, and Karl Popper...Its main tenets‚Äîphilosophical, political, and economic‚Äîwere worked out in detail by scholars such as Milton Friedman, George Stigler, Gary Becker, James Buchanan, and Gordon Tullock, as well as Hayek and Mises.\\" Jones asserts that the Chicago school of economics, of which Friedman and Stigler were a part, was \\"perhaps the most influential group in terms of the development of transatlantic neoliberal politics\\". In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s Chicago economists published influential works arguing for free market policies and extending free market analyses into new regions (e.g. law and regulation). They painted a hostile portrait of trade unions and presented monopolies as mostly benign. The theories of regulatory capture, public choice theory, and rational choice theory all became influential to neoliberal thought, according to Jones, because they connected the market to politics and the public sector, and helped the neoliberal view of free markets seep into mainstream public and political consciousness. The economist George Stigler argued that government regulatory bodies often become captured by private industry, so that these bodies act in the interests of private corporations rather than in the public's interest‚Äîa notion known as \\"regulatory capture\\". James Buchanan and Gordon Tullock, considered the \\"fathers of public choice theory\\", emphasized the imperfections of political institutions and constitutional mechanisms, and argued voters have a tendency to vote their own interest rather than in the public interest. Milton Friedman and monetarism Milton Friedman Milton Friedman became a leading figure of neoliberal thought and a prominent public intellectual in the 1950s. An American, Friedman was less influenced by the effects of World War II and more by the subsequent Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. Jones argues that for neoliberals \\"the Cold War necessitated the unambiguous advocacy of the superiority of the market\\", and Friedman framed the \\"war of ideas\\" between socialism and free-market capitalism as a \\"life-or- death struggle.\\" Jones argues that \\"Friedman's significant contribution to neoliberal thought was his connection of economic freedom with political freedom\\", which he made in his popular book Capitalism and Freedom (which Jones describes as the \\"American Road to Serfdom\\"). Friedman argued that free markets and liberal democracy are inseparable, that the market guarantees basic political freedoms by ensuring that alternatives are always available (e.g. alternative employment options or alternative goods), guarantees equality by divorcing economic activities from anything unrelated to an individual's productivity, and protects dissent by separating economic power (i.e. the ability to make money) from political power (in other words, politicians cannot deprive an individual of employment if they express political dissent). Friedman consistently pointed out his view that \\"increases in economic freedom have gone hand in hand with increases in political and civil freedom and have led to increased prosperity; competitive capitalism and freedom have become inseparable\\", and pointed to countries like China under Deng Xiaoping and Chile to justify this. Jones notes that Friedman was a harsh critic of government intervention in the economy. A key point of Capitalism and Freedom, according to Jones, was outlining government failure, including in the areas of railroad regulation, labor law, monetary reform, agriculture, public housing, social security legislation, foreign aid, urban redevelopment, and income tax. In A Monetary History of the United States, Friedman blamed the Great Depression on overly tight monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. Friedman linked New Deal liberalism with socialism and communism, while he considered his own ideas as a part of the classical liberal family. Friedman's development of the macroeconomic theory of monetarism was particularly influential to neoliberalism. Jones argues that the Keynesian consensus that had dominated political thought in the United States and United Kingdom for decades had prioritized low unemployment over inflation. In contrast, by the 1950s neoliberal thinkers began to emphasize inflation. Friedman ultimately developed monetarism, a macroeconomic theory dealing with inflation and the supply of money that suggested that the Keynesian view that government can achieve full employment at the cost of limited inflation was incorrect and would lead to higher inflation in the long run. Friedman argued that governments and central banks, rather than focusing on employment, should focus on ensuring a constant and predictable level of monetary growth. Jones describes monetarism as \\"the most consistent, systematic, and significant alternative economic strategy to Keynesian demand management and fine-tuning\\". This, according to Jones, primed neoliberal theory for political acceptance in the United States and United Kingdom, who would experience persistent stagflation during the 1970s. Jones sums it up as such: \\"Friedman's monetarist analysis and market solutions grabbed people's attention as a ready-made and plausible alternative strategy [to Keynesianism] when the economy began to unravel [in the 1970s] under the weight of stagflation\\". Think tanks In Britain and the United States, the neoliberal right built a \\"dazzling array of think tanks\\", which became the preferred vehicle of neoliberal thinkers. Notable among these, according to Jones, were the American Enterprise Institute, the Foundation for Economic Education, the Institute of Economic Affairs, the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute, the Adam Smith Institute, and a group of think tanks emanating out of the Atlas Foundation, including the Fraser Institute, the Fisher Institute, and the Manhattan Institute. These think tanks brought politicians and businesspeople into contact with neoliberal ideas and thinkers and raised the public profile of free-market policies. In particular, the Heritage Foundation had a significant influence on US president Ronald Reagan‚Äîclaiming on its website that nearly two-thirds of the proposals they suggested to him in their policy guide Mandate for Leadership were implemented‚Äîwhile the Adam Smith Institute had appreciable sway with the Thatcher government. Jones notes that many of these institutes were funded by wealthy businessmen, such as Charles Koch and Joseph Coors. Relation to conservatism Free market economics has been associated with the political right, but Jones emphasizes that it is \\"but one branch\\" of it. In the United States, he argues that the right had a number of often-competing interests (principally traditionalism, anticommunism, and neoliberalism), but the \\"distinctive feature of the conservative revival in the 1950s and 1960s was the ability of its disparate elements to unite under the banners of anticommunism and states' rights\\"‚Äîa union that became known as \\"fusionism\\". This union, which Jones largely credits William F. Buckley Jr. for achieving, led to the growth of a conservative establishment that would, after decades of decline, rival its liberal opponents. This \\"pave[d] the way for the later electoral successes of Ronald Reagan\\", which would usher in neoliberal policies. =Third phase: Policy implementation (1980 onward)= Jones notes that there were two major issues facing the United States and the United Kingdom at the end of the 1960s: the instability of the Bretton Woods international monetary system and high inflation. As Jones describes it: \\"the late 1960s and early 1970s brought a succession of economic shocks that undermined the postwar international monetary system and pushed the world economy into stormy waters. The final stage in the shift in economic strategy in Britain and the United States, the reason neoliberal ideas found a receptive audience, was the force of these events.\\" The proposed neoliberal solutions of monetarism, deregulation, and trade union reform, as well as the wealth of neoliberal arguments against the prevailing Keynesian demand management, provided a \\"powerfully compelling logic\\", and neoliberal policies were soon adopted by British and American politicians. Yet these economic solutions acted as mere \\"Trojan horses for a more polemical neoliberal faith in free markets\\", which would come to dominate politics in the United States and the United Kingdom. left Neoliberal policies, according to Jones, were first introduced in the United States by Democratic president Jimmy Carter and in the United Kingdom by Labour prime minister James Callaghan. However, their approaches were examples of \\"governments of the left who accept[ed] the logic of the technical insights of Friedman and Stigler in terms of macroeconomic strategy or deregulation without also importing their neoliberal philosophies\\". It would be their successors, Ronald Reagan in the United States and Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom, who Jones argues embodied the neoliberal belief in the \\"supremacy of the free market\\". They would also have the greatest impact on neoliberal policy implementation, successfully advancing agendas of deregulation, lower taxes, and market liberalization. He emphasizes the importance of the transatlantic neoliberal network on Reagan and Thatcher, noting that \\"many of their most important advisers, government colleagues, and supporters were drawn from the transatlantic neoliberal network\\". Jimmy Carter and Paul Volcker Jones argues that the implementation of neoliberal policy in the United States began with US president Jimmy Carter, who Jones notes had been strongly influenced by neoliberal economist George Stigler. During the Carter presidency (1977‚Äì1981) the airline, trucking, and financial industries were deregulated. Jones suggests that \\"perhaps the single most important economic policy decision made by Carter was his appointment of Paul Volcker in August 1979 to replace [George William] Miller as chairman of the Federal Reserve\\". Volcker aggressively and successfully targeted inflation by raising interest rates, bringing inflation down from a high point of nearly 15% in 1980 to 3%. Ronald Reagan Ronald Reagan presidential portrait In 1981, Ronald Reagan became president of the United States. Jones argues that the Reagan administration \\"followed neoliberal principles influenced particularly by the ideas of Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, George Stigler, and Pat Buchanan\\". This can be seen in the four policy proposals Jones argues Reagan prioritized: # Increased deregulation and market liberalization # Tighter control of the money supply # Tax cuts # Cuts to public spending The administration lifted economic controls on oil, busted the air traffic controller's union and fired all the striking workers (in the United States most air traffic controllers are employed by the federal government), and implemented significant tax cuts, including reducing the top marginal tax rate from 70% to 28%. Jones argues that Reagan's tax cuts were motivated by arguments including the philosophy of limited government promoted by Friedman and other neoliberals; the idea developed by economist Arthur Laffer that tax revenue would increase as tax rates dropped because, as Jones summarized Laffer's argument, \\"more people would pay taxes and fewer would attempt tax avoidance\\"; and the belief that lower taxes lead to increased investment by the wealthy, which boosts economic growth and thereby benefits all members of society (a belief that would become known as trickle-down economics). Margaret Thatcher Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 1979, ushering in a broad range of supply-side reforms and monetarist macroeconomic policies. Jones contends that \\"the key early battle for the Conservative government had been driving through a tough slew of measures to bring the deficit under control and create the conditions for economic recovery in the famous budget of 1981\\". The government combined budget cuts with a \\"reorientation of the tax system to provide greater incentives for entrepreneurship\\". Monetarist policy had first been introduced by the Callaghan Labour government, which had instituted monetary targets and cash limits. Monetarist policy was continued under the Thatcher government. Jones places \\"the major differences, and the real departure in economic terms, between the Callaghan government and the Conservatives lay in their radicalization of microeconomic policy through various market-based supply-side reforms and their importation of market mechanisms into public service provision\\". Effects Jones believes that the \\"neoliberal contribution to the political changes of the last third of the twentieth century in Britain and the United States have been massive\\", and includes not only the considerable reforms that Reagan and Thatcher implemented but also the effects neoliberalism had on introducing \\"a new economic policy framework...[that] governed the policies and ambitions of Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, and Barack Obama\\". Neoliberalism resulted in a \\"broad breakdown of the characteristic mid-twentieth century belief in the efficacy and moral superiority of government and collective action\\" in favor of a belief in the efficacy of markets. Additionally, he notes that neoliberalism was extended into international development and trade through the structural adjustment policies of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization, which were dominated by neoliberal economists in the late 20th century. He argues that this ultimately had mixed effects: > \\"Some of the most powerful insights of [neoliberal] thinkers did help to > address pressing social and economic issues by increasing homeownership or > stabilizing persistently high inflation. But such successes were not so > numerous as to make the effect of transatlantic neoliberal politics anything > better than ambivalent...neoliberal policies tended to affect the most > vulnerable members of society in the harshest ways. During the last two > decades of the [20th] century, inequality (the gap between rich and poor), > poverty, and homelessness all increased. Unemployment seemingly disappeared > as a major problem in the immediate postwar years but returned with a > vengeance after the 1970s. Inflation...[was] cowed...by the uncompromising > policies of central bankers and pliant politicians in the early 1980s. In > Britain, unemployment and inflation returned during another deep recession > by the time Thatcher was forced from office in October 1990.\\" Furthermore, Jones believes that \\"the most important reason for the [2008] financial crisis was the direct result of neoliberal policies\\" of financial deregulation. He argues that the neoliberal \\"faith in markets had become divorced from reality\\", with crisis-level effects. Reception The book was a finalist for the Western Social Science Association's 2014 Presidents‚Äô Book Award and shortlisted for the 2012 Gladstone Prize. It has received mixed reviews. The Economist praised the book as a \\"bold biography of a great idea\\", describing it as a \\"novel and comprehensive history of neoliberalism\\" that, while \\"a little thin on character sketches and economics\\", is a \\"strong work\\" by a \\"fair and nuanced writer\\". James McAuley, writing in the magazine Prospect, claims that Jones \\"has produced an ideal kind of intellectual history‚Äîan investigation that shows that the reigning free market paradigm was not the inevitable end of progressive policy developments...it was instead a programme that was actively promoted by a network of intellectuals and institutions, and it depended on external political circumstances for its success\\". Alejandro Chafuen, former president of the Atlas Economic Research Foundation and member of the Mont Pelerin Society, writes in Forbes that he appreciates that the author's \\"lengthy exposition of the views shared by these outstanding economists (Friedman, Hayek, and Mises) might encourage many to pay attention to their works\\". Jennifer Burns, writing in The American Prospect, states that \\"Jones‚Äôs provocative if disconcerting argument deserves wide consideration. So does Masters of the Universe, which does much to help explain the aftermath of 2008 and the ways in which political responses that might have defined another era seem unthinkable in ours\\". Kirkus Reviews called it \\"a cerebral, pertinent exegesis on the thinking behind the rise of the New Right\\", though notes that it is \\"too scholarly for most general readers\\". Glenn C. Altschuler, writing in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, states that the author \\"draws on extensive archival research and interviews with politicians, policy-makers and intellectuals to provide a lucid, richly detailed examination of the evolution of the free-market ideology since the end of World War II\\". Scott Sumner, writing in the magazine Reason, calls the book \\"a balanced and informative study of neoliberal thinkers\\", however he believes that Jones, in his criticism of neoliberalism as prone to market fundamentalism, \\"misses the bigger picture for three reasons: He underestimates the extent to which neoliberalism was built on impressive economic research, he overstates the extent to which neoliberalism became associated with modern conservatism, and he overstates the neoliberals' opposition to government\\". Daniel Ben-Ami, writing in Financial Times, praised the book as \\"clearly written and relevant to a wide audience\\", noting it \\"incorporates a wealth of primary material\\", although he states Jones \\"fails to capture fully the failures or successes of neoliberal thought\\". Edward Nik- Khah, writing for the Economic History Association, calls it an \\"accessible introduction\\" to the intellectual history of neoliberalism, criticizing it only for \\"some of Jones‚Äôs framing choices\\" which \\"get in the way of understanding [the] complex history [of neoliberalism]\\". Paul Kelly, writing for the London School of Economics Review of Books, criticizes the book as being \\"overambitious\\", lamenting that \\"the connections between the various [neoliberal] thinkers are ambiguous, fortuitous or at best under explained\\" and stating that the book \\"sadly fails to deliver on its promise\\" of delivering \\"an analysis and critique of the dominant language of political economy of the last four decades ‚Äì neoliberalism\\"; he also criticizes the book for \\"assuming a polemical concept (neoliberalism) as an ideological unity\\". Kenneth Minogue, writing for The Wall Street Journal, claims that, while the book \\"has intelligent things to say\\", its \\"historical virtues are compromised by more adjectival attitudinizing than a chronicler of history should allow himself\\"; for instance, \\"free-market ideas are characterized as 'aggressive,' 'relentless' and 'uncritical,' culminating in the description of market enthusiasm as a 'holy grail' and the use of a variety of religious metaphors designed to suggest that it is irrational\\". Greg Kaza, writing in the Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics published by The Mises Institute, criticized the book for neglecting to include information from the archives of Ludwig von Mises and for selective reporting on the 1960s-era U.S. civil rights movement. The title has been criticized by Edward Nik-Khah, who notes that the book does not explicitly state who, exactly, the \\"masters of the universe\\" are.

Plot  Cry Baby wakes up hesitant for her first day at K-12 Sleepaway School. Realizing that her mother is passed out due to excessive drinking, she knows that she will have to walk to the bus stop. On the ride to school, she is bullied by the other students for having a gap between her teeth and sits next to her best friend Angelita (\\"Wheels on the Bus\\"). They are both revealed to have powers that turn their eyes completely black. The bus driver becomes distracted by the students who are misbehaving and swerves into a lake. Cry Baby and Angelita use their powers to lift the bus out of the water and into the sky, before landing it at the school. Cry Baby and Angelita arrive late to Ms. Daphne's class and are scolded by her. The students recite the rule about tardiness: \\"when the bell rings, you must be in your assigned seat\\". During class, a popular mean girl named Kelly becomes jealous of Cry Baby because she has been flirting with Kelly's boyfriend Brandon, so she writes a disturbing letter for Cry Baby saying \\"You at Recess\\" accompanied by a stick person and a tombstone. At naptime, Cry Baby shows Angelita the letter. Cry Baby expresses her worries that she has no chance at winning since she doesn't know how to fight, to which Angelita suggests that she uses her powers. Cry Baby refuses, stating that it would be cheating. At recess, Kelly begins punching Cry Baby and cuts her arm with a pocket knife, until Cry Baby levitates and attempts to strangle Kelly with her braids. Ms. Daphne soon sees what is happening and stops the fight, sending both of the girls to the principal's office (\\"Class Fight\\"). In the principal's office, the principal fires Ms. Harper for being transgender. Immediately after, Cry Baby finds out from a boy named Thomas that the principal forces the students to take pills in order to control them and stop them from leaving the school. Angered, she uses her powers to call him on the phone and insults him, calling him out on everything he has done wrong. The principal begins coughing after having a drink, implying that he was poisoned. In tears, Ms. Daphne orders the Bunny Doctors to cure him, which they do (\\"The Principal\\"). Cry Baby becomes a marionette puppet to entertain the students during show and tell until Ms. Penelope drops her, causing her to have a nosebleed and exposing her intestines, which grosses the students out (\\"Show & Tell\\"). Outside of the Nurse's Office, Angelita turns Cry Baby back into a human. The nurses attempt to keep them restrained and under control (\\"Nurse's Office\\") until an angelic spirit guide named Lilith frees Cry Baby and Angelita. She attacks the nurses and Bunny Doctors. During drama class, Cry Baby expresses her discomfort in being placed in a \\"domestic\\" role in the school play, instead wishing to play a strong role such as a film director or the President of the United States. The drama teacher, Mr. Cornwell, dismisses her concerns and calls in the guards to restrain her when she attempts to leave. Cry Baby is forced to play the role she was assigned, although the events take a turn when she presses a hot clothes iron to another student's face. She then warns the students in the auditorium that they are being brainwashed and uses her powers to defeat the guards and free the students. The students rush to the principal's office at Cry Baby's order and begin tearing him apart, killing him (\\"Drama Club\\"). Cry Baby and Angelita bury the body, then leave to play tennis with their friend Celeste. Due to a bubble blown by Cry Baby, the tennis ball floats away to a boy named Ben. Later on, Cry Baby is seen in a locker room preparing herself for swimming class. The film switches between scenes of her dancing with the other girls in her class and wearing a dress with a large skirt made of cake. She has a look of distress on her face as several boys begin to eat the cake (\\"Strawberry Shortcake\\"). Cry Baby then has a dream in which she is speaking to Lilith, telling her that she doesn't want to be part of this world. Cry Baby and Celeste notice that Angelita's skirt is stained with blood after she complains about \\"the worst stomach pain [she has] ever experienced\\". The three rush to the bathroom to cover it. During lunchtime in the cafeteria, Cry Baby meets a girl named Magnolia after separating herself from Kelly's clique, who didn't actually want to be her friends; they were only interested in gossiping and spreading rumors (\\"Lunchbox Friends\\"). Cry Baby and her friends soon discover that Fleur, a friend of Kelly, has the same abilities as them, and they set up a food fight in an attempt to separate her from the group. After seeing that Fleur is leaving with Kelly, Cry Baby follows her to the bathroom, where she realizes that Fleur is bulimic, likely partially due to pressure from Kelly to maintain a specific figure in order to remain friends with her (\\"Orange Juice\\"). Cry Baby tells Fleur that \\"everyone is deserving of love\\", and the two become friends. Leo, the principal's son, stops the food fight and asks who is responsible for the situation. Kelly informs him that Cry Baby was the one who started it, resulting in her being sent to detention. Her powers are mostly suppressed by the drugs given to her by a nurse until she manages to brainwash Leo and make him set her free (\\"Detention\\"). Ben slips a note into Cry Baby's locker, which contains an anonymous poem confessing his feelings to her. Leo then checks the security footage to see Cry Baby and her friends discussing a plan to take him down and destroy the school. In biology class, the teacher flirts with Angelita, who is flattered by his advances. The teacher uses his relationship with Angelita to trick her into ingesting a potion that causes her to shrink. Just as he is about to dissect her, Cry Baby enters the room and uses her abilities to throw him into the wall. She then turns Angelita back to her normal size, and the latter attacks the teacher with a knife, presumably killing him (\\"Teacher's Pet\\"). After a conversation with Angelita about their past lives and marijuana, Cry Baby sings about the requirements one must meet to be with her (\\"High School Sweethearts\\"). Ben is preparing to ask Cry Baby to the school dance when Leo bumps into him. He watches from behind a wall as Leo asks Cry Baby to the dance, to which she accepts while thinking \\"keep your friends close and your enemies closer\\". He claims to be the one who wrote the note. At the dance, Cry Baby realizes that she had messed up the plan to escape the school by accepting Leo's offer. Her friends express disappointment in her, and she storms off to the bathroom. A ghost appears in the mirror, telling Cry Baby not to beat herself up when she is mad at herself for ruining the plan. Leo makes an announcement to the students that he knew what Cry Baby had been planning, and forces all of the students to dance all night long. Cry Baby, who is disguised as a woman named Lorelai, seduces Leo and manages to lock him in a closet. She then frees everyone from the spell. She warns the students to leave the school, and all except Kelly flee downstairs to the exit (\\"Recess\\"). As Ben is trying to escape, he sees Cry Baby and follows her. When they meet, he confesses to her that he was the one who put the note in her locker. Together, they create a plan to use a bubble to make the school float away and disappear. Once this is done, they both jump out of the balcony to escape. After the school disappears, causing anyone still left inside to disappear with it, Cry Baby kisses Ben on the cheek. Lilith appears again with the gate to return home. Magnolia, Fleur, Celeste, and Ben are the first to leave. As Angelita is about to walk through the gate, she stops and asks Cry Baby if she's coming or not. Cry Baby looks back in shock, hinting at a sequel.

Her music is chiefly soul and R&B;, and includes elements of blues, rock, hip-hop and folk. Her songwriting ability has been described as \\"demonstrating a rare gift to portray raw, dynamic emotion in a way that moves the body as much as the spirit\\" Her influences include Whitney Houston and Tina Turner. Her debut extended play Seen It All was released on June 29, 2018. Early life Diamond was born in Little Rock, Arkansas to a fourteen-year-old mother and was raised by relatives in Memphis, Tennessee before living most of her teenage years and adulthood in Flint, Michigan. She ran away from home at age fourteen and spent time in the foster care system before getting emancipated at seventeen. Growing up she felt immense pressure to act masculine, despite knowing early on that she identified as a woman. She was inspired to become a singer by Tina Turner and worked on her skills while directing her church choir, where she was often chastised for singing too high. At age 20 she robbed a convenience store at gunpoint to pay for gender affirmation surgery. Diamond was in and out of men's correctional facilities in Michigan between 1999 and 2009. It was in prison that she wrote her song \\"I Am Her.\\" While incarcerated, Diamond faced discrimination specifically for her identity as a trans woman. She was kept in protective segregation and lost privileges often to keep her away from the male population. Humiliation, isolation, and misgendering were used as punishment. Career After watching a video of Diamond performing her song \\"I Am Her\\" a cappella at a Trans Lives Matter rally, pop songwriter Justin Tranter was so impressed by her \\"honesty\\" and raw vocal talent that he immediately got in contact with her and they began recording music together. Tranter went on to co-sign her to Asylum Records and executive produce and co- write her debut extended play Seen It All, released on June 29, 2018 through Asylum Records. Diamond covered \\"I'd Love to Change the World\\" by the English rock band Ten Years After for the 2017 television miniseries When We Rise. In December 2018 Diamond joined the Human Rights Campaign's Equality Rocks campaign. In February 2019 she was nominated for the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Music Artist. In 2019 her song \\"American Pie\\" was endorsed by 2020 United States presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg. In June 2019 she was a headliner for the Washington, DC Capital Pride Concert On June 7, 2019 Diamond released her single \\"Don't Shoot\\", a song that was described by Paper as containing \\"a message against America's ongoing gun violence epidemic while also being a reflection Diamond's experience [sic] as a Black trans woman who has been incarcerated and systemically discriminated against\\". Diamond's hand appeared on the originalcover of Sam Smith's upcoming third studio album, back when it was known as To Die For. She also appears in the music video for their song \\"I'm Ready\\" with Demi Lovato. Diamond's song \\"I Am America\\" provides the theme song for the HBO series We're Here.

Due to the NFL understanding television at an earlier time, they were able to surpass Major League Baseball in the 1960s as the most popular sport in the United States. NBC's coverage of the National Football League (which has aired under numerous program titles and formats) actually goes back to the beginnings of the network's relationship with the league in 1939, when its New York City flagship station, then known as W2XBS (now WNBC) aired the first televised professional football game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the now-defunct Brooklyn Dodgers football team. Even before this, in 1934, NBC Radio's Blue Network had carried the Detroit Lions' inaugural Thanksgiving game nationwide. Regular broadcasts of games began after World War II and the first NFL championship to be televised was the 1948 match between the Eagles and Cardinals. Year-by-year breakdown =1950= In 1950, the Los Angeles Rams and the Washington Redskins became the first NFL teams to have all of their games‚Äîhome and away‚Äîtelevised. In the same year, other teams made deals to have selected games telecast. The DuMont Network then paid a rights fee of US$75,000 to broadcast the 1951 NFL Championship Game across the entire nation. =1951= Locally and regionally televised games were broadcast as early as 1939, but on December 23, 1951, DuMont televised the first ever live, coast-to-coast professional football game, the NFL Championship Game between the Los Angeles Rams and Cleveland Browns. DuMont paid $75,000 for the rights to broadcast the game. From the 1951 thru the 1964 seasons, the Pro Bowl television rightsholders were the Los Angeles Newspaper Charities, as opposed to the National Football League. Since the 1965 season, the NFL has owned the telecast rights. =1952= In 1952, DuMont only aired New York Giants games before moving to a more national scope the following season. =1953= During the 1953Telecasts of complete professional games would not appear until 1953 on DuMont. NFL football on television, as we know it today, would have to wait for a decade, and the arrival of television- minded NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, before it made an impact on network television. and 1954 seasons, DuMont broadcast Saturday night NFL games. It was the first time that National Football League games were televised live, coast-to-coast, in prime time, for the entire season. This predated Monday Night Football on ABC by 17 years.ABC wasn't the first network to try football in prime time. In the early 1950s, the now-defunct DuMont network broadcast pro football on Saturday nights, but a lack of affiliates and interest killed the concept (not to mention DuMont). Several of the games in 1953 and 1954 originated in New York (Giants), Pittsburgh (Steelers), or Washington (Redskins). (All three of these cities had DuMont O&Os.;) In 1953, DuMont televised a Thanksgiving NFL game between the Detroit Lions and the Green Bay Packers. =1954= DuMont was nominated for Emmy Awards for its coverage of the 1953 and 1954 seasons but did not win. DuMont proved to be a less than ideal choice for a national broadcaster. The network had only eighteen primary affiliates in 1954, dwarfed by the 120 available to NBC (although a number of ABC, CBS, and NBC affiliates that had DuMont \\"secondary\\" affiliations did carry some NFL games, mainly on Sunday afternoons). Coverage of Canadian football's \\"Big Four\\" was more readily available on NBC than NFL games were in most markets on DuMont. =1955= In January 1955, DuMont obtained rights from the Los Angeles Newspaper Charities to cover the Pro Bowl only one week before the game date. As they had trouble lining up affiliates to cover the game on such short notice, the telecast was cancelled. By 1955, the DuMont network was beginning to crumble. For instance, in 1955, NBC replaced DuMont as the network for the NFL Championship Game, paying a rights fee of $100,000. ABC acquired the rights to the Thanksgiving game. Meanwhile, most teams (sans the Giants, Eagles and Steelers, who received regionalized coverage from DuMont) were left to fend for themselves in terms of TV coverage. DuMont ceased most entertainment programs (and a nightly newscast) in early April 1955. DuMont still broadcast some sports events (a Monday-night boxing show and the 1955 NFL season) until either August 1956,Aug 8, 1956 - On August 8, 1956, The DuMont network offered its final telecast: a boxing card. CBS inherits the rest of the Dumont/NFL football deal. or Thanksgiving 1957.Tober, Steve (November 20, 2017).Thanksgiving football games a disappearing tradition. NorthJersey.com. Retrieved November 21, 2017. \\"The ‚Äô57 Thanksgiving game at Foley Field was televised live and in color (both rarities in those early TV days) on Channel 5 via the old Dumont Television Network, which was under the leadership of Dr. Dumont, who - by the way - was a Montclair resident. Also, the late, great Chris Schenkel did the play by play.\\" Prior to the 1956 NFL season, DuMont sold its broadcast rights to CBS; for DuMont's last broadcast in 1957, a high school football state championship, it borrowed Chris Schenkel, CBS's announcer for New York Giants broadcasts at the time. By 1955, NBC became the television home to the NFL Championship Game, the precursor to the Super Bowl, paying US$100,000 to the league for the rights. The network had taken over the broadcast rights from the DuMont Television Network, which (as previously mentioned) had struggled to give the league a national audience (NBC's coverage of proto-Canadian Football League games from the year prior was more widely available at the time) and was on the brink of failure; the NFL's associations with NBC (as well as with CBS) proved to be a boost to the league's popularity. =1956= In August 1956, the DuMont Television Network, the NFL's primary television partner, ended network operations after years of decline. DuMont had already sold the rights to the NFL Championship to NBC in 1955, and when DuMont ended its regular season coverage, CBS acquired the rights. CBS' coverage began on September 30, 1956 (the first regular season broadcast was a game between the visiting Washington Redskins against the Pittsburgh Steelers), before the 1970 AFL‚ÄìNFL merger. Prior to 1968, CBS had an assigned crew for each NFL team. As a result, CBS became the first network to broadcast some NFL regular season games to selected television markets across the country. From 1970 until the end of the 1993 season, when Fox won the broadcast television contract to that particular conference, CBS aired NFL games from the National Football Conference. Since 1975, game coverage has been preceded by pre-game show The NFL Today, which features game previews, extensive analysis and interviews. CBS's first attempts to broadcast the NFL on television were notable for there being no broadcasting contract with the league as a whole. Instead, CBS had to strike deals with individual teams to broadcast games into the teams' own markets, many of which CBS had purchased from the moribund DuMont Television Network. Often the games would be broadcast with \\"split audio\\" ‚Äì that is, a game between two franchises would have the same picture in both teams' \\"networks\\" (the visiting team's home city and affiliates of the home team's \\"network\\" beyond a 75-mile radius of the home team's television market). Each team's \\"network\\" had different announcers (usually those working in their home markets). The New York Giants in particular were carried on the DuMont network, then CBS (airing locally on WCBS-TV, channel 2) in the early days of the NFL of the league's television broadcasts, when home games were blacked out within a 75-mile radius of New York City. Chris Schenkel was their play- by-play announcer in that early era when each team was assigned its own network voice on its regional telecasts. At the time, there were few if any true national telecasts until the NFL championship game, which was carried by NBC. Schenkel was joined by Jim McKay, later Johnny Lujack through the 1950s and the early 1960s. As Giants players retired to the broadcast booth in the early and 1960s, first Pat Summerall, then Frank Gifford took the color analyst slot next to Schenkel. As the 1970 merger of the NFL and AFL approached, CBS moved to a more generic announcer approach while Schenkel left to join ABC Sports. The Week 5 game between New York and Philadelphia in 1956 was a national telecast with the Giants crew (Chris Schenkel and Gene Kirby) calling the shots. The Week 13 game between the Washington Redskins and Baltimore Colts in 1956 was also a national telecast with the Washington voices (Arch McDonaldand Jim Gibbons) calling the game. The 1957 Pro Bowl was offered to NBC, then CBS. Both declined to carry the game. ABC was then offered to televise and accepted, but could not gain enough clearance of affiliates in time to make it a profitable venture. Thus they also dropped out and the game was not televised. =1957= Both NBC and CBS passed on the rights to the 1957 Pro Bowl. ABC apparently considered televising the game, but could not gain enough clearance of affiliates to make a telecast feasible. So for the third straight year, there was no telecast. When CBS televised a Week 1 game between the Bears and Green Bay Packers in 1957, it not only served as a rare occurrence of an away game shown on the Chicago CBS network, but an regular season NFL telecast shown in Chicago. This particular game (called by Red Grange and Bill Fay for the Chicago market and Ray Scott and Johnny Lujack for the Green Bay market) was the first official game ever played in the new City Stadium, which we now know as Lambeau Field. Also in Week 1 of the 1957 season, the Philadelphia-Los Angeles game not televised, so the Eagles crew of Byrum Saam and Jack Whitaker worked the Detroit-Baltimore game back to the Philadelphia region. Meanwhile, Jim McKay worked with Chris Schenkel for that week's New York-Cleveland game. Per the October 17, 1957 issue of Sports Illustrated, the Redskins-Cardinals game in Week 2 of the 1957 season was a virtual national telecast, seen everywhere except the West Coast and the Green Bay and Detroit networks. Arch McDonald and Jim Gibbons called the game for the Washington market while Joe Boland and Joe Foss called it for the Chicago market. Also per the November 4, 1957 issue of Sports Illustrated, the Chicago Bears-Los Angeles game was listed as not being televised. For the Thanksgiving Day game in 1957 between Green Bay and Detroit, Joe Boland and Bob Kelley worked the national audio feed. Meanwhile, Ray Scott and Johnny Lujack called the game for the Green Bay market and Van Patrick, Bob Reynolds and Les Bingaman called it for the Detroit market. One week later, the New York-Pittsburgh game was a national telecast, simply using the Giants on-air talent (Chris Schenkel and Jim McKay). The Week 13 game between Pittsburgh and the Chicago Cardinals was originally scheduled to be televised at least regionally, but with nothing at stake for this game and with the Detroit-San Francisco Western tiebreaker set for later in the day, this game was dropped from telecast. =1958= For 1958, Red Grange partnered with Bill Fay to do play-by-play on the CBS Chicago football network when the Bears were home. At this point, the Cleveland Browns were still a part of the syndicated Sports Network outside of the Cleveland region, which consisted of non-CBS affiliates. Leon Hart would join the Detroit Lions broadcast crew (consisting of Van Patrick and Bob Reynolds) for 1958. The Lions also simulcast the team of Patrick and Reynolds for radio and the CBS-TV Lions network. Per the November 3, 1958 issue of Sports Illustrated the Chicago Bears-Los Angeles game in Week 6 was not televised. For that year's Thanksgiving Day game between Green Bay and Detroit, three crews were used (a national feed and local audio feeds for the Green Bay and Detroit networks). On the coast-to- coast audio, Joe Boland and Chris Schenkel split play-by-play duties. Meanwhile, Ray Scott and George Connor called the game for the Green Bay market while Van Patrick, Bob Reynolds, and Leon Hart called the game for the Detroit market. The 1958 tiebreaker game between Cleveland and New York featured Chris Schenkel and Ken Coleman splitting a half of play-by-play with Johnny Lujack as color throughout. The 1958 NFL Championship Game, played at Yankee Stadium, between the Baltimore Colts and the New York Giants went into sudden death overtime. This game, since known as the \\"Greatest Game Ever Played\\", was seen by many throughout the country and is credited with increasing the popularity of professional football in the late 1950s and early 1960s. =1959= From 1956 to 1959, the Baltimore Colts, Pittsburgh Steelers and Philadelphia Eagles only had their away games telecast on CBS. When these three played at home, there was no need for the usage of split audio. Instead, the away team's telecasts were produced in a simple singular audio-video feed. In 1959, 1960 and 1961, NBC had the rights to televise Colts and Steelers home games. While the game broadcasts were blacked out (as per NFL policy) in those cities, they were available to other NBC-affiliated stations. The Chicago Bears and Chicago Cardinals only produced home telecasts for their vast network. Because of this, if the Bears played the Colts in Baltimore or the Cardinals visited Forbes Field to play the Steelers during this period, it was likely that the games were not televised by CBS (although from 1959 to 1961, they might have been shown by NBC). Meanwhile, the Cleveland Browns had their own network, part of Sports Network Incorporated (SNI) and Carling Beer. By 1959, big-market teams such as the Bears and Giants had all their games televised, but small-market ones like the Packers and 49ers still did not. Upon becoming NFL commissioner, Pete Rozelle worked to ensure that every team got all its games on TV. CBS had at least 11 teams under contract. The Cleveland Browns were still pretty much, the lone exception. CBS' broadcast of the New York-Los Angeles game (called by Chris Schenkel and Johnny Lujack) in Week 1, was a national telecast that was carried live. CBS would not dare preempt the ratings powerhouse that was Gunsmoke so the game started at approximately 11:15 p.m. Eastern Time. Meanwhile, the huge Chicago network carried only home games of the Cardinals and Bears. Thus Week 1's Bears- Packers game (called by Ray Scott and Tony Canadeo) was seen only on the Packers network (subject to blackout) and the Redskins-Cardinals game (called by Jim Gibbons and Eddie Gallaher for the Washington market and Joe Boland and Paul Christman for the Chicago market) was seen on the CBS Chicago network, which may have reached 40% of the country. The Eagles crew of Byrum Saam and Jack Whitaker worked that week's Detroit-Baltimore game for the New York and Philadelphia CBS networks. Finally, the Philadelphia-San Francisco game was seen only on the CBS Pacific network, thus only the 49ers commentators (Bob Fouts and Gordy Soltau) were heard. On October 11, 1959 during Week 3, NFL Commissioner Bert Bell, while in the stands for the Pittsburgh-Philadelphia game (with Joe Tucker on commentary), suffered a fatal heart attack. In Week 6 of the 1959 season, the full CBS Pacific network was tuned into the Chicago Bears-Los Angeles game (called by Bob Kelley and Elroy Hirsch). Due to the quirk that the Eagles did not televise home games and the Cardinals did not televise away games on their respective networks in 1959, the Philadelphia- Chicago Cardinals game in Week 8 was by design, not televised. CBS once again used three separate audio feeds for the Thanksgiving Day game in 1959. Joe Boland and Paul Christman, the Cardinals crew, worked the coast-to-coast feed, Ray Scott and Tony Canadeo were heard on the CBS Packers network, and Van Patrick and Bob Reynolds were used for the Lions CBS network (subject to blackout). The Detroit network also plugged into Week 10's San Francisco- Cleveland game (called by Bob Fouts and Gordy Soltau on CBS and Ken Coleman and Jimmy Dudley on Cleveland's syndicated network). The following week, the Packers' CBS network plugged into Pittsburgh-Chicago Bears game (called by Joe Tucker for the Pittsburgh market and Red Grange and George Connor for the Chicago market) while the Colts' CBS network plugged into Cleveland-New York game (called by Chris Schenkel and Johnny Lujack for CBS). For the final week of the 1959 regular season, the Packers' CBS network (again composed of Ray Scott and Tony Canadeo) plugged into Detroit-Chicago bears match-up (called by Van Patrick and Bob Reynolds for the Detroit market and Red Grange and George Connor for the Chicago market) while the Colts' CBS network plugged into New York-Washington game (called by Chris Schenkel and Johnny Lujack for the New York market and by Jim Gibbons and Eddie Gallaher for the Washington market).

Biography  Kay was born in the Richmond River area at Broadwater, New South Wales to a Minyangbal mother. At the age of ten, she was removed with her brother by the Aboriginal Protection Board to a home at Parramatta, in western Sydney. She then entered domestic service with a family called Arthur, for whom she worked from about 1918 until the late 1950s, firstly in Sydney, and from about 1930 in Queensland, at a station near Julia Creek. Kay received a bequest of ¬£50 at Mrs Arthur's death in 1948, and in the late 1950s, retired and bought a house at Tweed Heads, on the north coast of New South Wales. Kay located a bora ring near Tweed Heads, which she had been shown by relatives. It was overgrown and the mounds were being worn away. Kay cleared and restored it and a nearby traditional well. She successfully lobbied the Tweed Shire Council to have the area preserved; it was gazetted in 1961 as a Nature Reserve for \\"the Preservation of Aboriginal Relics\\", at a period when conserving Aboriginal sites was unusual. Kay led school students on conducted tours, explaining the history and significance of the site. In 1980, its management was taken over by the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, and it was declared a Historic Site. In 2011, on the 50th anniversary of the gazetting of the South Tweed Heads reserve (and coincidentally the 40th anniversary of the appointment of Neville Bonner, the first Aboriginal senator in Australia, who was born on nearby Ukerebagh Island), the Senate of Australia acknowledged Kay's work in conserving Aboriginal heritage, at a time when that was rare. Kay also collected Aboriginal artefacts, which she displayed in her home as an Aboriginal museum. Kay herself made coloured sand art in bottles, and crocheted, sewed, painted and drew. Late in her life, she took part in the opening ceremony of the Opal Hostel for Aborigines in Brisbane, giving Queensland governor Sir Henry Abel Smith an official gift. Kay had hypertension and diabetes for some years before her death from infectious hepatitis in Murwillumbah hospital on 5 November 1967. Although she died intestate, the Lower Tweed River Historical Society was able to purchase her artefacts. Some of Kay's works are held in the Minjungbal Resource Museum.

When the rival American Football League (AFL) began in 1960, it signed a 5-year television contract with ABC. This became the first ever cooperative television plan for professional football, through which the proceeds of the contract were divided equally among member clubs. ABC and the AFL also introduced moving, on-field cameras (as opposed to the fixed midfield cameras of CBS and the NFL), and were the first to have players \\"miked\\" during broadcast games. As the AFL also had players' names stitched on their jerseys, it was easier for both TV viewers and people at the games to tell who was who. As of the 1961 season, CBS held the rights to all but one of the NFL's teams; the Cleveland Browns had a separate contract with Sports Network Incorporated (SNI) to carry their games over a regional network. However, the Browns and SNI were forced to break their deal when the NFL and CBS devised their own revenue sharing plan after CBS agreed to telecast all regular season games for an annual fee of $4.65 million. A special antitrust exemption, the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961, was passed in Congress to accommodate the collective contract, which restricted what days the league could televise their games. CBS' fee later increased to $14.1 million per year in 1964, and $18.8 million per year in 1966. With NBC paying the AFL $36 million in 1965 to televise its games, and the intensified battle over college prospects, both leagues negotiated a merger agreement on June 8, 1966. Although they would not officially merge into one combined league until 1970, one of the conditions of the agreement was that the winners of each league's championship game would meet in a contest to determine the \\"world champion of football.\\" The first ever AFL-NFL World Championship Game was played on January 15, 1967 between the NFL champion Packers and the AFL champion Chiefs. As CBS held the rights to nationally televise NFL games and NBC had the rights to broadcast AFL matches, it was decided that both would cover that first game. The next three AFL-NFL World Championship Games, the initial Super Bowls, were then divided by the two networks: CBS broadcast Super Bowls II and IV while NBC covered III. Year-by-year breakdown =1960= NBC held individual team contracts with the Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Colts in 1959, 1960 and 1961. While the games were blacked out in Pittsburgh and Baltimore, they were broadcast on other NBC stations. In some cases, the game broadcast was seen on CBS in the visiting team's home region. NBC covered eleven games in 1960 and 13 games in 1961 in a \\"Game of the Week\\" format. NBC would take one week off due to its coverage of the World Series. During this era, NBC broadcast pre-recorded and edited hour-long broadcasts of NFL games in the off-season under the title Best of Pro Football. On June 9, 1960, the league signed a five-year television contract with ABC, which brought in revenues of approximately $2,125,000 per year for the entire league. The deal called for ABC to broadcast approximately 37 regular season games, the AFL Championship Game and the AFL All-Star Game. These games were typically broadcast regionally on 15 consecutive Sundays and on Thanksgiving Day. This became the first ever cooperative television plan for professional football, in which the proceeds of the contract were divided equally among member clubs; the National Football League would follow suit in 1961, a move that required Congress to pass the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961 to accommodate such collective broadcasting contracts. =1961= On April 5, 1961, NBC was awarded a two-year contract (1961‚Äì62) for the radio and television rights to the NFL Championship Game, paying US$615,000 annually for the rights ($300,000 of which was to go directly into the NFL Player Benefit Plan). On May 23, 1963, NBC was awarded exclusive network broadcast rights for the 1963 NFL Championship Game for $926,000. In 1961, then-CBS affiliate WISN-TV (channel 12, now an ABC affiliate) in Milwaukee opted not to carry that year's annual telecast of The Wizard of Oz, running a Green Bay Packers football game instead. In contrast to the infamous Heidi telecast in 1968, the popularity of The Wizard of Oz as an annual television event at that time was such that the station ran the movie locally at a later date. On September 17, 1961, CBS Sports broadcast the first remote 15-minute pre-game show, the first of its kind on network sports television; Pro Football Kickoff originated from NFL stadiums around the country with a comprehensive look at all the day's games. Hosted by Johnny Lujack, the program originated from NFL stadiums around the country with a comprehensive look at the day's games. This show was succeeded in 1962 and 1963 by NFL Kickoff, with Kyle Rote serving as its host. =1962= In 1962, the NFL followed the American Football League's (AFL) suit with its own revenue sharing plan after CBS agreed to telecast all regular season games for an annual fee of US$4.65 million. CBS also acquired the rights to the championship games for 1964 and 1965 for $1.8 million per game, on April 17, 1964. The Colts and Redskins had some sort of co-op arrangement for 1962. In this instance, for the Week 1 game between Los Angeles-Baltimore game was seen throughout the vast Redskins network that extended all the way to the Florida Keys. Meanwhile, the Washington-Dallas game was seen only on Channel 9 in the DC viewing area. The Colts network in 1962 consisted of about four stations; Baltimore, Salisbury, York, Pennsylvania, and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, the Redskins network covered DC, Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia, Alabama, Florida at least. For Week 3, the Detroit-Baltimore game was apparently seen on the full Colts/Redskins network. Meanwhile the St. Louis- Washington game seen only on the Cardinals network. The New York-Cleveland game on September 16, marked Pat Summerall's debut as an NFL game commentator. Summerall worked alongside Chris Schenkel for the New York market while Ken Coleman and Warren Lahr called the game for the Cleveland market. The Browns network plugged into the Pittsburgh-Washington game in Week 14. It used its own audio with Coleman and Lahr calling the game. Coleman had apparently taken the red-eye across the country after working the first half (Bob Fouts called the second half alongside color commentator Gordy Soltau) of the December 15 national telecast between the Browns and San Francisco 49ers in San Francisco. CBS executive vice president James T. Aubrey, Jr., who on May 9, 1963, warned the network's affiliates the high cost of rights for professional sports could price them off television, nevertheless in January 1964 agreed to pay $28.2 million to air National Football League games for two years, spanning 17 games each season. In an interview with The New York Times, Aubrey said regarding the package, \\"We know how much these games mean to the viewing audience, our affiliated stations, and the nation's advertisers\\". Along with obtaining the aforementioned rights to the NFL Championship Game, in April 1964, he agreed to extend the deal for another year for a total of $31.8 million. =1963= CBS executive vice president James T.

On November 24, 1963, just two days after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, the NFL played its normal schedule of games. Commissioner Pete Rozelle said about playing the games: \\"It has been traditional in sports for athletes to perform in times of great personal tragedy. Football was Mr. Kennedy's game. He thrived on competition.\\" No NFL games were telecast, since on the afternoon of the 22nd, just after the president had been pronounced dead, CBS President Frank Stanton ordered that all regular programming be pre-empted until after Kennedy was buried at his funeral procession. Normal programming, including the NFL, was replaced by non-stop news coverage, broadcast without commercials. Less than one hour prior to kickoff of the games in the Eastern Time Zone, Lee Harvey Oswald, who had been charged with Kennedy's assassination, was himself shot to death by Jack Ruby in the basement of the Dallas city jail as he was being transferred to the Dallas County jail. NBC televised the NFL Championship Game until 1963. The contract for the title game was separate than the regular season contracts held by CBS, which started televising NFL games in 1956. Prior to 1962, each team had its own individual television contract. (This was in contrast to the American Football League as well as established practice in college football, both of which forced all of their members to participate in a collective television contract. As the legality of such a collective contract was still in question at the time, and would eventually be declared illegal in 1984, the NFL did not pursue such a contract until Congress explicitly allowed for the NFL to do so, with conditions, in the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961.) =1964= In 1964, CBS experimented with a \\"half-and-half\\" format for their announcers. The first half of each telecast would be called by the home teams' commentators while the second half would be done by the visitors' commentators (this practice would later be revived decades later by the NFL Network when replaying preseason games that were broadcast by local stations as opposed to a national network). Also in 1964, CBS ditched the concept of using pooled video and split audio feeds. In 1962 and 1963, CBS would provide separate audio for a telecast (for instance, if the Green Bay Packers hosted the Chicago Bears, the telecast would have the same video, Chicago area viewers watching on WBBM-TV would hear Red Grange and George Connor call the action; meanwhile, viewers in Milwaukee and other parts of Wisconsin (Green Bay itself was blacked out) would hear Ray Scott and Tony Canadeo describe the game). Ray Scott was not a fan of the separate audio concept and temporarily left CBS for a job calling a regional slate of college football games for NBC. Ultimately, CBS dumped the four-man crew and resumed the 1962‚Äì63 method for the great majority of games in 1965, 1966 and 1967. On September 13, 1964, Frank Gifford began hosting the renamed NFL Report, which was subsequently retitled The NFL Today later that season. This version of The NFL Today was a 15-minute, regional sports program that presented interviews with NFL players and coaches, and news and features about the league. =1965= CBS' afternoon exhibition telecast of Dallas vs. San Francisco on August 21, 1965 was interrupted by coverage of the Gemini V blastoff, which resulted in a healthy amount of angry phone calls from fans. The game (called by John Roach, Frank Glieber, and Gordy Soltau) was subsequently broadcast on tape-delay basis the following afternoon in a number of cities due to the late start. The August 26 exhibition game between Baltimore-Cleveland game (called by Glieber and Pat Summerall) however was not tape-delayed. it was the nightcap of Art Modell's exhibition doubleheader that ran from 1962-71. On November 25, 1965 (Thanksgiving Day), CBS featured the first color broadcast of a regular-season NFL game, the traditional Thanksgiving Day game at Detroit. It was only the second time that the network's first color mobile unit had been used (it had been used a month earlier to cover the attempted launch of an Atlas-Agena, which was to have been the rendezvous target for the Gemini 6 space mission). Only a handful of games during the rest of the season were shown in color, along with the NFL Western Conference Playoff, the NFL Championship Game, the Playoff Bowl and the Pro Bowl. In 1966, most of the network's NFL games were broadcast in color, and by 1968, all of the network's NFL telecasts were in color. On December 29, 1965, CBS acquired the rights to the NFL regular season games in 1966 and 1967, with an option to extend the contract through 1968, for $18.8 million per year (in sharp contrast to the $14.1 million per year it paid for the rights in 1964). On February 14, 1966, the rights to the 1966 and 1967 NFL Championship Games (the Ice Bowl) were sold to CBS for $2 million per game. 1967 also marked the last year that CBS had separate commentator crews for each team for about 90% to 95% of their NFL games. =1966= In Week 11 of the 1966 season, the Philadelphia-San Francisco game was a regional telecast with a single audio feed. San Francisco play-by-play announcer Bob Fouts worked with Philadelphia analyst Tom Brookshier, while Chick Hearn was called in for CBS Control duty. For that year's Thanksgiving Day game, CBS aired a \\"day/twilight\\" doubleheader that were both in color. For the San Francisco- Detroit game, Van Patrick and Frank Gifford called the first half while Bob Fouts and Gifford worked the second half. For the Cleveland-Dallas game, Jack Buck and Pat Summerall were on the call for the first half, while Frank Glieber and Summerall announced the second half. Week 12's Green Bay-Minnesota game was the Sunday doubleheader telecast. Hal Scott called the first half, while Ray Scott called the second half. Tony Canadeo was the analyst for the full game and Jim Morse had CBS Control duties. For Week 12, St. Louis-Dallas was the main doubleheader game with Jack Buck and Eddie LeBaron working the first half and Jack Drees and LeBaron calling the second half. On December 13, 1966, the rights to the Super Bowl for four years were sold to CBS and NBC for $9.5 million. The first ever AFL-NFL World Championship Game was played on January 15, 1967. Because CBS held the rights to nationally televise NFL games and NBC had the rights to broadcast AFL games, it was decided by the newly merged league to have both of them cover that first game (the only other NFL game since to have been carried nationally on more than one network until December 29, 2007 New England Patriots-New York Giants game, which aired on NBC, CBS and the NFL Network). However, NBC was also forced to broadcast the game over CBS' feed and cameras (CBS received prerogative to use its feed and camera angles since the Coliseum was home to the NFL's Rams), while only CBS' cameras and technical crew were allowed to work the game, although NBC was allowed to use its own commentators. As a result, NBC's crew had little to no control over how the game was filmed. Each network used its own announcers: Ray Scott (doing play-by-play for the first half), Jack Whitaker (doing play- by-play for the second half) and Frank Gifford provided commentary on CBS; while Curt Gowdy and Paul Christman were did so for NBC. NBC did have some problems with the dual telecast; the network did not return in time from a halftime commercial break for the start of the second half. Therefore, the first kickoff was stopped by the game's officials and was redone once NBC returned to the broadcast. =1967= The first AFL-NFL World Championship Game was played on January 15, 1967. Because CBS held the rights to nationally televise NFL games and NBC had the rights to broadcast AFL games, it was decided by the newly merged league to have both of them cover that first game. Ray Scott, Jack Whitaker, Frank Gifford and Pat Summerall called the game for CBS. 39.9 million viewers would watch Bart Starr's performance in the game that earned him the MVP trophy. NBC did have some problems. The network did not return from a commercial break during halftime in time for the start of the second half; therefore, the first kickoff was stopped by the game's officials and was redone once NBC was back on the air. NBC was also forced to broadcast the game over CBS' feed and cameras (CBS received prerogative to use its feed and camera angles since the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum was home to the NFL's Rams). In other words, NBC's crew had little to no control over how the game was shot. The next three AFL-NFL World Championship Games, later renamed the Super Bowl, were then divided by the two networks: CBS televised Super Bowls II and IV while NBC covered Super Bowl III. During the week, tensions flared between the staffs of the two networks (longtime arch-rivals in American broadcasting), who each wanted to win the ratings war, to the point where a fence was built between the CBS and NBC trucks. Each network used its own announcers: Ray Scott (doing play-by-play for the first half), Jack Whitaker (doing play-by-play for the second half) and Frank Gifford provided commentary on CBS, while Curt Gowdy and Paul Christman were on NBC. While Rozelle allowed NBC to telecast the game, he decreed it would not be able to use its cameramen and technical personnel, instead forcing it to use the feed provided by CBS, since the Coliseum was home to the NFL's Rams. Super Bowl I was the only Super Bowl in history that was not a sellout in terms of attendance, despite a TV blackout in the Los Angeles area (at the time, NFL games were required to be blacked out in the market of origin, even if it was a neutral site game and if it sold out). Of the 94,000-seat capacity in the Coliseum, 33,000 went unsold. Days before the game, local newspapers printed editorials about what they viewed as a then-exorbitant $12 price for tickets, and wrote stories about how viewers could pull in the game from stations in surrounding markets such as Bakersfield, Santa Barbara and San Diego. In 1967, The NFL Today expanded to a 30-minute format preceding game coverage. Week 4 of the 1967 AFL season coincided with the race for the American League pennant. NBC decided to focus on their baseball coverage instead of covering the early games; thus resulting in Curt Gowdy calling the Twins-Red Sox game; Jim Simpson calling the Angels-Tigers game); while the AFL schedule resulted in the two early games (Broncos-Oilers and Dolphins-Jets games not being televised with another Chargers-Bills game being a locally televised game airing only in San Diego on then-NBC affiliate KOGO (now ABC affiliate KGTV). =1968= Super Bowl II was televised in the United States by CBS, with Ray Scott handling the play-by-play duties and color commentators Pat Summerall and Jack Kemp in the broadcast booth. Kemp was the first Super Bowl commentator who was still an active player (with Buffalo of the AFL) at the time of the broadcast. The CBS telecast of this game is considered lost; all that survives are in-game photos, most of which were shown in the January 8, 1969 edition of Sports Illustrated. Not even NFL Films, the league's official filmmaker, has a copy of the full game available; however, they do have game footage that they used for their game highlight film.http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000622357/article/the-mystery-of- the-super-bowl-i-tapeshttp://www.nflfilms.com/specialorders/twNFL.php Unlike the previous year's game, Super Bowl II was televised live on only one network, which has been the case for all subsequent Super Bowl games. While the Orange Bowl was sold out for the game, the NFL's unconditional blackout rules in place then prevented the live telecast from being shown in the Miami area. During the latter part of the second quarter, and again for three minutes of halftime, almost 80 percent of the country (with the exceptions of New York City, Cleveland, Philadelphia and much of the Northeast) lost the video feed of the CBS broadcast. CBS, who had paid $2.5 million for broadcast rights, blamed the glitch on a breakdown in AT&T; cable lines. The overnight Arbitron rating was 43.0, a slight increase from Super Bowl I's combined CBS- NBC rating of 42.2.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- BC/BC-1968/1968-01-22-BC.pdf When CBS decided to abandon its practice of using dedicated announcing crews for particular teams in 1968, the network instituted a semi-merit system in its place, with certain crews (such as Ray Scott and Paul Christman or Jack Buck and Pat Summerall) being assigned to each week's most prominent games regardless of the participating teams. One of the most remembered games on NBC was a 1968 game known as the Heidi Game. As its nationally televised game between the Oakland Raiders and New York Jets running late, the network discontinued coverage while the game was still playing to air the movie Heidi just moments after the Jets' Jim Turner kicked what appeared to be the game-winning field goal with 1:05 remaining. While millions of irate fans, missing the finale, jammed NBC's phone lines, the Raiders scored two touchdowns in eight seconds during the final minute to win 43‚Äì32. The reaction to The Heidi Game resulted in the AFL, and most other sports leagues, demanding thereafter that television networks broadcast all games to their conclusion. NFL contracts with the networks now require games to be shown in a team's market area to conclusion, regardless of the score. To avoid a repeat incident, a 1975 NBC broadcast of Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory was delayed until the completion of a Washington Redskins‚ÄìRaiders game. The network installed a new phone in the control room wired to a separate exchange, becoming known as the Heidi Phone, to prevent this situation from occurring in the future. On December 22, 1968, CBS interrupted coverage of a Western Conference championship game between the Minnesota Vikings and Baltimore Colts to show a broadcast from inside the Apollo 8 spacecraft, headed towards the moon (the first manned space mission to orbit the moon, and a major step towards the lunar landing the following July). The interruption began approximately three minutes before halftime of the game, and lasted 17 minutes. CBS showed highlights of the missed action (in which neither team scored) when the network returned to football coverage; nonetheless, the network received approximately 3,000 complaints after the game. =1969= The next three AFL-NFL World Championship Games, later renamed the Super Bowl, were then divided by the two networks (with each network broadcasting the game exclusviely): CBS broadcast Super Bowls II and IV while NBC covered III. When NBC Sports broadcast Super Bowl III, sports broadcasts were produced under the oversight of the NBC News division (this remained the case until well into the 1970s, long after both CBS and ABC had spun-off their sports operations into departments separate from their news divisions). Curt Gowdy handled the play-by-play duties and was joined by color commentators Al DeRogatis and Kyle Rote in the broadcast booth. Also helping with NBC's coverage were Jim Simpson (reporting from the sidelines) and Pat Summerall (helping conduct player interviews for the pregame show, along with Rote). In an interview later done with NFL Films, Gowdy called it the most memorable game he ever called because of its historical significance. While the Orange Bowl was sold out for the game, the live telecast was not shown in Miami due to both leagues' unconditional blackout rules at the time. This game is thought to be the earliest surviving Super Bowl game preserved on videotape in its entirety save for a portion of the Baltimore Colts' fourth quarter scoring drive. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, CBS used a marching band- like instrumental arrangement of the song \\"Confidence\\" (from Leon Carr's score for the 1964 off-Broadway musical The Secret Life of Walter Mitty) as the theme for their NFL broadcasts. With 1969 being the final season before the AFL‚ÄìNFL merger, this was also the final season where both leagues would have Thanksgiving doubleheaders. Starting in 1970, only two games would be played on Thanksgiving, with the Lions and Cowboys hosting those games, and an AFC team rotating as the visiting team between Detroit and Dallas every year.

An early bid by the league in 1964 to play on Friday nights was soundly defeated, with critics charging that such telecasts would damage the attendance at high school football games. Undaunted, Rozelle decided to experiment with the concept of playing on Monday night, scheduling the Green Bay Packers and Detroit Lions for a game on September 28, 1964. While the game was not televised, it drew a sellout crowd of 59,203 spectators to Tiger Stadium, the largest crowd ever to watch a professional football game in Detroit up to that point. Two years later, Rozelle would build on this success as the NFL began a four-year experiment of playing on Monday night, scheduling one game in prime time on CBS during the 1966 and 1967 seasons, and two contests during each of the next two years. NBC followed suit in 1968 and 1969 with games involving American Football League teams. During subsequent negotiations on a new television contract that would begin in 1970 (coinciding with a merger between the NFL and AFL), Rozelle concentrated on signing a weekly Monday night deal with one of the three major networks. After sensing reluctance from both NBC and CBS in disturbing their regular programming schedules, Rozelle spoke with ABC. Despite the network's status at the time as the lowest-rated of the three major broadcast networks, ABC was also reluctant to enter the risky venture. It was only after Rozelle used the threat of signing a deal with the independent Hughes Sports Network, an entity bankrolled by reclusive businessman Howard Hughes, did ABC sign a contract for the scheduled games. Speculation was that had Rozelle signed with Hughes, many ABC affiliates would have pre-empted the network's Monday lineup in favor of the games, severely damaging potential ratings. After the final contract for Monday Night Football was signed, ABC Sports producer Roone Arledge immediately saw possibilities for the new program. Setting out to create an entertainment \\"spectacle\\" as much as a simple sports broadcast, Arledge hired Chet Forte, who would serve as director of the program for over 22 years. Arledge also ordered twice the usual number of cameras to cover the game, expanded the regular two-man broadcasting booth to three, and used extensive graphic design within the show as well as instant replay. Year-by- year breakdown =1970= Super Bowl IV was broadcast in the United States by CBS with play-by-play announcer Jack Buck and color commentator Pat Summerall, with Frank Gifford and Jack Whitaker reporting from the winning and losing locker rooms, respectively. While the game was sold out at Tulane Stadium, the NFL's unconditional blackout rules in place then prohibited the live telecast from being shown in the New Orleans area. CBS erased the videotape a few days after the game; the same thing they did with Super Bowls I and II, which they broadcast. Videotape was expensive then and networks did not believe old games were worth saving. The only reason this game exists is because the CBC and the French version on Radio-Canada in Canada and in Qu√©bec carried the broadcast and because the Vikings were located so close to Canada and had a lot of Canadian and Qu√©bec fans (and Bud Grant was a legendary player and coach in the CFL), the CBC decided to save it for their archives. As previously mentioned, as videotape was too expensive in those days to save, they transferred the footage to black & white film (kinescope). This therefore, enabled them to reuse the videotape. In 1970, after the NFL and AFL completed their merger, NBC signed a contract with the league to broadcast games from the American Football Conference (AFC). Curt Gowdy, who had covered the first five seasons of the American Football League with broadcast partner Paul Christman on ABC, moved over to NBC in the fall of 1965. For the next decade, Gowdy was the lead play-by-play announcer for the network for both AFL football (AFC from 1970 onward) and Major League Baseball games; however, Gowdy also covered a wide range of sports, earning him the nickname of the \\"broadcaster of everything.\\" Besides Paul Christman, Curt Gowdy's other football broadcast partners were Kyle Rote, Al DeRogatis, Don Meredith, John Brodie and Merlin Olsen. Looking for a lightning rod to garner attention, Arledge hired controversial New York City sportscaster Howard Cosell as a commentator, along with veteran football play-by-play announcer Keith Jackson. Arledge had tried to lure Curt Gowdy and then Vin Scully to ABC for the MNF play-by-play role, but settled for Jackson after they proved unable to break their respective existing contracts with NBC Sports and the Los Angeles Dodgers. Jack Buck was also considered, but when Arledge assistant Chuck Howard telephoned Buck with the job offer, Buck refused to respond due to anger at his treatment by ABC during an earlier stint with the network. Arledge's original choice for the third member of the trio, Frank Gifford, was unavailable since he was still under contract to CBS Sports. However, Gifford suggested former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Don Meredith, setting the stage for years of fireworks between the often-pompous Cosell and the laid-back Meredith. On September 20, 1970, The NFL Today signed industry-pioneering women: Marjorie Margolies (who years later won election to the U.S. House from Pennsylvania in 1992 as Marjorie Margolies-Mezsvinsky), who produced and reported features and actress Carole Howey, who also reported for the program. Monday Night Football first aired on ABC on September 21, 1970, with a game between the New York Jets and the Browns in Cleveland. Advertisers were charged US$65,000 per minute by ABC during the clash, a cost that proved to be a bargain when the contest collected 33% of the viewing audience. The Browns defeated the Jets, 31-21 in a game which featured a 94-yard kickoff return for a touchdown by the Browns' Homer Jones and was punctuated when Billy Andrews intercepted Joe Namath late in the fourth quarter and returned it 25 yards for the clinching touchdown. However, Cleveland viewers saw different programming on WEWS-TV, because of the NFL's blackout rules of the time (this would apply for all games through the end of the 1972 season; beginning in 1973, home games could be televised if tickets were sold out 72 hours before kickoff). =1971= On January 17, 1971, NBC's telecast of Super Bowl V between the Baltimore Colts and Dallas Cowboys was viewed in an estimated 23,980,000 homes, the largest household audience ever for a one-day sports event. The game was called by play-by-play announcer Curt Gowdy and color commentator Kyle Rote. Although the Orange Bowl was sold out for the event, unconditional blackout rules in the NFL prohibited the live telecast from being shown in the Miami area on WSVN. The blackout was challenged in Miami-Dade District Court by attorney Ellis Rubin, and although the judge denied Rubin's request since he felt he did not have the power to overrule the NFL, he agreed with Rubin's argument that the blackout rule was unnecessary for the Super Bowl. The game was also the first Super Bowl to be carried live in the state of Alaska; thanks to NBC's then-parent company RCA acquiring the Alaska Communications System from the United States Air Force.http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1971/1971-01-18-BC.pdf The complete original broadcast, up until Chuck Howley's second interception, the first play of the fourth quarter exists, however the rest of the fourth quarter is missing from network vaults. Broadcast excerpts of the crucial fourth-quarter plays, recovered from the Canadian feed of NBC's original, do exist and circulate among collectors. (Two different NFL Films game compilations also cover the fourth quarter plays, in part.) By 1971, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) introduced the Prime Time Access Rule, which freed local network affiliates in the top 50 markets (in practice, the entire network) to take a half-hour of prime time from the networks on Mondays through Saturdays and one full hour on Sundays. Because nearly all affiliates found production costs for the FCC's intended goal of increased public affairs programming very high and the ratings (and by association, advertising revenues) low, making it mostly unprofitable, the FCC created an exception for network-authored news and public affairs. After a six-month hiatus in late 1971, CBS would find a prime place for 60 Minutes in a portion of that displaced time, 6:00 to 7:00 p.m. (Eastern; 5:00 to 6:00 Central Time) on Sundays, in January 1972.Madsen 15 This proved somewhat less than satisfactory, however, because in order to accommodate CBS' telecasts of late afternoon National Football League games, 60 Minutes went on hiatus during the fall from 1972 to 1975 (and the summer of 1972). This took place because football telecasts were protected contractually from interruptions in the wake of the infamous \\"Heidi Game\\" incident on NBC in November 1968. Due largely to CBS' live broadcast of NFL games, as well as other sports events aired by the network that run past their scheduled end time, 60 Minutes sometimes does not start until after 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time, with the program starting right after the conclusion of game coverage (however, on the West Coast, because the actual end of the live games is much earlier in the afternoon in comparison to the Eastern and Central Time Zones, 60 Minutes is always able to start at its normal 7:00 p.m. Pacific start time, leaving affiliates free to broadcast local newscasts, the CBS Evening News, and other local or syndicated programming leading up to 60 Minutes). The program's success has also led CBS Sports to schedule events leading into 60 Minutes and the rest of the network's primetime lineup, causing (again, except on the West Coast) the pre- emptions of the Sunday editions of the CBS Evening News and affiliates' local newscasts. In 1971, Frank Gifford became available after his contract with CBS Sports concluded; Arledge brought him to ABC to serve as play-by-play announcer, replacing Jackson (who returned to broadcasting college football for the network, which he continued to do for the next 35 seasons). The former New York Giant had been an NFL analyst for CBS during the 1960s but had never called play-by-play prior to joining Monday Night Football. In that capacity for Monday Night Football from 1971 to 1985, Gifford was often criticized for his see-no-evil approach in regard to discussing the NFL, earning him the dubious nickname \\"Faultless Frank.\\" Regardless, Gifford would have the longest tenure of any broadcaster on the show, lasting until 1998. Jack Whitaker and Pat Summerall took over hosting duties on The NFL Today from Gifford. Howard Cosell's abrasive personality gave him enough recognition to host a live variety show on ABC in the fall of 1975. That show is remembered today only as a trivia question, as its title, Saturday Night Live, prevented a new late- night sketch comedy program on NBC from using that title until the ABC show was canceled. That seeming popularity was in contrast to the repeated criticisms in the media, as well as bar room contests in which winners were allowed to throw a brick through a television image of Cosell. =1972= On January 16, 1972, the Dallas Cowboys defeated the Miami Dolphins 24‚Äì3 in Super Bowl VI in New Orleans. The CBS telecast had an estimated household viewership of 27,450,000 homes, the highest-rated single-day telecast ever at the time. Although Tulane Stadium was sold out for the game, unconditional blackout rules in the NFL prohibited the live telecast from being shown in the New Orleans market. This would be the last Super Bowl to be blacked out in the television market in which the game was played. The following year, the NFL allowed Super Bowl VII to be televised live in the host city (Los Angeles) when all tickets were sold. In 1973, the NFL changed its blackout policy to allow games to be broadcast in the home team's market if tickets are sold out 72 hours in advance (all Super Bowls since the second have sold out, as it is the main event on the NFL schedule, and there is high demand for Super Bowl tickets). =1973= On January 14, 1973, NBC's telecast of Super Bowl VII between the Miami Dolphins and Washington Redskins was watched by approximately 75 million viewers. NBC's telecast of Super Bowl IX between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Minnesota Vikings had an audience of approximately 78 million viewers. The game, called by Curt Gowdy and Al DeRogatis, was the first Super Bowl to be televised live in the city where it was being played. Despite the league's unconditional blackout rules that normally would have prohibited the live telecast from being shown locally, the NFL allowed the game to be telecast in the Los Angeles area on KNBC on an experimental basis when all tickets for the game were sold. The league then changed its blackout rules the following season to allow games sold out at least 72 hours in advance to be televised in the host market. No subsequent Super Bowl has ever been blacked out in the city it has been played in, since all of them have been sold out. In 1973, The NFL Today began originating from CBS' New York City studios; the program also began to include reports from stadiums around the country, however it continued to be pre-recorded before each week's game day. After beginning with critical acclaim, Don Meredith began to take his weekly assignments less seriously, while also beginning an acting career. By 1973, his motivation for the broadcasts seemed highly suspect, given incidents during a trio of contests. On October 29, Meredith was drinking during the Buffalo Bills-Kansas City Chiefs game, which was preceded one week earlier by his pre-game analysis of the Denver Broncos-Oakland Raiders game: \\"We're in the Mile High City and I sure am\\" ‚Äì a not-so-subtle reference to his use of marijuana at the time. Finally, during the Pittsburgh Steelers-Washington Redskins game on November 5, he referred to U.S. President Richard Nixon as \\"Tricky Dick\\". On November 4, 1973, local San Francisco CBS affiliate KPIX (now an owned-and-operated station of the network) experimented with a \\"simulcast\\" in which the station kept switching back and forth between the network's broadcasts of a San Francisco 49ers game (against the Detroit Lions) and an Oakland Raiders game (against the New York Giants) that were being played at the same time, with frequent cuts to studio host Barry Tompkins. The station received many complaints from viewers, however, and the experiment was not repeated. This resulted in the NFL instituting new rules for markets that had two teams, which basically state that teams televised in two markets must play their games at different times in the day or week, or one of the teams must be on the road, or the teams' games must be on different networks. (For example, an NFL schedule for a given week in markets with two team franchises might look like this: Oakland at Kansas City, 1:00 p.m.; New York Giants at Philadelphia, 1:00 p.m.; San Diego at San Francisco, 4:15 p.m.; and New England at New York Jets, 8:00 p.m.) On December 16, 1973, NBC cameras were there to cover O. J. Simpson as he rushed for 2,000 yards in one season. On that particular day, Simpson's Buffalo Bills would go on to beat the New York Jets at Shea Stadium. =1974= Super Bowl VIII was televised in the United States by CBS with play-by-play announcer Ray Scott and color commentators Pat Summerall and Bart Starr. This was Scott's final telecast for CBS. Midway through the following season Summerall would take Scott's place as the network's lead play-by-play announcer, holding that position through 1993, when CBS lost rights to the NFC television package to Fox. In 1974, CBS abandoned the pre-recorded NFL Today broadcast and its short-form wrap-up show, Pro Football Report, for a live, wraparound style program titled The NFL on CBS. It started a half-hour prior to kickoff of either the singleheader or doubleheader telecast (12:30, 1:30 or 3:30 p.m. Eastern Time). On September 15, 1974, the revamped program debuted with a new three-segment format: the first segment featured highlights of the day's games and commentary, special features shot during the week were broadcast during the second segment, and the third segment covered the day's sports news, including scores and highlights at halftime. The program's hosts were Jack Whitaker (who was brought into the studio after quite a few years serving as a play-by-play announcer for the network's NFL broadcasts) and Lee Leonard. The program broke ground in a number of ways: it was the first live pre-game show, the first to show halftime highlights of other games televised by CBS, and the first to wrap-up as a post-game show. CBS also began referring its stadium studios or its pre-game set, previously known as \\"CBS Control,\\" as the \\"CBS Sports Center\\". The program also no longer featured a third member of the on-air crew stationed at CBS Control to provide scores, halftime information and ‚Äì time permitting ‚Äì post-game interviews, a position often held by Dick Stockton during his early days at the network. Don Meredith would be absent from Monday Night Football for a broadcasting and acting career on rival NBC from 1974 to 1976. Fred Williamson, a former Kansas City Chiefs defensive back nicknamed \\"The Hammer\\" for his often-brutal hits, was selected by ABC to replace Meredith in 1974, but following a few pre-season broadcasts, proved so inarticulate that he was relieved of his duties prior to the start of the regular season, becoming the first MNF personality not to last an entire season (much less no part of the regular season at all). Williamson was replaced by fellow Gary, Indiana native Alex Karras, formerly of the Detroit Lions. The highlight of Williamson's MNF career was probably at the introductory press conference where he quipped that he was hired to \\"bring some color to the booth.\\" Karras made his debut on September 16, 1974 and immediately made an impact when he jokingly referred to Oakland Raiders' defensive lineman Otis Sistrunk as having attended \\"The University of Mars.\\" That would essentially be the high point of Karras' three-year tenure, with a developing movie career often distracting him from showing any improvement (in reality, Sistrunk did not attend any college but enlisted in the United States Marine Corps after high school and played semi-professional football before getting a tryout with the Raiders; the Raiders team guide listed his college alma mater as \\"U.S. Mars\\"). During the October 13, 1974, New Orleans Saints‚ÄìDenver Broncos game, the broadcasting duo of play-by-play announcer Don Criqui and color commentator Irv Cross was supplemented by the contributions of the first woman ever on an NFL telecast, Jane Chastain. While providing limited commentary, Chastain was used on an irregular basis over the rest of the season. =1975= Super Bowl IX was broadcast in the United States by NBC with play-by-play announcer Curt Gowdy and color commentators Al DeRogatis and Don Meredith. Charlie Jones served as the event's field reporter and covered the trophy presentation; while hosting the coverage was NBC News reporter Jack Perkins and Jeannie Morris (Morris, then the wife of former Chicago Bears wide receiver and WMAQ-TV sports anchor Johnny Morris) became the first woman to participate in Super Bowl coverage). Prior to the 1975 NFL season, NBC did not have a regular pregame show. In 1975, CBS debuted The NFL Today, a pre-game show originally hosted by journalist Brent Musburger and former NFL player Irv Cross, with former Miss America Phyllis George serving as one of the reporters. Jimmy Snyder, nicknamed \\"The Greek\\", joined the program in 1976. Snyder was dismissed by CBS Sports at the end of the 1987 season, one day after making comments about racial differences among NFL players on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day in January 1988. Phyllis George was replaced by Jayne Kennedy (who was crowned Miss Ohio USA in 1970) for the 1978 season, only for Kennedy to depart at the end of the following season. George would return in 1980 and stay on through the 1983 season; she was replaced by Charlsie Cantey. In 1979, the first year that the Sports Emmy Awards were awarded to sportscasts, The NFL Today was among the recipients. Meanwhile, NBC's first official NFL pre-game show, GrandStand, a program that doubled as a competing sports anthology series to ABC's Wide World of Sports during the off-season (GrandStand also served as the pre-game show for NBC's Major League Baseball Game of the Week during the 1976 season) premiered with hosts Jack Buck and Bryant Gumbel (who joined Buck sometime later in the season). Prior to 1975, NBC would air the political talk show Meet the Press in the NFL pre-game show's timeslot (12:30 p.m. Eastern Time). Also by 1975, CBS used several themes (technically, CBS had different opening songs and graphics per crew) to open their broadcasts, ranging from David Shire's \\"Manhattan Skyline\\" from the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack to \\"Fly, Robin, Fly\\" by the Silver Convention. Around this time, Electric Light Orchestra's \\"Fire on High\\" was also used as a lead-in to the broadcast. One of the trademarks of Monday Night Football is a music cue used during the opening teasers of each program, a Johnny Pearson- composition titled \\"Heavy Action\\", originally a KPM production library cue (and also used as the theme music for the BBC programme Superstars), which MNF began using in 1975. In 1975, because of NBC's coverage of Game 2 of the World Series between the Cincinnati Reds and Boston Red Sox, NBC's 1:00 p.m. NFL telecasts were cancelled. All games except for the New England Patriots- Cincinnati Bengals match were picked up by local stations in the markets of the visiting team. Meanwhile, at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, NBC aired a game between the Oakland Raiders and Kansas City Chiefs nationally. As the 1975 World Series progressed, NBC would advertise its upcoming weekend schedule during the breaks: As it turned out, no baseball was played that Sunday. Three days of rain in Boston forced Game 6 to be postponed until the following Tuesday, October 21, followed by Game 7 the next night. =1976= CBS' 1976 telecast of Super Bowl X between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Dallas Cowboys was viewed by an estimated 80 million people, the largest television audience in history at the time. CBS' telecast featured play-by-play announcer Pat Summerall (calling his first Super Bowl in that role) and color commentator Tom Brookshier. Towards the end of the game, Hank Stram took over for Brookshier, who had left the booth to head down to the locker room area to conduct the postgame interviews with the winning team. Hosting television coverage was The NFL Today crew of Brent Musburger; Irv Cross and Phyllis George. During this game, CBS began using Jack Trombey's \\"Horizontal Hold\\" as the theme music. That would be used the following season for the NFL Today pregame show between 1976 and 1980 in its original form, with a remake for 1981 followed by updates for 1984 and 1989 before its retirement. By this time, The NFL Today began the complex process of producing three separate live pre-game, halftime and postgame programs for 1:00 p.m., 2:00 p.m. (through 1981) and 4:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) games. Also for the first time, signature musical pieces are produced for NFL coverage. The show's signature theme was \\"Horizontal Hold,\\" a piece by Jan Stoeckart (recorded under his pseudonym of Jack Trombey). The NFL Today was among the recipients of the Sports Emmy Awards in its inaugural event in 1979. In 1976, Jack Buck left GrandStand in order to return to the booth as a play-by-play announcer, remaining with NBC. He was replaced as co-host by Lee Leonard. Leonard (who would later become a co-host of ESPN's SportsCenter) left the program in 1977, and was replaced by Mike Adamle and Regina Haskins as Gumbel's co-hosts. For the post-game show, GrandStand kept the Sperry NFL Report, although later incarnations of the post-game would be retitled the Budweiser NFL Report. On October 12, 1976, Commissioner Pete Rozelle negotiated contracts with the three television networks to televise all NFL regular-season and postseason games, as well as selected preseason games, for four years beginning with the 1978 season. ABC was awarded yearly rights to 16 Monday night games, four prime time games, the AFC-NFC Pro Bowl, and the Hall of Fame Games. CBS received the rights to all NFC regular season and postseason games (except those in the ABC package) and to Super Bowls XIV and XVI. NBC received the rights to all AFC regular season and postseason games (except those in the ABC package) and to Super Bowls XIII and XV. Industry sources considered it the largest single television package ever negotiated. =1977= On January 9, 1977, 81.9 million people (the largest audience ever for a sports event at that point) watched NBC's telecast of Super Bowl XI between the Oakland Raiders and Minnesota Vikings. Only three other television events prior to that time, all of which aired on all three commercial networks of the era (the funeral of President John F. Kennedy, the 1969 moonwalk of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin; and the 1974 resignation speech of President Richard M. Nixon), attracted more viewers than Super Bowl IX. The game was also the last broadcast that color commentator Don Meredith, who called the game with Gowdy, did for NBC, as he returned to ABC to rejoin the Monday Night Football crew for the 1977 season, where he had been a commentator from 1970‚Äì73. Bryant Gumbel and Lee Leonard with analyst John Brodie anchored NBC's pregame, halftime and postgame coverage. At the height of the disco fad, from 1977 to 1979, CBS used Meco's \\"Star Wars Theme/Cantina Band,\\" a disco arrangement of John Williams's theme from Star Wars, as a musical theme. In 1977, NBC dropped the GrandStand moniker in favor of NFL, which the title being paired with a year number that corresponded to the then- current NFL season (such as NFL '77 and NFL '78). Beginning with NFL '80, NBC would pioneer the use of the in-game highlight packages (\\"Let's go to New York for an NFL '80 update\\") NBC would use this particular method of titling their pregame show until the 1987 season. Meredith returned to the ABC booth in 1977, but seemed to lack the enthusiasm that had marked his first stint from 1970 to 1973. While the NFL moved to a 16-week schedule in 1978, Meredith was contractually obligated to work only 14 games, leaving Cosell and Gifford to work games as a duo or with newly retired Fran Tarkenton beginning in 1979. From 1977 to 1986, ABC also aired occasional NFL games on Thursday, Saturday and Sunday nights. Each of these telecasts would be billed by the network as a \\"Special Thursday/Saturday/Sunday Night Edition of Monday Night Football\\". On October 12, 1977, Commissioner Pete Rozelle negotiated contracts with the three television networks to televise all NFL regular season and postseason games, as well as select preseason games, for four years beginning with the 1978 season. ABC was awarded yearly rights to 16 Monday night games, four prime time games, the AFC-NFC Pro Bowl, and the Hall of Fame Games. CBS received the rights to all National Football Conference (NFC) regular season and postseason games (except those in the ABC package) and to Super Bowls XIV and XVI. NBC received the rights to all AFC regular-season and postseason games (except those in the ABC package) and to Super Bowls XIII and XV. Industry sources considered it the largest single television package ever negotiated. =1978= On January 15, 1978, the Dallas Cowboys defeated the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XII in front of the largest audience ever to watch a sporting event. CBS scored a 47.2/67 national household rating/share, the highest-rated Super Bowl to date. This game was the first Super Bowl to be played in prime time, was broadcast in the United States by CBS with play-by- play announcer Pat Summerall and color commentator Tom Brookshier. The game kicked off at 5:17 p.m. Central Standard Time. Hosting the coverage was The NFL Today hosts Brent Musburger; Irv Cross; Phyllis George (in the last game of her first stint on the NFL Today before leaving to host the short-lived People the following season). Also contributing were Hank Stram (who had recently been fired by the New Orleans Saints); Jimmy \\"The Greek\\" Snyder; Sonny Jurgensen (working on CBS Radio coverage); Gary Bender; Paul Hornung; Nick Buoniconti and Jack Whitaker. Buoniconti and Hornung served as sideline reporters; with Hornung doing postgame interviews in the Broncos' locker room; while Bender covered the trophy presentation in the Cowboy locker room. An interesting aspect was the use of what was called an Electronic Palette graphics system (created by CBS and Ampex) for a painting-like aspect to several visual graphics; such as the game intro, starting lineups and bumpers going into or coming out of a commercial break. CBS would also unveil what was known as the \\"Action Track\\"; showing the trail of a football that had been kicked during replays. Also, when the planned lead-in (the Phoenix Open golf tournament) was halted due to poor weather, CBS Sports president Robert Wussler (in New York) and producer Barry Frank (at the Superdome) ended up filling the time period with an impromptu look at how the game would be produced. As in their previous Super Bowl; CBS used the Frank Sinatra song \\"Winners\\" to play over the closing montage. Prior to 1978, Monday night games were not scheduled in the final week (Week 14) of the regular season. From 1974 to 1977, a Saturday night game was scheduled for Week 14 and televised live by ABC in lieu of a game on Monday night. One of the more somber contests in the run of the Monday Night Football series came on November 27, 1978 when the San Francisco 49ers hosted the Pittsburgh Steelers. Earlier in the day, San Francisco mayor George Moscone and City Supervisor Harvey Milk had been murdered at City Hall. Despite the complaints that followed, the NFL chose to play the game, a decision that mirrored the league's decision to play its scheduled games during the weekend following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy 15 years earlier. After the 1975 World Series, Curt Gowdy was removed from NBC's baseball telecasts, when sponsor Chrysler insisted on having Joe Garagiola (who served as a spokesman in many of the automotive manufacturer's commercials) be the lead play-by-play voice. Gowdy continued as NBC's lead NFL announcer through the 1978 season, with his final broadcast being the memorable Super Bowl XIII between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Dallas Cowboys. With NBC now anxious to promote Dick Enberg (who hosted NBC's pre- game and post-game coverage of Super Bowl XIII) to the lead NFL position, Gowdy moved over to CBS to call more football, as well as baseball on radio. =1979= NBC's January 21, 1979 telecast of Super Bowl XIII between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Dallas Cowboys was viewed in 35,090,000 households, by an estimated 96.6 million fans. The game ‚Äì called by Curt Gowdy on play-by- play, with Merlin Olsen and John Brodie on color commentary and Dick Enberg served as the pregame host for the broadcast with Bryant Gumbel and Mike Adamle as sideline reporters ‚Äì was Gowdy's seventh and final Super Bowl telecast, and his last major event for NBC before moving to CBS later in 1979. Enberg had essentially succeeded Gowdy as NBC's lead NFL play-by-play announcer in the 1978 regular season, and network producers did not decide until nearly the last minute which of them would conduct play-by-play for that year's Super Bowl. NBC preceded the game with the first network broadcast of Black Sunday, a 1977 film that depicts a terrorist attack on a fictitious Super Bowl game in the Orange Bowl between Pittsburgh and Dallas (and which utilized footage shot during Super Bowl X). The pregame festivities featured the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders and several military bands. The Colgate Thirteen performed the national anthem. The coin toss ceremony featured Pro Football Hall of Famer and longtime Chicago Bears owner/head coach George Halas. The opening Monday night contest of the 1979 season saw a poignant moment as former New England Patriots wide receiver Darryl Stingley was introduced to a sellout crowd at the Patriots' Schaefer Stadium. Stingley had been paralyzed in a preseason game the year before and was making his first visit to the stadium since the accident.

(29 September 1814 ‚Äì 31 March 1898) According to this information, they had only one child, George Bejamin [sic] Capper in 1842 was a writer and Orientalist, particularly noted for his association with Ceylon (present day Sri Lanka) and his editorship of The Times of Ceylon. History John Capper Capper was born in Lambeth, Surrey, London to Benjamin Pitts Capper (c. 1773 ‚Äì c. 1850) and Maria Margaret Capper, ne Bessell (c. 1780 ‚Äì c. 1844) Capper joined the coffee wholesale business of Acland & Boyd, by whom in 1837 he was sent to Ceylon to manage the company's cinnamon and coconut oil interests, and where he oversaw the clearing of much native vegetation for the establishment of new coffee plantations. Capper had some journalistic experience as co-editor of The Mining and Steam Navigation Gazette, and founded The Ceylon Magazine, which ran from 1840 to 1842. It was a serious, scholarly magazine, which served to bring together a group of like-minded individuals who in 1845 formed the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, with Capper as treasurer. When the Ceylon Examiner was founded on 7 September 1846, Bessell was its editor and Capper the chief contributor. 1847 saw the collapse of the coffee market, and Acland & Boyd suspended operations. Capper returned to London, where he threw himself into journalistic activity: he wrote articles on Ceylon for Charles Dickens' Household Words (uncredited, as was Dickens' custom), and The Emigrant's Guide to Australia chiefly aimed at hopeful diggers, the Australian gold rush then being in full swing. Next came The Three Presidencies of India: A History of the Rise and Progress of the British Indian Possessions, which enjoyed a considerable market and praise from critics. A few more books of advice to the prospective emigrant \\"down under\\" followed, then his first about Ceylon, Pictures from the East, with illustrations by J. L. K. van Dort. He would collaborate with van Dort again, in The Duke of Edinburgh in Ceylon, a record of Prince Alfred's 1870 tour of the island. During the ten years Capper was in London, he also served as sub- editor of The Globe. Capper returned to Ceylon in 1858, and purchased the twice-weekly Ceylon Times, which he edited with considerable skill and effort but little financial return until 1874, when he sold the newspaper. Capper, now an establishment figure, had unofficial membership of Ceylon‚Äôs Legislative Council. On 15 November 1864, he and five other unofficial members ‚Äî two British and three Ceylonese ‚Äî resigned in protest at the Government's stringent fiscal policies, and in 1865 formed the Ceylon League, which acted as a thorn in the side of the newly-appointed Sir Hercules Robinson's government. In 1874 he sold the Ceylon Times, left the island, and was involved in promoting the tea industry. In the meantime, The Ceylon Times had become moribund and been liquidated. In 1882 he returned to Ceylon, and with his sons Frank Augustus Capper and Herbert Henry Capper revived it as The Times of Ceylon, an evening daily, which became the island's leading English- language newspaper. Capper died in Fulham, Middlesex, England, aged 83 years. Selected publications *The Emigrant's Guide to Australia, mostly concerned the goldfields of New South Wales and Victoria.

He was also a gem cutter. Biography Born on a farm in Ingham County, Michigan, Burton Longyear moved, at the age of 18, with his parents and brother to Mason, Michigan, the county seat of Ingham County. He clerked in a pharmacy owned by his brother and eventually became a registered pharmacist. In 1890 he enrolled to study botany and chemistry at the State Agricultural College of Michigan, which was renamed Michigan Agricultural College in 1909 and Michigan State University in 1964. At the State Agricultural College, he became in 1893 an instructor of botany and later was employed there for two years as United States Experiment Station Botanist. As a special student at the State Agricultural College, he graduated with a bachelor of science degree in 1903. In 1904 he became an instructor in botany and horticulture at Colorado Agricultural College (CAC), which was renamed Colorado State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts in 1935 and Colorado State University in 1957. In 1909 he became head of the newly established department of botany and forestry at CAC. From 1912 to 1915 he served as State Forester of Colorado (a newly created position) but then returned to teaching botany. At CAC he became am associate professor of forestry and held that position until he retired in 1936. He received a master's degree in forestry from Michigan Agricultural College in 1925. During his career he published many bulletins and articles. On 29 December 1897 Burton O. Longyear married Jessie L. Bond (1870‚Äì1953). They had several children.

An Ausburger (external citizen or \\"outburgher\\") was a citizen of an imperial free city who resided on a rural estate outside of the city's jurisdiction. A Pfahlburger (pale citizen) was a citizen of a free city who lived in the faubourg (suburbs) outside of the city's jurisdiction. Both claimed citizenship and its rights while being vassals of and living under the jurisdiction of territorial lords. The distinction between them was their distance from the city of which they claimed citizenship. According to M. I. Schmidt, the Pfahlburgers claimed to be exempt from the taxation of their lords, while the Ausburgers did not claim an exemption. According to F.-J. Fuchs, Ausburger may have been a general term that included the more specific Pfahlburger. The term Pfahlburger refers to the Pfahl (picket or palisade) that enclosed the suburbs but lay beyond the city walls. The \\"burgesses of the palisades\\" were men who had moved into the suburbs to escape the authority of their lords and obtain the protection of the city. Cities were generally willing to grant full or partial citizenship to such persons, but the lords strongly objected to this practice, since the area between the palisades and the walls lay \\"outside the more closely defined legal boundaries of the municipality\\". In 1205, King Philip exempted from taxes the lands owned by the citizens of Strasbourg in Alsace. This caused a rush of Alsatian landowners seeking citizenship in Strasbourg. The Emperor Frederick II (1220‚Äì50) tried in vain to ban the practice of cities granting citizenship to non-residents. According to the Annales Wormatienses, on 10 November 1255, King William \\"eliminated the rights of citizens who are called Pfahlb√ºrger so that among other restrictions, none of the cities were permitted to have them or receive them\\". A later scribe added a gloss to the Annales to clarify that the Pfahlburgers \\"were citizens who were not resident in the city\\". At a Hoftag (diet) in Metz in 1356, Jean de Lichtenberg, the bishop of Strasbourg and lord of Lichtenberg, complained about the practice to the Emperor Charles IV, who forbade it in the Golden Bull of 1356, a foundation constitutional document of the later empire. The distinction between Ausburger and Pfahlburger may post-date 1365, since only the Pfahlburger is mentioned in the Golden Bull. The term Ausburger, which had until then had referred only to land-owning noblemen who also held citizenship, may have been extended after 1356 to cover peasant Pfahlburger so as to evade Charles' prohibition. In 1430, King Sigismund banned the city of Constance from having Ausburgers, but he lifted the ban in 1436.

Year-by-year breakdown =1980= CBS televised Super Bowl XIV in the United States with play-by-play announcer Pat Summerall and color commentator Tom Brookshier. One of the guest analysts for the network's studio pregame show was former Oakland Raiders coach John Madden; he impressed CBS executives so much that he replaced Brookshier as lead game analyst in 1981. CBS Radio coverage featured Jack Buck and Hank Stram; with Brent Musburger working both radio and television coverage (hosting the Super Bowl Today pregame show and the Vince Lombardi Trophy presentation).Sports Illustrated, January 14, 1980, page 5. Joining Musburger on CBS' pregame coverage was the NFL Today crew of Irv Cross (who joined Musburger in the Pittsburgh Steelers locker room), Jayne Kennedy (the only Super Bowl she would be part of covering for CBS), Jimmy \\"The Greek\\" Snyder and Jack Whitaker; with George Allen as a second guest analyst; while filing remote reports from bars in the respect team's home markets were Paul Hornung in The Ginger Man in Beverly Hills (briefly joined by Jayne Kennedy's NFL Today predecessor Phyllis George and her then-husband, newly-inaugurated Kentucky Governor John Y. Brown Jr. along with Houston Oilers quarterback Dan Pastorini) and Tim Ryan at the LeMont Restaurant in Pittsburgh (which included a brief shot of the newly-redesigned Pittsburgh Penguins logo and uniform); while Dick Stockton handled the Los Angeles Rams locker room interviews. Television ratings in 1980 were the second-best in NFL history, trailing only the combined ratings of the 1976 season. All three networks posted gains, and NBC's 15.0 rating was its best ever. NFL broadcasts on CBS and ABC had their best ratings since 1977, with 15.3 and 20.8 ratings, respectively. Starting with the 1980 season, CBS frequently used the beginning guitar riff of Heart's \\"Crazy on You\\" for commercial break tosses. During the 1980 season, Monday Night Football continued its tradition of featuring notable guests during the half-time show, from a variety of different industries and backgrounds. During a Thursday Night Football special in Houston, 2 days after Ronald Reagan was elected to the White House, Vice-President elect George H.W. Bush was interviewed in the broadcast booth at halftime. Prior to the election, none of the candidates were invited on the program due to equal time regulations governing appearances during campaigns. Later that same season in Southern California, movie star Bo Derek, well known for her role in the movie \\"Ten\\", was the half-time guest and was interviewed by Howard Cosell. Some of the production crew teasingly referred to the segment as \\"The Beauty and the Beast\\". 1980 also marked some key personnel moves for the top-rated ABC show. It was the first season of Monday Night Football produced by Bob Goodrich, who would lead the production team for another 6 years. In addition, 1980 was the first year a woman joined the traveling production crew of over 40 cameramen, engineers, producers and directors. Alexis Denny, then a sophomore at Yale University, served as the stage manager of the telecasts and wrote the script for the half-time highlights that Howard Cosell would voice over in a style for which he was known throughout his career. One of the most remembered moments in Monday Night Football history occurred on December 8, 1980, yet had nothing to do with the game or football in general. During a game between the Miami Dolphins and New England Patriots, Howard Cosell broke the news of famed Beatle John Lennon's assassination, news that stunned a nationwide audience. In 1974, Lennon had appeared in the Monday Night Football broadcast booth and was briefly interviewed by Cosell. =1981= Super Bowl XV was broadcast in the United States by NBC, with Dick Enberg handling the play-by-play duties (Enberg's first Super Bowl in that role) and Merlin Olsen serving as color analyst. (John Brodie and Len Dawson, in a separate broadcast booth, also provided occasional analysis during the game.) Bryant Gumbel and Mike Adamle of NFL '80 anchored the pregame, halftime, and postgame coverage. Also taking part on NBC's coverage of the game were Pete Axthelm and Bob Trumpy. Like the game two years before, NBC used the same custom, synthesizer-heavy theme in place of their regular music. This game would also be the first Super Bowl to air with closed captioning for the hearing impaired. CHiPs was broadcast after the game, representing the Super Bowl lead-out program. Toward the end of NBC's coverage, a montage of the game, the arrival of the hostages following their release, and the inauguration of Ronald Reagan as the 40th President of the United States aired to the tune of \\"Celebration\\" by Kool & the Gang. In 1981, ABC and CBS set all-time ratings highs, with ABC finishing the season with a 21.7 rating and CBS with a 17.5 rating; NBC was down slightly to 13.9. On October 18, 1981, Game 5 of the National League Championship Series between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Montreal Expos, which was supposed to be televised on NBC that Sunday afternoon, was postponed due to snow. The cancellation of that game allowed CBS to achieve record breaking television viewership levels for a regular-season professional football broadcast. It was rated as the most watched afternoon of regular-season NFL football broadcasts on a single network in television history. In 1981, CBS introduced a new opening theme for the NFL games, a peppy, fanfare-styled theme that remained in use until partway through the 1986 season. The patriotic-style opening title sequence showed the Stars and Stripes of the U.S. flag morphing into the words \\"National Football League.\\" That same year, CBS Sports standardized its on- screen graphics for all of its telecasts; prior to this, each director in charge for each game used a different look. For the network's coverage of Super Bowl XVI at the end of that season, CBS' theme music eventually became the theme for CBS Sports Saturday/Sunday. The music itself, could be considered a hybrid of the theme used for The NFL Today at the time and the original theme for its college basketball broadcast; CBS would use this particular theme again at least for the NFC Championship Game at the end of the 1982 season. Going into the 1981 NFL season, CBS Sports executives decided that John Madden, who had joined the network in 1979 and had worked with Frank Glieber and Gary Bender (Pat Summerall and Madden were first teamed on a November 25, 1979 broadcast of a Minnesota Vikings‚ÄìTampa Bay Buccaneers game) in his first two years, was going to be their star NFL color commentator ‚Äì however, they had trouble figuring out who was going to be his play-by-play partner. At the time CBS had reshuffled their #1 team lineup as Summerall's longtime broadcast partner Tom Brookshier was moved into a play-by-play role (teamed with former Detroit Lions legend Wayne Walker, at the time the sports director for CBS affiliate KPIX), and it was not immediately clear if Summerall was going to keep his position or if #2 play-by-play man Vin Scully, whose contract was nearing expiration, was going to be promoted to take over. CBS elected to give both Summerall and Scully chances to work with Madden. Scully worked with Madden for four games in September while Summerall was busy covering the U.S. Open tennis tournament for CBS. Summerall then worked with Madden for four October games as Scully called Major League Baseball's National League Championship Series and World Series for the Los Angeles Dodgers Radio Network and CBS Radio respectively. After the eighth week of the NFL season, CBS Sports executives decided that the laconic, baritone-voiced Summerall's style was more in tune with the lively, verbose Madden than the elegant, poetic Scully. As a consolation prize, CBS Sports gave Scully the \\"B\\" team assignment and the right to call the NFC Championship Game telecast with Hank Stram. Meanwhile, Pat Summerall called that game on CBS Radio with Jack Buck while John Madden prepared to do the Super Bowl XVI with Summerall in Pontiac, Michigan. Vin Scully reportedly was not happy about the demotion as well as (in his eyes) having his intelligence be insulted (at least, according to CBS Sports producer Terry O'Neil in the book The Game Behind the Game). As a result, Scully bolted to NBC (where he started a seven-year run as their lead Major League Baseball announcer) as soon as his contract with CBS was up. In 1981, ABC and CBS set all-time rating highs. ABC finished with a 21.7 rating and CBS with a 17.5 rating. NBC however, was down slightly to 13.9; this was, at the time, the nadir of the Fred Silverman era, when ratings for the network were down across the board. =1982= The NFL's television contract renewal in 1982 also put ABC in the Super Bowl rotation for the first time, giving it the broadcast rights to Super Bowl XIX in 1985. A second renewal of the television contract gave them the rights to Super Bowl XXII in 1988. NBC's national Nielsen rating of 48.6 for Super Bowl XVII was the second-highest for a Super Bowl broadcast, trailing only the 49.1 garnered by Super Bowl XVI on CBS the year before. Following the game, NBC aired the premiere episode of The A-Team, beginning the tradition of the game's host network airing programming after the game. On January 24, 1982, CBS Sports' broadcast of Super Bowl XVI ‚Äì in which the San Francisco 49ers (led by quarterback Joe Montana) defeated the Cincinnati Bengals, 26‚Äì21 ‚Äì became the highest rated Super Bowl of all time, with a 49.1 rating/73 share. Pat Summerall and John Madden called their first Super Bowl together as they went on to become one of the most popular NFL announcing teams ever. During the Super Bowl XVI telecast, the telestrator made its major network debut, which the network introduced as the \\"CBS Chalkboard\\" during their sports coverage. Madden utilized the device effectively to diagram football plays on-air to viewers. The telestrator is generally credited with popularizing the use of \\"telestration\\" during sports commentary. Hosting coverage for The Super Bowl Today pregame (90 minutes), halftime, and postgame shows was the NFL Today crew of Brent Musburger; Irv Cross; Phyllis George and Jimmy \\"The Greek\\" Snyder, with studio analysis from Terry Bradshaw and Roger Staubach. CBS, for this game, used the theme for the CBS Sports Saturday/Sunday for the intro (CBS had aired a special CBS Sports Sunday prior to the beginning of Super Bowl XVI coverage). This Super Bowl was simulcast in Canada on the CTV Television Network, which was airing the Super Bowl for the first time. The game was one of the most watched broadcasts in American television history, with more than 85 million viewers. The final national Nielsen rating was a 49.1 (a 73 share), which is still a Super Bowl record, and ranks second to the final episode of M*A*S*H in 1983 among television broadcasts in general. (Super Bowl XLV holds the record for total U.S. viewership, with an average audience of 111 million, but only earned a rating of 46.0 and a 69 share). In 1982, the NFL signed a five-year contract with the three television networks (ABC, CBS and NBC) to televise all NFL regular season and postseason games starting with the 1982 season. By this particular time, CBS decided that instead of using the regular CBS Sports typeface of that period (a variant of Franklin Gothic), that it would instead use the Serifa typeface that began to be used a few months earlier on CBS News programs for their title graphics and lower-thirds. During the 1982 season, the NFL allowed CBS to rebroadcast Super Bowl XVI during the first Sunday of the strike. CBS also rebroadcast their most recent Super Bowl (XXI) telecast during the 1987 strike. Also during the 1982 strike, CBS' NCAA football contract required the network to show four Division III games; the network initially intended to show those games on Saturday afternoons, with the broadcasts being received only in markets that were interested in carrying them. However, with no NFL games to show on October 3, 1982 (on what would have been Week 5 of the NFL season) due to the strike, CBS decided to show all of its NCAA Division III games on a single Sunday afternoon in front of a mass audience. CBS also used their regular NFL crews (Pat Summerall and John Madden at Wittenberg‚ÄìBaldwin‚ÄìWallace, Tom Brookshier and Wayne Walker at West Georgia‚ÄìMillsaps, Tim Ryan and Johnny Morris at Wisconsin‚ÄìOshkosh ‚Äì Wisconsin‚ÄìStout, and Dick Stockton and Roger Staubach at San Diego‚ÄìOccidental) and aired The NFL Today instead of using their regular college football broadcasters. =1983= On January 8, 1983, CBS began their coverage of the NFL playoffs. As a consequence to the strike, which shortened the regular season from a 16 game schedule to only 9 games, a special 16-team playoff format (which was dubbed the \\"Super Bowl Tournament\\") was instituted. Geographical divisional standings were ignored and instead, the top eight teams from each conference were seeded 1‚Äì8 based on their regular season records. Ultimately, this resulted in the early round playoff games being regionally televised for the first and to date, only time. Super Bowl XVII was televised in the United States by NBC, with Dick Enberg handling the play-by-play duties and color commentator Merlin Olsen in the broadcast booth. Len Berman and his NFL '82 castmates, Mike Adamle (who also covered the Vince Lombardi Trophy presentation ceremony), Ahmad RashƒÅd and Pete Axthelm anchored the pregame, halftime and postgame coverage. NBC's national Nielsen rating of 48.6 was the second-highest for a Super Bowl broadcast, trailing only the 49.1 garnered by Super Bowl XVI on CBS the year before. NBC introduced a new theme for the game; a brass-based piece that would see usage in various forms (as game introduction; pregame introduction or bumper music) for most of the remainder of the decade. From 1983 to 1986, ABC also aired a Friday night game in the final week (Week 16) of the regular season, in addition to the normal Monday night game. Howard Cosell continued to draw criticism during Monday Night Football with one of his offhand comments during the September 5, 1983 game, igniting a controversy and laying the groundwork for his departure at the end of that season. In a game between the Washington Redskins and Dallas Cowboys, Cosell referred to Alvin Garrett, an African American wide receiver for the Redskins, as a \\"little monkey.\\" Cosell noted that Garrett's small stature, and not his race, was the basis for his comment, citing the fact that he had used the term to describe his grandchildren. Later, a special on Howard Cosell showed him calling Mike Adamle (a white player) a \\"little monkey.\\" Stung by the unrelenting barrage of remarks, Cosell claimed upon his departure from Monday Night Football that the NFL had become \\"a stagnant bore.\\" In Cosell's book, I Never Played the Game, he devoted an entire chapter (\\"Monkey Business\\") to the Garrett episode. In the book, Cosell also said that ABC should have had the right to choose its own Monday Night schedule. In his mind, Monday Night Football is what elevated the NFL in popularity over Major League Baseball. He felt that this should have been ABC's reward for raising the league's profile. That same year, O. J. Simpson replaced Fran Tarkenton as a fill-in when Don Meredith or Cosell, who also was a broadcaster for the network's coverage of the Major League Baseball playoffs, was unavailable. The season would serve as a study in contrasts as one of the most exciting Monday night games ever was followed the next week by one of the most badly played in the run of the series. On October 17, 1983, the second highest scoring game in Monday Night Football history took place in the Green Bay Packers-Washington Redskins game, with the Packers winning the game by a score of 48‚Äì47. One week later, the New York Giants and St. Louis Cardinals played for more than four hours before settling for a 20‚Äì20 overtime tie, MNFs only OT tie to date. The deadlock had come after dropped touchdown passes by Cardinal wide receivers Willard Harrell and Roy Green, and a trio of missed field goals by teammate Neil O'Donoghue, including two in the final 63 seconds of the overtime period. =1984= Super Bowl XVIII was broadcast in the United States by CBS and featured the broadcast team of play-by-play announcer Pat Summerall and color commentator John Madden. Hosting pregame coverage for The Super Bowl Today was Brent Musburger; Irv Cross; Phyllis George and Jimmy \\"The Greek\\" Snyder. Other contributors to CBS coverage included Jim Hill (who was also sports director of KNXT in Los Angeles which aired the game in that market {KNXT changed its call letters to the current KCBS-TV that April}; WDVM aired the game in Washington, D.C.); Charlsie Cantey; Pat O'Brien; Dick Vermeil; Tom Brookshier; Hank Stram (who also worked the game alongside Jack Buck on CBS Radio); John Tesh and CBS News correspondent Charles Osgood. Dick Stockton would serve as pregame host for CBS Radio coverage; while Musburger would also contribute halftime commentary in addition to hosting CBS television coverage During this game, CBS introduced a new theme and open that would later be used for their college football coverage until it was replaced by the current college football theme introduced on Super Bowl XXI (the next Super Bowl CBS aired at the end of the 1986 season). When Howard Cosell left Monday Night Football prior to the start of the 1984 season, the trio of Frank Gifford, Don Meredith and O.J. Simpson handled the duties. Cosell's departure seemed to have the greatest effect on Meredith, who many believed to be a poor analyst in his absence. Falling ratings also gave indications that much of the mystique that surrounded the weekly event had disappeared. In the 1984 season, the October 18 game between the Pittsburgh Steelers at San Francisco 49ers and the Buffalo Bills at Seattle Seahawks were both on at the same time as Game 5 of the World Series (also on NBC) between the San Diego Padres and the Detroit Tigers. The Steelers won that day. It was the only loss the 49ers suffered in the 1984 season. =1985= Frank Gifford was the play-by-play announcer for Super Bowl XIX, while then-ABC Sports analyst Don Meredith and then-Washington Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann served as color commentators. Al Michaels and Jim Lampley hosted the pregame (2 hours), halftime, and postgame (Lampley presided over the Vince Lombardi Trophy presentation ceremony) coverage for ABC. Michaels and Lampley were joined by analysts O. J. Simpson (who would normally have been the second color commentator; when interviewed as to why Theismann would join Gifford and Meredith in the booth instead of Simpson; director Chet Forte was quoted in the January 14, 1985 edition of Broadcasting Magazine as saying that Theismann could contribute more due to having played both teams in the regular-season as well as having played in the two previous Super Bowls.) and Tom Landry (in a separate booth during the game). Also helping out with ABC's coverage were Jack Whitaker, Dick Schaap, Donna de Varona, Ray Gandolf, and ABC News reporters Stone Phillips, Jeff Greenfield, Judd Rose, and Bill Redeker. This would be the only ABC Super Bowl for Gifford as play-by-play announcer, the final game for Don Meredith and the second (and last) time a commentator for the Super Bowl (Theismann) was an active player (Jack Kemp in Super Bowl II was the only other active player to provide commentary). Michaels would call ABC's next six Super Bowls, until the network lost their NFL rights in 2006. After the 1984 season, ABC replaced Meredith with Joe Namath the following year, with the quarterback making his debut in the annual Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. In a coincidental twist, both Namath and Simpson were busy prior to the telecast with their induction into the shrine. On March 6, 1985, NBC Radio and the NFL entered into a two-year agreement granting NBC the radio rights to a 37-game package for the 1985 and 1986 seasons. The package included 27 regular season games and 10 postseason games. Also in 1985, the NFL showed a ratings increase on all three networks for the season, with viewership gains of 4% on NBC, 10% on CBS, and 16% on ABC. The 1984 season saw a new theme (\\"Constant Energy\\" by Craig Palmer) utilized throughout the pregame show and game-opening sequence, which would be utilized for the remainder of the decade. Another music selection was used for the \\"Great Moments\\" segment, a segment of clips from older games on NBC that was unique in that instead of the NFL Films footage, NBC used their own footage and audio. This segment would be featured at the beginning of the pregame show for much of the latter part of the 1980s. In May 1985, shortly after calling after working the 17th hole at the Masters and calling Game 1 of the NBA Playoff series between Portland Trail Blazers and Los Angeles Lakers, play-by- play announcer Frank Glieber died of a heart attack. Tom Brookshier, who previously served as Summerall's color commentator prior to Madden, replaced Glieber in the NFL on CBS broadcast booth. For the 1985 season, the NFL showed a ratings increase on all three networks for the season, with viewership of CBS' telecasts increasing by 10%, NBC telecasts by 4%, and ABC telecasts by 16%. For the 1985 season, NBC used Graham De Wilde's composition \\"Send Them Victorious\\" for their official theme music for the NFL. On January 26, 1986, the Chicago Bears defeated the New England Patriots 46‚Äì10 in Super Bowl XX at the Louisiana Superdome. The NBC telecast replaced the final episode of M*A*S*H as the most-viewed television program in history, with an audience of 127 million viewers, according to ACNielsen figures. In addition to drawing a 48.3 rating and a 70% share in the United States, Super Bowl XX was televised to 59 foreign countries and beamed via satellite to the QE II. An estimated 300 million Chinese viewers watched a tape delayed broadcast of the game in March. NBC Radio figures indicated an audience of 10 million for the game. One of the more grisly moments in Monday Night Football history occurred during a game between the Washington Redskins and New York Giants on November 18, 1985, at RFK Stadium. Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann's career would end when Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor reached from behind to drag him down and Taylor fell heavily on the quarterback's leg in the process. On the play, which viewers could see in a gruesome slow-motion replay, Theismann suffered a compound fracture of the tibia and fibula in his lower right leg. The injury ended the playing career of Theismann, who had teamed with Gifford and Meredith on ABC's coverage of Super Bowl XIX in January 1985. Two weeks after that painful memory, the program's most watched contest took place as the previously unbeaten Chicago Bears were defeated by the Miami Dolphins, which had not lost to a National Football Conference (NFC) team at home since 1976. That would turn out to be Chicago's only loss in 1985. The game broadcast earned a Nielsen rating of 29.6 with a 46 share. =1986= The NBC telecast of Super Bowl XX, with play-by-play announcer Dick Enberg and color commentators Merlin Olsen and Bob Griese (who was not in the booth with Enberg and Olsen), garnered the third highest Nielsen rating of any Super Bowl to date, a 48.3 but it ended up being the first Super Bowl to garner over 90 million viewers the highest to date up to that point. While Dick Enberg, Merlin Olsen and Bob Griese called the game, Bob Costas and his NFL '85 castmates, Ahmad Rashad and Pete Axthelm anchored the pregame, halftime and postgame coverage. Other contributors included Charlie Jones (recapping Super Bowl I), Larry King (interviewing Mike Ditka and Raymond Berry), and Bill Macatee (profiling Patriots owner Billy Sullivan and his family). Also, the pregame coverage included what became known as \\"the silent minute\\"; a 60-second countdown over a black screen (a concept devised by then-NBC Sports executive Michael Weisman); a skit featuring comedian Rodney Dangerfield and an interview by NBC Nightly News anchor Tom Brokaw of United States President Ronald Reagan at the White House (this would not become a regular Super Bowl pregame feature until Super Bowl XLIII; when Today show host Matt Lauer interviewed U.S. President Barack Obama). Both Joe Namath and O.J. Simpson would be replaced on Monday Night Football at the end of the 1985 NFL season, with critics noting their lack of journalistic skills in comparison to Howard Cosell. In their place the following year came veteran broadcaster Al Michaels, who had previously anchored ABC's pregame coverage of Super Bowl XIX, and had been the lead play-by-play announcer of Monday Night Baseball since 1983. Michaels had also by this point, gained much notoriety at ABC for his 1980 \\"Miracle on Ice\\" broadcast. Michaels served as the play-by-play announcer, teaming with Frank Gifford for a two-man booth in 1986. During that season, the Miami Dolphins again made records with the biggest blowout in Monday Night Football history in a 45-3 rout of the then 10-1 New York Jets (the record was later tied and subsequently broken in 2005; see below). Also in 1986, when Al Michaels became unavailable because he was calling Major League Baseball's League Championship Series, Frank Gifford moved up into the play-by-play spot while Lynn Swann or O.J. Simpson filled-in as the color commentator. Gifford would once again call the play-by-play when Michaels was busy calling the World Series in 1987 and 1989 and the National League Championship Series in 1988. Beginning in Week 4 of the 1986 season, CBS adapted a theme for its game broadcast, an intense, kinetic, synthesizer-laced theme that has affectionately been referred to as \\"Pots and Pans\\" (because of the background notes that often resembled the banging of those particular cooking objects). In 1989, the \\"Pots and Pans\\" theme was revamped to give it a more smooth, electronic style. This theme was also known for integrating the play-by-play announcer's voice-over introduction into the theme, it integrated three voice-over segments, one for the visiting team, home team and game storyline to set the latter element into the broadcast; this practice was common with CBS Sports' themes of the 1980s. =1987= Super Bowl XXI was broadcast in the United States by CBS and featured the broadcast team of play- by-play announcer Pat Summerall and color commentator John Madden. Brent Musburger of The NFL Today anchored The Super Bowl Today pregame, halftime and postgame coverage. Helping Musburger were reporters Irv Cross and Will McDonough and analysts Jimmy \\"The Greek\\" Snyder, Terry Bradshaw, Joe Theismann, CBS News reporter Charles Osgood and Dan Dierdorf (in his final CBS assignment before moving on to ABC's Monday Night Football for the following season). The game was also the first NFL game to be broadcast in Dolby Surround sound and in stereo. The game was also broadcast in Canada on CTV and in the United Kingdom on Channel 4. This was also the first Super Bowl to be telecast on commercial television in Asia, as the GMA Network in the Philippines aired its first Super Bowl. This game also marked the first Super Bowl to be broadcast live in Rome. In the teams' local markets, the game was also broadcast by CBS stations in the New York City and Denver markets, WCBS- TV 2 in New York City and KMGH-TV 7 in Denver. The postgame show was supposed to feature the song \\"One Shining Moment\\" but due to postgame interviews taking so long, CBS never aired it. They ultimately changed the lyrics from \\"The ball is kicked\\" to \\"The ball is tipped\\" in time for the 1987 Final Four (in which Indiana University won its most recent national title to date), and the song has since then been played at the end of the network's annual NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship coverage (it is also played on Turner Sports when said game airs on that network due to alternating rights with CBS that first started in 2016). CBS also debuted the theme music (composed by Lloyd Landesman) that would later be used for their college football coverage during this game (still used as of the 2018 season), as well as its open that was used through 1990. At the NFL's annual meeting in Maui, Hawaii on March 15, the NFL announced the signing of new three-year television contracts with ABC, CBS, and NBC for the 1987 to 1989 seasons. In 1987, Fox's first full year on the air, ABC initially hedged on renewing its contract to carry Monday Night Football ‚Äì then the league's crown-jewel program ‚Äì as was in the middle of negotiations to reach a new contract, due to an increased expense of the rights. Fox made an offer to the National Football League to acquire the Monday Night Football contract for the same amount ABC that had been paying to carry the package, about US$1.3 billion at the time. However, the NFL, in part because Fox had not established itself as a major network, chose to renew its contract with ABC. While ABC had been airing occasional Sunday night NFL games (usually one per season) under its Monday Night Football banner since 1978, the concept of playing a regular series of Sunday night professional football games on ESPN was originally a concept designed for the United States Football League. As part of the abortive 1986 USFL season, ESPN was to carry a weekly Sunday night game throughout the fall season.ESPN, minus USFL, has 66 hours to fill. Associated Press via St. Petersburg Times (August 5, 1986). Retrieved January 23, 2016. As part of its new television package in 1987, the NFL granted ESPN the rights to air a series of Sunday night games, which were to air over the second half of the regular season. The NFL thus became the last major North American professional sports league to begin airing its games on cable television. During the inaugural season of ESPN Sunday Night NFL (as the telecast was then branded) in 1987, the network's announcing booth consisted of Mike Patrick, Roy Firestone, and a weekly \\"guest color commentator\\". Joe Theismann took over as lead analyst beginning in 1988. Two years later, the NFL expanded its Sunday night offerings to the full season, with TNT airing games in the season's first half and ESPN taking over for the second half. ESPN's games were typically simulcast on regular over-the-air television stations in each participating team's local market so that households without cable television could still see the telecasts. During the first season, the game between the New York Giants and New England Patriots (the very first regular season game aired by ESPN) saw WABC-TVTV Sports; Marathon Mystery Unseen Winner (ABC's flagship station out of New York City) produce a completely separate telecast from ESPN's. The reason behind this was that WABC's union contract at the time prohibited non-union workers, such as those at ESPN, from producing live events for WABC. The WABC broadcasts involved play-by-play man Corey McPherrin and Frank Gifford and Lynn Swann on color commentary. Beginning in 1987, CBS started broadcasting NFL games in stereo. On December 8, 1987, Cathy Barreto became the first woman to direct an NFL game at the network television level for the Minnesota Vikings-Detroit Lions telecast. Also in 1987, Frank Gifford and Al Michaels were joined by Dan Dierdorf, returning Monday Night Football to its original concept of three announcers in the booth. The trio would last for 11 seasons through the conclusion of the 1997 season. =1988= Super Bowl XXII was broadcast in the United States by ABC with play-by-play announcer Al Michaels and color commentators Frank Gifford and Dan Dierdorf. Keith Jackson hosted the pregame, halftime, and postgame coverage for ABC, joined by analysts Lynn Swann and Mike Adamle as well as then Cleveland Browns head coach Marty Schottenheimer and then Minnesota Vikings head coach Jerry Burns. (Bob Griese was originally supposed to co-host with Jackson, but had to bow out due to a family illness.) Also helping with ABC's coverage were Jack Whitaker, Jim Hill and Becky Dixon. This was the first Super Bowl broadcast on ABC with the broadcast team of Michaels, Gifford, and Dierdorf in the booth (as the 1987 season was the first year the trio was together, with Dierdorf moving to ABC from CBS; Gifford was the only holdover from ABC's Super Bowl XIX telecast). The trio went on to man the booth for ABC's Monday Night Football from 1987 to 1997 and called Super Bowls XXV and XXIX. During September of the 1988 season, NBC brought in some legendary broadcasters to fill-in for their regular play-by-play men. This was because, much of their key personnel (namely, Dick Enberg, Marv Albert, Don Criqui, Charlie Jones, Tom Hammond as well as NFL Live! commentators Bob Costas, Ahmad RashƒÅd, and Gayle Gardner) were away in Seoul, South Korea for NBC's coverage of the Summer Olympic Games. In the meantime, filling-in were names such as Curt Gowdy, Ray Scott, Chuck Thompson, Marty Glickman, Merle Harmon and Al DeRogatis. Bob Costas' predecessor, Len Berman, filled-in for him at the anchor's desk while Gayle Sierens (who a year earlier, made history by becoming the first female play-by-play announcer in NFL history) was also added to the studio team. =1989= NBC's 1989 telecast of Super Bowl XXIII between the San Francisco 49ers and Cincinnati Bengals was watched by an estimated 110,780,000 viewers, according to ACNielsen, making it the sixth most-watched program in television history. The game was Merlin Olsen's final Super Bowl broadcast, as he was demoted the following season to make room for Bill Walsh. The game featured a special segment by Frank Deford profiling recently deceased Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney. This was also the first NFL game that NBC covered with their new \\"Quantel Cypher\\" graphics system, which was introduced during their coverage of the 1988 Seoul Olympics (the network had used Chyron for their graphics prior to Super Bowl XXIII). With the win, the 49ers became the first team to win Super Bowls televised on three different networks (the other two being Super Bowl XVI on CBS and Super Bowl XIX on ABC). Since then, the Washington Redskins (in 1992), the Green Bay Packers (in 1997), the Pittsburgh Steelers (in 2006) the New York Giants (in 2008) the New England Patriots (in 2015) and the Denver Broncos (in 2016) have accomplished this same feat. This was the last outdoor Super Bowl to start earlier than 6:00 pm Eastern Time, as it started just after 5:00 pm. This was also the first NFL game that NBC covered with their new \\"Quantel Cypher\\" graphics system, which was introduced during their coverage of the 1988 Seoul Olympics (they had used Chyron for their graphics prior to Super Bowl XXIII; the Cypher was also used for the network's presentation of the 1988 World Series). NBC also introduced their \\"cursive font\\" logo during this broadcast. Before, it was just the 1986 peacock logo with \\"NBC SPORTS\\" in their generic corporate font. With the win, the 49ers became the first team to win Super Bowls televised on three different networks (CBS-XVI, ABC-XIX, and NBC). Since then, the Washington Redskins (in 1992), the Green Bay Packers (in 1997), the Pittsburgh Steelers (in 2006), the New York Giants (in 2008), and the New England Patriots (in 2015) have accomplished this same feat. Starting in 1989, NBC commissioned musician (and then-Entertainment Tonight co-host) John Tesh, who would later compose \\"Roundball Rock\\" for the forthcoming NBA on NBC broadcasts to compose a new theme, called \\"Gridiron Dreams\\" which was used on the network's NFL telecasts until 1991. The versions used on the pre-game show are different from the version supplied on Tesh's albums. For the 1992 season, John Colby composed a theme only used that year through the 1992 AFC Championship Game in which the Buffalo Bills beat the Miami Dolphins 29‚Äì10. Also in 1989, television composer Edd Kalehoff created a new arrangement of Johnny Pearson's \\"Heavy Action\\", by that time fully synonymous with Monday Night Football. This more or less replaced an original composition by Charles Fox. Also debuting in 1989 was Hank Williams, Jr. performing \\"All My Rowdy Friends Are Here on Monday Night\\", sung to the music of his 1984 hit \\"All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight.\\" As part of the league's television contract renewal with the network in 1989, ABC was awarded the television rights to Super Bowl XXV and Super Bowl XXIX, and the first round of NFL playoffs. The Monday Night Football announcing team anchored the telecasts, except for the first of two Wild Card Playoff games, in which ESPN's Sunday Night NFL crew of Mike Patrick and Joe Theismann presided over that telecast. However, the original crew for one of the two Wild Card Playoff games from 1990 to 1995 consisted of Brent Musburger and Dick Vermeil (both of whom did college football broadcasts for ABC during those two seasons). For the Thanksgiving game broadcasts on November 23, 1989, John Madden awarded the first \\"Turkey Leg Award\\", for the annual game's most valuable player. Reggie White of the Philadelphia Eagles was the first recipient of the honor for his part in what would become known as Bounty Bowl I. The gesture was seen mostly as a humorous gimmick relating to Madden's famous multi-legged turkeys served on Thanksgiving. Since then, however, the award has gained subtle notoriety, and currently, each year an MVP has been chosen for both the CBS and Fox games. When CBS returned to the NFL in 1998, the network introduced their own award, the \\"All-Iron Award.\\" References External links *ABC News *CBS Sports *ESPN *Fox Sports *NBC Sports *NFL Network Category:CBS Sports Category:ABC Sports Category:ESPN Category:Monday Night Football Category:Sunday Night Football Category:1980s in American television ","title":"NFL on television in the 1980s"},{"id":"61466082","text":"I Think You've Gone Mad (Or the Sins of the Father) is the third studio album by Toronto rapper and producer Sean Leon.

It is a dominant emergent tree in parts of the rainforests of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. In the international timber market, this species is traded under the name cumaru. It furnishes a dense, hard, beautiful reddish timber which has become a popular import in the 2010s for use in parquet. The ornamental bunches of lilac pink flowers high in the canopy eventually develop into a mass of large fruit pods, which are an important food for many native animals during the dry season. The fruit contains a single oily seed which is edible, although these seeds are not exploited as a commercial product. Vernacular names In northeastern Peru, a local common name which has been recorded for this plant since its discovery by Western scientists is charapilla. This name is shared with Dipteryx charapilla. The word charapilla is a diminutive of the Quechua word charapa, meaning 'turtle', and refers to the shell-like half of an opened bean pod of this tree.Grant S, Niezgoda C (2019). Field Museum of Natural History (Botany) Seed Plant Collection. Version 11.10. Field Museum. Occurrence dataset https://doi.org/10.15468/nxnqzf accessed via GBIF.org on 2019-08-10. https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/1228398050 It is also known as coumarou or almendrillo in Bolivia, and shihuahuaco in the Department of Madre de Dios in southern Peru. In both these last two regions it shares the same name with D. alata. The word almendrillo is a diminutive of the Spanish almendro, meaning almond. Both tree species are also known as mawi in the Ese Eja language spoken there. Other names used for this plant that are or have been used in Peru are huamansamana (in Loreto), shihuahuaco negro (in Hu√°nuco), cumar√∫ and guacamayo. The name kumarut as given in many sources starting in 1926 is only attested to the first collection of this plant by G√ºnther Tessmann from along the Mara√±√≥n river. Adolpho Ducke in 1940 states his belief it is a misspelling of cumar√∫. Tessmann, in his notes, in fact spells the name kumar√∫. Taxonomy The specific epithet micrantha is compounded from the Greek ŒºŒπŒ∫œÅœåœÇ (mikr√≥s), meaning \\"small\\" and ·ºÑŒΩŒ∏ŒøœÇ (anthos) meaning ‚Äúflower‚Äù. The holotype was first collected by G√ºnther Tessmann early 1925 at the mouth of the Pastaza river along the northern shore of the Mara√±√≥n river, below stream from the Pongo de Manseriche, in Datem del Mara√±√≥n Province, Department of Loreto. This specimen found its way down the Amazon river to Germany, where a bit less than two years later Hermann Harms described it as a new species, choosing the name Dipteryx micrantha (he initially vacillated with the name D. parviflora which means the same in Latin as the present does in Greek). The holotype was housed in the Berlin herbarium (B). The second time this species was collected was 5 years later by Guillermo Klug in 1930 at a place near Iquitos, once called Mishuyacu, in Maynas Province, Department of Loreto.Orrell T (2019). NMNH Extant Specimen Records. Version 1.21. National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution. Occurrence dataset https://doi.org/10.15468/hnhrg3 accessed via GBIF.org on 2019-08-10. https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/1702824830 In 1940 Adolpho Ducke re-described it under the name Coumarouna. A botanical taxonomic congress had decided many years before that the older name Dipteryx should be conserved, to which Ducke found himself unable to comply with at the time objecting primarily because of morphological grounds. Ducke changed his mind in 1949. In the most recent monograph on the genus Dipteryx, A Checklist of the Dipterygeae species by the Brazilian researcher Haroldo Cavalcante de Lima in 1989, D. ferrae was synonymised with D. micrantha. His taxonomy was accepted by ILDIS (2005) but not noticed or followed by some works such as the Catalogue of the Flowering Plants and Gymnosperms of Peru (1993) or the Tropicos database by the Missouri Botanical Garden. By 2010 de Lima had changed his mind and had started to recognise D. ferrae as an independent species again. As of the late 2010s this species is mostly (mis-)identified as Coumarouna odorata in agroforestry in Peru, and is recorded as such by MINAG, the Peruvian institute of forestry, which collects statistics of this species under both this name as well as .... Description Habitus: This is a very large tree, sometimes growing up to 60m, although in Man√∫ National Park in Peru the average height was 44m. The trunk has large buttresses although individual trees have been recorded with smallish buttresses. The buttresses can grow to 4m high and 1.5m thick in mature individuals. In young trees the buttresses may faintly snake up the trunk, giving a furrowed or corrugated profile to a cross-section of the trunk, but in older mature trees the bole is cylindrical. The base is wide and parasol-shaped. The bark is distinctively coloured salmon. The trunk can grow to 2 m in diameter Leaves: It has compound leaves, with the number of the leaflets 6 to 14. 9-11 leaflets groove running down the upper side of the leaf rachis. Flowers: leathery calyx coloured pinkish; size of the calyx 20 to 25. calyx membranous, upper calyx \\"wings\\" appear petalous. lilac light violet Fruit: The fruit is ovoid or oblong in shape, with a fleshy pericarp. The seed is large. Unlike other some species of Dipteryx, the pods and seeds of this tree do not have the typical scent of coumarin. The seeds are oily and edible. =Infraspecific variation= At least in Peru, D. micrantha exists in two discreet, easily distinguished morphotypes, which are furthermore chorologically distinct. These morphotypes have not been named taxonomically. Morphotype 1: Morphotype 2: =Similar species= Other species of Dipteryx which are said to grow in the same area (Peru) as this species are D. alata, D. charapilla, D. ferrae, D. odorata and D. rosea. It shares a number of features with D. ferrae (see taxonomy), according to James Francis Macbride differing primarily in the higher number of leaflets which comprise its compound leaves. Distribution Bolivia: It is known in Bolivia from the departments of Beni, Cochabamba, La Paz, Pando and Santa Cruz. Brazil: It is found in the Brazilian states of Acre, Amazonas and Rond√¥nia. Colombia: It is found in Colombia in the departments of Amazonas, Caquet√° and Meta in the ecoregions of the Amazon rainforest, the Colombian Guayana region, the Orinoco rainforests and the foothills of the Serran√≠a de la Macarena. Ecuador: It is known to grow in Aguarico Canton in Orellana Province near the Peruvian border. Peru: It has been found growing in the departments of Hu√°nuco, Loreto, Madre de Dios, Puno and Ucayali. Ecology These enormous trees are emergent above the canopy. It is a relatively common species in parts of the rainforest, occurring at densities of 0-6 trees per hectare. Flowering takes place high in the crown of the tree shortly after the start of the rainy season. The fruit are ripe in the height of the dry season; only a few other tree species fruit in these forests at this time, making them an important food source for local wildlife. The seedlings are shade-tolerant, but survive to maturity only in or near gaps in the canopy, such as those formed by fallen trees. =Habitat= It occurs in mature, seasonal, evergreen tropical rainforest, which has dry and wet seasons, on alluvial soils in floodplains, but it does not typically grow in forests inundated under water for a large part of the year (v√°rzea), although it has been collected in flood-free areas in this type of habitat, as well as water-logged terrain on terra firme. Besides primary woodland it also grows in secondary woodland (after logging operations) and disturbed habitats such as pastures, smallholder farms (chacras) and plantations. It has also been collected in dry woods in the Department of Hu√°nuco in Peru. It has been recorded in brown clay and alluvial soils. In Colombia it grows to an altitude of 100m. In Ecuador it has been collected at 200 to 250m altitude. Specimens have been collected from 135 to 400m in Peru, and 180 to 850m in Bolivia. =Interspecific relationships= It occurs together with the palms Astrocaryum murumuru, Iriartea deltoidea and Attalea cephalotes in southern Peru. In Orellana Province in eastern Ecuador, it is found growing together with the there common trees Cedrelinga catenaeformis, Croton tessmannii and Brownea macrophylla. This species primarily uses two different groups of animals sequentially to disperse its seeds. Initially fruit-eating bats (Artibeus spp.) carry off ripe fruit to their feeding roosts low in the understory (3-5m), where they drop the large seeds to the forest floor, these seeds lie singly or in small piles. Secondarily the seeds are eaten by large to medium-sized rodents, mostly spiny rats in the Proechimys genus and the agouti Dasyprocta variegata, which may carry off seeds to hide in caches. Many seeds escape being eaten by the rodents, which in Man√∫ National Park in Peru commonly miss a third of the seeds, often due to satiation. In Peru, other animals seen eating the ripe fruit pulp in the crown of this tree are the spider monkeys Ateles paniscus and Didelphis spp. opossums, both of which simply drop the seeds to the ground under the parent tree while they eat. In Brazil animals seen eating the fruit were bats, macaws and monkeys. Uses =Food= The seeds are oily and edible. These are a prized food in traditional Ese Eja cuisine in southern Peru. =Charcoal and firewood= It makes good firewood. The wood is also heated slowly to make charcoal. Charcoal is the most important fuel used in restaurant and domestic ovens for cooking, and is also important for barbecues and heating. It is especially important for the poor. In Peru in 2008, according to the Direcci√≥n General Forestal y de Fauna Silvestre (DGFF), 96% of all charcoal in the country is produced from dry woodlands in three neighbouring northern departments, of which almost everything was produced in the small department of Lambayeque from Prosopis pallida. Because this is unsustainable, researchers have recommended exploiting the abundant stock of the Peruvian Amazon to produce needed charcoal, especially from secondary woodlands. The Amazon rainforest has great potential as a charcoal source, but is undeveloped and under-utilized. The department of Loreto, the largest department of Peru with abundant forest reserves, is unconnected to markets in the rest of the country and only limited amounts of charcoal are produced, exclusively for local consumption. DGFF statistics confirm that D. micrantha, Manilkara bidentata and Calycophyllum spruceanum are the most abundant and suitable species used for production of charcoal of high caloric value in the Amazon, possibly also as a by-product of the parquet industry. In the city of Iquitos D. micrantha and Cedrelinga cateniformis are among the most important species used for charcoal production. D. micrantha charcoal produced at 400¬∞C is considered \\"B\\" quality and has a density of 543 kg/m3, a fixed carbon content of 68.77% and a caloric value of 8466.82 kcal/kg. Produced at 300¬∞C it is considered \\"C\\" quality and has a density of 680 kg/m3, a fixed carbon content of 33.69% and a caloric value of 5600.28 kcal/kg. =Timber= The wood is hard, beautiful and of high quality, but until recently was only rarely exploited locally. In the 1930s boats were made from the wood near Iquitos in Peru. In 1999 the main uses were as railway sleepers, vehicle frameworks, bridges over narrow ravines, flooring, heavy construction, external (outdoor) woodwork, joinery and parquet. Exports from Peru to primarily China began in the ... for the parquet industry to supply the North American and European flooring market. Freshly logged thick planks do not dry well naturally and have a tendency to warp, but planks to 13mm thick behave well when dried artificially slowly over a period of days in a kiln. The lumber is difficult to work as it is cross-grained and very hard, so it is best to use a bandsaw or other suitable power-tools. The lumber is naturally resistant to biological attack and does not need extra treatment. =Culture= Necklace made with fruits of Dipteryx micrantha Among the Ese Eja people, the plant is mixed with Banisteriopsis for use as an element in shamanistic rituals. According to Alexiades this is a recent non-indigenous practice. The tree is seen as a \\"teacher plant\\", and hallucinogenic visions of the tree symbolize concrete (houses) and the future/modernity. Conservation In Bolivia it has been collected from Madidi National Park. In Brazil, the conservation status of this species has not yet been evaluated by the Centro Nacional de Conserva√ß√£o da Flora. It is a common plant in Acre in forests on dry (not flooded) land. In Colombia the conservation status is also yet to be evaluated. In can be seen in situ at Amacayacu National Park. In Ecuador it is protected in Yasun√≠ National Park. In southeastern Peru this is a common species. In northeastern Amazonian Peru it is quite common and trees occur in medium to high densities. The conservation status has not been evaluated. It is protected in Man√∫ National Park, Allpahuayo-Mishana National Reserve, Ipar√≠a National Forest, Bahuaja-Sonene National Park and Tambopata National Reserve. It is found in the buffer zones of El Sira Communal Reserve and Yanachaga-Chemill√©n National Park. It is also found outside of national parks. Harvesting for timber appears to increase recruitment of this species due to better seedling survival, because of both the increase in gaps in the canopy, and protection by farmers moving into recently logged lands, although researchers warn about over-exploitation, the movement of poor farmers into the region and the subsequent development of logged land as infrastructure modernises in the region. Some form of agroforestry/silviculture appears quite possible with this species.

The contracts totaled US$3.6 billion, the largest package in television history. This contract saw each network having rights to one Super Bowl telecast as part of the package. The fourth Super Bowl (XXVIII) was up for a separate sealed bid. NBC won the bid, and since they were last in the rotation for Super Bowl coverage in the regular contract, ended up with two straight Super Bowls (although they were originally scheduled to broadcast Super Bowl XXVI; CBS instead televised the game as part of a swap with the network). CBS is the only other network to televise two Super Bowls (Super Bowl I and II) in a row. NBC, which had held XXVII (according to the original rotation, NBC would have had XXVI and CBS XXVII, but the NFL allowed the networks to switch the two games in order to allow CBS a significant lead-in to its coverage of the 1992 Winter Olympics), was the only network to bid on XXVIII. Previously, the league alternated the Super Bowl broadcast among its broadcast network partners, except for Super Bowl I; CBS broadcast Super Bowl II, then the league rotated the broadcast between CBS and NBC until 1985 when ABC entered the rotation when that network broadcast Super Bowl XIX. Year-by-year breakdown =1990= For CBS' coverage of Super Bowl XXIV at the end of the 1989 season, CBS introduced a brand new theme for its NFL broadcasts, using a considerably more traditional and standard (but still peppy and bombastic) theme than the one used the previous four seasons; the theme was used until the 1991 NFC Championship Game. The game featured the broadcast team of play-by-play announcer Pat Summerall and color commentator John Madden. Brent Musburger hosted all of The Super Bowl Today pregame (2 hours), halftime, and postgame events with help from his NFL Today co-hosts Irv Cross, Dick Butkus, and Will McDonough, along with game analysts Terry Bradshaw, Ken Stabler, and Dan Fouts, and then- Chicago Bears head coach Mike Ditka. CBS Sports reporter Pat O'Brien, meanwhile, was stationed in San Francisco 49ers quarterback Joe Montana's hometown of Monongahela, Pennsylvania. This was the last NFL broadcast where Musburger and Cross appeared on The NFL Today, which both had been involved with since its 1975 premiere. Shortly before he was to call the 1990 men's Division I college basketball championship game on April 2, 1990, Musburger was fired by CBS management. Cross, meanwhile, was made a color analyst alongside Tim Ryan for two seasons before he left after the 1991 season. In addition, both Butkus and McDonough left the network after this game; McDonough moved to NBC's pregame team while Butkus decided to return to acting and philanthropic work. CBS elected to go with a two-man team for the next year, pulling Bradshaw and Greg Gumbel off of their respective broadcast teams and naming them the new hosts for The NFL Today. CBS also debuted a new graphical package and theme song for their telecasts. The graphics became part of The NFL Today open while the theme continued to be used on game broadcasts for the next two seasons and replaced the original NFL Today theme, which had been used in remixed form for the 1989 season. The last use of the actual theme was for the 1991 season's NFC Championship game, while a remixed version was used for Super Bowl XXVI's pregame show. The game drew a national Nielsen rating of 39.0 for CBS, the lowest rating for a Super Bowl game since Super Bowl III in January 1969. On September 9, 1990, The NFL Today overhauled its talent lineup, consisting of Greg Gumbel, Terry Bradshaw, Pat O'Brien and Lesley Visser. As previously mentioned, Gumbel and Bradshaw replaced Brent Musburger, who was fired by CBS on April 1, 1990, and Irv Cross, who was demoted to the position of game analyst. During the 1990 season, Pat Summerall was hospitalized after vomiting on a plane during a flight after a Bears‚ÄìRedskins game, and was out for a considerable amount of time. While Verne Lundquist replaced Summerall on games with Madden, Jack Buck (who was at CBS during the time as the network's lead Major League Baseball announcer) was added as a regular NFL broadcaster to fill-in. TNT televised NFL games from 1990 through the 1997 season. They broadcast Sunday night NFL games during the first half of the season, with ESPN taking over for the second half. TNT got a couple of Thursday night games to show, as ESPN did in the second half (TNT's Thursday night games were aired in place of Sunday night games that would have otherwise conflicted with the World Series). As has always been the case for cable NFL broadcasts, TNT's games were simulcast on regular over-the-air television stations in each participating team's local market so that households without cable television could still see the telecasts. ESPN anchor Chris Berman referred to TNT's football programming by its original \\"Nitro\\" brand, even after TNT abandoned that moniker. (This is not to be confused with the professional wrestling show called WCW Monday Nitro.) It does not appear that TNT's coverage ever used the title Sunday Night Football, and indeed ESPN filed for a trademark on that title in 1996 (the trademark was later assigned to the NFL, allowing for its eventual use by NBC).USPTO Trademark Assignment Search for no. 75045443. Retrieved September 8, 2010. =1991= Super Bowl XXV was broadcast in the United States by the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), featuring the Monday Night Football broadcast team of play-by-play announcer Al Michaels and color commentators Frank Gifford and Dan Dierdorf. Brent Musburger hosted all the events with the help of then-ABC Sports analysts Bob Griese and Dick Vermeil, Musburger's regular color commentator on ABC's college football telecasts. Also, sponsors Coca-Cola and Diet Pepsi had to withdraw planned contest promotions or advertisements, due to the Gulf War situation (PepsiCo's contest, a heavily promoted $3 million giveaway in which viewers would be invited to call a toll-free number during the first three quarters; with the caller receiving a Diet Pepsi coupon and an opportunity to win one of 3 prizes totaling $1 million each, was also withdrawn due to FCC and Congressional fears and complaints from the telephone communications industry that the United States telephone system would be overwhelmed). In the teams' local markets, the game was also broadcast by the local ABC stations in the New York City and Buffalo markets (WABC-TV 7 in New York City and WKBW-TV 7 in Buffalo). The live Sunday matches of the 1991 Ryder Cup held in late September on NBC were scheduled to end by mid-afternoon in order to allow NBC to cover regional NFL games at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time. =1992= At Super Bowl XXVI, Lesley Visser became the first female sportscaster to preside over the Vince Lombardi Trophy presentation ceremony. The network's telecast of Super Bowl XXVI on January 26, 1992 was seen by more than 123 million viewers nationally, second only to the 127 million that viewed Super Bowl XX. The ongoing 1990 television contract gave CBS rights to Super Bowl XXVI instead of Super Bowl XXVII, which was in the network's rotation of the champion game. The NFL swapped the years in which CBS and NBC held rights to the Super Bowl in an effort to give CBS enough lead-in programming for the upcoming 1992 Winter Olympics that were set to begin two weeks later. For this game, CBS debuted a new network-wide red, white and blue graphics package as well as a new theme song (composed by Frankie Vinci) for its NFL coverage that replaced the one CBS debuted for their coverage of Super Bowl XXIV two years earlier. The package lasted until the end of 1995, after which CBS discarded it in favor of an orange and yellow color scheme for its sports graphics. The new music lasted until CBS lost the NFL rights at the end of the 1993 season, but continued to be used by CBS Radio until 2002. Several remixed versions of the 1993 theme were used upon the return of the NFL to CBS until the end of the 2002 season, when CBS replaced its entire NFL music package with one composed by E.S. Posthumus. =1993= Super Bowl XXVII was broadcast on television in the United States by NBC. Dick Enberg served as the play-by-play announcer with color commentator Bob Trumpy in the broadcast booth. Bob Costas hosted all the events with analyst Mike Ditka, who joined NBC almost immediately after he was fired as head coach of the Chicago Bears earlier in January. Other contributors included former Boston Globe sportswriter Will McDonough (assigned to Buffalo's locker room); former Oakland/Los Angeles Raiders tight end Todd Christensen; The Tonight Show host Jay Leno; Cris Collinsworth (participating in an NFL Experience piece with Christensen as well as reporting from the Dallas locker room); former Los Angeles Lakers basketball player Magic Johnson (then working as a commentator for the NBA on NBC; Johnson was assigned to an interview with Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman, running back Emmitt Smith and wide receiver Michael Irvin); Paul Maguire; Gayle Gardner; Jim Lampley (who would replace Costas as host of NFL Live for the following season); and Dateline NBC correspondent Deborah Roberts (producing a special report on the Michael Jackson halftime show). Also included was an interview with former New York Jets defensive end Dennis Byrd and his wife Angela in the first one-on-one interview since Byrd suffered a paralyzing neck injury (which he eventually recovered from) suffered in a collision with teammate Scott Mersereau during their game against Kansas City. In September 1993, The NFL Today celebrated its 19th season as a half-hour pre-game show. It held the distinction of being the highest-rated program in its time slot for 18 years, longer than any other program on television. Despite having a few successful shows like The X-Files, Fox still lacked credibility among viewers. The network was mostly known for blue-collar family sitcoms like The Simpsons and Married... with Children. Despite so much skepticism about Fox that it had to assure the NFL and reporters that Bart Simpson would not be an announcer, to the surprise and shock of many in the sports and media industries, on December 17, 1993, the NFL selected the bid offered by Fox, in the process stripping CBS of football for the first time since 1956. Fox's coverage, in addition to being able to televise NFC regular season and playoff games, also included the exclusive U.S. television rights to Super Bowl XXXI (held in 1997) under the initial contract, which took effect with the 1994 season. The steady downturn in programming fortunes that CBS experienced during the tenure of network president Laurence Tisch (brother of New York Giants co-owner Bob Tisch) would precipitate in 1993. As the television contracts for both NFL conferences and for the Sunday and Monday prime time football packages came up for renewal, the Fox Broadcasting Company ‚Äì which made a failed attempt at acquiring the Monday Night Football package six years earlier ‚Äì made an aggressive move to acquire the league television rights. Knowing that it would likely need to bid considerably more than the incumbent networks to acquire a piece of the package, Fox placed a then-record bid of US$1.58 billion for the four-year contract for the broadcast rights to the National Football Conference, significantly exceeding CBS' bid of $290 million for each year of the contract. The NFC was considered the more desirable conference at the time due to its presence in most of the largest U.S. markets, such as New York City, Chicago, Dallas, and Philadelphia. As previously mentioned, the NFL accepted Fox's bid on December 18, 1993, giving that network rights to televise NFC regular season and playoff games effective with the 1994 season, as well as the exclusive U.S. television rights to Super Bowl XXXI (held in 1997) under the initial contract. This stripped CBS of National Football League telecasts following the 1993 season after 38 years, resulting in CBS not broadcasting any NFL games for the next four years. The Fox network had only debuted seven years earlier and did not have an existing sports division; however, it would establish its own sports division and began building its own coverage by hiring many former CBS personalities (such as Pat Summerall, John Madden, James Brown, Terry Bradshaw, Dick Stockton and Matt Millen), management and production personnel. =1994= Super Bowl XXVIII was broadcast in the United States by NBC, with play-by-play announcer Dick Enberg and color commentator Bob Trumpy. Jim Lampley hosted all the events with the help of analysts Mike Ditka and Joe Gibbs and sideline reporters O. J. Simpson (on Buffalo's sideline) and Will McDonough (on Dallas' sideline). While Lampley was busy covering the trophy presentation, Bob Costas (who also interviewed Dallas head coach Jimmy Johnson and Dallas owner/general manager Jerry Jones together prior to the game) covered for Lampley at the host and analysts' desk (and signed off the broadcast for NBC). It was the first time a network had held consecutive Super Bowls outright. The five-year NFL contract signed in 1989 had a provision where the last Super Bowl in the contract (XXVIII) would not be rotated, but would go to the highest bidder. NBC, which had held XXVII (according to the original rotation, NBC would have had XXVI and CBS XXVII, but the NFL allowed the networks to switch the two games in order to allow CBS a significant lead-in to its coverage of the 1992 Winter Olympics), was the only network to bid on XXVIII. Less than two weeks before the game was aired, NBC had shown a Peanuts special, You're In the Super Bowl, Charlie Brown, in which the character Melody-Melody wins the Punt, Pass & Kick contest wearing a Dallas Cowboys uniform. For this game, NBC introduced a new theme for NFL broadcasts by composer John Colby that would be retained for the 1994 season. Previously, the league alternated the Super Bowl broadcast among its television networks, except for Super Bowl I in which both NBC and CBS televised it simultaneously. CBS broadcast Super Bowl II, then the league rotated the broadcast between CBS and NBC until 1985 when ABC entered the rotation when they broadcast Super Bowl XIX. CBS televised its last game as the rights holder of the National Football Conference package on January 23, 1994 when the Dallas Cowboys defeated the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship Game, 38‚Äì21. Before signing off one last time, CBS aired a photo montage of their most memorable moments during their 38 years of covering the NFL set to the song \\"After the Sunrise\\" by Yanni. The unexpectedly high bids from Fox and other networks increased the NFL salary cap, new in 1994, to $34 million from the predicted $32 million. CBS's Laurence Tisch had apparently underestimated the value of its NFL rights with respect to its advertising revenues and to its promotional opportunities for other programming on the network. Indeed, Fox was still an upstart player in 1993, not yet considered on par with CBS, NBC and ABC, the three longer established major networks (Fox, by comparison, had debuted in October 1986 as the only venture at a fourth television network since the 1956 demise of the DuMont Television Network to truly compete with the \\"Big Three\\"). The network already had offbeat hits such as The Simpsons, Married... with Children, and Beverly Hills, 90210 on its schedule. However, Fox did not have a sports division up to that point, and its news division was a few years away from fruition (most Fox stations outside of a few owned by the network did not even produce their own news programming), and most Fox affiliates were often either full-power UHF stations or low-powered stations. The acquisition of NFL rights by Fox made that network a major player in American television by giving it many new viewers (and affiliates) and a platform to advertise its other programs. In the meantime, CBS lost several affiliates, and ratings for its other programming languished. On May 23, 1994, News Corporation, then parent of Fox, struck an alliance with New World Communications, by now a key ownership group with several VHF affiliates of the three established major networks ‚Äì most of which were CBS affiliates, almost all of which were located in NFC markets ‚Äì and wary of a CBS without football. Through the deal, in which Fox purchased a 20% interest in New World, the company signed an agreement to affiliate the majority of its stations (including those that New World was in the process of acquiring from Argyle Communications and Citicasters) with Fox; twelve of New World's stations began switching their affiliations to Fox beginning in September 1994 and continuing through September 1996. To this day, CBS admits that it has never fully recovered from the loss of key affiliates through the New World-Fox deal. It took a particularly severe hit in Atlanta, Detroit and Milwaukee, as the network found itself on the verge of having to import the signals of nearby affiliates via cable and satellite after being turned down for affiliation deals by other major network stations in those markets. Ultimately, the network was relegated to UHF stations with marginal signals in certain areas within their markets (because of satellite television, the NFL Sunday Ticket in local markets, and rules of the time, satellite subscribers were required to use antennas to pick up local affiliates). CBS purchased one of these stations, WWJ-TV (channel 62), only days before its longtime Detroit affiliate, WJBK (channel 2), was set to switch to Fox. The ratings impact in these three markets was significant; the former CBS affiliates were all considered to be ratings contenders, especially during the NFL season. With CBS ending up on UHF stations that had virtually no significant history as a former Fox or first-tier independent station (or former Big Three affiliate for that matter), ratings for CBS programming in these markets declined significantly. In Milwaukee, for instance, WITI (channel 6)'s switch from CBS to Fox resulted in several of CBS' remaining sports properties, most notably the Daytona 500, not being available to cable subscribers for much of 1995 until Weigel Broadcasting signed carriage agreements with providers to add new CBS station WDJT-TV (channel 58). CBS apparently underestimated the value of its rights with respect to its advertising revenues and to its promotional opportunities for other network programs. The vast resources of Fox founder Rupert Murdoch allowed that network to grow quickly, primarily to the detriment of CBS. The loss of the NFL came in part because CBS Sports suddenly went into cost-cutting mode in the wake of its money-bleeding, $1 billion deal with Major League Baseball (1990‚Äì1993). The network had already developed a stodgy and overly budgeted image under Laurence Tisch, who had become chief executive officer of CBS in 1985. Tisch was already notorious for having made deep cuts at the network's news division and for selling off major portions of the company (such as the 1988 sale of its Columbia Records division to Sony). When CBS lost the NFL to Fox, the \\"Tiffany Network\\" struggled to compete in the ratings with a slate of programming whose audiences skewed older than programs broadcast by the other networks, even though the network still finished ahead of Fox, whose programming at the time of the NFL deal was almost exclusively limited to primetime and children's programming. One of the few bright spots in terms of ratings and audience demographics for CBS in the Tisch era, the Late Show with David Letterman (which often dominated The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in its first two years) saw its ratings decline in large part due to the affiliation switches, at times even finishing third behind Nightline on ABC. Fox aired its inaugural NFL game telecast on August 12, 1994, with a preseason game between the Denver Broncos and the San Francisco 49ers at Candlestick Park in San Francisco. Coverage formally began the following month on September 4, with the premiere of Fox NFL Sunday, followed by a slate of six regionally televised regular season games on the first Sunday of the 1994 season. The October 17, 1994 episode of Monday Night Football between the Kansas City Chiefs and Denver Broncos featured a duel between two future Hall of Fame quarterbacks, Joe Montana and John Elway. With 1:29 left to play in the game, Elway scored on a 4-yard touchdown run to put the Broncos ahead 28‚Äì24. But then Montana led the Chiefs on a 75-yard drive to score the game-winning touchdown with just 8 seconds to play. The final score was Chiefs 31, Broncos 28. The October 31, 1994 game between the Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears is notable for a very windy/rainy game, which also featured the Crypt Keeper deliver the famous phase, and also remembered with a 36-yard TD run by Brett Favre, who had a sore hip that night. Later dubbed the Halloween Monsoon by Bear fans, the Packers crushed the Bears, 33-6. =1995= Super Bowl XXIX was broadcast in the United States by the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), with play-by-play announcer Al Michaels and color commentators Frank Gifford and Dan Dierdorf. Lynn Swann (Chargers sideline) and Lesley Visser (49ers sideline) served as sideline reporters. During that Super Bowl, Visser became the first woman assigned to a Super Bowl sideline. Visser had previously become the first woman sportscaster to cover the Vince Lombardi Trophy presentation ceremony, when she covered Super Bowl XXVI for CBS. Brent Musburger hosted all the Super Bowl XXIX pregame (2 hours), halftime, and postgame events with the help of then-ABC Sports analyst Dick Vermeil, Musburger's regular color commentator on ABC's college football telecasts, and then-New York Jets quarterback Boomer Esiason. This would be the final Super Bowl hosted by Musburger, as all subsequent Super Bowls on ABC were hosted by ESPN's Chris Berman following the Disney purchase of ABC (which included ESPN), and the subsequent integration of ESPN and ABC Sports (now ESPN on ABC). Also, the trophy presentation for this game was the last to be held in the winning team's locker room, as all subsequent Vince Lombardi Trophy presentations would be held on the field. This was the last Super Bowl broadcast by the Monday Night Football broadcast team of Michaels, Gifford and Dierdorf. This was the broadcast team for Monday Night Football from 1987‚Äì1997. They also worked ABC's coverage of Super Bowls XXII and XXV. This would also be the last Super Bowl aired on ABC until the 1999 season (when Al Michaels called the game with Boomer Esiason). Starting in 1995, NBC unveiled a new theme by veteran composer Randy Edelman, which was used for both its pregame show (now simply titled The NFL on NBC) and game telecasts. This theme would be used until Super Bowl XXXII in 1997 between the Denver Broncos and Green Bay Packers. NBC lost AFC television rights after 1997 to CBS which currently has them today. The NFL would not return to NBC until 2006 for Sunday Night Football. NBC still uses the 1995 to 1997 era theme, but only for online streams of Sunday Night Football online (dubbed \\"NBC Sunday Night Football Extra\\") if the feed is accessed prior to the start of the game. In the 1995 MNF regular season opener between the Dallas Cowboys and New York Giants at the New Jersey Meadowlands, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones controversially brought Nike chairman Phil Knight down to the sidelines, representing Jones' individual deal with Nike, contrary to the NFL's policy of negotiating its marketing deals as a league. =1996= Super Bowl XXX was broadcast in the United States by NBC, with play-by-play announcer Dick Enberg and color commentators Phil Simms, Paul Maguire, and Jim Gray and Will McDonough on the sidelines. Greg Gumbel hosted all the events with the help of then-NBC analysts Ahmad RashƒÅd, Mike Ditka, Joe Gibbs, and Joe Montana. The Vince Lombardi Trophy presentation started a tradition in which it is held on the field instead of inside the winners' locker room. All three Super Bowl wins for the Cowboys in the 1990s were broadcast on NBC, who later gained majority control and then full ownership of its affiliate in the Dallas area, KXAS-TV. By 1996, Fox's graphic changed to a full-statistics panel, where down and distance, penalty, and key in-game statistics would pop in and out when necessary. The basic design of the scoring bug, which was named the \\"FoxBox\\", mimicked the version used on Fox's MLB coverage. For Fox's coverage of Super Bowl XXXIII at the end of the 1998 season, the starting lineups were shown using a virtual television. To television viewers, the effect appeared as if the end zone opened up and a giant television screen rose from the ground. The virtual television display showed video announcing the starting lineups. The virtual television effect was provided by PVI Virtual Media Services using its L-VIS virtual graphics system. =1997= Super Bowl XXXI was the first Super Bowl to be televised in the United States by the Fox network. Play-by-play announcer Pat Summerall and color commentator John Madden, both previously of CBS, called the game. James Brown hosted all the events with help from his fellow Fox NFL Sunday cast members Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long, and Ronnie Lott. This was the first of three Super Bowls to be called by Summerall and Madden while with Fox (Super Bowls XXXIII and XXXVI being the others). The telecast ended up being the highest-rated program in the history of the then ten-year-old Fox network, and it currently ties Super Bowl XLII for the highest-rated program in the entire history of the network. Afterwards, Fox televised The X-Files episode \\"Leonard Betts\\". Fox's broadcast was also the first Super Bowl to have a constant, live-updating graphic for the score, time and down & distance. The FoxBox was used also in Super Bowl XXXIII, and the graphic positioned over live action has become the norm in virtually all sports broadcasts at the national and regional production levels. With the Packers' win, they became the third team to win Super Bowls on three networks (I-broadcast on both CBS and NBC, II-CBS, and Fox). They also became the first team to win three Super Bowls with Fox as one of the networks to televise their win. The previous seven games played in domes were all won by the designated road team, which wore white. The game was rematched on October 27, 1997, as a near-national telecast on ABC's Monday Night Football, the only time ABC aired a rematch of the previous season's Super Bowl. In 1997, ABC began using a scoring bug showing the game clock and score throughout the entire broadcast. TNT lost their rights to the NFL following the 1997 season after ESPN chose to bid on the entire regular season package beginning in 1998. In the wake of the loss of NFL rights, TNT began negotiations with NBC Sports to start a new football league; TNT eventually backed out of the proposal.HighBeam (NBC's proposed league eventually became the XFL.) TNT would not air professional football again until signing on as a broadcast partner with the Alliance of American Football in 2019. The last TNT game was aired on October 26, 1997. Fittingly, one of the teams involved was the Atlanta Falcons, based in the home city of Turner Broadcasting - Atlanta, Georgia (they played at their division rivals, the Carolina Panthers, located up Interstate 85 in Charlotte, North Carolina). Unlike the Braves, Hawks and Thrashers, however, Turner never owned the Falcons at any point in time (due to NFL ownership rules). =1998= Super Bowl XXXII was televised in the United States by NBC, with play-by-play announcer Dick Enberg (calling his eighth and final Super Bowl), color commentators Phil Simms and Paul Maguire, and sideline reporter Jim Gray. Greg Gumbel hosted all the events, and was joined by co-host Ahmad Rashad and commentators Cris Collinsworth, Sam Wyche, and Joe Gibbs. Following the game, NBC aired a special one-hour episode of 3rd Rock from the Sun, which opened live at the game site with Gumbel playing himself before he was \\"attacked\\" by show star John Lithgow. During the game, NBC (partnering with Silicon Graphics Inc.) would include real-time 3D computer graphics on SGI's Onyx2 computers to display a model of Qualcomm Stadium and simulating real-time animation of things such as receiver patterns and yards after the catch; along with a second model known as \\"Football Guy\\" which allowed viewers to see defensive players from the quarterback's vantage point, with those replays handled by Randy Cross. NBC's rebound in overall ratings in both the 1980s and 1990s (after years of being in the bottom of the ratings cellar) was attributed in part to its continuing coverage of the NFL. But with television contract re-negotiations in early 1998 ushering in the era of multibillion-dollar broadcasting agreements, an era of pro football broadcasting would soon come to an unceremonious conclusion. Neal Pilson, former president of CBS Sports, said that \\"Four years later the negative impact was so severe that CBS went to the NFL and said, 'Name your price and we'll pay whatever to get a package' ... We lost affiliates, ratings, the male audience and a lot of sports sponsorships\\". In November 1996, Sean McManus (son of ABC Sports broadcast legend Jim McKay and proteg√© of longtime ABC Sports executive Roone Arledge) was named President of CBS Sports, and would lead CBS' efforts in re-acquiring broadcast rights to the NFL. On January 12, 1998, CBS agreed to a contract with the NFL to broadcast American Football Conference games effective with the 1998 season (taking over the rights from NBC), paying $4 billion over eight years ($500 million per season). In the last year NBC had rights to the AFC, the Denver Broncos, an original AFL team, defeated the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XXXII, which aired on NBC and ended a 13-year drought against the NFC in the Super Bowl. Around the time CBS took over the rights to the AFC saw the trend of the 1980s and 1990s reverse, in that the AFC became the dominant conference over the NFC (1998 also saw the Broncos win the Super Bowl). The New England Patriots dynasty in the 2000s in the only AFC-only top-ten market also contributed to the ratings surge. In fact, the primary stations for both the Broncos and Patriots are the same ‚Äì KCNC-TV in Denver, and WBZ-TV in Boston, prior to the two stations switching to CBS in 1995 through the network's affiliation deal with Westinghouse ‚Äì as when NBC carried the AFC (KUSA and WHDH-TV carried those teams' games from 1995 to 1998). As previously mentioned, NBC's consecutive 33-year run as a football broadcaster came to an end with Super Bowl XXXII, played on January 25, 1998 between the Denver Broncos and Green Bay Packers. The Broncos won 31‚Äì24 to snap the AFC's 13-year losing streak in the Super Bowl (since then, the AFC has won eleven additional Super Bowls to the NFC's seven). Following the game, NBC aired a special one-hour episode of 3rd Rock from the Sun, which opened live at the game site with Greg Gumbel playing himself before he was \\"attacked\\" by show star John Lithgow as his Dick Solomon character, warning about the invasion of alien females that was part of the episode's plotline. NBC, meanwhile, had indicated a desire to bid for Monday Night Football rights in 1998, but eventually gave up, allowing ABC to retain the rights. In addition, the current AFC deal also saw CBS indirectly acquire rights to air most games played by the Pittsburgh Steelers, which air locally on KDKA-TV (a longtime CBS affiliate, which became a CBS O&O; after parent company Westinghouse Electric Corporation bought CBS in late 1995 and has long been one of CBS's strongest stations) and often get the highest television ratings for an NFL franchise due to the team's rabid fanbase on a national level. Coincidentally, before the AFL‚ÄìNFL merger (when the Steelers went to the AFC voluntarily to balance out the number of teams between conferences), Steelers road games had aired on KDKA-TV as part of the network's deal to air NFL games, while league rules at the time mandated that home games could not be televised at all during this period, even if they did sell out tickets. After acquiring the new package, CBS Sports then named former NFL Today host Greg Gumbel, as their lead play-by-play announcer (Gumbel had moved to NBC Sports, where he worked from 1994 to 1998 after CBS lost the NFL to Fox). Phil Simms (who at the time, was at NBC as part of the lead announcing team alongside Dick Enberg and Paul Maguire) was hired as the lead color commentator. On September 6, 1998, after 1,687 days since the last broadcast of The NFL Today, host Jim Nantz welcomed back viewers to CBS for its coverage of the National Football League. Given the challenge of making its coverage of the American Football Conference different from that of NBC, CBS passed over longtime NBC veterans Charlie Jones and Bob Trumpy in favor of newcomers such as Ian Eagle and Steve Tasker. According to CBS Sports executive producer Terry Ewert, \\"We wanted to forge our own way and go in a different direction. We wanted to make decisions on a new way of looking at things.\\" In one stark difference from NBC, CBS used a score and clock graphic for its NFL games that was constant during the game broadcasts outside of break tosses, a la the FoxBox. CBS' contribution was dubbed the EyeBox. \\"When CBS got the NFL back (in 1997), everything picked up again\\", Pilson said. On November 8, 1998, CBS televised the first NFL game to be broadcast in high-definition, between the New York Jets and Buffalo Bills at Giants Stadium. It was also the first time two Heisman Trophy winning quarterbacks started against each other in the NFL (Vinny Testaverde for the Jets and Doug Flutie for the Bills). In 1998, as Disney began consolidating ESPN and ABC Sports, ESPN's NFL coverage began using themes associated with Monday Night Football such as \\"Heavy Action\\". In- game use of these themes ended after 2000, in favor of another original theme also referred to as \\"Sirens\\" (for featuring sirens prominently) by The Herbaliser. Also 1998, Lesley Visser became the first female commentator on Monday Night Football. She had been the first female beat writer in the NFL when she covered the New England Patriots for the Boston Globe in the mid-1970s, and was the first and only woman to handle a Super Bowl Trophy presentation when she was a sportscaster with CBS. Visser was followed by several women, notably Melissa Stark and Lisa Guerrero, on the sideline who were perceived as \\"eye candy\\", none of whom affected the ratings. For the 1998 season, ABC pushed Monday Night Football back an hour (it has usually aired at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time). A special pre-game show was created, Monday Night Blast, hosted by Chris Berman from the ESPN Zone restaurant in Baltimore. The game would start around 8:20 p.m. Eastern for this particular season. Despite leaving the booth, Frank Gifford stayed on one more year as a special contributor to the pre-game show, usually presenting a single segment. Also beginning in 1998, ESPN broadcast the entire slate of Sunday night games (now officially rebranded as ESPN Sunday Night Football), and had exclusive rights to any night game other than the season opener and regular Monday night games, which aired on ABC. Thus, ESPN would usually have a few weekends each season with games on both Saturday (sometimes Thursday instead) and Sunday nights. Also in 1998, Paul Maguire joined Mike Patrick and Joe Theismann in the booth after re-joining ESPN after several years as a color commentator for NBC. A mildly infamous incident came during the final 1998 telecast when Dierdorf asked Michaels, prior to a halftime interview with Buffalo Bills quarterback Doug Flutie, \\"Are you gonna tell 'em how you're sick of all this B.C. [Boston College] stuff?\\" Michaels (thinking that they had gone into a commercial break and that his microphone was off) replied, \\"No shit.\\" Nielsen ratings data for the first 17 weeks of the 1998‚Äì99 television season showed that Monday Night Football averaged a 13.9 rating, down 8% from the 15.0 average rating for the broadcasts in 1997 ‚Äì the previous standard in ratings futility. In actuality, MNF ratings had been hitting all-time record lows for the previous four years. =1999= Super Bowl XXXIII was broadcast in the United States by Fox and featured the broadcast team of play-by-play announcer Pat Summerall and color commentator John Madden. James Brown hosted all the events with help from his then-fellow Fox NFL Sunday cast members Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long and Cris Collinsworth. Miami became the first Super Bowl host city to have games televised by all four major American broadcast networks. CBS televised Super Bowls II and X (and later XLI and XLIV), NBC televised Super Bowls III, V, XIII, and XXIII, and ABC televised Super Bowl XXIX. With this appearance, the Broncos became the first team to play in Super Bowls televised on all four major broadcast networks in the United States. CBS televised the Broncos' losses in Super Bowls XII, XXI, and XXIV (and later their Super Bowl 50 victory), ABC their loss in Super Bowl XXII, and NBC their win in Super Bowl XXXII. The Pittsburgh Steelers became the second with their appearance in Super Bowl XLV, and the New York Giants the third with their appearance in Super Bowl XLVI. The starting lineups were shown using a virtual TV. To TV viewers, it appeared as if the end zone opened up and a giant TV came up out of the ground. The virtual TV displayed video announcing the starting lineups. The virtual TV effect was provided by PVI Virtual Media Services using their L-VIS virtual graphics system. Beginning in 1999, Suzy Kolber, who had recently rejoined ESPN from Fox Sports, served as the sideline reporter; Kolber replaced Solomon Wilcots, who joined CBS as a color commentator. Boomer Esiason replaced Frank Gifford on Monday Night Football in 1998, and Dan Dierdorf left for a return to CBS in 1999. Esiason's relationship with Al Michaels was questioned leading to his firing. Esiason and Michaels reportedly never got along, and it led to ABC firing Esiason shortly after calling Super Bowl XXXIV together. Also beginning in 1999, Monday Night Football telecasts used a computer-generated yellow line to mark where a team needs to get a first down, a method first used by ABC sister cable channel ESPN. 1999 also saw the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game being moved from Saturday afternoon to Monday night. It would remain on Monday night through 2005.

Afterward, RT blames anti-racist protesters for violence and promotes two videos shot at the event. * May 2: A second rally is held in Buffalo, New York, protesting the death of India Cummings. Like the April 4 rally, the event is heavily promoted by the IRA's Blacktivist Facebook account, including attempted outreach to local activists. * May 21: Two competing rallies are held in Houston to alternately protest against and defend the recently opened Library of Islamic Knowledge at the Islamic Da'wah Center. The \\"Stop Islamization of Texas\\" rally is organized by the Facebook group \\"Heart of Texas\\". The Facebook posting for the event encourages participants to bring guns. A spokesman for the group converses with the Houston Press via email but declines to give a name. The other rally, \\"Save Islamic Knowledge\\", is organized by the Facebook group \\"United Muslims of America\\" for the same time and location. Both Facebook groups are later revealed to be IRA accounts. * May 25: The Westboro Baptist Church holds its annual protest of Lawrence High School graduation ceremonies in Lawrence, Kansas. The \\"LGBT United\\" Facebook group organizes counterprotesters to confront the Westboro protest, including by placing an ad on Facebook and contacting local people. About a dozen people show up.

Local activists contact Don't Shoot. After being pressed on who they are and who supports them, Don't Shoot agrees to move the protest to the St. Anthony police headquarters. The concerned local activists investigate further and urge protesters not to participate after deciding Don't Shoot is a \\"total troll job.\\" Don't Shoot organizers eventually relinquish control of the event to local organizers, who subsequently decline to accept any money from Don't Shoot. * July 9: The \\"Support Hillary, Save American Muslims\\" rally occurs in Washington, D.C.

Hacking incidents  ; 2013 * Apparent security hackers gain access to the Trump Organization's domain registrar account at GoDaddy and register hundreds of \\"shadow\\" subdomains with IP addresses located at a company in St. Petersburg, Russia, known for hosting websites containing malware. In November 2017, the subdomains disappeared after the Trump Organization was notified of the issue, although the company denies that any breach occurred. August is specifically noted. ; 2015 * Summer: Hackers linked to the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) gain access to the Democratic National Committee's computer network. Dutch intelligence services alert their U.S. counterparts that a hacking group known as Cozy Bear has penetrated the Democratic National Committee (DNC) servers. * September: An FBI special agent reports to the DNC that at least one of its computer systems has been hacked by an espionage team linked to the Russian government. The agent is transferred to a tech-support contractor at the help desk, who makes a cursory check of DNC server logs and does not reply to the agent's follow-up calls, allegedly because of a belief that the call might have been a prank. ; 2016 * March 15: In Moscow, Russian military intelligence hacker Ivan Yermakov, working for Fancy Bear, begins probing the DNC computer network. * March 19: Podesta is asked to change his email password in an apparent phishing attempt, believed to be spearheaded by Russian hackers.

Fancy Bear, in particular, is suspected of affiliation with Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU). * May 4: Starting May 4, and continuing through September, a pair of servers owned by Alfa-Bank look up the Trump Organization's \`mail1.trump-email.com\` domain on a server housed by Listrak and administered by Cendyn more than 2,000 times. Alfa-Bank performed the most lookups during this period, followed by Spectrum Health, and then Heartland Payment Systems with 76 lookups; beyond that no other visible entity made more than two. * May 25: Thousands of DNC emails are stolen. * June: The FBI sends a warning to states about \\"bad actors\\" probing state voter-registration databases and systems to seek vulnerabilities; investigators believe Russia is responsible. * June 8: The DCLeaks website comes online. * June 11‚Äì12: The DNC expels Russian hackers from its servers. Some of the hackers had been accessing the DNC network for over a year. * June 14: The DNC publicly alleges that they have been hacked by Russian state-backed hackers.

Smith sends an encrypted email to an undisclosed list of recipients that includes Trump campaign co- chair Sam Clovis. The email says that after two days of meetings in D.C. on Clinton's private email server, he determined that the server was hacked by \\"State-related players\\" as well as private mercenaries. He writes, \\"Parties with varying interests, are circling to release ahead of the election.\\" * August 29: The Washington Post is the first to report that Illinois discovered in July that its voter registration servers were hacked, and that the user ID and password of an Arizona election official in Gila County was stolen in June. Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan shut down the state's voter registration system for a week but did not find that any state or county systems were compromised. * August 31: Smith sends an email to an undisclosed list of recipients in which he claims KLS Research met with parties who had access to Clinton's missing emails, including some with \\"ties and affiliations to Russia\\". Mueller's team is unable to determine whether such meetings occurred or find any evidence that Smith's team was in contact with Russian hackers. * September 3‚Äì5: Wealthy Republican donor Peter W. Smith gathers a team to try to acquire the 30,000 deleted Clinton emails from hackers. He believes Clinton's private email server was hacked and copies of the emails were stolen. Among the people recruited are former GCHQ information-security specialist Matt Tait, alt-right activist Charles C. Johnson, former Business Insider CTO and alt-right activist Pax Dickinson, \\"dark web expert\\" Royal O'Brien, and Jonathan Safron. Tait quickly abandons the team after learning the true purpose of the endeavor. Hackers contacted in the search include \\"Guccifer 2.0\\" and Andrew Auernheimer (a.k.a. \\"weev\\"). The team finds five groups of hackers claiming to have the emails. Two of the groups are Russian. Flynn is in email contact with the team. Smith commits suicide on May 14, 2017, about ten days after telling the story to The Wall Street Journal but before the story is published in June. * September 4‚Äì5: At the 2016 G20 Hangzhou summit, Obama confronts Putin about Russian cyber attacks, telling him to stop.

The new domain does not appear to have been previously active and the PTR record did not include the new, alternate name. According to \\"Max\\"'s data, the Alfa-Bank server only looked up the new domain once. Spectrum Health never succeeded in relocating the Trump server through the new route. * September 29: FBI Director James Comey testifies before the House Judiciary Committee, confirming that federal investigators have detected suspicious activities in voter registration databases, as stated in the August 18 alert. * October 31: Slate publishes an article by Franklin Foer alleging that a Trump server was in suspicious contact with Alfa-Bank in Russia. Snopes examined the story and rated it \\"Unproven\\". Several cyber security experts saw nothing nefarious, while the FBI was still investigating the matter: \\"One U.S. official said investigators find the server relationship 'odd' and are not ignoring it. But the official said there is still more work for the FBI to do. Investigators have not yet determined whether a connection would be significant.\\" * November: The GRU targets over 120 Florida election officials' email accounts with spearphishing attacks. They receive emails purportedly from VR Systems, the state's voter registration and election results service provider, asking them to open a purported Word document containing a trojan. At least some emails contain British spellings and come from Gmail accounts, which VR Systems doesn't use. Many of the emails are flagged by spam filters. They also receive an email from VR's chief operating officer warning them about the malicious emails. Later, the FBI believes one county government's network was compromised in a way that would have given security hackers the ability to alter voter registration data, but this is disputed by state election officials. * November 4: Mother Jones reports that an October security sweep of the DNC offices in Washington, D.C., discovered a signal that may have belonged to a device outside the office that could intercept cell phone calls. The DNC says details of the security sweep were passed on to the FBI and \\"another agency with three letters,\\" but no device was ever found. * November‚ÄìDecember: After the election, a Russian hacker breaks into Election Assistance Commission servers and steals the login credentials for over 100 users.

Kilimnik writes that Deripaska is paying significantly more attention to the campaign and expects him to reach out to Manafort soon. Using his official Trump campaign email address, Manafort asks Kilimnik to forward an offer to provide \\"private briefings\\" to Deripaska. * July 24: Appearing on This Week, Manafort denies there are any links between him, Trump, or the \\"campaign and Putin and his regime\\". * July 29: Kilimnik sends Manafort an email requesting to meet in person so he can brief Manafort on a meeting he had \\"with the guy who gave you your biggest black caviar jar several years ago\\", saying he has important messages to deliver from this person. In September 2017, The Washington Post reports that investigators believe Kilimnik and Manafort used the term \\"black caviar\\" in communications as a reference to expected payments from former clients. In December 2018, TIME magazine reveals that the names \\"Victor\\" and \\"V.\\" mentioned in the emails between Kilimnik and Manafort refer to Deripaska aide and former Russian intelligence officer Commander Viktor A. Boyarkin. In 2018, Manafort tells Mueller's team that \\"the guy\\" was Yanukovych, who gave him a $30,000‚Äì$40,000 jar of caviar in 2010 to celebrate being elected President of Ukraine. * July 31: Kilimnik again emails Manafort to confirm their dinner meeting in New York, saying he needs two hours \\"because it is a long caviar story to tell.\\" * August 2: Manafort, Gates, and Kilimnik meet at the Grand Havana Room of 666 Fifth Avenue in New York City. ...the longtime acquaintances \\"talked about bills unpaid by our clients, about [the] overall situation in Ukraine...and about the current news,\\" including the presidential campaign, according to a statement provided by Kilimnik... This meeting is considered the \\"heart\\" of Mueller‚Äôs probe, per February 2019 reporting. Manafort gives Kilimnik polling data and a briefing on campaign strategy, and, according to Gates, discusses the \\"battleground\\" states Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Manafort asks Kilimnik to pass the data to pro-Russian Ukrainians Serhiy Lyovochkin and Rinat Akhmetov. Kilimnik gives Manafort a message from Yanukovych about a peace plan for Ukraine that is an opportunity for Russian control of the region. The plan would require Trump's support and Manafort's influence in Europe. The two discuss Manafort's financial disputes with Deripaska and the Opposition Bloc in Ukraine. They leave separately to avoid media reporting on Manafort's connections to Kilimnik. * August 3: A private jet carrying Deripaska's family arrives at Newark Liberty International Airport near New York City a little after midnight New York time and returns to Moscow that afternoon. The trip's timing is considered suspicious because it is within hours of Manafort's meeting with Kilimnik. In 2018, a spokesperson for Deripaska confirms the flights and passengers. * August 14: The New York Times reports that Manafort's name has been found in the Ukrainian \\"black ledger\\". The ledger, belonging to the Ukrainian Party of Regions, shows $12.7 million in undisclosed cash payments to Manafort from 2007 to 2012. Manafort's lawyer, Richard A. Hibey, says Manafort never received \\"any such cash payments\\". The Associated Press later verifies some of the entries against financial records. * August 19: ** Manafort resigns as Trump's campaign manager, but continues to advise Gates, Kushner, Bannon, and Trump until the election. ** Volodymyr Ariev, a member of the Ukrainian parliament, formally asks the Prosecutor General of Ukraine to investigate Kilimnik based on media reports of his connections to Viktor Yanukovych and Russian intelligence. * September: The FBI makes a second attempt to recruit Deripaska as an informant on Manafort, the Kremlin, and Russian organized crime in exchange for a U.S. visa. * November: Manafort and Gates falsely assert in writing to the Justice Department that their work for the Ukrainian government did not require registering as foreign agents in the United States. In September 2018, Manafort pleads guilty to lying to the Justice Department about the extent of his work for Ukraine. * December 8: Kilimnik sends Manafort a detailed email about the proposed Ukrainian peace plan. He writes that the plan is ready to move forward if Trump appoints Manafort as a \\"special representative\\" to manage it, that \\"[Yanukovych] guarantees your reception at the very top level\\" in Russia, and that \\"[Trump] could have peace in Ukraine basically within a few months after inauguration.\\" ; 2017 * January 12: Manafort returns to the U.S. after meeting with Deripaska deputy Georgiy Oganov in Madrid, where they discussed global politics and \\"recreating [the] old friendship\\" between Manafort and Deripaska. * January 15: Manafort emails McFarland, copying Flynn, about \\"some important information I want to share that I picked up on my travels over the last month.\\" Flynn advises McFarland not to respond. In 2018, Manafort tells Mueller's team that he was referring to Cuba, which he had visited along with other countries at the time, and not Russia or Ukraine. * January 18/19: McClatchy and The New York Times report that Manafort, Page and Stone have been under investigation by the FBI, NSA, CIA, and FinCEN, based on intercepted Russian communications and financial transactions. Sources say \\"the investigators have accelerated their efforts in recent weeks but have found no conclusive evidence of wrongdoing.\\"  Papadopoulos, Mifsud, Polonskaya, Timofeev, Millian, Halper and Downer  George Papadopoulos was an advisor to the Trump campaign on foreign policy.

Clovis tells Papadopoulos that improving relations with Russia is a top foreign policy goal. * March 14: Papadopoulos first meets Mifsud while in Rome on a trip to visit officials affiliated with Link Campus University as part of his job at the LCILP. After Papadopoulos mentions his position with the Trump campaign, Mifsud shows more interest, and offers to introduce him to European leaders and other people with contacts to the Russian government. * March 17: Papadopoulos returns to London from his Rome trip. * March 21: In a Washington Post interview, Trump names members of his foreign policy team, including Papadopoulos and Page. * March 24: ** In London, Papadopoulos meets Mifsud and Olga Polonskaya, who falsely claims to be Putin's niece. Polonskaya tells Papadopoulos that she is a friend of the Russian ambassador in London and offers to help establish contacts with Russia. Papadopoulos leaves the meeting with the expectation that he will be introduced to the Russian ambassador, but it never occurs. Polonskaya is in regular email contact with Papadopoulos, in one message writing, \\"We are all very excited by the possibility of a good relationship with Mr. Trump\\". ** Papadopoulos emails Trump campaign officials about his new Russian contacts. He emails Trump's foreign policy team that he met with Putin's niece and the Russian ambassador in London, and claims the ambassador also acts as the Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia. He writes that the Russian leadership wants to meet with campaign officials in a \\"neutral\\" city or Moscow \\"to discuss U.S.-Russia ties under President Trump\\", and that Putin and the Russian leadership are ready to meet with Trump. Clovis replies that he thinks any meetings with Russians should be delayed until after the campaign has a chance to talk with NATO allies and \\"we have everyone on the same page.\\" ** Papadopoulos searches Google for information on Polonskaya and discovers that she is not Putin's niece. * March 29: Polonskaya attempts to send Papadopoulos a text message that was drafted by Mifsud. The message addresses Papadopoulos's \\"wish to engage with the Russian Federation.\\" * March 31: The first meeting of Trump's foreign policy team is held at the yet-to- open Trump International Hotel Washington, D.C.. With Trump and Sessions in attendance, Papadopoulos speaks of his connections with Russia, and offers to negotiate a meeting between Trump and Putin. Sessions later states he opposed the idea, and two people who were present support his assertions, but differ in what he objected to and how strongly. In late summer 2017 Papadopoulos and Gordon tell Mueller's team that Trump was \\"supportive and receptive to the idea of a meeting with Putin,\\" and that Sessions supported Papadopoulos's efforts to arrange a meeting. Papadopoulos's lawyers assert in a September 2018 court filing that Trump nodded in agreement to the offer, and that Sessions said the campaign should look into it. * April 10‚Äì11: Papadopoulos learns of Polonskaya's attempt to send him a text message on March 29 and sends her an email to arrange another meeting. She responds that she is \\"back in St. Petersburg\\" but \\"would be very pleased to support [Papadopoulos's] initiatives between our two countries\\" and \\"to meet [him] again.\\" Papadopoulos replies that she should introduce him to \\"the Russian Ambassador in London\\" to talk to him or \\"anyone else you recommend, about a potential foreign policy trip to Russia.\\" Mifsud is copied on the email exchange. Mifsud writes, \\"This is already been agreed. I am flying to Moscow on the 18th for a Valdai meeting, plus other meetings at the Duma. We will talk tomorrow.\\" Polonskaya responds that she has \\"already alerted my personal links to our conversation and your request,\\" that \\"we are all very excited the possibility of a good relationship with Mr. Trump,\\" and that \\"[t]he Russian Federation would love to welcome him once his candidature would be officially announced.\\" * April 12: Papadopoulos and Mifsud meet at the Andaz Hotel in London. * April 18: While in Moscow, Mifsud introduces Papadopoulos to Ivan Timofeev via email. Timodeev is the program director of the Kremlin-sponsored Valdai Discussion Club and a member of the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC). Papadopoulos and Timofeev communicate for months over email and Skype about potential meetings between Russian government officials and members of the Trump campaign. Later records indicate that Timofeev discussed Papadopoulos with former Russian Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov. In August 2017, Papadopoulos tells Mueller's team that he believed at the time his conversations with Timofeev were monitored. * April 22: Timofeev thanks Papadopoulos \\"for an extensive talk\\" and proposes meeting in London or Moscow. * April 25: ** Timofeev emails Papadopoulos that he spoke to Ivanov, \\"the President of RIAC and former Foreign Minister of Russia,\\" and relays Ivanov's advice on how best to arrange a \\"Moscow visit.\\" ** Before the second Mifsud meeting, Papadopoulos emails Stephen Miller, informing him that \\"[t]he Russian government has an open invitation by Putin for Mr. Trump to meet him when he is ready\\" and that \\"[t]he advantage of being in London is that these governments tend to speak a bit more openly in 'neutral' cities.\\" ** Papadopoulos meets Mifsud in London again at the Andaz Hotel. Mifsud claims that he has learned that Russians are in possession of thousands of stolen emails that may be politically damaging to Clinton. This is the first of at least two times the Trump campaign is told Russia has \\"dirt\\" on Hillary Clinton. Two months later the Russian hacking is publicly revealed. * April 27: ** Trump speaks at the Mayflower Hotel at the invitation of The National Interest, the magazine of the CNI. He delivers a speech that calls for improved relations between the US and Russia. The speech was edited by Papadopoulos and crafted with the assistance of Simes Index for Proof of Collusion. and Richard Burt. Burt is a board member of the CNI and a lobbyist for Gazprom. Papadopoulos brings the speech to the attention of Mifsud and Polonskaya, and tells Timofeev that it should be considered \\"the signal to meet\\". Simes later moves to Moscow. ** Papadopoulos emails Stephen Miller that he has \\"some interesting messages coming in from Moscow about a trip when the time is right.\\" ** Papadopoulos tells Lewandowski via email that he has \\"been receiving a lot of calls over the last month about Putin wanting to host [Trump] and the team when the time is right.\\" * May 4: Timofeev emails Papadopoulos that his colleagues from the ministry \\"are open for cooperation.\\" Papadopoulos forwards the email to Lewandowski and asks whether this is \\"something we want to move forward with.\\" * May 5: Papadopoulos forwards Timofeev's email to Clovis, who replies, \\"[t]here are legal issues we need to mitigate, meeting with foreign officials as a private citizen.\\" * May 6: In London, during a night of heavy drinking, Papadopoulos tells Australian ambassador Alexander Downer that the Russians have politically damaging material on Clinton.

He writes: \\"Russia has been eager to meet Mr. Trump for quite sometime and have been reaching out to me to discuss.\\" Manafort shoots down the idea in an email to Rick Gates, with a note: \\"Let[']s discuss. We need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips. It should be someone low level in the Campaign so as not to send any signal.\\" * May 27‚Äì28: Putin makes an official visit to Greece and meets with President Prokopios Pavlopoulos, Defense Minister Panagiotis Kammenos, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, and Foreign Minister Nikolaos Kotzias. His visit overlaps with a trip to Greece by Papadopoulos, during which Kammenos introduces him to Pavlopoulos, Kotzias, and a former prime minister. * June 1: Papadopoulos emails Lewandowski asking whether he wants to have a call about a Russia visit and whether \\"we were following up with it.\\" Lewandowski refers him to Clovis. Papadopoulos emails Clovis about more interest from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to set up a Trump meeting in Russia. He writes, \\"I have the Russian MFA asking me if Mr. Trump is interested in visiting Russia at some point.\\" He continues that he \\"[w]anted to pass this info along to you for you to decide what's best to do with it and what message I should send (or to ignore).\\" * June 19: After communicating with the MFA via email and Skype, Papadopoulos tells Lewandowski by email that the MFA is interested in meeting with a \\"campaign rep\\" if Trump can't meet with them. Papadopoulos offers to go in an unofficial capacity. * July 11‚Äì12: Papadopoulos and fellow campaign foreign policy advisor Walid Phares exchange emails discussing the upcoming Transatlantic Parliamentary Group on Counterterrorism (TAG) conference, of which Phares is also co-secretary general. In the email chain, Phares advises Papadopoulos that other summit attendees \\"are very nervous about Russia. So be aware.\\" * July 15: Sergei Millian reaches out to Papadopoulos on LinkedIn, introducing himself \\"as president of [the] New York-based Russian American Chamber of Commerce.\\" He claims to have \\"insider knowledge and direct access to the top hierarchy in Russian politics.\\" * July 16: Papadopoulos, Clovis, and Phares attend the TAG conference. Contemporaneous handwritten notes in Papadopoulos's journal show that he, Clovis, and Phares discuss potential September meetings with representatives of the \\"office of Putin\\" in London. The notes say they will attend as unofficial campaign representatives. Later Clovis tells a grand jury that he does not recall attending the TAG conference, although a photograph from the conference shows him seated next to Papadopoulos. * July 22‚Äì26: Papadopoulos asks Timofeev about Millian. Timofeev responds that he hasn't heard of him. * July 26: The Australian government informs the U.S. government of Papadopoulos's May 6 interactions with their ambassador in London, prompting the FBI to start investigating potential coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign on July 31. * July 30: Papadopoulos meets with Millian in New York City. * July 31: Papadopoulos emails Trump campaign official Bo Denysyk saying that he has been contacted \\"by some leaders of Russian-American voters here in the US about their interest in voting for Mr. Trump.\\" He asks whether he should put Denysyk in contact with their group (the US-Russia chamber of commerce). Denysyk responds that Papadopoulos should \\"hold off with outreach to Russian-Americans\\" because \\"too many articles\\" portray the campaign, Manafort, and Trump as \\"pro- Russian.\\" * July 31 ‚Äì August 2: The FBI sends two agents to London who interview Downer about his interactions with Papadopoulos. * August 1: Papadopoulos meets with Millian a second time in New York City. * August 2‚Äì3: Millian invites Papadopoulos to attend and possibly speak at two international energy conferences, including one in Moscow in September. Papadopoulos does not attend the conferences. * August 15: Papadopoulos emails Clovis about requests he received from multiple foreign governments, \\"even Russia[],\\" for \\"closed door workshops/consultations abroad.\\" He asks if there is still interest for himself, Clovis, and Phares \\"to go on that trip.\\" Clovis copies Phares and tells Papadopoulos that he can't \\"travel before the election\\", writing, \\"I would encourage you [and Walid Phares to] make the trip, if it is feasible.\\" The trip never occurs. * August 23: Millian sends a Facebook message to Papadopoulos offering to \\"share with you a disruptive technology that might be instrumental in your political work for the campaign.\\" In September 2017, Papadopoulos tells the FBI he does not recall the matter. * August 31 or September 1: FBI informant Stefan Halper meets with Trump advisor Sam Clovis, who stated they talked about China. * September: ** The Egyptian Embassy in Washington, D.C., reaches out to Papadopoulos expressing Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's interest in meeting Trump. With Bannon's approval, Papadopoulos arranges a meeting between Trump and el-Sisi at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. While the meeting does not appear to relate to campaign contacts with Russia, it highlights that Papadopoulos was more than a \\"coffee boy\\", as Trump campaign officials later claim. ** Mifsud hires Mangiante to work for the LCILP, on Pittella's recommendation. Papadopoulos, a former employee of the Centre, contacts her via LinkedIn. They begin dating in March 2017. * September 9: Papadopoulos contacts deputy communications director Bryan Lanza about a request from Interfax for an interview with Ksenia Baygarova. Lanza approves the interview. * Mid-September: Papadopoulos approaches British government officials asking for a meeting with senior ministers.

British officials conclude he is not a major player and discontinue contact. * September 15: Papadopoulos meets with Stefan Halper's research assistant Azra Turk for drinks in London. She asks him questions about whether the Trump campaign was working with Russia. Papadopoulos becomes suspicious about her line of questioning, and comes to believe Turk is an intelligence agent, possibly from Turkey. In May 2019, The New York Times reports that Turk was an undercover FBI agent supervising Halper's inquiries into possible connections between the Trump Campaign and Russia. * September 25: Halper asks Papadopoulos if he is aware of any efforts by Russians to interfere with the 2016 election; Papadopoulos twice denies it. * September 30: Ksenia Baygarova interviews Papadopoulos for Interfax on Trump's foreign policy positions in relation to Russia.

Baygarova later tells The Washington Post that she had been tasked to interview a representative from each campaign. She says Papadopoulos was the only person from the Trump campaign to respond. She describes him as not very experienced. Adverse publicity generated by the interview leads to Papadopoulous being fired from the campaign in October. * November: Mangiante quits the LCILP after complaining to Mifsud about not being paid her salary. * November 9: Papadopoulos and Millian make arrangements to meet in Chicago to discuss business opportunities, including with Russian \\"billionaires who are not under sanctions.\\" * November 14: Papadopoulos and Millian meet at the Chicago Trump International Hotel and Tower.

Papadopoulos declines the offer, saying he is only interested in private sector jobs. Later, Papadopoulos said he refused the job because he knew it was unethical and possibly illegal, and feared it might have been an FBI setup.  Goldstone, Veselnitskaya and the Trump Tower meeting  Rob Goldstone is the British publicist for Russian pop singer Emin Agalarov, son of real estate magnate Aras Agalarov who had organized Miss Universe 2013 in Moscow with Trump. In 2016 Goldstone made several overtures to the Trump campaign, offering notably to arrange a meeting between Trump and Putin. In June he set up the Trump Tower meeting, in which Natalia Veselnitskaya was supposed to deliver political \\"dirt\\" on Hillary Clinton. Instead, she discussed the Magnitsky Act. Ike Kaveladze, a Georgian-American senior vice president at the Crocus Group, also attended the meeting. ; 2015 * July 22: Trump receives an invitation to Moscow for the 60th birthday of Aras Agalarov, who co-hosted the Miss Universe pageant with him in 2013. * July 24: Trump's assistant Rhona Graff replies that Trump is unlikely to attend the birthday party due to his campaign schedule. Goldstone suggests that Emin Agalarov could arrange a meeting between Putin and Trump if he comes. ; 2016 * January 19: Goldstone emails Trump Jr. and Graff, suggesting to promote Trump's candidacy on VKontakte (VK), Russia's most prominent social network.

Vladimir Yakunin, under U.S. sanctions, is also present. Rohrabacher later says he met Yakunin at the request of Kislyak. He also meets with officials at the Russian Prosecutor General's office, where he receives a document full of accusations against Magnitsky. U.S. Embassy officials are worried Rohrabacher may be meeting with FSB agents. The meeting at the prosecutor's office is not on his itinerary. The document is given to Rohrabacher by Deputy Prosecutor Viktor Grin, who is under U.S. sanctions authorized by the Magnitsky Act. Rohrabacher subsequently uses the document in efforts to undermine the Magnitsky Act. His accepting the document from Grin, a sanctioned individual, and using it to influence U.S. government policy leads to a July 21, 2017, complaint being filed against Rohrabacher and his staff director, Paul Behrends, for violating Magnitsky Act sanctions. ** While in Moscow with Rohrabacher, Rohrabacher's aide Paul Behrends introduces Congressman French Hill to Veselnitskaya and Rinat Akhmetshin. Veselnitskaya gives Hill a document nearly identical to the one Grin gave to Rohrabacher. * May: A new American shell company, \\"Silver Valley Consulting\\", is set up by Russian-born accountant Ilya Bykov for Aras Agalarov. * Early June: Before traveling to New York to translate at the June 9 Trump Tower meeting, Kaveladze contacts Roman Beniaminov, a close associate of Emin Agalarov, to find out why Kushner, Manafort, and Trump Jr. were invited to a meeting ostensibly about the Magnitsky Act. Beniaminov tells Kaveladze that he heard Goldstone and Agalarov discuss \\"dirt\\" on Clinton. In November 2017, Kaveladze's lawyer tells The Daily Beast that Beniaminov was Kaveladze's only source of information about the meeting. * June 3: ** Aras Agalarov is told that the Russian government wants to give the Trump campaign damaging information about Clinton. ** Goldstone emails Trump Jr. offering, on behalf of Emin Agalarov, to meet an alleged Russian government official who \\"would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father\\", as \\"part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.\\" Trump Jr. respond 17 minutes later: \\"If it‚Äôs what you say I love it especially later in the summer,\\" and schedules the meeting. Goldstone also offers to relay the information to Trump through his assistant. This is the second time a Trump campaign official was told of \\"dirt\\" on Clinton. ** $3.3 million began moving between Aras Agalarov and Kaveladze, a longtime Agalarov employee once investigated for money laundering. * June 6: ** Goldstone follows up with Trump Jr. about when Jr. can \\"talk with Emin by phone about this Hillary info.\\" Trump Jr. calls Emin. Phone records show Trump Jr. called two blocked numbers at Trump Tower before and after calls to Emin. According to CNN, the two people Trump Jr. called were Nascar CEO Brian France and businessman Howard Lorber. ** According to Rick Gates, Trump Jr. informs the participants in a regular senior campaign staff meeting that he has a lead on damaging information about the Clinton Foundation. Gates is under the impression that the information is coming from a group in Kyrgyzstan. The other meeting participants include Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort, and Hope Hicks. Manafort, according to Gates, warns the group to be careful. In April 2018, Kushner tells Mueller's team that he doesn't remember the information being discussed before the June 9 meeting. * June 9: ** Veselnitskaya, Akhmetshin, Kaveladze, and Anatoli Samochornov meet for lunch and discuss what to say at the upcoming Trump Tower meeting. ** Kushner, Manafort and Trump Jr. meet at Trump Tower with Goldstone, Veselnitskaya, Akhmetshin, Kaveladze, and translator Samochornov. Veselnitskaya is best known for lobbying against the Magnitsky Act, an American law that blacklists suspected Russian human rights abusers. Trump Jr. later says that he asked Veselnitskaya for damaging information about the Clinton Foundation and that she had none. Samochornov, Kaveladze, and Akhmetshin later tell the Senate Judiciary Committee that Trump Jr. told Veselnitskaya to come back after they won the election. The meeting lasts approximately 20 minutes, and Manafort takes notes on his phone. * June 20: Aras Agalarov wires more than $19.5 million to his account at a bank in New York. * June 29: Goldstone again emails Scavino about promoting Trump on VKontakte.

It was released on August 15, 2016, by Big Hit Entertainment on SoundCloud.  Background and development  Prior to launching his career as the rapper Suga of South Korean boy band BTS, Agust D began writing music lyrics and working with MIDI at age 13 and held a part- time job composing and arranging music at a recording studio at age 17. Active under the name \\"Gloss\\" as an underground rapper, Agust D originally entered Big Hit Entertainment as a producer in 2010 and trained under Big Hit Entertainment for three years alongside members J-Hope and RM before making his debut as a member of BTS in 2013. In the initial years of his career in BTS, both he and his fellow group member RM faced criticism from the South Korean underground hip hop scene for \\"selling out\\" and becoming K-pop idols. Between his commitments as a member of BTS, Agust D took advantage of time on the plane and in hotel rooms after concerts to continuously produce and compose music. In an interview for Grazia Korea, Agust D expressed a desire to release the music he wanted to do without having to consider popular appeal or music ranking. He intended to release his music for free in the form of a mixtape to avoid such considerations, commenting that an album \\"has a feeling of being trapped in some sort of framework\\" due to the need for company involvement in promotion and advertising. Developing Agust D musically on the base of hip hop, much of Agust D's inspiration for the lyrics came from his own stories of dream, youth, and reality. In order to differentiate his work from that of his work as Suga, he developed the alter ego \\"Agust D\\", which is derived from the initials DT, short for his birthplace, Daegu Town, and \\"Suga\\" spelled backwards. Steadily accumulating songs in his career, Agust D utilized a number of songs composed as early as 2011 to as late as a month before release to create his mixtape. The release of Agust D followed RM's self- titled mixtape RM (2015) and the success of BTS' first compilation album The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever (2016) and The Most Beautiful Moment in Life On Stage: Epilogue Tour.  Music and lyrics  The final cut of Agust D comprises ten tracks on SoundCloud and eight tracks on streaming and download services. Critics viewed Agust D as a major departure from his previous catalog as a member of BTS with a hardcore rap style highlighting his underground influences. Billboard and Fuse complimented the album's divergence from his contemporaries in K-pop with its vulnerability and Agust D's self- production. In Agust D, Agust D exposed his inner thoughts on his beginnings to his rise to stardom. \\"Intro ; Dt sugA\\", showcasing the style of classic turntablism hip hop, preceded the self-introduction track \\"Agust D\\" which utilized fast and precise rap techniques over \\"deep and intense bass\\" to underscore his confidence and self-identity. \\"Give It to Me\\" launched into \\"full-on disses\\" towards his detractors and the subsequent \\"Skit\\" explored the duality of Agust D and Suga \\"as a human being and as a musician\\". While \\"724148\\" reflected on the meaning of \\"success\\" and Agust D's beginnings in his hometown of Daegu, the track \\"140503 at Dawn\\", composed of minimal beats, reflected on his underlying vulnerability in the early morning before transitioning into the track \\"The Last\\" which utilized dramatic beats and rap techniques to portray his soul consumed by depression, obsession, and self- hatred following the pursuit of his dream in Seoul. In \\"Tony Montana\\", Agust D took on the character of Tony Montana from the 1983 film Scarface to ruminate on the nature of success, ambition, and envy. The lyrics of \\"Interlude: Dream, Reality\\" consisted of only the word \\"dream\\", leading into the final track \\"So Far Away\\" which reflected on the essence of the word \\"dream\\" while urging his listeners to continue dreaming.  Release and commercial performance  On July 29, 2016, Agust D's release date was confirmed to be in August. On August 15, it was released on SoundCloud and for free download via links on Twitter in conjunction with a music video for \\"Agust D\\". On August 18, Agust D released a follow-up music video for \\"Give It to Me\\". Aside from interviewing for Grazia Korea and Marie Claire Korea, Agust D did not further promote the mixtape. Fuse later ranked it at #16 on their list of the 20 best mixtapes of 2016. In February 2018, the mixtape was rereleased for digital purchase and streaming sans its first two tracks. The reissue reached #3 on Billboard's World Albums Chart, #5 on the Heatseekers Albums chart, and #74 on the Top Album Sales chart. The rerelease also caused Agust D to reach #46 on the Emerging Artists chart for the week of March 3.Agust D Billboard charts:  *  Track listing  Sample credits * \\"Intro: Dt sugA\\" and \\"Agust D\\" contain a sample of \\"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\\" as performed by James Brown.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. History The earliest record held in Tangipahoa Parish describes an act of sale in the year 1822 as \\"the section of land on which Nathan Joiner now lives and was originally settled by Thomas Joiner.\\" The Joiner family are believed to have first settled the property sometime in the 1790s. Further records from the Tangipahoa parish courthouse show that a man named Alfred Hennen purchased the Zemurray property sometime in 1828, in two different land sales, one 640 acre piece was purchased from William Cooper and another 640 acre plot from Moses Moore. The Hennen family built a large home on the property and is believed to be the source of the present structure. The following is an excerpt from the National Register of Historic Places nomination: The land title changed during the following years through various heirs and relatives. In one of the transactions the land was called \\"Hennen Retreat\\". In March 1888, the property of Ann Morris Hennen was auctioned to John Albert Morris of Westchester County, New York. The property was then donated to a man named Dave Morris and was renamed \\"Morris Retreat\\". Then in the year 1918, the property was sold to the Lake Superior Piling Corporation and was renamed \\"Holtonwood\\". Charles and William Holton, the new owners of the company renovated and greatly improved the property. Samuel Zemurray Sometime in October 1928, Samuel Zemurray from New Orleans, the president of the United Fruit Company at that time, purchased the property. Howard Schilling, a local parish farmer, was employed to manage the project. His wife Sarah Zemurray, an admirer of flowers instructed Schilling to plant many rows of azaleas and camellias along the forest trails. Samuel Zemurra saw the beauty created and decided to expand the project. Over the subsequent years, the gardens increased in beauty with a majestic scenery. In the mid-1900s, the Zemurray family hired a notable architect from New Orleans named Moise Goldstein and interior designer George Gallup to improve the property. Each spring, hundreds of tourists and people from the surrounding areas would travel to the garden. Joiner Cemetery The National Register nomination describes it as a narrow wooded driveway that leads from the highway to the garden entrance. Near the entrance to the garden is a small cemetery barely visible with a towering white monument. The inscription on the monument reads, \\"Nathan Joiner and Wife, First Settlers In the Home Place\\". It is located about northeast of Hammond on Zemurray Garden Drive.

Originally called Mohyeon Jiseongmyo, the name was changed to its current state under Gyeonggi-do Decree No. 2016-205 on November 8, 2016. The dolmens were designated as Gyeonggi-do Monument No. 22 in 1974 for their historical value. The Wangsanli Dolmens are the largest and most well-preserved in all of Gyeonggi-do, showing the intricate architectural innovations of the Bronze Age. Background Known as goindol (Í≥†Ïù∏Îèå) in Korean, a dolmen is a tomb consisting of large megaliths making up a single-chamber for the dead. Along with the seokgwanmyo (literally 'stone sarcophagus'), it is one of the most prominent tomb structures of the Bronze Age. The Korean peninsula has one of the most dolmens in the world with approximately 40,000 located all over the region. There are two types of dolmens in this area, which are classified depending on the shapes and particular arrangements of the vertical megaliths and the 'table' (the flat horizontal stone that is put on top of the vertical stones): the Northern (table) style and the Southern (tile) style. The Wangsanli Dolmens are Northern style dolmens, meaning that they were made by 1) raising the vertical megaliths first to make a stone chamber, 2) placing the corpse in the chamber, and 3) putting the horizontal stone on top (thus giving it the appearance of a table, hence its other name). Southern style dolmens are made in a similar way, except the vertical megaliths are buried under the ground instead of being exposed. Description Although a total of twelve dolmens have been discovered in the Wangsanli region, as of 2019, only two have actually been examined in depth: the Wangsanli Jiseongmyo. The best-preserved dolmen has a roof stone with the length of 5.5 meters (18 ft), width of 4.4 meters (14.4 ft), and thickness of 1 meter (3.2 ft). There are three upright stones that are supporting the top, with an average height of 80 cm (2.6 ft) between them. Compared to the top stone, the sizes of the vertical megaliths are unusually small. Additionally, the outside of the stone chamber is half-buried in soil, implying that the architects piled additional earth near the dolmen to provide additional protection from outside forces. It was inferred that the dolmen was originally composed of four vertical megaliths, but one had disappeared due to unknown circumstances. The second dolmen has a smaller top stone, with a length of 4.4 meters (14.4 ft). Compared to the first dolmen, it is in a state of worse preservation; the supporting vertical stones have all collapsed. Grave goods that have been discovered include stone knives and stone arrowheads. Nearby natural monuments include the Gwangju mountain range in the east and the Gyeongancheon (Gyeongan stream) in the north (which subsequently connects to the Han River). To the west lies the Global Campus of the Hankuk University of Foreign Studies as well as the Hankuk Academy of Foreign Studies, a private boarding school.

It had already formed a network in Lincolnshire, but the route from London and points south and west of Grantham was very indirect. The line opened 1867, and was 18 miles in length, from Honington, near Grantham to Pelham Street Junction in Lincoln. Running through rural terrain, it was never heavily developed, and after nationalisation, through traffic was concentrated on a better alternative route via Newark. All local stations except Leadenham closed in 1962, and the line from Honington to Lincoln closed completely in 1965. Origins The Grantham and Lincoln railway lineIn 1848 the Great Northern Railway opened part of its authorised network, from Peterborough to Lincoln via Spalding and Boston in 1848. The GNR called this the Loop Line, or the Lincolnshire Loop. In due course it opened its Towns Line, which eventually became part of the East Coast Main Line.John Wrottesley, The Great Northern Railway: volume I: Origins and Development, B T Batsford Limited, London, 1979, The Boston, Sleaford and Midland Counties Railway opened a railway line between Grantham and Boston, through Sleaford, providing an east- west line. It opened in two stages, in 1857 and 1859, and was worked by the GNR.Neil R Wright, The Railways of Boston, Their Origins and Development, Richard Kay Publications, Boston, 1971, , pages 38 and 39 It became evident that the route from the south to Lincoln by way of Boston was rather roundabout, and the GNR gave thought to a shorter route. They were also concerned that the rival Great Eastern Railway sought to penetrate the area of Lincolnshire that the GNR dominated. Authorisation A Bill in the 1864 Parliamentary session was for the railway,Great Northern Railway (No. 2) (Lincoln to Bourn) Bill. Note that the town of Bourne had the alternate spelling at that time. in which the GNR sought powers for a line from a triangular junction at Honington to Lincoln, another from Sleaford to Bourn, and for absorption of the Boston, Sleaford and Midland Counties Railway, and the Bourne and Essendine Railway. The Sleaford--Bourn part of the proposal was rejected, but the remainder of the Bill became an Act on 25 July 1864, with new capital at ¬£310,000 for the GNR.Wrottesley, volume 1, page 150Charles H Grinling, History of the Great Northern Railway, 1845 ‚Äì 1895, Methuen and Co, London, 1898, page 207 Opening Leadenham railway stationThe line between Honington and Lincoln was opened by the GNR on 15 April 1867. It was 18 miles 2 chains in extent and was constructed by Kirk & Parry for ¬£121,533. There were stations at Caythorpe, Leadenham, Navenby, Harmston and Waddington, and the line joined the Lincolnshire Loop at Pelham Street junction, Lincoln. Board of Trade sanction was given for passenger opening, provided that a 5 mph speed limit was observed over Fulbeck bank where a slip was giving trouble, and on condition that all trains over Pelham Street crossing had a pilotman. Captain Tyler withdrew this condition on 2 August, as a satisfactory signalling and locking system had been installed there.Wrottesley, volume 1, page 165Grinling, page 233Stewart E Squires, The Lost Railways of Lincolnshire, Castlemead Publications, Ware, 1986 , page 64Robin Leleux, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 9: The East Midlands, David and Charles (Publishers) Limited, Newton Abbot, 1976, , page 198 George Hussey Packe was chairman of the GNR and lived at Caythorpe Hall; he had the right to have any train stopped at Caythorpe.Squires, page 65 Construction of this branch involved provision of a new station at Honington, built slightly to the west of the old BS&MCR; one, and with a refreshment room. Honington east curve An east-to-north curve at Honington, for direct Sleaford-Lincoln running, was partly constructed. It appears doubtful if it was ever completed or used, and it was removed about 1882.Wrottesley, pages 165 and 166Squires, pages 65 and 66 Train service Navenby railway stationThe passenger train service consisted of five trains each way on weekdays between Grantham and Lincoln and two on Sundays. The new route cut three quarters of an hour off the journey time between Lincoln and London. By 1887 the train service had increased to nine each way, but only one each way on Sundays. In 1914 there were six weekday trains from Lincoln to Grantham, of which two, the 11.22 am and the 1.50 pm conveyed through carriages to London. From London through carriages ran on the 12.30 and 4.0 pm trains. In 1938 seven trains each way were normally run but only one conveyed through carriages to London. This was the 10.28 am from Lincoln to Grantham, where it was attached to the express from Newcastle due into Kings Cross at 1.15 pm. Return was by the 5.50 pm London to Yorkshire express, reaching Grantham at 7.55 pm. It left Grantham at 8.3 pm, called at Leadenham on request to set down passengers from London only, and was due into Lincoln at 8.37 pm. Not all trains stopped at all stations; usually one or two each way were Lincoln- Grantham direct to connect with main-line services. Most timetables show that if no scheduled stop was made at Leadenham, then some would stop to pick up or set down there if required. Block system Preparations were made in 1878 for the block system of signalling on the Honington to Lincoln line. Temporary cabins were erected at the stations, later replaced by permanent boxes between 1880 and 1883. As part of the work, ironstone sidings and a signal box were brought into use at Frieston.John Wrottesley, The Great Northern Railway: volume II: Expansion and Competition, B T Batsford Limited, London, 1979, , page 69 Automatic train control system trial In 1897 the line was used for an experiment with an early form of semi-automatic train control invented by Mr Wynford Brierly. A two-lever trip connected to a bell was placed beside the cab footstep on Stirling 2-2-2 no 6 and this contacted a rocker actuated by signal wire near the signals. When at danger the signal rocker engaged the lever on the locomotive, ringing a bell in the cab and displaying a red disc below it. Although the trial proved to be successful the system was never installed on the GNR.Squires, page 67 Bracebridge Gasworks Accident There was a serious accident on the line on 25 January 1963, in which two drivers were killed. It took place at Bracebridge Gas Works, not far south of Lincoln. A steam locomotive carrying out shunting was standing on the down main line to allow an up train to pass. The signalman forgot about the engine and cleared his signals for a down train, which struck the engine at about 40 mph.Ministry of Transport, Report on the Collision that occurred on 25th January 1963 at Bracebridge Gas Sidings Signal Box near Lincoln in the Eastern Region of British Railways, Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1963 Diesel trains In the mid-1950s steam-hauled passenger trains were replaced with diesel multiple units on the line; it was one of the first routes on which this happened. Steam services were restored on some trains for a time in 1963 when Lincoln multiple units were taken temporarily to dieselise the Grantham to Nottingham service. The local goods trains remained steam hauled to the end.Squires, pages 66 to 69 Decline and closure In the 1960s the decline in local traffic could not be ignored, and all the stations on the line except Leadenham were closed to passenger traffic. Some retained their goods facilities for the time being, although Harmston closed completely. Two years later, on 15 June 1964, all stations lost their goods services other than for coal, at the time still an important resource. In 1965 Leadenham yard looked busier than it had done for many years when truckloads of steel were delivered for the construction of electricity pylons in the area. However complete closure was inevitable, and on 1 November 1965 the line closed completely between Honington and Lincoln, and through trains were diverted via Newark. For a short time afterwards, one mile of track was retained northwards from Honington Junction and used for redundant wagon storage, and until 7 December 1970 the short section from Lincoln to the Gas Works was in use.
