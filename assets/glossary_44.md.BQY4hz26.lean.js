The life mask Johann Andreas Streicher, pianist and piano-maker, and friend of Beethoven, supervised a private concert hall in Vienna, and in 1812 statues of musicians, sculptured by Klein, were placed in the hall. For the statue of Beethoven, Streicher commissioned Klein to make a life mask of Beethoven.Paul Nettl. \\"Klein, Franz\\". Beethoven Encyclopedia. Philosophical Library, New York 1956.

Early life Marchand was born in Amiens, near the frontline of the First World War. Marchand was a firefighter in Paris in the 1930s. He was a prisoner-of-war during World War II. He then moved to Venezuela, where he was a lorry driver and sugarcane planter. In the 1950s he went to Canada, where he had a job as a lumberjack. He returned to France in 1960 and worked as a gardener and wine dealer until 1987. He took an active part during the strikes of 1936 in France that gave birth to the modern era foundations of French employment legislation. He is a member of the French Communist Party and the CGT Trade Union, the longest-serving member still living, with 90 years of membership. Career Aged 35 he finished seventh in the Grand Prix des Nations in 1946. He returned to cycling in 1978 and continued training after his 100th birthday.

At the age of 105 he was recognised as the world's oldest competitive cyclist by Guinness World Records. Marchand puts his remarkable fitness and longevity down to a diet consisting of: lots of fruit and vegetables, a little meat, not too much coffee ‚Äì and an hour a day on the cycling home-trainer. After he turned 106 Marchand‚Äôs doctors advised him to stop competing for world records. He obliged, but refused to quit racing completely. In early February 2018 Marchand completed a 4,000-meter race in the same stadium where he made his last record. Marchand celebrated his 107th birthday by going for a 20-kilometre bike ride in the Ard√®che. After his 108th birthday Marchand stopped riding bikes outdoors due to hearing loss.

She started work at the ministry's offices in the Ordenspalais opposite the Reich Chancellery in Berlin in 1942. In 2016, aged 105, she gave a series of interviews for a film documentary entitled A German Life, in which she discusses \\"her lack of remorse and the private side of her monstrous boss\\". Biography Pomsel was born in Berlin in 1911. In 1933 she joined the Nazi Party and got a job in the news department of the government radio station. On the recommendation of a friend, she was transferred to the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda in 1942, where she worked under Joseph Goebbels as a stenographer until the end of the war. According to Kate Connolly in the Guardian, Pomsel was more than just a secretary; her tasks included \\"massaging downwards statistics about fallen soldiers, as well as exaggerating the number of rapes of German women by the Red Army\\". At the end of the war in 1945, Pomsel was imprisoned by the Soviet NKVD until 1950 in three different concentration camps, Buchenwald, Hohensch√∂nhausen and Sachsenhausen. She was released from the NKVD camp in 1950, and escaped from the Soviet-occupied zone to West Germany, where she worked as a secretary with the state broadcaster S√ºdwestfunk in Baden-Baden and then at ARD in Munich until her retirement in 1971. On her 100th birthday in 2011, she publicly spoke out against Goebbels. A documentary called A German Life, drawn from a 30-hour interview with Pomsel, was shown at Filmfest M√ºnchen in 2016. Shortly before her death she revealed that she had been in love with a man named Gottfried Kirchbach, who had a Jewish mother. They planned to leave Germany together. In 1936 Kirchbach escaped to Amsterdam to arrange a new life. Pomsel visited him regularly until he told her she was endangering her life by doing so. She aborted their child after a doctor advised her the pregnancy might kill her because she had a serious lung complaint. Towards the end of her life Pomsel lived in Munich. She died there on 27 January 2017 at the age of 106.

Background Facing a spillover of the unrests throughout Eastern Europe that began in Poland, the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic, among other republics of the USSR declared its sovereignty. On August 24, 1990, for the second session of the Supreme Soviet of the Tajik SSR adopted the Declaration \\"On the Sovereignty of the Tajik SSR.\\" But this sovereignty was declared while the Soviet Union still existed. Despite this, the declaration was only the first document to on the path to the real independence of Tajikistan, with the former Minister of Justice stating that, \\"Declaration was the first document towards independence. For example, it is the fifth article that had given the Supreme Council of the Republic the authority to stop the action of the documents of the USSR, which contradicted the legal rights in Tajikistan.\\"–ù–µ–∑–∞–≤–∏—Å–∏–º–æ—Å—Ç—å –¢–∞–¥–∂–∏–∫–∏—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∞. –ö–∞–∫ —ç—Ç–æ –±—ã–ª–æ?  20 –ª–µ—Ç –ù–µ–∑–∞–≤–∏—Å–∏–º–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –†–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∏ –¢–∞–¥–∂–∏–∫–∏—Å—Ç–∞–Ω  –°–ø—Ä–∞–≤–æ—á–Ω–∏–∫ –≥. –î—É—à–∞–Ω–±–µ After the failed coup organized by the State Committee on the State of Emergency in August 1991, the national republics began the process of proclaiming national independence.

Google PageRank GooglePageRank (Google PR) is one of the methods Google uses to determine a page's relevance or importance. Important pages receive a higher PageRank and are more likely to appear at the top of the search results. Google PageRank (PR) is a measure from 0 - 10. Google PageRank is based on backlinks. PageRank works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is. The underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites.Metrics However, Google claims there will be no more PageRank updates, rendering this metric as outdated.Google: When Will Be The Next PageRank Update?

These services monitor student activity online, filter content and alert school officials to possible suicidal or self-harm ideation. As of June 2018, GoGuardian reports its services are used in 10,150 schools for at least five million students. In 2018, Inc 500 named GoGuardian the fastest-growing education company.  Product history  GoGuardian was founded in 2014 and is based in Los Angeles, CA. Its feature set includes Chromebook filtering, monitoring, and management, as well as usage analytics, activity flagging, and theft recovery for any device running the Chrome Operating System (Chrome OS). GoGuardian also offers filtering functionality for third-party tools such as YouTube. These services enable school administrators to monitor student activity online, filter potentially harmful or distracting content, and recover lost or stolen devices. As of June 2015, GoGuardian reported it was active in over 1,600 of the estimated 15,000 school districts in the United States. In January 2015, Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) chose GoGuardian to support their 1:1 device rollout program to 661,000 students. Chromebooks are one of the device options in LAUSD's 1:1 rollout. This partnership provides LAUSD with device tracking and grade-level-specific filtering capabilities, and facilitates compliance with the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA). In September 2015, the company unveiled GoGuardian for Teachers. The tool is designed to help teachers manage Chromebook usage in their classrooms and monitor student activity on the device. The goal of the tool is to help keep students on-task and away from inappropriate content. In January 2016, GoGuardian announced the launch of Google Classroom Integration for GoGuardian for Teachers.

GoGuardian can collect information about any activity when users are logged onto their accounts, including data originating from a student's webcam, microphone, keyboard, and screen, along with historical data such as browsing history. This collection can be performed whether students connect from school-provided or personally-owned devices. Some parents have raised privacy concerns over this data collection, stating that \\"This is essentially spyware.\\" In 2016, researcher Elana Zeide raised the concern that the use of GoGuardian software for suicide prevention, though \\"well-meaning\\", could result in \\"overreach\\". Zeide further noted that legitimate personal reasons could motivate a student to wish to search for sensitive information in private. According to Zeide, this concern is compounded by the fact that school devices may be the only devices for lower- income students. American School Counselor Association ethics chair Carolyn Stone raised the concern that GoGuardian's ability to track web searches conducted at home is \\"intrusive\\" and could be \\"conditioning children to accept constant monitoring\\" as normal. In October 2015, GoGuardian software was able to track keystrokes and remotely activate student webcams. GoGuardian states that the features were removed as part of its \\"ongoing commitment to student privacy.\\" GoGuardian technical product manager Cody Rice stated in 2016 that schools had control over GoGuardian's collection and management of data, and that no client had complained about privacy.

It was first published in Scribner's Magazine, volume 13 issue 4, April 1893.Scribner's Magazine Volume 0013 Issue 4 (April, 1893) Cornell University Library, accessed 1 September 2015. It was included in Life's Little Ironies, a collection of Thomas Hardy's short stories first published in 1894. In the story, set in South Wessex and London, the interaction of the lives of three people are related, at the time of the Great Exhibition in London, and of the coming of the railway to Wessex. Summary An old man, reminiscing with the narrator about times past, comments on the Great Exhibition of 1851. He says, \\"For South Wessex, the year formed in many ways an extraordinary chronological frontier.... a sudden bringing of ancient and modern into absolute contact....\\" The conversation moves to people they knew at that time, particularly of three local people; their story is described. Wat Ollamoor, a veterinary surgeon lodging in the village of Mellstock, is known as a fiddle- player; he is called \\"Mop\\" becaused of his long hair. His appearance and fiddle-playing are attractive to young ladies, in particular to Car'line Aspent of the nearby village of Stickleford. Ned Hipcroft is courting Car'line. When his proposal of marriage is rejected, Ned, a mechanic, goes to London (in six days' walking; the railway line was being built but was not open) and works there, living in Lambeth. After four years in London he works on the glass-house of the Great Exhibition. He receives a letter from Car'line: she says she had been foolish to refuse him, and would gladly marry him. Ned, after a few days' consideration, replies: he is slightly reproachful and does not volunteer to return to Stickleford; agreeing to marry her, he suggests that she comes to London on the train, the railway line being now open. She arrives, with a girl aged about three; they are wet after the journey in the rain in an open carriage. Ned, initially displeased by the unexpected presence of Car'line's daughter, acquiesces to the situation. They get married, visiting the Exhibition after they come back from church; their married life is comfortable. After about three years Ned becomes short of work, and they decide to return home. At Casterbridge, where they leave the train, Ned makes inquiries about work in the town while Car'line and her daughter Carry walk to Stickleford. They stop for a rest at an inn; there is entertainment and, being recognized, Car'line is welcomed. There is dancing, to the music of Ollamoor's fiddle-playing. \\"The notes of that old violin... thrilled the London wife, these having still all the witchery that she had so well known of yore, and under which she had used to lose her power of independent will.\\" She takes part in a five-handed reel; she is eventually the only one left dancing, and finally faints. While she is being revived, Ollamoor disappears with the little girl. Ned, having arrived, is angered by Carry's disappearance, being more concerned about her than he is about his wife. Ollamoor and Carry are never seen again, despite Ned's return to London to look for them. It is supposed that Ollamoor and his daughter emigrated to America, \\"Mop, no doubt, finding the girl a highly desirable companion when he had trained her to keep him by her earnings as a dancer.\\" Commentary The writer and literary critic John Wain comments that Hardy had no particular regard for the short story as a literary form; that some of his stories have enough plot to have been a full-length novel. In \\"The Fiddler of the Reels\\", he suggests, Ned's return to London to look for Carry, or Ollamoor and his daughter's later adventures, could have been expanded if the writer had wished. Wain adds, \\"In such cases the decision to tell the story shortly is evidently an arbitrary choice on the author's part, rather than an artistic necessity inherent in the material chosen.\\" John Wain (chosen and introduced by), Selected Stories of Thomas Hardy, Papermac 1966.

The show premiered on Servus TV in Austria and Germany on January 17, 2015, on La 2 in Spain on March 8, 2015, on RAI 5 in Italy on May 15, 2015, and on August 19, 2015, on Foxtel Arts in Australia.  Reception  Many people uninterested in opera find the program and the host entertaining. This style of edutainment makes the show reach a wider audience, but also attracts those already from music circles. The series has received nominations from festivals: This is Opera was nominated in the Rocky Awards in the BANFF festival under the category of music and variety. It was also chosen for the IDFA festival in November 2015. Most recently, it has been nominated at the Rose d'Or Festival in the category of Arts for its episode of Turandot.  Host  From episode Tristan und Isolde Ramon Gener, writer and musician, is the host. With the dramatic aspect of opera, Gener tries to transmit ideas or thoughts on life‚Äîfor example the idea of sharing, which he states in an interview, \\"All that you have, share it with the world for if you don't what use is it in having?\\" He has hosted other shows, and has been involved in Television programs since early 2011.https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4696428/ Gener has done various interviews concerning his writings, and This is Opera in which he discusses his first experiences with music and how the show came to be.

The New Secession, initially led by Georg Tappert and Max Pechstein, was formed after 27 expressionistic works of art had been excluded from a 1910 exhibition of the Berlin Secession. The first exhibition of the New Secession was advertised as showing artists \\"rejected by the Berlin Secession 1910\\", but the group was also joined by artists who were not former Berlin Secession members. The New Secession helped introducing expressionism in Germany. Besides Berlin expressionists, the New Secession had members from Die Br√ºcke still living in Dresden until 1911, members from Munich, who would later form Der Blaue Reiter, as well as members from other places in Europe. The fourth exhibition of the New Secession opened mid November 1911 and was a success, but at the same time the group started to fall apart. When Max Pechstein was not reelected as president of the New Secession, he left followed by the rest of the Br√ºcke group. Also, after a split of the Neue K√ºnstlervereinigung M√ºnchen, the Blaue Reiter group now began organizing their own exhibitions. The last exhibition of the New Secession was held in 1914.

It came just over a month after the failed attempt to assassinate the country's leader, Adolf Hitler, on 20 July 1944. The programme targeted former officials and members of mainstream centre and left-wing \\"Bourgeois\\" parties from the period of democratic government that been declared illegal after January 1933. Those arrested included Social Democrats and trades unionists, Liberals, Communists and Bavarian People's Party members, along with members of the old centre parties. The name The word \\"Gitter\\" can be translated into English as \\"grille\\" or \\"lattice\\": in the context of Aktion Gitter it refers to putting people \\"behind bars\\". The term had already been officially used before, in connection with a mass arrest overnight of more than 4,000 people that had taken place in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia on 16 March 1939, in connection with completion of the German takeover in what had previously been the western part Czechoslovakia. Aktion Gitter was the official title used by the government, but these events are also sometimes identified in sources as Aktion Gewitter or Aktion Himmler. \\"Gewitter\\" is a German word for a \\"thunder storm\\" and Heinrich Himmler was a senior member of the government whose areas of responsibility included policing and a wide range of other matters administered in his capacity as Minister of the Interior. Planning The mass arrests of Aktion Gitter were neither unprecedented nor a spontaneous government response to the assassination attempt of July 1944, but the working through of long-standing policies. Leading politicians from the Weimar years had been identified on a so-called government \\"A-list\\" as early as 1935/36, divided into sub-categories A-1, A-2 and A-3. At the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 the Gestapo had arrested between 2,000 and 4,000 people whose names appeared on List A-1. These were identified as \\"enemies of the state\\" and placed in \\"protective custody\\", in most cases in the Buchenwald concentration camp. However, most of these had been released by the summer of 1940. Nevertheless, Chancellor Hitler gave notice in April 1942 that \\"if a mutiny were to break out today somewhere in the country\\", it would meet with an immediate response (\\"Sofortma√ünahmen\\"). Directly following the outbreak of civil arrest or similar disturbances, all \\"leading men from the [left-wing] opposition, and indeed also those from the Catholic political tradition would be arrested, removed from their homes and sent for execution.\\"....leitenden M√§nner gegnerischer Str√∂mungen, und zwar auch die des politischen Katholizismus, aus ihren Wohnungen heraus verhaften und exekutieren lassen\\" Additionally all concentration camp inmates would be shot along with all criminals, whether they were in state detention or at liberty at the time. On 14 August 1944 Heinrich Himmler received the mandate to have former Social Democratic (SPD) and Communist Party (KPD) officials detained. The mass arrest, which was estimated to cover more than 5,000 former politicians, should take no account of whether or not those detained were still engaged in opposition activity, and was not connected with the search underway for the July assassination plotters. On Thursday 17 August 1944 all leading Gestapo officers in the country received a secret telex from Department 4 of the Reich Main Security Office (Reichssicherheitshauptamt / RSHA). The telex contained notification from Gestapo Operation Chief M√ºller that the Reichsf√ºhrer SS Himmler had ordered a large wave of arrests. All former members of the national Reichstag, regional Landtags or city councils who had been members of the (till 1933 legal) SPD and KPD (parties) along with all trades union and party officials of the SPD, without regard to whether or not they were currently facing investigation, were to be detained. Those aged more than 70, those who were ill and those who had been \\"of service to the system\\" [since 1933] should be spared from arrest, however. The arrests were to happen nationwide during the early hours of 22 August. Orders were that detainees should then be taken without delay to the nearest concentration camp and taken into what was designated \\"protective custody\\" by the RHSA. Additionally, by 25 August Gestapo officers of the RHSA should then report the total numbers arrested, analysed according to political party and according to political functions. Himmler's orders arrived under the heading Aktion Gitter. On 21 August the order was extended so that pre-1933 assembly members from the old Centre Party were also to be detained, although this broadening of the scope of The Aktion was partially rescinded two days later.Bundesarchiv Koblenz (BA) R 58/775. Zur Kategorisierung der Konzentrationslager: N√ºrnberger Dokument 1063-PS. In: Der Proze√ü gegen die Hauptkriegsverbrecher vor dem Internationalen Milit√§rgerichtshof N√ºrnberg, Vol. 27, N√ºrnberg 1949. p. 695 ff. Implementation The arrests went ahead as instructed, in the small hours, either by Gestapo officers acting alone or by Gestapo officers acting in partnership with local police officers. Estimates indicate that approximately 5,000 were arrested across Germany, and most were promptly delivered to the closest concentration camp. Some of the concentration camps receiving the largest numbers of \\"Aktion Gitter\\" detainees were at Neuengamme near Hamburg (650), Buchenwald near Weimar (742) and Dachau near Munich (860). In Berlin detainees were taken to the main Gestapo prison in Prince Albrecht Street, and a large number from this area were also sent to Ravensbr√ºck. The arrests had in many cases been undertaken on the basis of out of date lists: many of those arrested were old and ill, and had not been involved in politics for more than ten years. Some of those arrested had already been arrested during the immediate aftermath of the Nazi takeover in 1933, but subsequently released. Others found themselves arrested for the first time. Many were released after a few months in response to protests from family members. Victims The way in which the mass arrests were carried out triggered such popular resentment that just one week later, on 30 August 1944, Ernst Kaltenbrunner ordered a review that led to some mitigation. Overall the approach of the ruling Nazi Party remained inconsistent and unpredictable, however. On the one hand many of the detainees were soon released in response to massive protests from their families and friends. But on the other hand, because of the inhuman conditions in the concentration camps during the winter of 1944/45, many of those who remained in detention died. That is what happened to Johanna Tesch and Joseph Roth. Former national Reichstag Gitter detainees who did not survive the concentration camps included , Karl Mache and Heinrich Jasper. The Hamburg education reformer Kurt Adams was a Gitter victim who possibly did not even live to experience that year's winter. As the end of the war approached the authorities evacuated concentration camps in areas about to be over-run by enemy armies. Evacuation was accomplished through a succession of forced marches, which came to be known as death marches. Camp inmates unable to complete these death marches were simply shot. Other Gitter detainees perished when the SS Cap Arcona, by then used as a prison ship and moored off L√ºbeck, was sunk by the British Royal Air Force the day before the German military surrender. Aktion Gitter was therefore a government reprisal that ended in death for many of those caught up in it. Politician victims of Aktion Gitter who survived the experience and re-emerged as national politicians in the German Federal Republic (West Germany), following its establishment in 1949, include Konrad Adenauer (CDU), Paul L√∂be (SPD) and Kurt Schumacher (SPD). There is a longer list of Aktion Gitter victims, currently (September 2015) of 192 lines, on German Wikipedia at 'Victims of Aktion Gitter (1944)'. Historiography The historian Stefanie Sch√ºler-Springorum, writing in 2005, noted that Aktion Gitter had at that time only been researched \\"selectively\\" for northern Germany. Subsequently other historians have endorsed the view that Aktion Gitter has not yet been conclusively researched.

It is being developed by BioMarin Pharmaceutical and, being the only available causal treatment for this condition, has orphan drug status in the US as well as Europe. , it is in Phase II clinical trials. Mechanism of action A: Chondrocyte with constitutionally active FGFR3 that down-regulates its development via the MAPK/ERK pathway B: Vosoritide (BMN 111) blocks this mechanism by binding to the atrial natriuretic peptide receptor B (NPR-B), which subsequently inhibits the MAPK/ERK pathway at the RAF-1 protein. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) is a receptor that normally down-regulates cartilage and bone growth when activated by one of the proteins known as acidic and basic fibroblast growth factor. It does so by inhibiting the development (cell proliferation and differentiation) of chondrocytes, the cells that produce and maintain the cartilaginous matrix which is also necessary for bone growth. Children with achondroplasia have one of several possible FGFR3 mutations resulting in constitutional (permanent) activity of this receptor, resulting in overall reduced chondrocyte activity and thus bone growth. The protein C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), naturally found in humans, reduces the effects of over-active FGFR3. Vosoritide is a CNP analogue with the same effect but prolonged half-life, allowing for once-daily administration. Chemistry Vosoritide is an analogue of CNP. It is a peptide consisting of the amino acids proline and glycine plus the 37 C-terminal amino acids from natural human CNP. The complete peptide sequence is :PGQEHPNARK YKGANKKGLS KG _C_ FGLKLDR IGSMSGLG _C_ with a disulfide bridge between positions 23 and 39 (underlined). The drug must be administered by injection as it would be rendered ineffective by the digestive system if taken orally. Research Vosoritide has resulted in increased growth in a clinical trial with 26 children. The ten children receiving the highest dose grew in six months, compared to in the six months before the treatment (p=0.01). The body proportions, more specifically the ratio of leg length to upper body length ‚Äì which is lower in achondroplasia patients than in the average population ‚Äì was not improved by vosoritide, but not worsened either. , it is not known whether the effect of the drug will last long enough to result in normal body heights, or whether it will reduce the occurrence of achondroplasia associated problems such as ear infections, sleep apnea or hydrocephalus. This, together with the safety of higher doses, is to be determined in further studies. =Side effects= The drug was tolerated well in this study. Side effects were generally mild and included reactions at the injection site, headache, low blood pressure, back pain, and cough. One incidence of dizziness, possibly related to low blood pressure, was reported; the other cases of low pressure passed without symptoms or treatment. Society and culture Some people with achondroplasia, as well as parents of children with this condition, have reacted to vosoritide's study results by saying that dwarfism is not a disease and consequently does not need treatment.

Under his direction, 796,928 square miles of India were surveyed, including difficult mountainous, forest, and desert regions, often for the first time. He was responsible for the printing in 1854 of the first postage stamps valid throughout India. Thuillier was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1869, made a CSI in May 1870, and knighted in June 1879. Early life Thuillier was born at Bath on 10 July 1813, was youngest of eleven children (five sons and six daughters) of John Pierre Thuillier, Baron of Malapert, and merchant of Cadiz and Bath, by his wife Julia, daughter of James Burrow of Exeter. An elder sister, Julia, married Walter Savage Landor in 1811. He was descended from Huguenots who, on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, first settled in Geneva. He was educated at the East India Company's military academy, Addiscombe.\\"Thuillier, Henry Edward Landor\\" by Frank Herbert Brown in Dictionary of National Biography, 1912 supplement. Marriage Thuillier married firstly in 1836 Susanne Elizabeth (died 1844), daughter of the reverend Haydon Cardew of Curry Mallet, Somerset, by whom he had a son (Colonel Sir Henry Ravenshaw Thuillier, KCIE, also Indian surveyor-general, 1887‚Äì95), and a daughter; and secondly in 1847 Annie Charlotte, daughter of George Gordon Macpherson, Bengal medical service, by whom he had six sons (three of them became officers in the Indian army) and two daughters. Career Thuillier was gazetted to the Bengal artillery on 14 December 1832 and was stationed at the headquarters, Dum Dum. Transferred to the survey department in December 1836, he first served with parties in Ganjam and Orissa, and later was in charge of the revenue surveys in the Bengal districts of Cachar, SyLhet, Cuttack, and Patna. In January 1847, ten months before receiving his captaincy, he was appointed deputy surveyor-general and superintendent of revenue surveys. That post he held for seventeen years, in the course of which he much improved the survey system and rendered the results more readily accessible to the public. He \\"followed in the track of the different trigonometrical series, and thus had the advantage of fixed stations on which to base his detailed surveys\\".Memoir on Indian Surveys, 1878. He was joint author with Captain R. Smythe of The Manual of Surveying in India (Calcutta, 1851; 3rd edit. 1885). There he discussed the difficult question of Indian orthography, which was officially standardised while he had charge of the department. He was president of The Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1863.Presidents & Secretaries. The Asiatic Society. Retrieved 17 December 2016.https://archive.org/stream/journalofasiati321863asia#page/60/mode/2up Succeeding Sir Andrew Scott Waugh as surveyor-general on 13 March 1861, he was promoted lieutenant-colonel in the same year, colonel on 20 September 1865, and major-general on 26 March 1870. The survey of the more settled parts of India had been completed, and many of the surveys under Thuillier were over mountainous and forest-clad regions or sandy deserts, and frequently in parts never before visited by Europeans. In every branch, he showed organising and administrative talent. In 1868 he transferred the preparation of the Atlas of India from England to Calcutta, selecting a staff of engravers there for the purpose, and encouraging John Bobanau Nicklerlieu HennesseyDictionary of National Biography, Suppl. II. to introduce the photo-zincographic process. Under Thuillier's superintendence 796,928 square miles, or more than half the dependency, were dealt with. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1869, made a C.S.I., in May 1870, and knighted on 26 June 1879. In July 1876 he was awarded a good service pension. First stamps of India A four annas stamp of 1854 from the first issue of India. In 1854, while a captain at the Lithographic Office of the survey department, he was responsible for the printing of the first postage stamps for the whole of India, the first stamps issued in India being the Scinde Dawk stamps issued for use in the Province of Scinde (now in Pakistan) in 1852. The stamps produced by Thuillier were only printed in India when the Court of Directors of the East India Company would not authorise the printing of the stamps in England despite several unsuccessful attempts by different people in India to produce a stamp that could be reliably printed in quantity.Hausburg, L.R.R., \\"The Stamps of British India\\", The London Philatelist, Vol. XVII, March 1908, No. 195, pp. 53‚Äì57. Retirement Thuillier retired on 1 January 1878, and the secretary of state, in a despatch dated 18 July 1878, highly commended the energy and perseverance of his forty-one years' service, and congratulated him on the results. He was gazetted lieutenant-general on 10 July 1879, general on 1 July 1881, and (a rare distinction for an officer with little actual military service) colonel commandant of the Royal Artillery on 1 January 1883. Settling at Richmond, he was long a useful member of the Royal Geographical Society's council and came to be looked upon as the father of the East India Company's service. Of fine presence and genial temper, he retained his faculties till his death on 6 May 1906 at Richmond, where he was buried.

Demographics The town and its surroundings are one a very few places in the Diyala Province where Sunnis form a vast majority--nearly the totality--of the population. All others have been flooded by the Shia settlers. The population is primarily composed of Sunni Arab (mostly of the Azza tribe) and minority Sunni Turkmen.

Several variations of the dish exist, and prepared canned and boxed versions also exist. It can be a relatively inexpensive dish to prepare, and has been described as a comfort food. Preparation Several preparation methods exist. Basic versions may be prepared using chopped meat, tomato, spices, and elbow macaroni. Another basic preparation method incorporates boxed, prepared macaroni and cheese and canned chili. Some recipes incorporate all of the ingredients together, while others are prepared with the ingredients separately layered. Those that use cheese may use grated cheese atop the dish, while others mix the cheese throughout the dish. Sometimes, onions or beans are added. Some diners in St. Louis, Missouri serve a version called \\"chili mac a la mode\\", in which the dish is served topped with fried eggs. The dish may be prepared on a range top in a skillet, in a slow cooker, or baked as a casserole. Vegetarian and vegan versions of the dish are sometimes prepared. = Versions = Chili mac has been a staple dish at American military dining facilities for years.

A former Wesley College captain, Prout played for Essendon from 1908 to 1910. He was involved in a murder trial in 1911 as one of five accused, but was acquitted of the charge against him. VFL career Prout, a mechanical student, made football history when he was called up from Collegians to make his league debut in the 1908 VFL Grand Final. Named on a half forward flank, it was the first occasion that a player had debuted in a grand final and has happened only four times since. Essendon lost the match to Carlton by nine points. Prout, who was described in The Age as \\"the college experiment\\", was reported to have been ineffective as a forward in the first half of the game. He was moved to a wing where he put in an improved performance and was said to have played great opposed Ted Kennedy. Before the beginning of the 1909 VFL season, Prout applied for a clearance to join Sturt, an Adelaide-based club. He was living in the district at the time due to his employment, but soon after lost his position and had to return to Melbourne. His application was withdrawn and he instead lined up for Essendon for the opening round of the season. He began well with three goals against St Kilda and remained in the side until Essendon's loss to University in round four, when he fractured his collarbone. This kept him out of the side for six weeks and he was still not fully recovered when he returned in round 11. However he managed to kick a career high five goals against Geelong at Corio Oval the following round. He finished the home and away season with 25 goals and kicked another two in Essendon's semi-final loss. From 13 appearances in 1909, Prout's 27 goals were the second most for his club, behind Paddy Shea. Prout had an early setback in the 1910 VFL season, reported during the round two win over University. Field umpire R. J. Boyle testified that he saw Prout strike University's Athol Tymms and the tribunal handed down a four-week suspension. Used as a wingman for much of the year, Prout returned in round seven and did not miss another game for the rest of the season, in which he played 15 games. This included another semi-final, which Essendon lost to Collingwood. That loss was his last VFL appearance, meaning he started and ended his career in a final. Murder charge Prout was one of five men charged with murder in 1911, over the death of a 26-year-old man named Arthur Ernest Lupton in a work site in Wallan on the early hours of 28 January. The intoxicated men, who were employed on the railway as navvies, were going from tent to tent in the camp premises, looking for a man who went by the name \\"Killarney\\", who they had quarrelled with the previous night. Instead it was Lupton that fell victim to the group, struck by one of the men, later dying of a fractured skull. The jury convicted Prout's companion Frederick Carmody of manslaughter, satisfied by the account of a witness who had seen him attack Lupton at his tent. Prout and the other three men were acquitted. The judge, Justice Hodges, stated before discharging the men: Following the trial, Prout joined NSW Australian Football Association club YMCA for the 1912 season.

He is regarded as one of the founders of McGill University Faculty of Medicine. Early days Stephenson was born on December 12, 1796 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He was the youngest of five sons of John Stephenson and Martha Mair. His father was a merchant, who immigrated to Canada from Scotland. He studied at the Coll√®ge de Montr√©al, a Roman Catholic minor seminary in his home town. He wanted to become a physician, but at that time, there was no medical school in Canada. Edinburgh Medical School For medical education, Stephenson traveled to Scotland and joined the University of Edinburgh Medical School in 1817. While he was attending the Medical School, he met with his childhood friend, Andrew Fernando Holmes. Holmes was also studying medicine at Edinburgh. He was born with congenital disorder of the soft palate; he had difficulty in speech. In 1819, he and Holmes went to Paris to be trained under Philibert Joseph Roux, a surgeon at H√¥pital de la Charit√©, for few weeks. In September of that year, Roux performed an hour-long operation on Stephenson and his speech became almost normal. He obtained his M.D. from Edinburgh in 1820. His thesis, \\"De velosynthesi\\", written in Latin, explained one of the first successful surgical repairs of cleft of soft palate. Career in Montreal After obtaining his medical degree, Stephenson returned to Montreal. Montreal General Hospital was established in May 1822. Stephenson and three other Edinburgh Medical School alumni ‚Äì Andrew Fernando Holmes, William Robertson and William Caldwell ‚Äì became staffs of the hospital. It was Stephenson who convinced those three physicians to join the hospital. In October 1822, he founded the Medical Institution for medical education. He gave lectures in anatomy, physiology and surgery at the institute. The Institute needed a provincial charter so that it could confer medical qualifications to its students, but it couldn't obtain the charter. Meanwhile, McGill College (now McGill University), which received its royal charter in 1821, needed a functioning faculty. In 1829, the Montreal Medical Institution was incorporated into McGill College as the College's first faculty; it thus became the first Faculty of Medicine in Canada. Stephenson lectured in anatomy, physiology and surgery at the Faculty of Medicine and had significant influence on the faculty and the university. He died on February 2, 1842.

Katharine grew up in a vast Tudor-style rectory in Tansor. She was coached in music from the age of five and was a competent watercolour painter by the age of six. At the age of 19 she was sent to the Continent to study languages and drawing. Her elder brother Horatio, who was a naturalist, traveller and writer, supported her in this venture. Her older sister, Anna, was already living in D√ºsseldorf, having been banished in disgrace after falling pregnant. She eked out a living for herself and her child by producing paintings of flowers. In all Katharine spent seven years abroad, acquiring proficiency in drawing and fluency in French, German and Flemish. During a visit to D√ºsseldorf she met Mauritian-born James Renault Saunders (1818-1892) and married him the following year at the British Embassy in Brussels. She and her new husband and their daughter sailed to South Africa in 1854 aboard the East Indiaman 'Hotspur' and arrived in Cape Town on 12 September 1854, spending three weeks there before sailing for Durban where they arrived on 23 October 1854. They settled on the sugarcane farm, 'Tongaat Estate' north of Durban, where her husband was at first manager and later the owner. Having settled in, complete with a grand piano, Katharine started painting plants. The Saunders' first home was a sprawling thatched building with shady verandahs overlooking the Tongaat River and whimsically named 'The House by the Drift'. Her interest in plants was furthered by the Scots horticulturalist, Mark McKen, who worked on the sugarcane farm in a temporary capacity and later resumed his curatorship of the Durban Botanic Gardens. McKen fixed a variety of Natal orchids to trees in her garden, sparking in her a lifelong interest in orchids. By the 1870s her growing family and her husband's thriving career saw them occupying 'Tongaat House' which became a convenient meeting-place for botanists of the area. Katharine's enthusiasm for painting, botany and conservation generated the interest which held the groups together. The quality of her paintings led inevitably to her sending of live specimens and corresponding with the Hookers at Kew, W. H. Harvey in Dublin and Harry Bolus in Cape Town. On an extended visit to England in 1881/82 she met Joseph Dalton Hooker and William Turner Thiselton-Dyer who would become director of Kew in 1885. On her return to Natal she was visited by Marianne North, the English traveller and botanical artist. Katharine herself travelled and painted fairly extensively through the Transvaal and Swaziland, also visiting her daughter who had settled in Johannesburg and her son, Charles, in Eshowe. She donated a selection of her paintings to the Natal Museum in Pietermaritzburg in 1889. About 700 of her paintings have survived, some are to be found in the Tongaat Group Library. Her pressed specimens are at Kew and the herbarium of Trinity College, Dublin. Katharine Saunders sent some 426 specimens to Kew during the period 1881 to 1889 - about 16 of these were named after her though most were later regarded as synonyms. Amongst these were Schrebera saundersiae Harv., Habenaria saundersiae Harv., Drimiopsis saundersiae Baker, Sisyranthus saundersiae N.E. Br., Dermatobotrys saundersii Bolus and Haemanthus katharinae Baker.

He was active in South African politics and served four terms in the National Parliament in Cape Town from 1974 to 2014.  Early life and education  McIntosh was born in Brooklyn, Pretoria into a middle-class, politically liberal, bi-lingual (Afrikaans and English, later Zulu was added) South African family, where he was the youngest of three sons. He completed his secondary education at Michaelhouse in the province of KwaZulu-Natal.

Political career  McIntosh‚Äôs first memory of politics is a United Party fundraising braai (barbecue) at his parents‚Äô home when he was six. From his teenage years he has been a consistent proponent of liberal democracy. The first political party that McIntosh joined was the Liberal Party in 1963. He began his public political career when he joined the United Party in 1972 whilst farming near Weenen, KZN. At the time, Sir De Villiers Graaff was the leader of the Party. In 1974, at the age of 30, he was elected to Parliament as the MP for Pinetown (UP). He held the seat from 1974‚Äì1977. He was one of the very few South African MPs to report back to his black constituency, even though they did not have the franchise.Daily News, 14 January 1976 In 1977, when the United Party transformed into the New Republic Party, he joined the Progressive Federal Party (PFP), which was led by Colin Eglin.

The game puts emphasis on survival and lets players co-operate with each other to achieve success. The game adapts an open development and allows the community to give input regarding the game's development. As Press Play was closed in March 2016, the game was no longer in development. Gameplay Project: Knoxville is a third-person multiplayer survival game. Throughout the game, players can jump, sprint, and interact with the environments. The game's major objective is to survive and escape from an arena which is filled with different hostile enemies. These arenas are round-based, each one lasting for approximately ten to twenty minutes, and the game does not feature a persistent world. Players can interact with characters that are controlled by other players, and can choose whether to trust them or to distrust them. The game supports co- operative gameplay. As a result, players have the option to demand attention from other players, as well as requesting weapons, healing and currency from them. Some missions require multiple players to work and ally together, or else they will be unable to complete them. Competitive multiplayer elements are also present in the game, in which players can choose to eliminate or backfire at each other. In the arena, the player will be accompanied by seven different players at the beginning of each match. They can pick up weapons that are sparsely scattered across the world to defend themselves and attack enemies They are also tasked to collect coins, which can be used to escape a level and upgrade the character the player is using. The number of coins in a level is limited, and some players may not be able to collect the coin needed to escape the level, and will get left behind in the arena. Players who die in the game can also enter an Afterlife mode. They can spawn objects that will influence a round, such as enemies or medkit next to surviving characters. Development The game was currently being developed by Press Play, who had previously worked on Max: The Curse of Brotherhood and Kalimba. On August 18, 2015, Press Play revealed three different projects they may work on, and asked the public to vote and choose the one that they wanted the most. The three projects were Project: Dwarka, Project: Karoo and Project: Knoxville. Dwarka is a dungeon crawler set in a first-person perspective. It tasks players to play as a dwarf and investigate dungeons, which are procedurally generated. Karoo is a simulation game, which tasks players to build and customize their own vehicles, and explore a wasteland to gather different resources. The third project is Knoxville, which was ultimately chosen by the community. All of them feature multiplayer components. According to Press Play, the game was inspired by films like The Running Man and The Hunger Games. Similar to the films, they put emphasis on survival and the relationships between players. The game's development was aimed to be transparent, as they would share new information of the game every other week through Twitch. Supporters would also get to join meetings of the development team through Skype. On 7 March 2016 Microsoft announced that Press Play has closed down, and that the development of Project: Knoxville had ended. The decision was made as Microsoft wished to \\"focus its investment and development on the games and franchises that fans find most exciting and want to play\\".

As there are no niqqud, punctuation, or cantillation marks (called in Yiddish) in a Sefer Torah, and these are required features of the reading, the baal keriah must memorize them beforehand.Chabad.org: How to Get Called Up to the Torah (video)Eisenberg, Ronald L. Jewish Traditions: a JPS Guide, pp. 451-3  Arrangement  When the Torah scroll is placed on the bimah, or reading table, the baal keriah approaches the bimah by the most direct route possible and stands in front of the scroll, a little to the left. If necessary, the scroll is rolled to the portion to be read, and then closed and covered with the mantle. To the left side of the scroll stands the gabbai, who calls up congregants to honor them with an aliyah. To the right of the scroll stands the second gabbai, the gabbai sheini.  Before each aliyah  When called up by the first gabbai, the oleh comes by the most direct route possible and stands to the right of the baal keriah. A gabbai uncovers the scroll and the baal keriah indicates to the oleh which section will be read. In some communities, he only indicates the beginning; in others, he points to the beginning and the end. The oleh then touches the corner of his tallit (or some other holy piece of cloth, like the belt of the Torah scroll, or for scrolls with hard cases, the kerchief used to roll the scroll) to the indicated section and kisses it. He then rolls the scroll closed, holding on the right and left rollers (or sides of the case), turns slightly to the right and recites the blessings over the reading. The congregation answers \\"amen,\\" the scroll is unrolled again, and then the baal keriah chants the section, holding onto the left roller and pointing, usually with a specially-made ornate pointer called a yad in his right. = During the aliyah = During the chanting, the oleh reads quietly along with the baal keriah from the scroll, if he is able to.Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 141:2. Each of the gabba'im will also read along with the baal keriah, but from Chumashim, in order to let the baal keriah know of any errors. In some congregations, a gabbai will give cheironomic signals to indicate how the verses should be chanted. All those at the bimah stand for the reading. During certain significant sections of the Torah, like the Ten Commandments or the Song at the Sea, the congregation stands as well. These sections are typically chanted in a more ornate and majestic tune than usual. = End of the aliyah = At the end of the reading, the custom of the baal korei may dictate that he raise his voice at the cadence of the final verse, or simply finish with the usual tune for all verses. The oleh kisses the section just read in similar fashion to before the reading. The oleh then closes the scroll, holding onto both the rollers as before, turns slightly to the right and recites the concluding blessings. The congregation answers \\"amen,\\" the scroll is covered, and the oleh stands next to the gabbai sheini until the next oleh finishes his reading. At that point, the oleh circles counter-clockwise about the bimah, taking the longest path back to his seat, as if reluctant to leave the Torah. The baal keriah remains standing in place at the bimah until all the readings from the scroll are complete. = Sabbath and festivals: penultimate and maftir readings = On the Sabbath and holidays, the baal keriah will recite the half kaddish at the bimah after the penultimate reading. The oleh for the final reading (the maftir) is particularly honored with reading the haftorah after the maftir reading from the Torah scroll is complete. Usually the maftir is the final three verses of the weekly portion, repeated from the last aliyah. On special occasions, readings from other parts of the Torah will be read instead, relating specifically to the occasion. If other Torah scrolls are available, the maftir reading is read from the second scroll. Otherwise, the first scroll is rolled to the place of the maftir and the maftir is read from the same scroll. After the maftir reading, the scroll is raised and shown to the congregation, and then wrapped in its decorative and protective garb. The baal keriah then joins the rest of the congregation in listening and reading the haftorah quietly along with the maftir. = Weekday readings = On Mondays and Thursdays when there is no holiday, no haftorah is read. Also, only three olim are called up, and each aliyah is usually much shorter than the full Sabbath readings, not covering the entire weekly portion read on the Sabbath. Otherwise, the sequence is almost the same. = Ending a book = After completing one of the five books of the Pentateuch, it is customary for the congregation to call out, \\"Chazak chazak v'nitchazeik,\\" meaning \\"Be strong! Be strong! And may we be strengthened!\\", after the final verse. The baal keriah will repeat this phrase after the congregation, and the oleh will recite the blessings after the reading as normal. = Discovering a scribal error = If a possible scribal error is discovered during the reading, the reading is halted while those knowledgeable approach to examine the scroll. A child may also be brought to see whether he can recognize an ambiguous letter. If the scroll is kosher, the reading continues from the verse where it was halted. If the scroll is pasul, or invalid, a replacement scroll is brought out, while the invalid scroll is set aside for repair at the first opportunity. The reading then continues from where it left off. = Baal keriah as the oleh = If the baal keriah is himself called up as the oleh, he stands alone in front of the scroll, kisses the section to be read as usual, and recites the preparatory blessings like other olim. As he chants from the scroll, he either holds both of the rollers without pointing, or a gabbai holds a roller so that the baal keriah can use the pointer to keep his place.  Readings aside from the Torah scroll  = Haftorah = In some congregations, the haftorah is also read from handwritten scrolls. In others, the haftorah is read from printed Chumashim or specially-printed sifrei Haftarot, containing only the Haftarot, usually in enlarged type. As with the Torah scroll, handwritten scrolls for the haftorah contain no vowels, punctuation or , and so the reading must be memorized. When reading from a printed book which does contain these markings, less preparation is necessary. As with the Torah reading, blessings are recited before and after the reading, and the reader stands as he chants it. = Megillah = The Megillah is read during the festival of Purim, commemorating the rescue of the Jewish people from an genocidal decree written and promulgated by Haman. Instead of the Jews being annihilated, the plan was foiled, and Haman himself was hung on the gallows he originally built for the leader of the Jews. When reading the Megillah, the procedure for reading is somewhat different. It is customary to unroll the entire scroll, and fold it over in three sections for the reading, like a letter. The tune for chanting is more joyous, and pauses are made to allow the congregation to drown out the villain's name, Haman. Like the Torah scroll, the Megillah contains no vowels, punctuation or cantillation markings, and the text must be learned beforehand. As with the Torah scroll, blessings are recited before and after the reading, which lasts from 10‚Äì30 minutes. Unlike any other reading during the year from other Scriptures, the baal korei must chant every word from the scroll, and each congregant must hear each word in order to fulfill the commandment of the Megillah. Also as with the Torah scroll, the baal keriah reads while standing, although the congregation may sit.Katz, Mordechai. Understanding Judaism: A Basic Guide to Jewish Faith, History, and Practice, pp. 318-9. = Lamentations = The Book of Lamentations, known as Eichah from its first word, is read on Tisha B'Av, the anniversary of the destruction of both the First and Second Temples. It is read in a sad tune, with all present, including the baal keriah, sitting on low cushions or chairs on the ground, in the manner of mourners. No blessings are recited before and after the reading, although supplications are recited. At night, it is customary to read by candlelight. At the beginning of each chapter, the baal keriah raises his voice. The reading of Eichah is not a commandment to the same degree as the Torah, Haftorah and Megillah, and so it is common to chant it from a printed text, rather than from a handwritten scroll.  Assignment of the baal keriah  No special ordination is required to be a baal keriah, although one should be bar mitzvah age or older. In some congregations, the rabbi serves as the baal keriah, while in others, the cantor or one of the congregants is the baal keriah. If there is no professional baal keriah available, and there is a minyan, one of the other congregants should prepare the reading in advance to allow the Torah to be read with its proper vowels, punctuation and .  Preparation  To practice for the Torah reading, a baal keriah will usually use a special book called a Tikkun. This contains two copies of the text in parallel columns. One column has the text as it appears in the handwritten Torah scroll, without vowels or other markings. The other column contains the vowelized and punctuated text with the cantillation marks. Often, such Tikkunim will have a collection of laws and treatises on Biblical Hebrew grammar especially relevant to the baal keriah. The Tikkun will also often have other texts, like the Megillah and the Haftarot.  History  Before the 12th century, all olim would read their own aliyah (as the Yemenite Jews continue to do). As the knowledge to read the scrolls became more scarce, it became common to designate a person who would chant from the scroll throughout the year, in order to avoid embarrassing the olim.World ORT. Navigating the Bible II: Background: Baal Koreh.

Fee) and Marlena's twin Samantha Evans (Andrea Hall), who was killed in a case of mistaken identity. The Salem Strangler storyline was the very first serial killer storyline in the soap's history, and the supposed murder of Marlena at the hands of the killer resulted in one of the first fan campaigns ever. Eugene Bradford Eugene Bradford was played by John de Lancie from 1981 to 1986 and again in 1989. Also known as Gene and Euge, he went by the pseudonym Bettina Lovecraft while working as a Salem Today columnist. Eugene was a distant relative of the DiMera family through a prior marriage, and referred to Tony DiMera as a cousin. Prior to marrying Calliope Jones on December 31, 1985, Eugene had been married four other times. Eugene's first two wives were murdered, while his third marriage to Marlena Evans was actually a cover-up (Eugene pretended to be married to Marlena when she was pregnant with Roman Brady's twins; at this time Roman was believed to be dead) and not legal. He later served as the namesake for Roman and Marlena's daughter Samantha Gene (Sami Brady). Throughout the show, Eugene was portrayed as having psychic premonitions, and on a number of occasions they were useful in helping Salem Police and the ISA. In the last episode in which he appeared, he created a time machine type device and used the device. Upon activation, there was a big explosion and Eugene disappeared. He has not been seen on Days since. In 2006, Calliope returned as the fashion designer hired to make Mimi Lockhart's wedding dress, and she stated that she and Eugene remain happily married. Ilya Petrov Ilya Petrov was portrayed by Kai Wulff from 1983 to 1986 and for a few episodes in 1991. With the exception of Bart and Rolf, Petrov is the most well known henchman of Stefano. In comparison to Bart, he mostly succeeded and completed his assignments. Petrov assisted Stefano in a few of his many schemes. When Stefano kidnapped Marlena Evans & Liz Chandler in early 1983, Petrov was the one who kept an eye of them so they wouldn't escape. He then had small assignments in Stefano's devilish Salem Slasher plot. When Stefano had to escape after some failures of both himself and Andr√© DiMera, Petrov was already in the car. But Roman and Abe were ready as well and chased them. After struggling to shake off the police, and a drunk Alex Marshall caused some problem, the car drove off a bridge and fell down into a river. Alex was found but neither Petrov or Stefano. A few months later, Stefano was seen very much alive looking for the three prisms, and soon Petrov was seen taking orders from Stefano. He kidnapped Hope Williams for Stefano in an attempt to faster lure Roman into Stefano's trap. He also got instructions from Stefano on how to activate the volcano. After locking up a noisy Shane Donovan, he fulfilled his orders and activated the volcano successfully. In late 1985-early 1986, Petrov was seen in Miami, representing Stefano in a three-way wager with Victor Kiriakis and corrupt ISA chief George Nickerson, with the stakes being \\"the Purse (provided by Victor, which turned out to be clues to the locations of (1) a set of stolen U.S. Treasury engravings which were hidden in 1979 in Stockholm, and (2) a priceless Mayan treasure that could only be located during a specific astronomical event in 1991), The Power (provided by the ISA, a codebook with information that ostensibly gave the holder total immunity from every intelligence and law enforcement network in the world), and the Pawn (a \\"most formidable and dangerous man\\" controlled by Stefano, at the time believed to be the missing-and-presumed-dead Roman Brady but later retconned into the separate character of John Black).\\" In 2015, John Black embarked on an ISA-assisted quest to unravel the mysteries of his heretofore unknown past, including his parentage, once and for all. This coincided with the show's 50th anniversary. An important scene showed John viewing an ISA computer file on Petrov, which expanded his story to reveal that he was a Cold War-era Soviet agent who defected to the West, and became at one point a teacher at a private school in Vermont called Winterthorne around the time he became one of Stefano's henchmen. Winterthorne was later revealed to be a \\"front\\" for a secret training facility for assassins, run by a Far Eastern organization called the Phantom Alliance, which turned out to have been founded in the 1950s by John's real father, Timothy Robecheaux aka \\"Yo Ling\\". Petrov was revealed to have been Yo Ling's accomplice, and temporarily \\"defected\\" to Stefano's organization. In this storyline, it was suggested that Petrov eventually returned to the Phantom Alliance's fold. Trista Evans Bradford Trista Evans Bradford was played by Barbara Crampton from March 4, 1983. Crampton only lasted in the role for seven months; she departed from the series on October 24, 1983, when the character was killed off during the Salem Slasher storyline. Crampton later returned as Trista in flashbacks from February 14 to March 9, 1984.

Larry blackmailed Hope into marrying him but on the day of the wedding Bo rode in on his motorcycle and kidnapped Hope from the wedding. In 1985, Larry killed Stefano's daughter, Megan, and dumped her body in a hot tub; Hope was the prime suspect. Victor Kiriakis learned the truth and forced Larry to take the fall for the crime syndicate that he was running. Larry returned in 2002 when he again kidnapped Hope in an attempt to get his revenge on her, Bo and Victor. He was presumed dead after a prison break, but in reality, was helping Nicole in her plans to murder Victor. Larry was hit and killed by a car in early 2003. Calliope Jones Bradford Calliope Jones Bradford was played by Arleen Sorkin from 1984 to 1990, 1992, 2001, 2006 and 2010. Calliope came to Salem in 1984. She was employed in Liz Curtis's clothing business and her first scenes featured her making a dress for Anna DiMera. One of her trademarks was her endless collections of hats, which were very creative and sometimes very outlandish. However, Calliope soon came to possess a diamond necklace which was originally owned by Daphne DiMera. She claimed it as her own, but didn't realize that Stefano DiMera was after it, for it contained one of three prisms he was after. Her white lie unknowingly thrust her into a major storyline. Calliope went on to co-host a daytime talk show with Jennifer Horton-Deveraux. The show was a success, but Calliope would eventually turn over the show over to Jennifer and leave town. However, since her departure in 1990, Calliope has visited Salem several times. In 2006, Calliope returned to town as a successful wedding planner. Although hired to plan her good friend Marlena's wedding to Alex North, she was also able to help Shawn-Douglas Brady and Mimi Lockhart with theirs, despite normally being booked two years in advance. Still eccentric, Calliope butted heads with Mimi's mother Bonnie Lockhart, a fellow eccentric, but with a different wild taste. During her trip, Calliope also commented Eugene was doing just fine and she was now living in New York City. Calliope briefly returned in 2010, when she was hired by Rafe Hernandez to collect evidence to prove that Anna DiMera was hired by EJ to kidnap Sami and EJ's daughter Sydney DiMera. Shane Donovan Shane Donovan is an agent of the ISA and husband to Kimberly Brady Donovan. Donovan and Brady were a supercouple. In 1984, Shane came to Salem to keep an eye on Stefano DiMera's illegal dealings. He posed as Larry Welche's butler, and eventually learned of Stefano's acquisitions of two of three rare prisms designed by Larry's father. Shane teamed up with Bo, and the two intended on taking Stefano down. Later that year Shane learned that Stefano was about to acquire the third and final prism through a Russian ice skating troop that came to town. Hope and Bo got the prism from the troop, but after a long chase with Stefano's men the prism ended up embedded in the ice rink. Shane returned to Salem briefly in the winter of 2002 when Hope was kidnapped by Larry Welch. Shane later returned in 2010 and was revealed to have been held prisoner in a South American prison while on assignment with the ISA. Shane escaped with the help of Rafe and both returned to Salem in time for Alice Horton's funeral. Shane reconnected with Kimberly, who was in town for Alice's memorial service, and admitted that he wanted his future with her and the family and not with the ISA. Shane and Kimberly reunited and moved to LA to be together as a family. In July 2013, Jeannie appeared in Salem having dropped the name and instead uses her middle name, Theresa. She worked at the hospital as Jennifer Horton's assistant and then in Human Resources as the assistant to Anne Milbauer. In late 2016, Shane, apparently back in the ISA, returned to warn Theresa that her ex-boyfriend, a Mexican drug cartel boss, was back in town and wanting to reunite with her. The man was apparently so powerful that even Victor Kiriakis as afraid to cross him. Theresa relented and staged her disappearance to return to Mexico with him to protect her friends and family, who the man had threatened. In January 2017, agent Shane was back in town to inform the Salem gang that Stefano DiMera, for whose murder Hope Brady was serving a life sentence, was actually seen alive and well in Prague orchestrating a series of arms deals. Shane's mysterious demeanor during these appearances suggest more to the story than he was letting on. This proved to be true when it was revealed that Shane and brother-in-law Steve Johnson engineered the whole affair, and that Shane himself was impersonating Stefano, to \\"prove\\" that Stefano was alive and thereby secure Hope's freedom. Andrew Donovan Andrew Donovan was portrayed by several child actors including Bradley Pierce, later known for his role in movies such as Jumanji and Beauty and the Beast, until the character left the series in 1992, with further guest appearances in both 1996 and 1997.

It is an online platform based on a rating system that allows users to appraise other individual users as well as content entries and comments posted by them. Unlike other widely known social networks d3.ru provides opportunities to vote against users, comments and content entries. Today the website is essentially a social network with communities of interest (featuring more than 4000 communities).Every single user has the opportunity to start a community. Within the D3.ru communities users can elect a president. The community president is then eligible to manage and operate the community. The website's slogan is \\"D3.ru is an online platform for communities, where everyone is able to start a community ‚Äî your voice matters!\\"  History  The original Dirty.ru was founded by Jovan Savovic in 2001 as a platform for users to share and generate content. The website was launched on November 22, 2001. For the sake of quality, at the start of the website only registered users could post content, and registration required an invitation from another registered user (except for the short-term campaigns when the registration was open). It was made for users to follow simple grammar rules while commenting and keep a general polite attitude towards others. For those who broke the rules their profiles would be banned into a special section called \\"Leprosorium\\". In 2007 it grew into a separate website that is frequented by Sergey Dorenko, Alexei Navalny and others. Among former users Artemy Lebedev (banned in 2008) and Olga Shelest. In 2007 the website went through Balkanization, a process, according to the website creators, opposite to globalization. Registration became open to the public but soon after became selective due to the high number of people who were willing to register. Dirty became popular through Photoshop-festivals. Users organized spontaneous and preplanned posts with photoshopped images. The best images were saved to the Image archive, a website section where the most extraordinary works from participants were stored. In 2012 the website was rebooted and renamed to D3. Earlier the website had one single home page, after the remodel every community was given its own site. The main page now hosts all the newest and top-rated content of all users. (The website became open for registration, and communities could set-up for management.)  ADM Club  Anonymous Ded Moroz Club (ADM) ‚Äî was a popular campaign amongst users. During this time users can send each other New Year's presents. The user leaves his/her zipcode and receives a random zipcode of the other user. From that point the recipient is supposed to send a present to the address. Sender/receiver names remain a secret. In 2008-2009 ADM ran only among Leprosorium users, but in 2010 a separate campaign was specially held for Dirty users. In 2014 1038 also participated in the campaign. In 2020 there was 93 users. ADM tips: * While choosing the present, remember that the recipient may not have the same sense of humor. * There have been cases where participants found their Anonymous Ded Moroz offline in real life. * If you happen to still get a gift, do not unwrap it in the presence of your family members or children. It could be so that your ADM has not read these advices.  Together  ‚ÄúTogether‚Äù ‚Äì D3 community users engaged in charitable projects. The community was organized in 2010 after the Tu-154 emergency landing. It occurred at an abandoned airport; maintained voluntarily by Sergey Sotnicov. Users were impressed by his actions. In order to express their gratitude towards Sergey Sotnicov they gave him a snowmobile.  The Day of a Dead Horse  On July 7, 2010 the website experienced technical changes. In this time the registration was open to the public. Because of the technical maintenance the website's home page featured a picture of a dead horse. The number of users was so huge (5000 users registered within an hour) that registration was immediately closed. The users registered at that time were given a name ‚ÄúChildren of a dead horse‚Äù.  Current state  As of April 2015 the number of visitors amounted to 1,240,945 unique visitors per month, who made 17,044 entries, 251,839 comments for the specified period. 202 communities were being updated actively during this time.  Users status and moderation system  Since 2006, each user has the opportunity to express their opinions on the site, by pressing the '+' or '‚Äì' button for comments and posts. In the same way, they can express their attitude to each individual user on their profile page. Depending on the number of the '+/-' entries the user receives, it is shown as a good or bad user ‚Äúkarma.‚Äù Some communities set restrictions and limitations on the karma level for making entries evaluating and commenting. If the user's karma level is too low they will not be able to post content. The user can give gifts to other users, or buy a gold account. The gold account does not use advertisements. It gives the user access to the golden communities as well as the ability to see what other users write about them in the information field in their profile. It also allows the user to put a title right next to the username ‚Äî light form of donation as the website staff says.  General rules  Spamming, manipulation with votes, posting confidential information about other users is prohibited. The website allows everything unless it is restricted by the federal law of Russian Federation e.g. posting illegal information, incite ethnic or religious hatred, call for suicide or promoting homosexuality or drug use. Any breaking of the website's rules the administration can ban any user. Communities can also make their own rules within themselves. If any of these rules are broken a community can ban that user.  Types of entries  In addition to posting links to content, users post their own original entries. There are four formats of publications. * Link entries ‚Äî the shortest format for forwarding to certain content from other websites or publishing a single image, video or text. * Gallery entries ‚Äî for posting unlimited original images and descriptions in a specific field. * Feature entries ‚Äî possess the ample opportunities for processing content. In this post, the user can insert a photo, video and audio files. The user has access to change the outlines and text size with the use of the graphic symbols. Entries graded by other users with more than one hundred pluses and less than three minuses become gold. Their author receives a star of honor, which is displayed on his/her profile page. Types of communities Communities are divided into open and closed (lists, karmas, or other grounds), with content available to the public, and other content is marked as 18+. The content covers a wide range of topics: from scientific innovations to sports news from the literary contributions to the image galleries of contemporary art. The communities are managed by their creators. However users can change their communities to become democratic, in those cases communities are run by an elected president and moderators. Community owner can go to settings and enable elections. In such a case, the owner passes on his obligations to the elected president. From that point he/she no longer is able to manage the community, and only is credited as a creator. The creator is able to turn off the election, returning everything back at any time.  Regular updates  The site is regularly updated and improved. The administration of the website reports these updates on a special blog. Since the beginning of 2015 the website moderators brought back the feature that allows the weight of the vote to vary depending on user's karma, which determines the rating of posts or comments, for which the users vote. The administration added a section called \\"Pulse\\", which shows what is being discussed among D3 users, and fixed the search engine that has not worked for many years.  Design  The logo of D3, a chicken, was taken from one of the works of surrealist artist Jeff Jordan. Next to the logo there is an image on each page which is called a D3 Geertruida (in honor of Mata Hari.) The D3 Geertruida changes with each updated page. The visual appearance of every community is a result of its managers or volunteers work.

She and Lawrence began a relationship, but Lawrence still had feelings for Carly Manning. Lisanne learned that Vivian and Carly were keeping a secret involving a past pregnancy, so told Lawrence, and it eventually emerged that Carly had been pregnant with Lawrence's child, who it was believed had died. However, when Vivian Alamain brought her adopted son, Nicky, to the United States later that year, a different story was to emerge. After some investigation into Nicky's background, Lisanne discovered that he was, in fact Lawrence and Carly's son, who Vivian had actually stolen. Lisanne began to blackmail Vivian with this information, but her plans led to her demise. Nicky returned home one day to find his aunt and Lisanne engaged in a heated argument. He saw Vivian falling to the floor, and believing that Lisanne was hurting his aunt, he tried to separate the two. In the process, Lisanne fell and struck her head on a stone cat. The fall proved fatal for Lisanne, but Vivian told Nicky that she was just unconscious. Vivian and Lawrence's servant, Ivan Marais, then concealed Lisanne's body in the basement, later making it look as though she had been killed in a car crash. Lisanne's death led Lawrence to realise that Nicky was his son, something which caused Vivian to suffer a heart attack. While recovering in hospital, she revealed the truth to Lawrence - she told Carly that Nicky had died, then raised him as her own, even buying her servant's son's birth certificate to cover up the truth. Lawrence subsequently told Carly, who confronted Vivian, threatening to take Nicky away from her. Vivian then tried to leave Salem with Nicky, but was stopped from doing so. Kidnapping charges were brought against Vivian, but later dropped; while she desperately tried to hide the truth from Nicky. However, he ultimately learned his real identity. Meanwhile, suspecting that Lisanne's death may have been the result of foul play, Bo Brady began investigating the Alamains. Vivian told Lawrence to dispose of the stone cat and the rug on which Lisanne had fallen, as both had traces of her blood. Lawrence buried the items in the woods, but was seen by a prostitute, who reported it to the police. Soon after, Bo caught Lawrence trying to dig up the stone cat and arrested him. Lawrence was charged with Lisanne's murder, and went to trial, but it was revealed that Nicky had killed her.

Jamie Caldwell Jamie Caldwell, played by Miriam Parrish, first appeared on a recurring status on April 16, 1993 until November 15, 1993 before being upgraded to contract status from November 29, 1993 until August 29, 1996. Jamie is Sami Brady's best friend and the godmother of Will Horton. Jamie worked with Sami at Salem University Hospital as a candy striper and was the first one to find out about her bulimia. She alerted Roman to this fact, while Sami originally believed Marlena told Roman. Jamie also frowned on many of Sami's many schemes to break up Austin and Carrie, including drugging Austin into sleeping with her. Friends later discovered that Jamie has been raped by her father and Jamie moved out of her house and into the Brady Pub. Jamie's character vanished soon after she revealed to Kate that Sami drugged Austin. The actress' contract was not renewed in late 1996 with Jamie simply disappearing without mention. Throughout her time in Salem, Jamie had a crush on Lucas Roberts. Peter Blake Peter Blake is a fictional character from the American NBC Daytime soap opera Days of Our Lives, portrayed by Jason Brooks. Brooks joined the cast of Days of Our Lives in 1993, airing on September 1, 1993 until November 23, 1993 on a recurring status until upgrading to contract status from December 1, 1993 till December 24, 1996, when the character was presumed dead after being shot by Jack Deveraux. Brooks returned to the role nearly a year later on November 21, 1997 until his departure on February 23, 1998. Peter and his sister Kristen were raised but not legally adopted by Stefano DiMera at a very young age following the deaths of their parents; however, their mother Rachel was later revealed to be alive. Peter is known for his relationship with Jennifer Horton whom he married and for contracting the fictitious psychosis-inducing disease \\"jungle madness\\". Peter was revealed to have faked his death, after which he was imprisoned for framing Jack and for abducting Jennifer. On July 31, 2019, Abe Carver mentioned that Peter disappeared after his release from prison. Franco Kelly Franco Kelly, played by Victor Alfieri from June 1996 to October 1998, first came to Salem to model for Titan. It was soon revealed that Kate Roberts hired him to break up Bo and Hope Brady so that her daughter Billie Reed could reunite with her former lover Bo. After Franco was exposed he tried to con Sami Brady into marriage so that he could hide from his mob past and obtain a real green card. Kate planned revenge on Sami by exposing Franco's true motives at their wedding. Before the wedding could take place, Sami discovered the truth and announced that she was going to \\"kill that bastard\\". Franco meanwhile, attempted to beat and kill Kate for threatening him but was stopped when Lucas Horton shot Franco, killing him. Kate wanted to protect Lucas and staged the scene to look like Sami killed Franco. Sami was put on trial and sentenced to death by lethal injection. In early June 1999, Sami nearly died but was saved when Lucas and Franco's old mob boss, Roberto, both confessed to the murder at the last minute. Although Lucas was the real shooter, the police believed a dying Roberto's confession. The truth of Franco's real murderer was never revealed except to Sami and Brandon Walker. Eliana Eliana, played by Ann Werner, was the long-time housekeeper of Stefano DiMera at the DiMera mansion. Ann Werner left the show to pursue a writing career, and the character of Eliana was said to have retired. Father Timothy Jansen Played by three different actors from 1996‚Äì2008, Father Jansen has been a consistent figure for the church going citizens of Salem at weddings, funerals and death- beds. He has been played by Michael O'Neil (1996), Jim Beaver (1996‚Äì97, 2000, 2002‚Äì03), and James Lancaster (2003‚Äì2005, 2008). Bart Beiderbecke Bart Beiderbecke is a longtime DiMera family associate portrayed by Steve Blackwood. Introduced in 1997, he was originally the right-hand man of Dr. Wilhelm Rolf. Following his death, Bart became Tony's loyal assistant. He appears to be the only member of the DiMera organization who feels any remorse for the pain that is inflicted upon the citizens of Salem as a result of the DiMeras' influence. However, he is smart enough to keep his mouth closed around Tony and Stefano when it comes to this. After Tony's failed attempt at escaping from prison, Bart was seen occasionally for a little longer before vanishing from the canvas completely. When Bart returned two years later, he was assigned the task of killing Sami Brady, a task which he attempted to complete by drugging her and tying her up inside her car, which was filling with carbon monoxide. He failed, however, when EJ DiMera rescued her. On August 3, 2007, Bart died when he was stabbed by Andr√© DiMera during a sword fight between Andre and Tony DiMera. Stefano mourned Bart's death and is now concerned that Bart may not have made sure that the key to ending the vendetta was kept out of Tony's possession. Steven \\"Jonesy\\" Jones Jonesy, played by Robert Mandan from 1997‚Äì1998, was Vivian's bizarre husband and caretaker of the DiMera townhouse in Salem. Vivian was first interested in Jonesy because she thought he owned the expensive townhouse and all of its treasures. Vivian accomplished this by hosting a mock s√©ance in which the real Flora Dora told Jonesy to move on with Vivian. Jonesy was not a well man and Vivian and he married in England, with Susan Banks and Edmund Crumb standing up for them. Jonesy died of a heart attack after consummating the marriage. Vivian inherited all of Jonesy's treasures which forced Stefano, the original owner of the townhouse, to marry Vivian in order to reclaim his possessions. Wilhelm Rolf Wilhelm Rolf has been portrayed by William Utay from September 19, 1997, to June 12, 2003, and June 4, 2007, to September 24, 2008, and again briefly from October 20 to November 21, 2017. Introduced in September 1997, Dr. Wilhelm Rolf was the DiMera family's jack-of-all-trades and was responsible for: saving Roman's life from jungle fever, brainwashing Hope in order to turn her into Princess Gina, orchestrating the infamous baby switch using his niece Margo's daughter, creating the Gemini Twins (Rex and Cassie Brady), and erasing Patch's and John's memories. He was 'killed' in June 2003 when a crate landed on him and his corpse was subsequently used to fake Larry Welch's death. Utay reprised his role in 2017 from October 20 to October 31. Rolf returned from the dead, explaining that his death \\"didn't take.\\" He assumed his old position as a lackey for the DiMeras when he was instructed to kill Sami by poisoning her food at the hospital. After Marlena put Stefano in a coma, Rolf became John's butler. Unbeknownst to John, Rolf began helping Marlena try to repair the disc that contains his memories. Rolf obeyed both John and Marlena in order to avoid jail time for many of his past evil deeds. His character frequently provided comic relief by dressing up in silly costumes or cracking one-liners, often in collaboration with Stefano's other henchman Bart Beiderbecke. In 2017, Clyde Weston (James Read) reveals that Rolf told him that Sami's late son Will Horton (Chandler Massey) is alive, therefore exonerating Clyde's deranged son Ben (Robert Scott Wilson) of the crime. On Oct. 24, 2017, after claiming to have revived the corpse of Will Horton while posing as a medical examiner in Salem, Rolf ingested a cyanide capsule and committed suicide as Sami Brady and Hope Brady looked on. On October 31, 2017 Rolf once again returned from the dead in a dream sequence, revived by Ben to bring his victims back to life. The pair later strangle Kayla Brady to death. Rolf dug up the graves of Serena Mason and Paige Larson, the two killing Chad, Abby and Lani respectively. Confronted by a surprised Hope and Rafe, Rolf turns her into Princess Gina via satellite and has Gina murder Rafe via lipstick laced with poison. Hope snaps out of it demanding to know what Rolf made her do. This is ultimately revealed as a nightmare of Abby's Rolf returns on October 22, 2018 in Kristen's Nashville warehouse.

When Jan returned years later, her parents were dead and she was still obsessed with Shawn. Nicole also convinced a deeply disturbed Jan to help her kill Victor Kiriakis which she did (later it was revealed that Victor survived). Jan kidnapped Shawn and held him prisoner in a cage. When Shawn escaped he crashed his motorcycle and lost his memory. He woke up thinking that he wanted to be with Jan and she manipulated him until he regained his memory.

In addition, they can be distinguished from most other Conophytums by the distinctive dots, which clearly form angular, (horseshoe- shaped) lines over their heads. They have pale pink flowers. Distribution It is indigenous to the Robertson Karoo vegetation of the Breede River Valley, Western Cape, South Africa. It is especially common in the mountains north of Worcester as well as in McGregor, south of Robertson and in Bonnievale. Their habitat is rocky crevices and outcrops, where they form clumps in sheltered or partially shaded positions. They receive rainfall primarily in the winter.

The book is standalone, unlike Novik's other fantasy series. Warner Brothers purchased rights to make a movie adaptation and assigned Ellen DeGeneres produce it. Synopsis  Agnieszka lives in the village of Dvernik in the kingdom of Polnya. Every ten years the local wizard (known as \\"the Dragon\\") collects one teenage girl as payment for protecting the local valley from the magical forest (the Wood) that borders it. Despite being born in a tribute year, Agnieszka does not fear being taken, as the Dragon only chooses the best and brightest girls and Agnieszka is clumsy and slovenly ‚Äì as opposed to her beautiful friend Kasia, who has been groomed to be taken by the Dragon from childhood. However at the choosing ceremony the Dragon picks Agnieszka and abruptly brings her to the white tower where he lives. Through notes left behind by previous girls, Agnieszka gathers that her role mostly involves performing household domestic duties for the Dragon. However, the Dragon has chosen Agnieszka because she has magical abilities, and he starts teaching her simple spells. Agnieszka finds these acts of magic difficult and unnatural to do. As part of his duties the Dragon is called away to deal with a Chimera. During his absence Agnieszka notices a call for assistance coming from her village. Defying the Dragon, she escapes from the tower and returns to Dvernik, where she learns that wolves from the Wood have infected the cattle and a man. Agnieszka successfully uses magic to help destroy the cattle, only for the wolves to return and to try to kill her and Kasia. Before they can do so, the Dragon arrives and manages to save her, but not before being wounded himself. Returning them both to the tower, Agnieszka manages to save the Dragon's life after she intuits a spell from a notebook (written by the witch Jaga) which the Dragon had previously believed to be useless. Recognizing that Agnieszka's powers differ from his own, the Dragon reluctantly allows Agnieszka to teach herself the more intuitive magic that Jaga used. Kasia gets captured by creatures from the Wood. Knowing that no one can return from the forest alive, the Dragon writes Kasia off as dead. However, Agnieszka uses her magic to locate the girl, where she is half-entombed in a tree that is feeding off her flesh, and to extract her. However, the Wood has corrupted Kasia, and the Dragon tells Agnieszka that her friend must be killed. He agrees to put off the execution, though. Agnieszka hits upon the idea of using a summoning spell to see if there is anything of Kasia still left in her body. She and the Dragon combine their magic and manage to free the girl's mind. News of Kasia spreads far and wide, bringing Prince Marek and his wizard, the Falcon, to the Dragon's tower. Once they realize that Kasia is no longer under the spell of the Wood they order the Dragon to go into the forest to retrieve the prince's mother, who ran away twenty years earlier. Agnieszka, Kasia, the Dragon, Prince Marek, the Falcon and a search party of thirty soldiers go into the Wood. Walkers and Mantises slaughter the troops but the party manages to free the Queen, who acts as if in a coma. The Dragon wants to use the opportunity to destroy the weakened Wood once and for all, but the Prince brings his mother and Kasia back to court so that they may prove they are free of the Wood's corruption. Agnieszka goes with them to testify. After some reluctance she gains certification as a witch and meets other witches and wizards. However things quickly go awry. The Queen speaks at her trial to cast blame on Rosya, the rival state to Polnya. A wizard is transformed into a hideous creature and slays the King before being slain himself. The Queen then manipulates her oldest son into going to war against Rosya, where he is ambushed and killed, and then traitor soldiers murder the Crown Prince's wife, intending to kill his children as well. Instead, Agnieszka and Kasia grab the children and flee to the Dragon's tower. The Dragon has been joined by a baron prepared to help protect the children against Prince Marek and the Queen. The Queen, Marek, and the Falcon arrive at the Dragon's tower and engage in a violent battle. Just before the Queen is about to kill her grandchildren, Agnieszka has a vision and realizes that the Queen has been inhabited by the Wood Queen, who hundreds of years ago was bricked alive by her subjects in what is now the Dragon's tower. Kasia tries to kill the Queen but ultimately fails, though she does manage to drive her back to the forest. Though the Dragon is satisfied to send the heirs away and to continue to slowly battle the forest, Agnieszka convinces him to go with her to defeat the forest once and for all. They come upon a glade of heart trees and try to burn the one in which the Wood Queen is entombed. She defeats both Agnieszka and the Dragon and forces Agnieszka into the trunk of the oldest tree. Once again Agnieszka has a vision of the past where she learns that the Wood Queen was part of a group of magical people who lived in the forest. She married a human king, however once he died his people turned on the wood people, causing them to choose to become trees in order to protect themselves. After they failed to kill the Wood Queen she returned to her people only to find them turned into trees and in a misguided effort to protect them, began feeding human people to the trees. Agnieszka succeeds in escaping from the tree and tells the Wood Queen to heal the tree of her sister with her own body. The Dragon remains skeptical that this will keep the forest in check. He decides however to go to the Polnya court in the city of Kralia to help free it of the corrupting influences that have taken root there ‚Äì though Agnieszka suspects him of running from his feelings for her. A year later Agnieszka has managed to tame the Walkers who now help her in burning corrupted trees and in planting new, good trees. At the local harvest the Dragon returns to collect his taxes ‚Äì though Agnieszka knows he has actually returned for her.

Cultural references The book, owing to the author's mother being Polish, contains a number of references to the Polish culture. Most Polnyan characters bear Polish names, including the protagonist whose name references a story Agnieszka Skrawek Nieba (Agnieszka Piece of Sky) by Natalia Ga≈Çczynska, as explained in the Acknowledgements. Baba Jaga is a common boogeyman in Slavic folklore. The rival nation of Polnya, Rosya, shares its pronunciation with the Polish word for Russia, Rosja. The 'birthday song about living a hundred years' to the melody of which Agnieszka chants the spell which cures the Dragon of corruption is the Polish birthday song Sto lat, literally 'one hundred years'. The lyrics of another song quoted in the book, 'about the spark on the hearth, telling its long stories', are translation of a part of a bedtime song Bajka iskierki (or, Z popielnika na Wojtusia) by Janina Porazi≈Ñska. At the final feast, Agnieszka tastes zhurek which is a phonetic spelling of an Eastern European soup known in Poland as ≈ºurek.

During the book, all the children's balloons burst, with the exception of Alon's, which the wind blew out of the children's reach. The children look at the balloon and shout \\"Bye, bye, red balloon!\\". Whenever one of the balloons bursts, the children are comforted and told \\"that's how all balloons end up\\". Each balloon had burst for the following different reasons: * Uri's balloon burst due to contact with a rose bush while Uri was playing with it like a ball. * Ron's balloon burst after his father over-inflated it since Ron wanted it to be \\"as big as the Sun\\". * Sigalit's balloon burst after being scratched by Mitzi, Sigalit's cat. * Ruti's balloon burst after she hugged it tightly.

This is a list of notable characters who significantly impacted storylines and made their first appearance between 2000 to 2009. Maxine Landis Maxine Landis is a fictional character from the NBC soap opera Days of Our Lives . She was portrayed by Aloma Wright from 2008 to 2015 when the character just dropped off the canvas. Aloma previously made a one episode appearance as a nurse named Jillian in 2007. Storylines Maxine is the head nurse at Salem's University Hospital. She often gets into the lives of the Salemites to offer a piece of advice. She played an instrumental role in helping to shape Melanie Jonas from a spoiled self-centered brat into a kind and compassionate woman, who eventually wanted to become a nurse. As a result, she and Melanie eventually became good friends. She has mentioned having two children in the past, a son and a daughter, and her husband Carl has passed away. She has been friends with Dr. Daniel Jonas and Jennifer Horton, and is now starting to date Abe Carver. Maxine and Abe must have split because Abe is now with Valerie Grant. J.T. Reiber J.T. Reiber, born on June 9, 2000, is introduced as the child intended to be adopted by Abe Carver (James Reynolds) and Lexie Carver (Ren√©e Jones). However, Lexie's father Stefano DiMera (Joseph Mascolo) switches the infant at birth with Bo and Hope's (Peter Reckell and Kristian Alfonso) son. After years of trying for a baby the natural way, Abe and Lexie Carver decide that they will adopt a child. When Lexie's father Stefano DiMera hears about the news, he is over joyed at the prospect of finally becoming a grandfather and asks that Abe and Lexie adopt the child of one of his distant relatives. The birth mother Marlo is in fact the niece of Dr. Rolf, Stefano's longtime assistant. However none the wiser to Lexie and Abe, Stefano is planning a plot whereby Marlo's baby would be switched with the baby of Bo and Hope's who Stefano at the time thought might be his or John Black's. After the births of the babies, Stefano has Dr. Rolf switch Hope's and Marlo's babies birth tags. So, the baby is instead taken home by Bo and Hope Brady and named John Thomas, getting his names from family friend John Black (Drake Hogestyn) and Hope's late grandfather Tom Horton (MacDonald Carey). Zack Brady Zack Brady was the second son and child of supercouple Hope and Bo Brady, born June 9, 2000. For the longest time, Zack is known as Isaac Theo Carver, the long- awaited and much-beloved son of Abe and Lexie Carver. For years the two had tried unsuccessfully to have a child of their own with no success, until Lexie's father, Stefano, got them in touch with Marlo, a young pregnant woman. Abe and Lexie adopt the baby that Marlo has given birth to, unaware that Stefano had switched Marlo and Hope's sons. Zack dies on January 1, 2006, after being run over by Bo's SUV, which is driven by his daughter, Chelsea. Upon his death, his liver is donated to his niece, Claire Brady, and his corneas are donated to Abe Carver; Claire's life is saved and Abe regains his eyesight.

In June 2016, he returns as an aged ghost (Scott Shilstone) to help his mother Hope. Bonnie Lockhart Bonnie Lockhart is the mother of Patrick, Mimi, and Conner Lockhart. The role was originated by Robin Riker, who played the role from July 11 to 31, 2000. Kathy Connell then played the role from August 15, 2000, to June 7, 2002. Judi Evans, who previously played Adrienne Johnson Kiriakis, took over the role the following year; she is the most notable actress to play the role and has had the longest tenure. Evans played Bonnie from September 1, 2003, to March 1, 2007. A decade later, Bonnie returned to the show on July 21, 2017, when Evans was also portraying Adrienne Kiriakis. The character departed again on October 25, 2017, then returned on August 20, 2018, and remained on the show until November 6 of that year. The character of Mimi Lockhart's mother was introduced as \\"Maureen Lockhart\\" in 2002. Her storyline mainly dealt with the Lockhart family's homelessness due to her husband David's unemployment. The character was completely reconceived in 2003 with Evans's introduction as Bonnie Lockhart, a brash, trashy schemer and gold-digger. With David having abandoned his family, Mrs. Lockhart reclaims her pre-marriage identity and desists from David's demeaning use of her hated middle name, Maureen. Working as a housecleaner, Bonnie resents her employers and other established families in Salem, even the blue-collar Bradys, because of what she perceives as their privilege. Bonnie frequently interferes in her daughter Mimi's life. When Mimi's boyfriend Rex Brady is believed to be a member of the wealthy DiMera family, Bonnie encourages the relationship. But after Rex's true Brady family heritage is revealed, Bonnie discourages Rex from proposing to Mimi and persuades a pregnant Mimi to have an abortion without telling Rex about the pregnancy. After one of her employers, Maggie Horton, is seemingly murdered in late 2003, Bonnie gets Maggie's widower, Mickey Horton, to marry her. Mickey sets her up as the impresario of Maggie's old restaurant, Chez Rouge, which she reopens as a honky-tonk, Alice's, named after her new mother-in-law, Alice Horton, in hopes of ingratiating herself with Mickey's skeptical family. Mickey ends his marriage to Bonnie to resume his relationship with Maggie after she is found alive. Hoping to extort the Kiriakis family, Bonnie pays Mimi's surrogate Lauren to carry to term after accidentally being implanted with an embryo fathered by Philip Kiriakis instead of by Mimi's boyfriend Shawn-Douglas Brady. In 2007, the skeleton of David Lockhart's murdered corpse is found buried under a church. Bonnie reveals that Mimi killed her abusive father in self-defense years earlier and blacked out the incident. To protect Mimi, Bonnie confesses to killing David and sends Mimi to live in Arizona and look after Connor there. Bonnie stands trial offscreen and is jailed. Bonnie's scheme with Lauren comes to light after Bonnie's incarceration ends the payments, so Lauren abandons the baby, Tyler, who is adopted. Bonnie escapes from prison in 2017 with the help of Hattie Adams and Anjelica Deveraux. It is established that Bonnie looks identical to Adrienne Kiriakis, which was not addressed in Evans's previous appearances as the characters. Anjelica abducts Adrienne and leaves her imprisoned in Bonnie's place while Bonnie impersonates Adrienne. Anjelica orders Bonnie to break up with Adrienne's boyfriend Lucas Horton and reunite with Adrienne's and Angelica's ex-husband, Justin Kiriakis, and then break his heart, enabling Anjelica to seduce him. Bonnie dumps Lucas, despite her attraction to him. This drives recovering alcoholic Lucas to drink, and when he drunkenly returns to Bonnie's hotel room, she welcomes him for a tryst. When Anjelica suddenly dies of a heart attack, Bonnie focuses on getting revenge on Maggie for, as she sees it, stealing Mickey from her. Using Justin to gain access to the Kiriakis mansion, where Maggie lives as Victor Kiriakis's wife after Mikey's death, Bonnie obtains incriminating information about Victor and attempts to blackmail him into divorcing Maggie and marrying her. Victor agrees, but secretly informs his loved ones about the blackmail, humoring Bonnie to buy time to eliminate the evidence of his crimes. To prevent parolee Sheila Watkins from honoring Adrienne's request to raise the alarm, Bonnie gives Sheila a job as a housekeeper. Victor rebukes Bonnie at the intended wedding, and Adrienne's brother Steve Johnson detects her impersonation and exposes her. She flees Salem before she can be sent back to jail. The next year, Bonnie returns to Salem with a baby, also named Bonnie, she claims was conceived with Lucas in their one-night stand. A DNA test proves that the baby is Bonnie and Lucas's. Bonnie then hides \\"Baby Bonnie\\" and refuses to divulge her whereabouts unless Lucas helps extricate her from her legal problems. Bonnie is set to be released when the truth is revealed: the baby is really Emily, Mimi's daughter by Rex from their own one-night stand in a recent chance meeting. The DNA test produced a false positive due to the close relationships between Bonnie and her daughter, and between brothers Rex and Lucas. Bonnie's deal is rescinded, and Hattie convinces Bonnie to return to prison and serve out the remainder of her sentence. In 2019, after the show's one-year time jump, Bonnie has been released from prison and written a memoir. Bonnie does not appear onscreen, but Hattie reads Bonnie's book, Love Made Me Loony.

When they returned to Europe, Brandon and Angela got married. When a spy from her father saw Brandon and Sami kiss, he hired two gunmen to kill Sami and Brandon at the coronation of Greta Von Amberg.

When Brandon married Angela anyway, Vincent was convinced he loved his daughter. Kate later slept with Vincent to convince him to kill Victor and manipulated him into spying on Sami and Brandon. When his spy told him about the kiss he ordered Victor, Brandon and Sami to be murdered at the coronation of Greta Von Amberg. Chaos erupted then and Angela threw herself in front of Brandon, saving his life. Vincent was so upset at the events that he set in motion, that he committed suicide. Hattie Adams Hattie Adams is a woman who bore a resemblance to Marlena Evans. Under the guidance of Wilhelm Rolf, she had plastic surgery to increase this resemblance. Stefano DiMera planned to use Hattie against Marlena, but never implemented such a plan. Hattie eventually had further surgery (off-screen) to look identical to Marlena and reappeared briefly in 2004; she was suspected of being a serial killer after Marlena was supposedly witnessed committing the crimes, but it was determined that Marlena had performed the acts under hypnosis and Hattie was not involved. In 2016, an incarcerated Hope Williams Brady encounters Hattie in prison and they become allies; upset that Stefano had interfered in her life, Hattie is pleased that Hope had murdered him.

Jack eventually admitted that he was not gay, which led to Harold criticizing him for his cowardice. Harold later happened to be in Las Vegas at the same time as Jack and Greta, and he helped them hide from mob hitmen by disguising themselves as showgirls. To his dismay, Jack then learned that Harold was the son of Oliver Wentworth, the owner of the Spectator. This was the local newspaper, which Jack hoped to run; Jennifer got the job instead, due in part to Harold's recommendation. Harold then worked at the Spectator, and was able to maintain a friendly, professional relationship with Jack. He last appeared during the summer of 2003, shortly before the Salem Stalker storyline started. By 2006, though not shown on-screen, Harold had become editor of the Spectator; Jack and Jennifer learned that he was offering them a job running the London bureau of the paper, which they accepted.

As time went on it was discovered that they were the children of Andre DiMera (who at the time was impersonating his cousin Tony DiMera) and Marlena Evans but this turned out to be false. In reality a sperm sample was somehow taken from Roman Brady during his years of captivity at the hands of Tony's father Stefano DiMera and combined with eggs taken from Kate Roberts who was a prostitute and associate of Stefano's. Rex and, to a lesser extent, Cassie seemed to have super human intelligence. Rex also suffered mysterious mood swings and psychotic tendencies during Salem Stalker storyline. He dated Mimi Lockhart but they broke up when Rex discovered Mimi aborted his baby without telling him about it.

Barb read them secretly, realizing Glen was the father of J.T., and not Isaac's father, and went back to Salem to blackmail Lexie Carver. She succeeded in getting several thousand dollars, and then told Glen that she was pregnant with their child, hoping he will not try to search for the truth. Eventually they both returned to Salem and crashed Lexie's party. When Lexie didn't come up with the million dollars, Barb blew the whistle. Glen sought out a slick attorney, Cameron Reese, to sue for custody of J.T. In the ensuing DNA test, it was proven that Glen was J.T.'s father.

As a result, she left Grace at a convent orphanage. On March 30, 2009, Sami brought Grace home to Salem telling everybody she was her \\"adopted\\" daughter. The same day she made Rafe, her former bodyguard turned boyfriend, Grace's godfather. The baby was christened Grace Rafaela; Grace in honor of the convent and what Sami perceived as God's intervention in helping her to have and keep her baby, and Rafaela in honor of Rafe. Grace died on June 9, 2009 from bacterial meningitis. Grace's parents, Sami Brady and Rafe Hernandez, were at her bedside when she died. She had also been held on that day by her biological mother, Mia. On June 11, 2009 Sami revealed to E.J. that he was \\"Grace's biological father,\\" still unaware that the baby she had raised was not genetically theirs. Sydney DiMera Sydney DiMera is the daughter of EJ DiMera and Sami Brady. Sydney is born in secret on January 28, 2009, while her mother is in witness protection, and she is switched shortly after birth with Grace Brady, the daughter of a teenage mother, Mia, who has agreed to give her baby up for adoption to Nicole Walker. Nicole, who has miscarried her fianc√© E.J.'s daughter, has arranged in secret to adopt Mia's baby and pass the child off as E.J.'s, fearful that she would lose EJ without a baby. When Nicole learns that Sami had just recently given birth to her and E.J.'s daughter the same day Mia gave birth to hers, Nicole switches the babies, preferring to have E.J.'s biological daughter over an unrelated child. Nicole instantly bonds with Sydney, and vows to always protect her no matter what happens. Sami and E.J. are none the wiser to Nicole's treachery, and Sami and Rafe bond with \\"Sami's\\" daughter, while EJ and Nicole bond with \\"their\\" daughter. E.J. eventually learns that Nicole had a miscarriage and he kicks Nicole and Sydney out of the mansion, not knowing the truth about Sydney. Eventually, Sami also learns that Sydney is her biological daughter. Soon after, E.J. learns that Sydney is his biological child with Sami. However, the family reunion turns into a nightmare when Brady Black bails Nicole out of jail and she kidnaps Sydney. Nicole has a change of heart and decides to tell E.J. and Sami where Sydney is, but she is knocked out by Anna DiMera, who takes Sydney. It is later revealed that Anna was hired by E.J. to kidnap Sydney. Sydney becomes the subject of many custody battles between E.J. and Sami over the next few years, with Nicole involved, as well, during the time she is married to E.J. They later come to an agreement, though, and Sydney is able to stay with her entire family, including her siblings, Johnny, Allie Horton, and Will Horton. Sydney became an aunt when Gabi Hernandez gave birth to Will's daughter, Arianna Horton. Nathan Horton Nathan Horton, portrayed by Mark Hapka, is a doctor who came to Salem in June 2009 to start an internship at Salem University Hospital. He is the son of Melissa Horton; his father has never been identified. On his first day at the hospital, he meets Melanie Layton, and they start a flirtation. Later, Melanie is surprised and alarmed when she returns home to Maggie Horton's house to find a half-dressed Nathan, fresh out of the shower, as she hadn't yet learned that he is Maggie's grandson; Maggie soon arrives and explains that Nathan would be living there. When Nathan learns that Melanie was the girl his cousin Nick Fallon had been involved with, he blames her for ruining Nick's life and speaks harshly to her about it. When Maggie informs Nathan that Melanie had been Nick's victim and that she spoke on his behalf in court, Nathan apologizes to Melanie and she accepts. He moves into Lucas's house after learning Maggie feels uncomfortable with him and Melanie dating while living under the same roof. Madeline Peterson Woods Madeline Peterson Woods, portrayed by Jessica Tuck, is the mother of Chad DiMera. Madeline died after falling down a flight of stairs during an argument with Chad.

This vehicle was designed to carry two people and became famous under the name \\"cuckoo.\\" It has 750 kg weight, of which 370 kg held battery. Capacity of fully charged battery was enough for about 60 km way at a speed of 35 versts per hour (about 39 km/h).

First electric omnibus by Hyppolyte Romanov in Gatchina His 20-seater electric omnibus designed for hotels was built in the \\"Dux\\" factory in Moscow in 1902 . Its design featured running gear steel tire. However, the development of electric transport in the country needed support from the state. On January 19, 1901 Romanov was asked by St. Petersburg City Duma to open 10 routes. This required 80 omnibuses, which need totalling funds of more than 500,000 rubles. To find such huge amounts of money, it was decided to establish a joint stock company, which failed, because its direct competitors (different omnibus and tram companies) were clearly unhappy with the new form of transport. As the result all Romanov's efforts to establish regular traffic of electric buses failed. Seeing that his ideas were not popular, Romanov transferred to work in other areas of electrical engineering. He built eight electrical vehicles: 4 trucks, 1 three-cycled van and 3 private passenger cars by mid-1914, according to the magazine \\"Motorist\\".

Its aim was to provide an SME policy framework to improve competitiveness and promote entrepreneurship. Rather than being a legislative Act, it contains provisions applying to small firms, directed at governments and institutions to \\"think small first\\" when establishing policy and law. Content The SBA invites the Commission and Member States to adopt: * ten principles to guide policy-making * legislative proposals guided by the \\"think small first\\" principle: the General Block Exemption Regulation on State Aids; Regulation providing for a Statute for a European Private Company; Directive on reduced VAT rates * policy measures that implement the ten principles at the Community and Member State levels.Bruno Dallago; Chiara Guglielmetti; Michele Rondinelli. 2012.

It provides an \\"SME test\\" to ensure SMEs are taken into account at an early stage of the policy-making process. As such, all new administrative or legislative proposals are to be subjected to an SME impact review.

It can also be referred to as entity resolution. Name resolution in simple text For example, in the text mining field, software frequently needs to interpret the following text: > John gave Edward the book. He then stood up and called to John to come back > into the room. In these sentences, the software must determine whether the pronoun \\"he\\" refers to \\"John\\", or \\"Edward\\" from the first sentence. The software must also determine whether the \\"John\\" referred to in the second sentence is the same as the \\"John\\" in the first sentence, or a third person whose name also happens to be \\"John\\". Such examples apply to almost all languages, and not only English. Name resolution across documents Frequently, this type of name resolution is also used across documents, for example to determine whether the \\"George Bush\\" referenced in an old newspaper article as President of the United States (George H. W. Bush) is the same person as the \\"George Bush\\" mentioned in a separate news article years later about a man who is running for President (George W. Bush.) Because many people may have the same name, analysts and software must take into account substantially more information than only a name to determine whether two identical references (\\"George Bush\\") actually refer to the same specific entity or person. Name/entity resolution in text extraction and semantics is a notoriously difficult problem, in part because in many cases there is not sufficient information to make an accurate determination. Numerous partial solutions exist that rely on specific contextual clues found in the data, but there is no currently known general solution.

The bodach is a trickster figure, consort or male analogue of the cailleach (\\"hag\\"), already known from Old Irish sources, but this early modern tale is the only source of his identification with Manann√°n. In the tale the Fianna is challenged to foot-race by one \\"Ironbones, son of the king of Thessaly. The race is to be from Benn √âtair to Munster. Ca√≠lte mac R√≥n√°in, the best runner of the Fianna, is away at Tara. As Fionn mac Cumhaill goes to look for Ca√≠lte, he encounters a repulsive giant, the titular bodach, who agrees to run the race on the Fianna's behalf. As the race begins, the bodach seems to perform very badly, getting up late in the day, long after the challenger has already left. He then turns out to be an extremely swift runner, overtaking Ironbones twice, but he then stops to eat blackberries, or even backtracks after losing his coat. He still wins the race easily, and is later revealed to have been Manann√°n mac Lir in disguise.

Overview Expressions in computer programs reference variables, data types, functions, classes, objects, libraries, packages and other entities by name. In that context, name resolution refers to the association of those not-necessarily- unique names with the intended program entities. The algorithms that determine what those identifiers refer to in specific contexts are part of the language definition. The complexity of these algorithms is influenced by the sophistication of the language. For example, name resolution in assembly language usually involves only a single simple table lookup, while name resolution in C++ is extremely complicated as it involves: * namespaces, which make it possible for an identifier to have different meanings depending on its associated namespace; * scopes, which make it possible for an identifier to have different meanings at different scope levels, and which involves various scope overriding and hiding rules. At the most basic level name resolution usually attempts to find the binding in the smallest enclosing scope, so that for example local variables supersede global variables; this is called shadowing. * visibility rules, which determine whether identifiers from specific namespaces or scopes are visible from the current context; * overloading, which makes it possible for an identifier to have different meanings depending on how it is used, even in a single namespace or scope; * accessibility, which determines whether identifiers from an otherwise visible scope are actually accessible and participate in the name resolution process. Static versus dynamic In programming languages, name resolution can be performed either at compile time or at runtime. The former is called static name resolution, the latter is called dynamic name resolution. A somewhat common misconception is that dynamic typing implies dynamic name resolution. For example, Erlang is dynamically typed but has static name resolution. However, static typing does imply static name resolution. Static name resolution catches, at compile time, use of variables that are not in scope; preventing programmer errors. Languages with dynamic scope resolution sacrifice this safety for more flexibility; they can typically set and get variables in the same scope at runtime. For example, in the Python interactive REPL: >>> number = 99 >>> first_noun = \\"problems\\" >>> second_noun = \\"hound\\" >>> # Which variables to use are decided at runtime >>> print(f\\"I got {number} {first_noun} but a {second_noun} ain't one.\\") I got 99 problems but a hound ain't one. However, relying on dynamic name resolution in code is discouraged by the Python community. The feature also may be removed in a later version of Python. Examples of languages that use static name resolution include C, C++, E, Erlang, Haskell, Java, Pascal, Scheme, and Smalltalk. Examples of languages that use dynamic name resolution include some Lisp dialects, Perl, PHP, Python, REBOL, and Tcl. Name masking Masking occurs when the same identifier is used for different entities in overlapping lexical scopes. At the level of variables (rather than names), this is known as variable shadowing. An identifier I' (for variable X') masks an identifier I (for variable X) when two conditions are met # I' has the same name as I # I' is defined in a scope which is a subset of the scope of I The outer variable X is said to be shadowed by the inner variable X'. For example, the parameter \\"foo\\" shadows the local variable \\"foo\\" in this common pattern: private int foo; // Name \\"foo\\" is declared in the outer scope public void setFoo(int foo) { // Name \\"foo\\" is declared in the inner scope, and is function-local. this.foo = foo; // Since \\"foo\\" will be first found (and resolved) in the innermost scope, // in order to successfully overwrite the stored value of the attribute \\"foo\\" // with the new value of the incoming parameter \\"foo\\", a distinction is made // between \\"this.foo\\" (the object attribute) and \\"foo\\" (the function parameter). } public int getFoo() { return foo; } Name masking can cause complications in function overloading, due to overloading not happening across scopes in some languages, notably C++, thus requiring all overloaded functions to be redeclared or explicitly imported into a given namespace. Alpha renaming to make name resolution trivial In programming languages with lexical scoping that do not reflect over variable names, Œ±-conversion (or Œ±-renaming) can be used to make name resolution easy by finding a substitution that makes sure that no variable name masks another name in a containing scope. Alpha-renaming can make static code analysis easier since only the alpha renamer needs to understand the language's scoping rules. For example, in this code: class Point { private: double x, y; public: Point(double x, double y) { // x and y declared here mask the privates setX(x); setY(y); } void setX(double newx) { x = newx; } void setY(double newy) { y = newy; } } within the \`Point\` constructor, the class variables \`x\` and \`y\` are shadowed by local variables of the same name. This might be alpha-renamed to: class Point { private: double x, y; public: Point(double a, double b) { setX(a); setY(b); } void setX(double newx) { x = newx; } void setY(double newy) { y = newy; } } In the new version, there is no masking, so it is immediately obvious which uses correspond to which declarations.

Computer operating systems commonly employ multiple key/value lists that associate easily remembered names with the integer numbers used to identify users, groups, other computers, hardware devices, and other entities. In that context, name resolution refers to the retrieval of numeric values given the associated names, while Reverse name resolution refers to the opposite process of finding the name(s) associated with specified numeric values: * In computer networking, it refers to processes used to obtain the assigned IP addresses needed to communicate with devices whose host or domain names are known. Examples include the Domain Name System (DNS), Network Information Service and Multicast DNS (mDNS). IP addresses for devices on the local segment can in turn be resolved to MAC addresses by invoking the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). * Unix operating systems associate both an alphanumeric name and a user or group ID with each user account or defined group of user names. The GNU C library provides various operating system facilities that shell commands and other applications can call to resolve such names to the corresponding addresses or IDs, and vice versa.

Based around an early 19th-century house and developed as an inn and tea room in the early 20th century, the property exemplifies the adaptive reuse of older properties for the tourist trade in Maine. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. Description and history Watchtide by the Sea is set on the southeast side of US 1, roughly midway between downtown Searsport and Moose Point State Park. The inn consists of a 1-1/2 story Cape style house, which is connected by a long single-story ell extending to its left to a converted barn. The Cape is five bays wide, with a side gable roof and end chimneys, and has a porch extending across its front and a full-width shed-roof dormer above. The ell has smaller shed-roof dormers, which was also found on the barn's southern roof. The interior of the Cape has Greek Revival styling, and is organized in a typical Federal period central hall plan, enlarged by the presence of the dormer above, and an enclosed porch to the rear. The house was built about 1800, and was acquired in 1902 by George and Rose Pettee for use as a summer house. A number of the enlargements and alterations were made during their ownership, and the property was opened as a tea room and inn by their daughter Frances in 1917, known as the \\"College Club T House\\". Still under the Pettees' ownership, it operated under several variants of the \\"College Club\\" name through 1953. Although this practice of converting older buildings for use in the tourist trade was quite common in Maine, there are relatively few well-preserved examples, of which this is one.

Martin was a recent graduate of the Wilkes-Barre Business College. On December 17, 1938, she met an unknown man who claimed to be offering her a secretarial job, and was never seen alive again. Her body was discovered in the wilderness away by a hunter four days later. Martin's death resulted in a lengthy manhunt. Numerous suspects were examined, but no one was ever convicted of the crime. As of , it remains an unsolved case. Victim Margaret Martin was a resident of Kingston, in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. She graduated from Kingston High School in 1937. She took classes at the Wilkes-Barre Business College to gain secretarial skills and graduated with honors at the beginning of December 1938. She was 19 years old at the time of her death. According to Betty Hopkins, a former classmate, Martin was \\"a shy, studious, friendly girl who had many friends.\\" Her parents described her as \\"a living saint.\\" She was also a devout Catholic. Martin's father was John Martin, a local foreman and minor politician. Margaret Martin was the eldest of four children. Disappearance On December 17, 1938, a man contacted Martin, claiming that he was setting up an insurance company and needed a secretary, adding that he had heard of her through the Wilkes-Barre Business College. The two agreed to meet in Kingston Corners, not far from Martin's home. Martin was first noted to be missing that evening, after she had failed to return home from the alleged job interview. Several witnesses said they saw her getting into a brown Plymouth or black sedan with a man after a brief conversation. This was the last time she was seen alive. The witnesses were able to give only vague descriptions of the man, described as a \\"suave, neat, sandy-haired young man,\\" and did not identify the car's license plate. The man was between 25 and 30 years of age and slightly overweight. Martin's friends and family called the police and started a search, but her disappearance was difficult to publicize since the local newspapers were on strike. Death and discovery of the body According to a 1999 article in the Times Leader, Martin was tortured and murdered in a sawmill in the mountains about from the creek where her body was found. According to theories by the police, the killer had attempted to dismember her body and destroy it in the mill's firebox, but had been scared off by the mill's owner, James Kedd. Kedd had assumed that the killer was a mere trespasser and had fired a warning shot in the killer's direction. The killer then drove to a point close to the creek and carried Martin's body the final 75 yards to the creek, where he abandoned it. Initially, it was suspected that Martin's disappearance was linked to a sex slavery ring. However, her body was discovered in the forested wilderness of Northmoreland Township, Wyoming County, on December 21, 1938, about from her home. The discoverer was 19-year- old Anthony Rezykowski, who was trapping muskrats in the area. Rezykowski noticed a large burlap bag partially submerged in of water in a creek. Upon further investigation, he found the bag to contain the mutilated body of a young woman with no clothing. The body was soon identified as Margaret Martin. At the time of her body's discovery, she had been dead for at least 24 hours. If not for Rezykowski's discovery of her body, it may have gone unnoticed for several years. Martin's body showed signs of having been beatenperhaps with a rockand strangled. She had bruises on her throat and body, as well as knife wounds on her stomach and thigh. Her autopsy found the cause of death to be strangulation and stated that she had \\"suffered the molestation of a degenerate.\\" Initial investigations Investigators at the location where Martin's body was discovered After the discovery of Martin's body, approximately 75 state troopers combed the area in search of clues. However, no tire tracks were seen near the site where her body was found, and the burlap bag proved to be of no use in identifying any suspects. According to The Citizens' Voice, burned cloth matching the clothing Martin was wearing when she was last seen was discovered at an abandoned sawmill near Forkston. However, an article in The Kane Republican stated that this was not the origin of the cloth. An incident involving a bundle of clothing being thrown from a car near Orwigsburg proved to be unrelated to Martin's killing. On December 22, the Scranton Tribune predicted that Martin's killer would be arrested within 24 hours. Many hundreds of people attended Martin's funeral at St. Ignatius Church in Kingston on December 24. Plainclothes police officers also attended her funeral in the hopes of noticing anyone suspicious attending. Several theories about the identity of Martin's murderer were suggested by locals. These included a mortician from Wyoming County, a businessman's son who left the area soon after the murder, a local assistant pastor, a teacher at the Wilkes-Barre Business College, and a local teenager who had a crush on Martin. Two men who had attempted to attack a 16-year-old girl from Hanover Township, Luzerne County, were also investigated. Some investigators believed that due to the killer's familiarity with the area's terrain, the killer must have been a local. More recently, it has been suggested that the killer was actually a non-local serial killer. Impact and aftermath On December 28, 1938, Pennsylvania state senator Leo C. Mundy stated that at the next state legislature, he would introduce a bill making sex crimes punishable by execution and requiring registration for all sex offenders. Mundy had resolved to introduce the bill due to Martin's murder. Physicians and welfare and social service workers would also be required to report anyone with tendencies towards such offenses. By the beginning of 1939, most clues pertaining to Martin's murder had proven to be useless. The manhunt for the killer was still ongoing in February of that year, but the police had not turned up any more information. In June 1939, further clues were discovered, but the killer was not identified. Although a very large number of suspects were investigated after Martin's death, no perpetrator was ever identified. In September 1942, Orban Taylor of New York City confessed to Martin's murder. However, his confession was proven to be false after ten hours of investigation. Taylor was not charged with that crime although he did confess to several other crimes. In 1948, a decade after Martin's murder, the case was one of the few major unsolved murders in Pennsylvania. In 1999, Peter Paul Olszewski, Jr., who was at the time the Luzerne County District Attorney, stated that even with modern criminal investigation methods and forensic techniques, it is unlikely that the identity of Martin's killer will be discovered. It is presumed that the killer is now long-deceased.

After six months working as an assistant in the cutting room, Parker asked to direct her own film. She secured the funding for the film herself, asking for sponsorship from the Department of National Health and Welfare. Cinematographer Judith Crawley filmed and Parker directed the production, which was called Vitamins A, B, C. The film educated viewers about maintaining nutrition with wartime shortages and featured a great deal of footage of children. She later worked with Graham McInnes on a film called \\"A Friend for Supper.\\" According to McInnes the slogan \\"a friend for supper,\\" was Parker's idea, a way of encouraging Canadian children not to waste food by imagining they were having a 'friend' ‚Äî a child refugee ‚Äî over for a meal with them. McInnes was dubious because he thought this notion would encourage children to eat more instead of less but his \\"misgivings were without foundation,\\" he later wrote. \\"She shot the film as planned. Despite the equivocal logic it was an instant and continuing success with children ‚Äî and with adults.\\" This success was the beginning of Parker's long involvement with children and education through film. Her next film, Before They Are Six (1943) also dealt with children, as well as women's challenges during wartime.

Born September 17, 1945 by David Vitale and Paola Cesa, he became CEO of the family business, the Maglificio Calzificio Torinese, in 1968 at 23 years of age. He turned the Robe di Kappa after seeing a John Lennon interview on US television wearing the military-green shirt of a fallen US soldier in Vietnam. As thousands of T-shirts left unsold in its company's warehouses, he got the products dyed in military green and had them decorated with army patches and put them on the market. It was a resounding success. Sensing that the future for his company would have been in the youth casual-dressing, in 1971 he introduced a new jeans brand - Blue Jesus, launched with the advertising campaign 'He who loves me follows me' - stirring controversy with a then-powerful Roman Catholic Church resisting social change ignited by the youths across the West and hitting record retail sales for an Italian jeans brand. In 1980, Jesus was the first jeans brand to be made available in the Soviet Union, through a joint venture Maurizio signed, licensing the brand and production techniques to a state-owned garment producer. In the early '80s he once more showed his nature of setter of fashion and garments trends when he re-positioned Robe di Kappa as an active sportswear brand and, in the process, created a new sector in the Italian market. The brand was launched with professional football player and teen-age girls icon Marco Tardelli, pre-empting the trend of using professional athletes as brand testimonials, which later has become the pillar of global growth of sportswear brands such as Nike and Adidas. In 1981, he signed what it turned out to be the 1st technical sponsorship deal with a Football Club, which granted Robe di Kappa the right to brand playing kits of professional club FC Juventus - an agreement which lasted a record 23 years. In 1984 the brand Kappa sponsored the US Track & Field Olympic team at the Los Angeles 1984 Games. Maurizio Vitale was married twice and had four offspring: Maurizio Junior and Tancredi with Maddalena Marrone; Maria (who didn't survive birth) and Oliviero with Carolina Blaaw. Maurizio Vitale died prematurely in Turin, on June 4, 1987 at 41 years of age.

History  Sweden's capacity to protect its neutrality was questioned after the Crimean War 1854‚Äì56. England and France persuaded Sweden to fortify the inlet at F√•r√∂ with artillery batteries and naval mines. The fortress was built from 1885 to 1886 and consisted of three fixed batteries; Central Battery (batt. I), Northern Battery (batt. II) and Southern Battery (batt. III). At the turn of the century, the batteries were reconstructed. The batteries I and II were given modern quick-firing 57 mm guns, four per battery. F√•r√∂sund Fortress, which was name of the coastal position from 1915, was disbanded as such on 30 September 1919, and the coastal artillery detachment was relocated to Vaxholm Fortress and all equipment was removed. After the fortress was closed down and was taken over by the Swedish Prison and Probation Service in 1919, a penitential center was establishment. The fortress had been proposed as a detention center for social dangerous offenders, if and when legislation for such came about. No such laws did arise and the entire fortress was declared a listed building in 1935. In 1993, the National Property Board of Sweden took over the administration of the batteries which until that date had belonged to the Swedish Fortifications Agency. Under the company name F√•r√∂sund F√§stning AB, with business owner Peter Alv√©rus, it began in 2004 to build a hotel in and around battery I. The company went bankrupt on 15 September 2004 before construction was completed and the National Property Board completed the construction work. During 2005‚Äì2006 the facility was leased to Bj√∂rn Gustafsson. In 2008, Pontus Fritiof through the Pontus Group took over the hotel and conference facility F√•r√∂sund F√§stning AB together with the tenant Bj√∂rn Gustafsson. On 17 October 2012, F√•r√∂sunds f√§stning hotell och restaurang AB filed for bankruptcy at Stockholm District Court. The bankruptcy auction expired after bankruptcy trustee brought about a complete transfer of operations of the business and inventory to the new-old owner Peter Alv√©rus.

It is 71 km long and leads from Hanau to Gem√ºnden am Main, cutting across the so-called Mainviereck, a large loop of the river Main. The trail follows an ancient trade route which in the Middle Ages was an important road for moving troops and for long-distance trade. The Birkenhainer Stra√üe was a part of the link between Nuremberg and Antwerp. Its origins may lie back as far as the Neolithic period. The name likely derives from a prominent copse of birch trees that used to exist near the road at Geiselbach (Hesse). History Border stone on the Birkenhainer Stra√üe near Hanau-Neuwirtshaus, showing the Wheel of Mainz to the south and the Hanau chevron on the north side Bayrische Schanz, former border post and tavern Nearby findings and burial sites from the Neolithic and circular ramparts from the Iron Age indicate that the historic road Birkenhainer Stra√üe or at least an assortment of its paths was used that long ago. In the Middle Ages, it was an important link between Eastern Franconia and the Rhine-Main region (Rhenish-Franconia). Past Hanau, the route crossed the river Main at Steinheim and continued along its southern bank to Mainz. It was used by travelling Emperors like Frederick Barbarossa on his way to the Imperial Diet at W√ºrzburg, as well as by military forces. Back then, the Birkenhainer Stra√üe also served as an important trade route between Nuremberg and Antwerp and was used for cattle drives. It was used by the renowned wagon drivers from Frammersbach, who dominated long-distance trade along several key routes. The Birkenhainer Stra√üe was the subject of a symposium in 2014 organized by the which since 2012 has also conducted excavations at some points along the route. The name Birkenhainer Stra√üe likely derives from a copse of birch trees that stood near the village of Geiselbach, where several branches of the road meet to continue on together. The copse was referred to as Birkenhain in a document by the Abbey Seligenstadt dating from 1527. Route The old road began at the mouth of the Kinzig. The modern hiking trail mostly follows the historic route (which in some places was not just a single path but several alternative routes) and crosses the Spessart as a high route. It avoids the valleys and keeps to the peaks and ridges, as climbing up and down the slopes was difficult and arduous with horse- or ox-drawn wagons. At the same time, the route was much shorter than following the valley of the Main river in its great loop south to Wertheim and Miltenberg and back up to Aschaffenburg and Hanau. The trail is maintained and signposted by the with a black \\"B\\" on white. The trail starts at the Bundesstra√üe 8 not far from the , the remains of a small Roman fortification on the Limes Germanicus, located in the forests near Hanau. It then heads east to the boundary between the states of Hesse and Bavaria and largely follows it past Rodenbach, near the and Freigericht before leaving the borderline to continue eastward. The trail then leads through the outskirts of Geiselbach, the likely location of the birch copse that gave the road its name. At this point, several alternative routes met and continued onwards in a single direction. Heading north, the trail rejoins the Hessian‚ÄìBavarian border near Linsengericht and turns east again. At the Dr.-Kihn-Platz (named after ), it joins another modern trail/historic route, the Eselsweg, and the two routes continue east together to , an artificial lake, where the Birkenhainer Stra√üe leaves the border. Near Fl√∂rsbach (Fl√∂rsbachtal) it crosses the . Looping around the valley of Lohrhaupten (Fl√∂rsbachtal), it rejoins the border and continues along it southwards before entering Bavaria for good near the Bayrische Schanz (sconce), an old border post. The trail then goes almost directly east, passes (Lohr am Main) and the former location of (a Premonstratensian monastery). Past the Zollberg, named after a toll station between the territories of the Elector of Mainz and the Bishopric of W√ºrzburg, the trail finally leads down into the Main valley at Langenprozelten and continues into Gem√ºnden am Main where it terminates at the old town, east of the Franconian Saale.

As a solo artist he has been nominated for thirteen Grammy awards and ten NAACP Image Awards (including two wins), received a 2009 Soul Train Icon Award, and was a recipient of a BMI Icon Award in 2005. In 2009, he was named Billboard magazine's No. 1 Adult R&B; Artist, and his song \\"There Goes My Baby\\" was named the No. 1 Urban Adult Song for 2009 in Billboard Magazine. On June 30, 2013, BET honored Wilson with a Lifetime Achievement Award that was presented to him by Justin Timberlake. The BET tribute performances included renditions of Wilson's songs performed by India Arie (\\"There Goes My Baby\\"), Jamie Foxx (\\"Yearning for Your Love\\"), and Stevie Wonder (\\"Burn Rubber\\") but it was not until Wilson himself took to the stage at the request of Timberlake to perform his Grammy-nominated song \\"You Are\\" and then transition into a medley of hit songs performing alongside Timberlake and surprise guests Snoop Dogg and Pharrell Williams that Wilson stole the show during the youth-oriented program. The Charlie Wilson tribute helped BET achieve the highest ratings in years for the program and also earned the network the #1 primetime spot in the 18‚Äì49 demographic topping all its broadcast and cable competition for the night in both demographics and total viewers. Wilson is the national spokesman of the Prostate Cancer Foundation where there is a Creativity Award in his name which donates hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to researchers across the country for the development of creative science that conforms to PCF funding principles but is short-term and designed to allow development of otherwise unfunded ideas. Early life Charlie Wilson was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on January 29, 1953; he was the son of the Reverend Oscar Wilson, a minister in the Church of God in Christ. With his older brother Ronnie and younger brother Robert, Wilson often sang in church before their father's Sunday sermons, accompanied on piano by their mother. He also sang in his junior high school's choir, which was a precursor to his musical career with the Gap Band and later his solo career. He attended high school at Booker T. Washington. He attended Langston University and would go on to become drum major in the Langston University Marching Pride. Career =The Gap Band= From the start of his career, Charlie and his brothers, Robert and Ronnie, helped define and popularize an upbeat form of funk music that was infectious and lasting with their group the Gap Band. The group's songs such as ‚ÄúOutstanding‚Äù, \\"Party Train\\", \\"Yearning for Your Love\\", \\"Burn Rubber on Me\\", ‚ÄúYou Dropped a Bomb on Me‚Äù, and ‚ÄúOops Upside Your Head‚Äù are among their immense catalog and some of the most sampled songs in music history. After 15 albums the Gap Band announced their retirement in 2010. =Solo= thumb According to Wilson's website, rapper Snoop Dogg (with whom he is good friends) nicknamed him \\"Uncle Charlie\\".The Wikipedia Files with Charlie Wilson (Gap Band, not late congressman). Wikipedia Files. 6 April 2010. Snoop and his wife, Shante, renewed their vows in April 2008 at Wilson's 20 acre ranch outside of Los Angeles, CA. The event inspired the music video to Wilson's hit \\"There Goes My Baby\\", which featured Snoop and his wife and was given to them as a gift symbolizing their relationship. A few years later, Michael Paran persuaded Wilson to embark on a solo career. Paran, who is CEO of P Music Group, was responsible for rebranding the GAP Band in 1997 and repositioning them as one of the top R&B; touring groups, has managed Wilson for the past 14 years Paran and Wilson independently released Wilson's first solo album Bridging the Gap, which scored them Wilson's first No. 1 Billboard Urban Adult Contemporary single, ‚ÄúWithout You.‚Äù. In 2004, Paran successfully negotiated a multi-album deal for Wilson with Jive Records. The first album from that deal, Charlie, Last Name Wilson, debuted in the fall of 2005 featuring production from various hit-making producers including R. Kelly, Justin Timberlake, will.i.am, the Underdogs, Kay Gee, and the Platinum Brothers. The album, which was certified gold by the R.I.A.A., produced the hit single, ‚ÄúCharlie, Last Name Wilson\\". Since then, Wilson has consistently topped the Billboard Urban Adult Contemporary chart with singles from his follow up albums through P Music/Jive Records. His 2009 CD, Uncle Charlie, debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 200 and No. 1 on the Billboard R&B;/Hip-Hop chart, and received two 2010 Grammy nominations: Best R&B; Album and Best R&B; Vocal Performance, Male for \\"There Goes My Baby\\". In December 2010, Just Charlie, was released and spawned the hit single ‚ÄúYou Are\\" which held the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Urban Adult Contemporary chart for 13 weeks as well as 15 weeks consecutively on the Mediabase chart.

In the year of 1986, Wilson contributed vocals to Roger & Zapp's hit \\"Computer Love\\", a song that become a hit despite initial opposition from Wilson's label. There was a discussion between Troutman and Wilson to create a music video for the song. Unfortunately, this did not come to fruition, due to opposition from the label that Wilson was signed to at the time. The fact that both singers were from rival bands played a hand in the opposition as well. However, the two maintained their close friendship, and would perform often the song together on stage. In 1989, Wilson worked with Eurythmics on their album We Too Are One, providing backing vocals on several tracks and co- writing the hit song \\"Revival\\".

Wilson also worked with 2Pac and the Dogg Pound on an unreleased song \\"Just Watching\\" (1996), as well as \\"Wanted Dead Or Alive\\", which featured him on the hook and 2Pac & Snoop rapping. He was also featured on the Grammy-nominated single \\"Beautiful\\" (together with Pharrell) from Snoop's 2002 album Paid tha Cost to Be da Boss. Additionally, Wilson appeared on \\"Signs\\" (with Justin Timberlake) and \\"Perfect\\", both songs from Snoop's 2004 album R&G; (Rhythm & Gangsta) The Masterpiece.

In 1998, Wilson performed on Mystikal's Ghetto Fabulous album. In 2007, Wilson performed in two songs on UGK's Underground Kingz album: \\"Quit Hatin' the South\\" and \\"How Long Can It Last\\".

Personal life In 1995, Wilson married Mahin Tat. They met in that same year, when she was his social worker during his time in a drug rehabilitation program.

It took until 9 February 2013 for Zeefuik to score again, which he later score another, in a 2-1 win over RKC Waalwijk. Zeefuik was on the sidelined again when he suffered an abdominal muscle injury that kept him out for weeks. Zeefuik made his return to the first team against Heracles Almelo, but was involved in a dispute with teammate Leandro Bacuna, whether who should take it. Eventually, Bacuna took the penalty and it was converted successfully. Zeekfuik scored in the next game on 20 April 2013, in a 3-1 win over ADO Den Haag. On the last game of the season against Ajax, Zeefuik was dropped from the first team due to a conditional disadvantage. In his first season at Groningen, Zeefuik made twenty-seven appearance and scoring four times. In the 2013-14 season, Zeefuik was sidelined from the first team for the first three matches, due to not match fit. Zeefuik scored his first goal on his return, in a 3-3 draw against Go Ahead Eagles, followed up his three more goals against Ajax, RKC Waalwijk and Amsterdamsche Soon after, Zeefiuk suffered a hamstring injury that kept him out for months. After returning to training in late-November Despite expecting to be sidelined until winter, Zeefuik made his return to the first team on 22 December 2013, where he came on as a substitute for hat-trick scorer Michael de Leeuw, in a 5-2 win over NEC. In the January transfer window, Zeefuik was linked with a move to Cambuur, but wasn't interested. After rejecting a move to Cambuur, Zeefuik was involved in the first team, but was occasionally used when he mostly on the substitute bench in the second half of the season, as he made fourteen appearance and scoring three times. In the 2014-15 season, Zeefuik found himself in the transfer speculation when he was linked to Turkish side Samsunspor. There was newspaper reports in Netherlands, claiming that Zeefuik joined Willem II on loan. However, Zeefuik failed his medical after Willem II found out his histories of groin injury despite the deal was agreed. Zeefuik was previously linked with a move to Austria side Wolfsberger AC, but his hopes of moving Wolfsberger have cooled down. However, Zeefuik made no appearance for the club in the 2014-15 season. Following his return to FC Groningen, Zeefuik was released from his contract in July 2015. This came after the club's director Hans Nijland stated he has no future at Groningen ahead of the 2015-16 season. The club was keen on selling Zeefuik to the highest bidder in the summer. Loan to Hearts Zeefuik signed for Scottish club Hearts on loan on 8 January 2015 until the end of the season. In his first interview after joining the club he spoke of how Mark de Vries and Soufian El Hassnaoui were influential in helping him come to the club. On his debut, he scored twice in a 5‚Äì1 win at Dumbarton and missed a penalty, denying him a hat-trick. On 28 February, he scored a hat-trick in three first-half minutes in a 10-0 rout of Cowdenbeath, two of which were penalties. His hat- trick become the ninth fastest hat-trick in senior football. On the final day of 2014/15 season, Zeefuik scored a late double against Rangers to draw on his final appearance for Heart of Midlothian. At the expiry of his loan deal he returned to FC Groningen, rumors of a permanent transfer to Hearts were circulated in the press but did not come to fruition. This was put down to FC Groningen wishing a transfer fee rumoured to be around ¬£300-400k which was over Hearts transfer budget. =Balikesirspor= Rumours once again circulated that he would resign for Heart of Midlothian but following their recruitment of Spanish striker Juanma no move materialised. On July 20, speculation was ended when he signed for newly promoted Turkish side Balikesirspor. Zeefuik made his Balikesirspor debut, in the opening game of the season, in a 0‚Äì0 draw against Gaziantep BB, before coming off in the 66th minute. Despite Zeefuik scoring 12 goals throughout the season, Balikesirspor's chairman announced at the end of the campaign that he had not met expectations and that the club would listen to offers for him in the market. International career Zeefuik represented the Netherlands at various youth level, including Netherlands U17, Netherlands U19 and Netherlands U21. Though born in Amsterdam, Netherlands, Zeefuik was eligible to play for Suriname and was called up in late-December, but Groningen rejected the call-up.

It was released in 2000 and is the final part of what many now consider to be Tran's \\"Vietnam trilogy.\\" The film centres on three sisters who live in present-day Hanoi: Suong is the eldest, then Khanh in the middle, and Lien is the youngest. The film takes place over the course of one month, starting on the anniversary of their mother's death and ending on the anniversary of their father's. Tran was inspired to make the film after visiting Hanoi during a break in the filming of Cyclo during the Christmas holidays in 1994. This drama was lensed in Vietnam's capital, Hanoi, as well as in H·∫° Long Bay and the village of Luoi Ngoc, Qu·∫£ng Ninh Province. The film's original score is composed by T√¥n-Th·∫•t Ti·∫øt. Additionally, three songs of the noted Vietnamese songwriter Tr·ªãnh C√¥ng S∆°n are interspersed through the film, as are songs by The Velvet Underground, Lou Reed, Arab Strap, and The Married Monk. The Vertical Ray of the Sun was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival. Plot On the anniversary of their mother's death, three sisters in contemporary Hanoi meet to prepare a memorial banquet. After the banquet, the calm exteriors of the sisters' lives begin to give way to more turbulent truths, which will affect their seemingly idyllic relationships. The eldest sister has a small boy nicknamed Little Mouse, and botanical photographer husband Quoc, who is prone to long absences from home. The middle sister has recently discovered that she is pregnant to her husband Kien, who is a writer suffering from writer's block. The flirtatious youngest sister constantly fantasises about being pregnant, and lives with her brother Hai, for whom she has a deep affection. With the brilliant Vietnamese summer as a setting, Vertical Ray of the Sun is beautiful from beginning to end, a charming, slow-paced, face value, family saga film.

Oge is an American engineer and environmental regulator who served as the Director of the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Radiation and Indoor Air from 1990 to 1994 and Director of the Office of Transportation and Air Quality from 1994 to 2012. Beginning in 2009, Oge lead the EPA team that authored the 2010-2016 and the 2017-2025 Light-Duty Vehicle Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards. By 2025, these rules require automakers to half the greenhouse gas emissions of cars and light duty trucks while doubling fuel economy. These rules were the US federal government's first regulatory actions to reduce greenhouse gases. Early life and education Born in Athens, Greece, Oge studied in the United States and received a master's degree in engineering from the University of Massachusetts at Lowell. She later attended George Washington University and the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.  EPA career  Oge began working at the EPA in 1980 in the Office of Toxic Chemicals. In 1986 she was assigned to the office of Rhode Island Senator John Chafee. While there, Oge helped draft a law requiring the plastic six pack rings to be biodegradable. In 1990 she became the director at the EPA's Office of Indoor Air and Radiation. In 1993, her office released a report finding that secondhand smoke represented a public health danger. The report was attacked by the tobacco industry and not formally released until courts ruled in favor of EPA in 2002. In 1994, Oge became Director of the Office of Transportation and Air Quality. While there, her office issued multiple regulations aimed at reducing harmful emissions in the transportation industry. In addition to automobiles and trucks, these programs targeted reductions of toxic emissions from heavy-duty trucks, buses, locomotives, marine vessels, off-road equipment gasoline and diesel fuel. Combined, the programs are estimated by the EPA to prevent over 40,000 premature deaths and hundreds of thousands of respiratory illnesses each year. Her office also implemented the Renewable Fuel Standard, which will increase the volume of biofuels in the United States‚Äô fuel supply.  2010 and 2012 Greenhouse Gas Regulations  In 2009, Oge's office, in conjunction with the National Highway Safety Administration and the State of California, began negotiating new vehicle emissions and fuel economy regulations with automakers. These negotiations resulted in the 2010 light duty vehicle greenhouse gas and corporate average fuel economy standard. The measure targeted increases in fuel economy and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for new cars in model years 2012 through 2016. These regulations represented the first significant increases in fuel economy since the mid 1980s. They were also the first ever federal regulation to mandate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. In 2011 Oge led EPA's efforts working with the National Highway Safety Administration to set the first climate action to reduce greenhouse gas and improve fuel efficiency of medium to heavy duty trucks up to 23 percent from 2014 to 2018 and save fleet owners $50 billion annually. In 2012, Oge again lead the EPA efforts on regulation that extended the greenhouse gas emissions reductions through 2025. The regulation will require automakers in the US market to double the fleet-wide fuel efficiency of their 2025 models to 54.5 mpg. The deal also requires automakers to cut greenhouse gas emissions from their 2025 models in half from 2010 levels. The EPA estimates that, by 2025, these rules will double fuel efficiency of cars and trucks, reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent and save consumers $1.7 trillion in fuel costs. In September 2014, Economist ranked these standards as the world's sixth most effective measure in slowing climate change. The regulations require a mid term review in 2018 and have recently been attacked by auto industry officials.  Post-EPA Life  Oge retired from the EPA in September 2012. She is currently serves as a Distinguished Fellow with ClimateWorks Foundation, serves as a member on the International Sustainability Council of the Volkswagen Group, and is a board member of the National Academies of Science on Energy and Environment, the Union of Concerned Scientists, the International Council on Clean Transportation, and Member of the National Academies of Science Advisory Committee for the U.S. Global Climate Change Research Program. In April 2015, Arcade Press released Oge's book Driving the Future: Combatting Climate Change with Cleaner, Smarter Cars.  References  Category:1949 births Category:Living people ","title":"Margo T.

History Faj√£ do Ouvidor √† diast√¢ncia, ilha de S√£o Jorge, A√ßores, Portugal. The faj√£ received its name due to its association with Val√©rio Lopes de Azevedo, the magistrate/superintendent of the Donatary- Captain at the time, who was one of the principal property-owners. During the 17th century, a whale-watching hut was established on the flanks of the faj√£ in order to spot whales transiting the northern coast. Fisherman from Ouvidor and surrounding settlements would then leave their homes in order to hunt whales: due to the decline of whaling the outpost was abandoned. There is one religious meeting-point in the faj√£: the Hermitage of Nossa Senhora das Dores, which dates to 1903, and includes old images created in the parish of Norte Grande. In 1948 a formal roadway was opened to the public, from the principal viewpoint to the coast. Geography Faj√£ do Ouvidor, vista geral. Faj√£ do Ouvidor, povoado. Vista Parcia da Faj√£ do Ouvidor, ilha de S√£o Jorge, A√ßores, Portugal. =Physical geography= The faj√£ is known for the geological feature along the coast, including the many po√ßas, or tidal pools (such as the Po√ßa Jo√£o Dias and Po√ßo do Carneiro). The lava fields generated many natural pools that support protected natural swimming areas, the largest being the Po√ßa de Sim√£o Dias. Similarly, the faj√£'s coast is dotted by grottoes and coves, formed by marine erosion, including the Furna do Lobo, a cove approximately long and only accessible by boat. Among the waterways that descend from the flanks of Norte Pequeno are the Ribeira da Casa Velha (supporting eels). the Grotinha do Fur√£o and the Ribeira do Ilh√©u, supported by two important springs: the Abelheira, situated alongside the roadway to Ouvidor, and the Caminho Velho on the otherside of the main square. =Biome= The more abundant species of fish in the waters include: Mediterranean parrotfish (Sparisoma cretense), moray eel, anchovy, grouper, wrasse, in addition to crabs and limpets. Marine and terrestrial birds vary throughout the year, influenced by migratory patterns and climate. In addition to local terns, shearwaters and herons, the faj√£ is visited by wagtails, sparrows and common blackbird (Turdus merula) throughout the year, with other species arriving in the summer months. =Human geography= The faj√£ is occupied by couple of dozen homes, some dating back centuries. But, less than half those homes are constantly inhabited throughout the year. The majority of the remaining homes, and new dwellings are inhabited during the summer months, when local population \\"booms\\" with summer tourists and visitors: there are approximately 30 families that have homes in this community. It is one of the few faj√£s that have a sufficient population to support a disco, caf√©, restaurant and lighthouse and is one of the most visited faj√£s on the island, due to its ease and access from the interior. During the winter months there are farmers who graze their few cattle on private land, but generally, arable land is occupied by potato, bean, corn, garlic, onions and small vineyards. The fishing port that includes a crane, supports various maritime activities including boating and recreational and artisanal fishing, using hooks or nets. Culture The festival honour Our Lady of Sorrows () occurs annually on the third Sunday in September, with mass, sermon and a procession paying vows of its parishioners.

Oge, who served as the director of the EPA's Office of Transportation and Air Quality from 1994 to 2012. The book covers climate science, politics, regulations, auto technology and proposes how to meet greenhouse gas reduction goals. The book combines primary source research, Oge's first-hand knowledge of events and dozens of interviews with technical, environmental, regulatory, policy and legal experts. It is organized into three sections. Section 1 In the first, Oge reviews the origins of climate change theory dating back to the 1800s and the politicization of climate change-related issues beginning in the 1980s. Section 2 The second section details an ultimately successful effort to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from passenger vehicles. This effort resulted in changes to both Corporate Average Fuel Economy and, under the authority of the EPA, established the first ever federal greenhouse gas standards. As a result of these rules, manufacturers‚Äô fleets must average 54.5 mpg by 2025. The Economist magazine ranked them as the sixth most effective international action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Section 3 The third section examines the necessity and possibility of much more dramatic increases in fuel economy while accelerating the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Oge argues that, to meet the goal of a less than 2 degree Celsius rise in global temperatures, cars and trucks will have to average the equivalent of 180 mpg. Oge writes that this is possible using a combination of auto technologies, including more efficient internal combustion engines, battery electric, fuel cell and hybrid vehicles, higher energy density batteries, non-food stock bio-fuels, autonomous vehicles and connected vehicles. Global trends Oge also predicts that several global trends, including the growth of mega-cities, internationally converging fuel economy regulations and demand-side peak oil will ultimately result in reduced greenhouse gas emissions from passenger vehicles. Oge also examines the impact of social trends, such as a reduced rate of vehicle ownership and driver's licenses as well as increasing use of ride-sharing and on-demand cars among Millennials in OECD nations. She believes that electric cars are essential to hitting greenhouse gas targets and predicts that in the decades to come we will see widespread conversion to pure electric vehicles. Critical response Kirkus Reviews highlights that the book is ‚Äúhighly detailed and carries the authority of a woman who has fought diligently and consistently for each step forward on the efficiency regulations she sees as a crucial part of our nation‚Äôs response to climate change‚Äù.

It is a rhizomatous perennial, from the mountains of the Balkans in Europe, within the countries of Greece, former Yugoslavia, Turkey and North Macedonia. It has sage green or grey-green leaves, that are sickle- shaped, a stout short stem and 2 variable flowers, in shades from yellow to purple. They have a white or blue beard. It is often called Iris pumila subsp attica, but is classified in most sources, as a separate species, although it is closely related to Iris pumila, as a possible parent plant. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions. Description It is similar in form to Iris suaveolens, that also appears with yellow or purple forms.Basak Gardner and Chris Gardner They are also have flowers in similar colours/shades to Iris pumila, as well as the form of the iris,Kelly Norris but smaller. It has small rhizomes, that spread out, to form clumps of plants. It has glaucous, sage-green, or green grey leaves. They can grow up to between long, and 4-7mm wide. They are lanceolate with a sharp curvature, or sickle shaped. It has a stout stem, that can grow up to between tall. Although, very occasionally they can reach 15 cm tall. The stems hold 2 terminal (top of stem) flowers, blooming in spring, or early summer, between March,Lawrence Durrell April, May, or late as June. The slender, flowers are in diameter, come in various shades, from yellow to purple. Including whitish, pale yellow, greenish yellow, lemon yellow, mustard yellow, to blue, blue-purple, violet- blue, and mauve shades. Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. In the centre of the falls, is a beard. Which can vary in colour, from white through to blue, or bright blue. Some flowers are bi-coloured. The yellow forms have a brown signal patch on the falls. The purple or violet forms have contrasting spots in violet or plum. The standards are upright. After the iris has flowered, it produces a seed capsule that has not been described yet. =Biochemistry= In 1956, Mitra conducted karyological studies on the samples of specimens that they collected, and stated that Iris pumila (2n = 32) was an amphidiploid of Iris attica Boiss. & Heldr. (2n = 16) and Iris pseudopumila Tineo. (2n = 16). In 1979, a karyotype analysis study was carried out on Iris attica, Iris mellita (a synonym of Iris suaveolens Boiss. & Reut.) and Iris reichenbachii. It found that Iris attica was 2n=16, both Iris mellita and Iris reichenbachii were 2n = 24. As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has been counted several times; 2n=16 by Simonet, 2n=16 by Randolph in 1954 and 2n=16 Randolph and Mitra in 1956. Then in 1979 by Love. It has a published chromosome count of 2n=16.British Iris Society (1997) Taxonomy It has the common name of 'Greek Iris'. The Latin specific epithet attica refers to Attica, the former name of Athens in Greece.Sue Gordon (Editor) It was first published and described by Edmond Boissier and Theodor von Heldreich in 'Diagnoses Plantarum Orientalium novarum.' (Diagn. Pl. Orient.) Vol.2 Issue 4, on page 91 in 1859. In 1862, it was published (as Iris attica) in 'Gartenflora' Vol.11 377. 1862 (with a colour illustratation), then in The Gardeners' Chronicle Vol.674 in 1865. In 1890, Iris pumila subsp. attica was then published by K.Richt. in 'Plantae Europeae' (Pl. Eur.) Vol.1 on page 253. This re-classified the species as a subspecies of Iris pumila, as Iris pumila subsp. attica.Bob Gibbons But some botanists and sources disagreed with this re-classification, and still refer to the species as Iris attica. It was verified as Iris attica by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 27 December 2002, then updated on 1 December 2004. Iris attica is an accepted name by the RHS and listed in the RHS Plant Finder book. It is listed as Iris pumila ssp. attica in the Encyclopedia of Life. Distribution and habitat It is native to south eastern Europe. =Range= It is found in the Balkans, within the countries of Greece, (including Mount Egaleo, Delphi, Parnassos, Peloponnese, and many other regions of Greece,) former Yugoslavia, Turkey, and North Macedonia, (including near Ohrid). In 2013, Iris variegata L. and Iris pumila subsp. attica (Boiss. & Heldr.) K.Richt was found in Albania, during field trips in Prespa National Park and on Pashtriku Mountain in 2006, 2011 and then in 2012. =Habitat= It grows on the well drained, sunny, rocky mountainsides. On stony slopes, stony heaths and on rocky ground. It has been found with Fritillaria fleischeriana found growing on areas of rocky limestone amongst scattered juniper trees. They can be found at an altitude of above sea level. Conservation It status in the wild is currently unknown, but thought to be very common. Cultivation The leaves of Iris attica growing with a species of 100px It is hardy to between USDA Zone 3 and Zone 8, or Zone 10. It is hardy to Zone H2 in Europe (meaning ‚àí15 to ‚àí20 ¬∞C (5 to ‚àí4 ¬∞F).). It is thought to be not very hardy in the UK (due to the dampness in winter), so best grown an alpine house or bulb frame, or deep pot. It is prone to viral diseases, if left in water or overwatered. It prefers to be grown in well-drained soils, (including gritty loam,) with plenty of aeration. Similar to a scree. It can tolerate a ph level of between 6.1 and 6.5 (mildly acidic) ‚Äì 7.6 to 7.8 (mildly alkaline). It prefers a position in full sun, to partial shade. It has average water needs, during the growing months, but needs a period of summer dormancy (a period of dryness after the blooms have faded). It can be grown in a rock garden, in crevices or between small stones, or in large troughs. =Propagation= It can be propagated by division of the rhizomes or by seed growing. Collecting the seeds from the ripe and dry capsules (after the plant has bloom), they can be grown straight away, or stored. =Hybrids and cultivars= In 1995, it was reported by (Whitehouse and Warburton), that Iris pumila (an allotetraploid) is a cross between Iris attica and Iris pseudopumila (another diploid iris).Dan H. Meckenstock Several cultivars have been created from Iris attica including; 'Attica Parnes', 'Dr. Crenshaw', 'Herrick' and 'Sounion'. Iris attica crosses (with other irises) include; 'Cap Sounion', 'Chancelot', 'Goldenes Fuellhorn', 'Goldhaube', 'Mama Mia' and 'Nibelungehort'.' Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), can cause stomach pains and vomiting if mistakenly ingested. Handling the plant may cause skin irritation or an allergic reaction.David G Spoerke and Susan C. Smolinske Culture In the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, the goddess Persephone and her companion nymphs (the Oceanids along with Artemis and Athena) were gathering flowers such as rose, crocus, violet, iris (also called 'agallis' or ·ºÄŒ≥Œ±ŒªŒªŒØœÇ (in Greek script), lily, larkspur, and hyacinth.R. P. Winnington-Ingram Flowers in a springtime meadow before she was abducted by the god Hades. It has been suggested that 'agallis' mentioned, was a dwarf iris, (in form to leaf and root shape described,Leonhard Schmitz (Editor) ) and identified as Iris attica.Umberto Quattrocchi References Sources * Kohlein, Fritz. 1987.

David Healy is a retired footballer, who represented the Northern Ireland national football team between 2000 and 2013. During his international career, he played 95 matches in which he scored 36 goals, becoming his country's top scorer. Healy made his international debut in a friendly against Luxembourg at the Stade Josy Barthel in February 2000, scoring two goals in a 3‚Äì1 victory. In June 2004, he became Northern Ireland's all-time top scorer, after netting his 14th international goal in a friendly against Trinidad and Tobago; the previous record of 13 goals was held jointly by Billy Gillespie and Colin Clarke. As of October 2015, Kyle Lafferty is second to Healy in Northern Ireland's all-time scoring record, with 16 goals. Healy's final goal came in 2012, after a four-year goal drought, when he scored a 95th-minute equaliser against Azerbaijan during the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification. Healy is the only Northern Ireland player to have scored two international hat-tricks. Both were achieved during UEFA Euro 2008 qualification matches: the first came in a 3‚Äì2 win against Spain in September 2006, and the second in a 4‚Äì1 away defeat of Liechtenstein, six months later. Overall, Healy scored 13 goals during that qualification campaign, making him the highest-scoring player in a single European Championship qualification tournament. As a result of this record, he was presented with a special award by Michel Platini on behalf of UEFA. Healy held the record alone until October 2015, when Poland's Robert Lewandowski scored against the Republic of Ireland during qualification for UEFA Euro 2016 and matched Healy's feat. During Healy's career, Northern Ireland failed to qualify for either the FIFA World Cup or UEFA European Championship finals; the majority of his goals came in qualification matches (22), as opposed to friendlies. Healy has scored more goals (five) against Liechtenstein than any other nation, and more than half of his goals (20) were scored at Windsor Park in Belfast.

Before that, from 1925 to 1933, it was the regional subdivision of the Nazi Party in that area. History The Nazi Gau (plural Gaue) system was originally established in a party conference on 22 May 1926, in order to improve administration of the party structure. From 1933 onwards, after the Nazi seizure of power, the Gaue increasingly replaced the German states as administrative subdivisions in Germany. At the head of each Gau stood a Gauleiter, a position which became increasingly more powerful, especially after the outbreak of the Second World War, with little interference from above. Local Gauleiters often held government positions as well as party ones and were in charge of, among other things, propaganda and surveillance and, from September 1944 onward, the Volkssturm and the defense of the Gau. The position of Gauleiter in Halle- Merseburg was initially held by Walter Ernst from 1925 to 1926, followed by Paul Hinkler from 1926 to 1931 and Rudolf Jordan from 1931 to 1937. Joachim Albrecht Eggeling was the final Gauleiter, holding the position from 1937 to 1945. The first two Gauleiters, Ernst and Hinkler, both died in the final month of the war, the former killed in action, the latter through suicide. Jordan, the third Gauleiter, was sentenced to 25 years prison in the Soviet Union after the war but released in 1955 and died in 1988. He published his autobiography about his time as Gauleiter and in captivity which showed no indication that he was willing to take responsibility for the events in Nazi Germany. Eggeling, attempting to prevent the city of Halle from destruction, unsuccessfully petitioned the Nazi leadership in April 1945 to be permitted to not defend the city. After the refusal, Eggeling shot himself on 15 April 1945 with the city taken by the US Army on 19 April.

Geography  Aerial view (1968) Territet is located between Montreux and Veytaux, on the lake Geneva shore.  History  Territet unites several formerly separate hamlets. While the lower part (below the main road) was always called Territet, there were two other localities on the higher ground called Collonge and la Veraye. While the very first hotel of the region was opened in neighbouring Veytaux in 1829, other hotels were soon built in Territet, like the \\"Chasseur des Alpes\\" in 1840 which became in 1855 the H√¥tel des Alpes-Grand H√¥tel. The current Montreux city centre consisting of rich farmland was developed only later, which is why the Orient Express train would stop in the Territet station and not in Montreux. Foreign tourists started to stay in Territet from 1848 onwards and their numbers picked up from 1861 when the train station was opened. A number of VIPs visited Territet in the following years, among whom emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria in 1893 and his wife Empress Elisabeth of Austria (Empress Sissi) who came on her own four times.Evelyne L√ºthi-Graf, Article on Territet in Dictionnaire historique de la Suisse online, version of 5 July 2000 In 1879 the first phone to be installed in Switzerland was installed in √† Territet. Territet also had the first tennis court in Switzerland. It was created in 1894, exclusively for the use of the English tourists (Swiss or other nationalities weren't allowed to access this tennis court!).

Justin Sneed, the man who murdered Van Treese, agreed to plead guilty in exchange for testifying against Glossip, and received a sentence of life without parole. Glossip is the recipient of international attention due to the unusual nature of his conviction, for which there is little or no additional corroborating evidence. Glossip is notable for his role as named plaintiff in the 2015 Supreme Court case Glossip v. Gross, which ruled that executions carried out by a three-drug protocol of midazolam, pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In September and October 2015, Glossip was granted three successive stays of execution due to questions about Oklahoma's lethal injection drugs after Oklahoma Corrections Department officials used potassium acetate to execute Charles Frederick Warner on January 15, 2015, contrary to protocol. Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt ordered a multicounty grand jury investigation of the execution drug mix-up.  Murder of Barry Van Treese  On January 7, 1997, Justin Sneed beat Barry Van Treese to death gruesomely with a baseball bat.Liliana Segura & Jordan Smith, What Happened in Room 102, The Intercept (July 9, 2015). The killing occurred at the Best Budget Inn in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, where Van Tresse was the owner, Sneed was the maintenance man, and Richard Glossip was the manager. In exchange for avoiding the death penalty, Sneed confessed and told police that Glossip had instructed him to commit the murder. Glossip insisted on his actual innocence and refused to accept a plea bargain. In July 1998, an Oklahoma jury convicted Glossip of the murder and sentenced him to death. In 2001, the unanimous Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals threw out that conviction, calling the case \\"extremely weak\\" and finding Glossip had received unconstitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel.Glossip v. Oklahoma, 29 P.3d 597, 2001 O.K. C.R. 21 (Okla. Crim. App. 2001). In August 2004, a second Oklahoma jury convicted Glossip of the murder and sentenced him to death. Glossip complained that prosecutors had intimidated his defense attorney into resigning, but, in April 2007, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the death sentence, with two judges in the majority, one judge specially concurring, and two judges dissenting.Glossip v. Oklahoma, 157 P.3d 143, 2007 O.K. C.R. 12 (Okla. Crim. App. 2007). Glossip attracted the advocacy of Sister Helen Prejean, but failed to get the clemency board to consider letters from Sneed‚Äôs family, who believe Sneed is lying.  Innocence controversy  Glossip's legal team asserts that Justin Sneed was addicted to methamphetamine at the time that he murdered Van Treese, and that he habitually broke into vehicles in the parking lot of the Best Budget Inn while he was employed as a maintenance man. Glossip's execution is controversial in that he was convicted almost entirely on the testimony of Sneed, who confessed to bludgeoning Van Treese to death with an aluminum baseball bat by himself and who was spared a death sentence himself by implicating Glossip. In 2015, Oklahoma City police released a 1999 police report showing that a box of evidence had been marked for destruction. The report was never provided to attorneys who represented Richard Glossip in his second trial or his appeals according to his new defense team. In an interview published the same day Glossip's attorney Donald Knight criticised the previous attorneys, saying \\"They did a terrible job. Horrible. No preparation. No investigation.\\" On September 22, 2015, Glossip's attorneys filed papers referring to a July 1997 psychiatric evaluation of Sneed, in which he said he understood he was charged with murder in connection with a burglary and made no reference to Glossip's involvement. On September 23, 2015, Glossip's attorneys filed papers complaining that two new witnesses were being intimidated. In affidavits, one witness had claimed that Sneed laughed about lying in court about Glossip's involvement; another said he was convinced based on his conversations with Sneed that Sneed acted alone. On September 24, 2015 the Oklahoma attorney general's office filed papers stating that the claims of the new witnesses were \\"inherently suspect\\", and that the time it took Van Treese to die and whether blood loss contributed to his death did not affect the trial outcome, in response to a defense claim that the testimony of Dr. Chai Choi, who performed the autopsy, was incorrect. On September 28, 2015, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals voted 3-2 to proceed with execution.http://nebula.wsimg.com/48fc4a0c3f9be318b011c88989d09b0d?AccessKeyId=5A52C512D331E7A75AB9&disposition;=0&alloworigin;=1 Presiding Judge Clancy Smith wrote \\"While finality of judgment is important, the state has no interest in executing an actually innocent man. An evidentiary hearing will give Glossip the chance to prove his allegations that Sneed has recanted, or demonstrate to the court that he cannot provide evidence that would exonerate him.\\" Judge Arlene Johnson wrote that the original trial was \\"deeply flawed\\" and an evidentiary hearing should be ordered. On September 30, 2015, Glossip spoke to the UK's Sky News on the telephone from his cell as he was being served his last meal. Glossip said that Sneed testified at trial that Glossip did not wear or own gloves, \\"And now he's on TV saying that I did. It continues to show the discrepancies in anything that Justin Sneed has to say.\\" On the same day, Virgin CEO Richard Branson bought an advertisement in The Oklahoman newspaper which had campaigned against the execution, with Branson stating the evidence against Glossip is flawed and that \\"every person is deserving of a fair trial\\", adding, \\"Your state is about to execute a man whose guilt has not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\\" The United States Supreme Court denied a stay of execution. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote that he would grant a stay. = High- profile supporters = Richard Glossip has several high-profile supporters of his innocence, including Mark Ruffalo, Peter Sarsgaard, Sir Richard Branson, Susan Sarandon, Sister Helen Prejean, and Pope Francis. Oklahoma lethal injection protocol controversy  On October 13, 2014, the Oklahoma Attorney General said the state did not have adequate supply of execution drugs, and delayed the execution of Glossip and two other inmates. On January 28, 2015 the U.S. Supreme Court halted executions in Oklahoma until it decided on lethal injection drugs. Governor Mary Fallin stayed the execution after the Department of Corrections received potassium acetate instead of potassium chloride. Execution was reset for November 6, 2015.http://edition.cnn.com/2015/09/30/us/oklahoma-richard-glossip-midazolam- execution/index.html On October 1, 2015, Attorney General Scott Pruitt asked the Court of Criminal Appeals to issue an indefinite stay of all scheduled executions in Oklahoma, citing the Department of Correction's acquisition of a drug contrary to protocol, the next day, the request was granted. On October 6, 2015, Governor Mary Fallin said she hired an independent attorney, Robert McCampbell, to advise her on the legal process. On October 8, 2015, it was reported that Oklahoma Corrections Department officials used potassium acetate to execute Charles Frederick Warner on January 15, 2015, contrary to protocol. An attorney representing Glossip and other Oklahoma death row inmates said logs from Warner's execution initialed by a prison staff member indicated the use of potassium chloride; however, an autopsy report showed 12 vials of potassium acetate were used. According to a report on October 16, 2015, due to a grand jury investigation, it was likely the state would not conduct an execution for more than a year.  Midazolam controversy  Glossip was the plaintiff in Glossip v. Gross, a U.S. Supreme Court case decided in June 2015 in which a divided Court ruled 5-4 that midazolam may be used as a sedative in combination with other lethal injection drugs. The case was originally titled Warner v. Gross, but Glossip replaced Charles Frederick Warner as the plaintiff after Warner was executed in January 2015, also by Oklahoma, before the case was decided.  In popular culture  In 2017, Killing Richard Glossip, a four-part TV series about Glossip's innocence controversy and Oklahoma execution scandal premiered on Investigation Discovery.

Income inequality before and after taxes has risen significantly since the 1970s.  Controversies and arguments  Critiques of income inequality often refer to a casual chain linking unequal growth to a lessened economy. Unequal growth concentrates wealth in a small amount on consumers who can only buy so many things. As a result, the vast majority of people are left with little extra cash for goods and services thus less things are bought and the economy generates less capital than it otherwise might. Proponents of income inequality often reject the idea of increased government intervention in the markets which is inevitable if income inequality is to be fixed. Among the most notable arguments for income inequality are those concerning the natural effects of capitalism and the free markets.

It was most active and achieved its greatest commercial success during the 1990s; dealing largely in the field of urban music. It was originally distributed by its co- creator Arista Records from 1989 through 2001; after which it was shuttered and absorbed into Arista. In 2004, the label was rebooted, and it began operating through Jive Records until both were absorbed into RCA Records in 2011. Today, the label's back catalog and reissues are managed by Legacy Recordings. Company history LaFace was formed in 1989 as a joint venture between the producing duo Antonio \\"L.A.\\" Reid & Kenneth \\"Babyface\\" Edmonds, and Arista Records. The combined nicknames of the duo's successful production company inspired the name of the label. LaFace went on to become a successful label throughout the 1990s, responsible for launching the recording careers of such popular acts as: TLC, Toni Braxton, Outkast, Pink, Usher, Goodie Mob and Donell Jones. Towards the end of the decade, LaFace produced fewer artists, while Babyface began to focus more on his own music career. The label was acquired completely by Arista and BMG in 1999. In 2001, L.A. Reid was appointed Chairman/CEO of Arista. As a result of Reid's promotion, LaFace was dissolved as most of its prominent acts moved up to the main Arista label to continue to work under Reid. In 2004, after the corporate restructuring of the BMG labels, LaFace was reactivated as one-quarter of the newly reconstructed Zomba Music Group during the Sony BMG joint venture at the time. Most of its former roster, who had moved on to Arista, returned to the company upon its reactivation. In 2011, LaFace (along with its previous Jive/Zomba distributor) was again shuttered; this time being absorbed into RCA Records.

The Burmese invasion forces faced tough heavy resistance from the Siamese forces and finally withdrew the invasion when King Hsinbyushin died on June 10, 1776. As a result, the Burmese loss of southern Lan Na (Chiang Mai) later proved to be the end of their 200 years rule. Background Battle of Bangkeo in Ratchaburi In 1774, after the peace concluded between Konbaung and Qing Dynasty, a rebellion flared up in Lan Na mainly due to the repressive rule of the Burmese governor there, Thado Mindin. His contemptuous treatment of the local chiefs earned him their indignation. When a Siam army under the command of Chao Phraya Chakri and Chao Phraya Surasi reached Lampang, Phraya Chaban, Phraya Vaiwongsa and Phraya Kawila, the three local chiefs who had deserted the Burmese joined him in laying siege to Chiang Mai and soon King Taksin arrived on the spot. The city fell to the Siam armies in January 1775. The Burmese king sent another small army of 5,000 to attack Siam. But it was completely surrounded by the Siamese at Battle of Bangkeo in Ratchaburi, and eventually starvation compelled the Burmese to capitulate to King Taksin. Taksin took them alive was to promote the morale of the Siamese people.Damrong Rajanubhab, p. 462 The Burmese reinforcements who had encamped themselves in the province of Kanchanaburi were then mopped up. King Hsinbyushin, who had been in a long illness that would eventually take his life, now ordered Maha Thiha Thura, who known in Thai history as Azaewunky to lead a fresh invasion of Siam in October 1775. =Burmese preparations= The situation had changed a great deal since the last invasion of Siam ten years ago. King Hsinbyushin was dying, and the palace is full of rumors and intrigues. None of the Burmese commanders, including Maha Thiha Thura, were enthusiastic about the invasion. Maha Thiha Thura himself had a vested interest in the succession affairs as the heir-apparent Singu Min was his son-in-law. More importantly, the Burmese military command broke down. Dissension was rampant. Field commanders increasingly acted like warlords and behaved with arrogance towards the people, and began to ignore even the king's orders.Htin Aung, pp. 184-185 Maha Thiha Thura faced many difficulties in raising an invasion force, and had to wait until the end of rainy season in 1775 to start the invasion.Phayre, pp. 207-208 Invasion A combined force of 35,000 was eventually raised for the Siamese theater. Maha Thiha Thura's main army invaded by the southern route from Martaban, and Ne Myo Thihapate's army from Chiang Saen in northern Lan Na, (which was still under Burmese control). From the start, the invasion was fraught with multiple issues. First, the invasion force of 35,000 was too small to be effective whereas the 1765 invasion force consisted of at least 50,000 troops. More importantly, the Burmese command was in disarray. With the king on his deathbed, insubordination became increasingly rampant. Indeed, the second-in-command of the southern army, Zeya Kyaw, disagreed with Maha Thiha Thura on the invasion route, withdrew with his troops, leaving Maha Thiha Thura with a portion of the troops. Even with a full strength invasion force, an invasion of Siam was never easy for the Burmese. Without a full strength army, the effort appeared doomed from the start. Nonetheless, Maha Thiha Thura and Ne Myo Thihapate obeyed the orders, and marched on. Thihapate's army managed to recapture Chiang Mai, Maha Thiha Thura's army fought its way down to Siamese defenses and managed to occupy Phichai and Sukhothai provinces in northern Siam (present-day central Thailand).Phayre, pp. 207-208 In his interrogation of two Phichai officials, Maha Thiha Thura referred to Chao Phraya Surasih, the Governor of Phitsanulok, as \\"Phraya Sua\\" or \\"The Tiger\\", thus testifying to his boldness and decisiveness. The Burmese then besieged Phitsanulok which was defended by the brother generals, Chao Phya Chakri and Chao Phraya Surasi, and as the result of the stubborn resistance on the part of Siamese soldiers, they were checked outside the city ramparts for about 4 months.Damrong Rajanubhab, pp. 491-492 Hearing about Chao Phraya Chakri's counterattacks which drove back the Burmese to their well fortified camp, Maha Thiha Thura arranged a meeting with him, in the course of which he extolled his generalship and advised him to take good care of himself. He prophesied that General Chakri would certainly become king. If Maha Thiha Thura's purpose was to sow discord between King Taksin and Chao Phraya Chakri, he failed, as they collaborated closely in subsequent military expeditions.Wood, pp. 265‚Äì266Damrong Rajanubhab, pp. 493‚Äì495 In spite of King Taksin's endeavour to attack the Burmese from the rear, Chao Phraya Chakri and Chao Phraya Surasi could not hold Phitsanulok any longer, due to lack of provisions. Having collected most of the inhabitants, they successfully fought their way through enemy lines and made Phetchabun their headquarters. Maha Thiha Thura led his army into the deserted city at the end of March 1776, but was soon confronted with the same problem of the shortage of food. Retreat By June, at the start of the rainy season, the Burmese armies were bogged down in central Siam by determined Siamese resistance led by king Taksin and Chao Phraya Chakri, the war was in a stalemate, and prospects of another conquest of Siam looked bleak. When King Hsinbyushin finally died on June 10, 1776, Maha Thiha Thura decided to call off the invasion. He wanted to ensure that his son-in-law and heir-apparent Singu Min succeed the throne. The withdrawal's longterm impact was that the Burmese would lose most of the old Lan Na Kingdom, which had been under Burmese suzerainty since 1558. The Burmese still retained Chiang Saen, a region in northern Lan Na but they would lose that in Bodawpaya's disastrous invasion of Siam (1785‚Äì1786). Aftermath After the death of the Burmese king Hsinbyushin the Burmese were plunged into their own dynastic struggles. In 1776, the new monarch Singu Min sent Maha Thiha Thura to invade Lanna again with such a huge army that Lord Vichianprakarn of Chiang Mai had to abandon the city. Chao Phraya Surasi and Lord Kawila of Lampang retook Chiang Mai from the Burmese but decided to leave the city abandoned as there was no population to fill the city. No further Burmese invasions came as Singu staged his dynastic purges on the princes and Maha Thiha Thura himself.

The San Carlos de la Barra fort is one of a number of coastal fortifications which the Spanish built in Venezuela in colonial times. It is located in the Peninsula of San Carlos, in Zulia state, Venezuela. It was built in 1623 with limestone rocks, brought from the Island of Toas, at the entrance to the Maracaibo bar. The purpose of the fort was to protect the pass that connects Lake Maracaibo with the Gulf of Venezuela. Prior to the fort being constructed, Maracaibo had been attacked and sacked several times by pirates and the castle was intended to provide a true defense of the town and surrounding area that would prevent incursions by pirates into the mainland. History In 1666 the French pirate Jean David Nau El Olon√©s with a fleet of 8 ships and 650 men entered from the Gulf of Venezuela into the mouth of Lake Maracaibo where the Castle of San Carlos was located armed with 16 guns and attacked the fort. After an exchange of artillery, the pirates captured the fort in less than three hours. In March 1669, the town refugees took shelter in the fort during the sacking of Maracaibo by the British pirate Henry Morgan. Upon learning of the futility of escaping Lake Maracaibo by crossing the castle, Morgan tried to negotiate with the Spaniards by asking a ransom for hostages from the town. In response, Alonso de Espinosa, commanding officer of the castle, was given a large sum of gold and silver plus some cattle in payment, but Espinosa refused categorically to let them go. The next day, Morgan devised a trick to escape by simulate a ground attack on the site at night. The Spanish hurriedly abandoned the fort, while some soldiers remained in the castle attempting to block access back to the sea, without success. Morgan returned to Jamaica on May 14, 1669 under warnings from the English governor Thomas Modyford before claims of the misdeeds they committed were received in London. In 1823, the fort was attacked and taken by a Venezuelan squadron commanded by Admiral Jos√© Prudencio Padilla, in what was known as \\"The Forcing of the Barra de Maracaibo\\" which also allowed the Venezuelan ships to enter the lake and attack a Spanish fleet in the Battle of Lake Maracaibo, the last battle in the War of Venezuelan Independence. After Venezuela achieved independence the fort continued to be maintained as part of the country's defences. It saw action in the Bombardment of Fort San Carlos when it was attacked by the Imperial German Navy during the Venezuelan crisis of 1902‚Äì03. It also served as a prison, imprisoning such figures like included the writer Eduardo L√≥pez Bustamante, who wrote poetry during his captivity.

(2010) Assessment and therapeutic application of the expressive therapies continuum: Implications for brain structures and functions. Art Therapy: Journal of the American Art Therapy Association, 27(4), 168-177 used in the field of art therapy that is applicable to creative processes both within and outside of an expressive therapeutic setting.Hinz, L. (2009). Expressive Therapies Continuum. New York: Taylor & Francis Group The concept was initially proposed and published in 1978 by art therapists Sandra Kagin and Vija Lusebrink, who based the continuum on existing models of human development and information processing.Kagin, S, and Lusebrink, V. (1978) The expressive therapies continuum. Art Psychotherapy, 5, 171-180 This schematic model serves to describe and assess an individual's level of creative functioning based on aspects such as the artist's purpose for creating a piece, choice of medium, interaction with the chosen medium, and imagery within the piece. Conversely, it also serves to meet the needs of the client by assisting the art therapist in choosing a developmentally or situationally appropriate activity or art medium.Rubin, J. (1984). The Art of Art Therapy. Levittown, PA: Taylor & Francis Group By analyzing an individual's art making process and the resulting artwork using the ETC, art therapists can assess strengths, weaknesses, and disconnect in various levels of a client's cognitive functioning - suggesting or substantiating diagnosis of, or recovery from, a mental health condition. Levels of functioning According to Lusebrink: > The first three levels of the ETC reflect three established systems of human > information processing: the Kinesthetic/Sensory (K/S level); the > Perceptual/Affective (P/A level); and the Cognitive/Symbolic (C/S level) ... > The fourth level of the ETC is the Creative level (CR). It is seen as a > synthesis of the other three levels of the continuum. A diagram of the ETC, as pictured in the top right of the page, can be read from left to right and from the bottom, upwards. The model flows in a direction that travels from simple information processing and image formation to increasingly complex thought processes and interactions with the media. Individuals can fluctuate from level to level depending on personal and situational factors. They may also display an integration of all of the first three levels of functioning. This integration indicates that the individual is operating on the fourth and final level of functioning, known as the Creative level. The Creative level both transcends and intersects the prior three levels, in which the individual is either equally incorporating all aspects of the ETC or is able to find a satisfying and meaningful creative experience on one of the three levels alone. However, an individual cannot wholly operate at both ends of a level, as each level is bipolar. For example, if the individual is more focused on the quick and scribbly movement of a chalk-pastel on paper, then he or she is less focused on the sensory aspects of the media, such as the sound of the chalk against the paper or the powdery feel of chalk in one's hand. =Kinesthetic/Sensory Level (K/S)= As the first level of the ETC, the Kinesthetic/Sensory level is described as a form of preverbal information processing that is \\"rhythmic, tactile, and sensual\\". This simple type of interaction with various art media stimulates primal areas of the brain and meets basic expressive needs‚Äîall while providing sensory and kinesthetic feedback for the artist. If an individual is operating at the kinesthetic end of the spectrum, he or she may find satisfaction in movement‚Äîi.e. pounding at a piece of clay or scribbling frantically with a crayon. In contrast, if the individual is gravitating towards the sensory end of the spectrum, he or she might take more pleasure in the feel of finger-paints or the smell of scented markers. This level is particularly useful for young children but may also be useful for anyone needing to focus on sensorimotor skills. In addition, functioning at this level may allow for better access to preverbal memories or expression of extreme emotions. Individuals may identify operation at the K/S as a personal coping mechanism, in which the experience rather than the product is viewed as therapeutic. =Perceptual/Affective Level (P/A)= The second level of the ETC, the Perceptual/Affective level may or may not include verbal thought processes. However, the focus has shifted from the experience alone (with little focus on the outcome, as in the K/S level) to using the media to create an intentionally expressive or self-satisfying final product. The process may be characterized either by an individual's intent to express his or her own literal reality or be characterized by content that is \\"emotional and raw...without regard to form\\". By working with individuals at the P/A level, art therapists can help clients to perceive images or notions in a new way, strengthening communication and assisting with the formation of meaningful relationships. They can also focus on the identification and healthy expression of one's emotions. =Cognitive/Symbolic Level= Operation at the third level of the ETC, the cognitive/symbolic level, requires \\"complex and sophisticated\\" information processing, in which the individual consciously and strategically plans‚Äîprior to creating the art piece‚Äîfor an expressive and self-satisfying final product. At this level, individuals are able to step outside their own sphere of perception and emotional expression and focus on ways that they interact with the world around them. They may begin to use satire and hidden meanings in their pieces to best express their unique response to their surroundings or situation (symbolic) or use art to plan and to problem-solve (cognitive). =Creative level= The final level, which either intersects the previous three levels or transcends above them, is the Creative level. This level symbolizes a wholeness, in which the individual achieves a sense of joy, fulfillment, or wellbeing by taking part in the creative process and expressing the self. This may be accomplished through the integration of the three previous levels (where there was inclusion of all expressive operations in the art-making process; a feeling of oneness) or success in fulfilling an individual's need at any given level, which may be healing in and of itself.

Peddle (1899‚Äì1979) was an American modernist architect who was the first woman architect licensed by the state of Indiana and a cofounder of the Women's Architectural Club of Chicago. Early life and education Peddle was born on June 7, 1899, in Terre Haute, Indiana, to John B. and Alice O. Peddle. She was educated at the King Classical School, and she learned drawing from her father, who taught machine design at Rose Polytechnic Institute. She went on to earn a degree in architecture from the University of Michigan in 1920, the second woman to do so, following her friend Bertha Yerex Whitman. She then moved to Chicago, where she worked briefly for the architectural firm of Perkins, Fellows, and Hamilton. One of her coworkers there was Whitman, with whom she would go on to cofound (with seven other women) the Women's Architectural Club of Chicago. The club was active into the 1940s, when it merged with the American Institute of Architecture. Peddle was the editor of the club's occasional publication, The Architrave. The group exhibited work around Chicago, including at the first Woman's World's Fair in Chicago in 1925. After leaving Perkins, Fellows, and Hamilton, Peddle went on to study architecture in Europe. Architectural career In 1935, Peddle moved back to Terre Haute, where in 1939 she became the first female architect licensed by the state of Indiana. (There had been a couple of other women who were practicing architects in Indiana before Peddle, such as Grace Crosby, but Indiana only started licensing architects in 1929.) She opened her own architectural practice in Terre Haute, where she designed buildings for more than three decades. In addition to residences, she designed a Social Security building, the Medicenter building, and the Crawford School in and around Terre Haute. As she worked in Chicago after her graduation, Peddle was an architectural draftsman at E. H. Clark Inc. Peddle became known for a strongly modernist style. Her Topping House (1960), for example, had many glass features, including bubble skylights, glass walls, and textured glass room dividers. At the same time, Peddle greatly appreciated older American styles of building and was dismayed at how many such buildings were being demolished. She spent several decades photographing the buildings and streets of Terre Haute, creating a valuable historical archive that is now housed at the Vigo County Historical Society in Indiana. Her interest in local history found another outlet in a collection of 60 detailed drawings of Terre Haute buildings from before the Civil War that she made for the historical society and that were based on careful study of old photographs, drawings, descriptions, technical specifications, and interviews with local residents. She decided to publish this series in a local paper, the Terre Haute Sunday Tribune Star, in 1941‚Äì42 as a way of broadening local knowledge about Terre Haute's architectural heritage. Peddle provided the illustrations for a 1939 book about Indiana settlers, The Story of a Hoosier Immigration, that was based on the recollections of the lives of Peddle's great great grandparents.

The Party Founding Day is one of the most important holidays of the country, along with the Day of the Sun (birthday of Kim Il-sung), Day of the Shining Star (birthday of Kim Jong- il) and Day of the Foundation of the Republic. 2015 marked the 70th anniversary. Background The public hall where the founding conference was held now hosts the Party Founding Museum. North Korea commemorates 10 October 1945 as the date of the foundation of the \\"Central Organizing Committee of the Communist Party of North Korea\\", known as the \\"\\" by Western historians. On 10 October 1945 a meeting called \\"Conference of Korean Communist Party Members and Enthusiasts in the Five Northwestern Provinces\\" began in Pyongyang, in a public hall that now hosts the Party Founding Museum. On 13 October, the meeting saw the establishment of the North Korea Bureau of the Communist Party of Korea. The conference was the first time that Kim Il-sung emerged as a political force. Kim advocated the foundation of the North Korea Bureau so that party activities could be overseen in the north of the country in a situation where the north and south were occupied by the Soviets and the Americans respectively. Kim acceded the chairmanship of the North Korea Bureau some two months after the conference. The Bureau soon became independent of the Seoul-lead Communist Party of Korea, paving the way for a political force in the North. The North Korea Bureau is one in a series of predecessors to the present Workers' Party of Korea. The North Korea Bureau evolved into the Workers' Party of North Korea in August 1946. The present Workers' Party of Korea was not founded until 30 June 1949 when the Workers' Party of North Korea merged with the Workers' Party of South Korea. Celebrations A tour guide visiting the Monument to Party Founding in Pyongyang around the anniversary Celebrations include song and dance performances, evening galas, speeches, lectures on revolutionary history and oratorical meetings. Floral tributes are laid in front of statues of Kim Il-sung. Special food rations are distributed. This usually includes foodstuffs that are normally in short supply, such as oil and snacks. Meat is available through the public distribution system. Electricity is provided on the Party Foundation Day, despite shortages. There are live TV broadcasts of ceremonies. The holiday is celebrated throughout the country, though main celebrations take place in the capital, Pyongyang. The city typically hosts processions and a military parade during the day. Attendance in festivities in the capital is counted in the millions. The celebrations have included occasional ceremonial visits of North Korean leaders to the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun. The failure of Kim Jong-un to appear in 2014 intensified speculations of his lengthy absence. The tradition has not been very strong, as in comparison to Kim Jong-un, his father Kim Jong-il observed the same tradition only twice. North Korea schedules completion of large-scale construction projects to coincide with important anniversaries like the Party Foundation Day. The 1995 50th anniversary of the party, for instance, was met with unveiling of the Monument to Party Founding. The 70th anniversary in 2015 was planned to be celebrated with the completion of a stock breeding base and a power plant: the Sepho Tableland and the Chongchon River Power Plant. The latter was finished by the next month. Banks, offices, retail and government institutions close for the day. Weddings are often organized on the day.

She was also recognized widely and appointed to certain positions for her ability to work effectively with women of many different cultures and backgrounds. Biography A part of the Famine Emergency Committee, the International Alliance for Women, and the League of Women Voters, Anna Lord Strauss significantly influenced American history. She was born in New York City in 1899 and was brought up with two other siblings. After going to the New York School for Secretaries and getting a job alongside her father, she took a trip to France which ultimately made her contemplate what she really wanted to do with her life.Scott, A. F. Strauss, Anna Lord. September 20, 1899-February 23, 1979. In S. Ware & S. Braukman (Eds.), Notable American women: Completing the Twentieth century. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. In 1923, she got a job with the Century Magazine, but after six years left because she felt her promotion was taking a job away from someone more deserving. She took up volunteer work at Ellis Island, and eventually joined the New York City League of Women Voters in 1934. Determined and hard-working, Strauss moved up in the organization to president. Her election, however, led to the resignation of the senior board members and staff because the outgoing presidential candidate was apparently a big-shot and they did not want to give Strauss a chance. To combat the loss of members, she hired plenty of excited new people who shared similar stances. Accomplishments The League of Women Voters was an important way to get women's voices heard to the people who matter, such as Congress and the White House. More importantly, her status led to the making of the peace and the formation of the United Nations.Stone, Kathryn H. ‚ÄúAnna Lord Strauss‚Äù. The National Voter, Vol. 29, No. 1. 1979. 19-20. Web. 23 September 2015. Strauss was a presidential appointee to the U.S. Delegation to the United Nations (1951-1952), she directed the American Association for the UN, and was a member of the U.S. Committee for the UN, the UN Association of the US, and the Committee of Correspondence, N.Y.C. Strauss also stressed that the success of the formation of the United Nations was based ‚Äúon the understanding and support of the peoples of the world and on their determination to make it work‚Ä¶ The inevitable differences between nations must not divert the American peoples from the solution of our international problems, which demands a United Nations organization‚Äù.League of Women Voters. ‚ÄúDumbarton Oaks and World Opinion‚Äù. Action, Vol. 1 No. 2, January 1945. 2-8. Web. 7 November 2015. In the 1940s during Strauss' presidency, the League of Women Voters underwent major changes, including its title. The name was changed to the ‚ÄúLeague of Women Voters of the United States‚Äù to encourage nationwide participation. It was constructed in a way such that members joined by enrolling in leagues in their local communities. This greatly expanded the numbers, making the local Leagues the ‚Äúbasis and organization and representation in the League‚ÄùThe League of Women Voters Through the Decades! League of Women Voters, April 2007. Web. 7 November 2015.

The CCCMF had the idea for a Freedom Agenda Program to fight the fear caused by current rigidities through the understanding of our constitutional freedoms. Since Strauss was the president of the CCCMF, she therefore had the power of choosing members for the National Freedom Agenda committee, which was an organization within the CCCMF, yet another place for her to influence society.

She is regarded as an early writer about women's rights in Germany. Life She was born in Gotha in 1755. Her parents were and his wife Amalie. When her father died, her mother remarried, and she was looked after by an uncle and given a good private education. She published some poetry and then a book of protest because Switzerland was invaded in 1798 by the French. She married when she was sixteen and had three children with him. The marriage ended in divorce in 1787. Her ex-husband married Anna Dorothea Helene Siever, who had been her maid, after the divorce. By this time Berlepsch's writing was being regarded as more than amateur and aspiring to art. She is said to have \\"set her cap\\", unsuccessfully, at Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. She left Switzerland in protest at the French invasion of the country and swore never to set foot in it again while it was occupied. She went to visit Scotland in 1799 and 1800. She had already met the polyglot Reverend James Macdonald in Germany who was acquainted with C. M. Wieland and J. G. Herder. Macdonald was an enthusiast for improving relations between Scotland and Germany. The vicar in Fife became Berlepsch's chosen host. He looked after her and took her on tours of Scotland; some of her time was spent in Edinburgh and some in the Highlands. Berlepsch wrote a four volume account titled Caledonia, in German, which described Scotland, including the remote highlands,Ruth P. Dawson, ‚ÄúNavigating Gender: Georg Forster in the Pacific and Emilie von Berlepsch in Scotland.‚Äú In: Weimar Classicism, ed. David Gallagher. Lampeter, Wales: Edwin Mellen Press, 2011. 39-64. and discussed women writers publishing in English. Macdonald's affection for Berlepsch did not extend to marriage, and Berlepsch was disappointed.Hans Utz, 'Berlepsch, Emilie von (bap. 1755, d. 1830)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 9 Sept 2015 She returned to Germany and married again. Her second marriage was to August Heinrich Harmes who was not of noble birth. They lived at Lake Zurich until 1817. Writing The title-page of Caledonia, Hamburg, 1802 Berlepsch's book Caledonia included early translations and reviews of Robert Burns. Her translations are credited with encouraging an acceptance and appreciation of Burns's work. There were numerous reviews in German newspapers and journals after Berlepsch's translations were published. In her writing Berlepsch deals particularly with the subject of women's rights, a topic she first raised in 1791 in a journal article innocuously titled \\"Some Characteristics and Principles Necessary for Happiness in Marriage,\\" in which she ponders the pervasiveness of misogyny and the costs of women's conventional submissiveness.Ruth P. Dawson: ‚Äú'And This Shield is called‚ÄîSelf- Reliance,' Emerging Feminist Consciousness in the Late Eighteenth Century.‚Äú In: German Women in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries, A Social and Literary History, ed. Ruth-Ellen B. Joeres and Mary Jo Maynes. Bloomington: Indiana Univ. Press, 1986. 157-74. She described herself as \\"fighting against the prejudice that wants to grant women neither a will of their own nor the courage to express it\\". She talks about routine misogyny that cannot be handled by submissiveness. She argues that women are given neither rights nor the opportunity to complain; women are not, by their nature, prisoners of their emotions and men are not natural tyrants. She wanted an end to misogyny but she believed that men retained supremacy. She discussed various writers for German readers including particularly Mary Wollstonecraft.. She notes her own role in raising women's issues for the first time in German. Berlepsch died in Lauenburg in 1830.

The first generation Apple Pencil was announced alongside the first iPad Pro on September 9, 2015. It communicates wirelessly via Bluetooth, and has a removable cap that conceals a Lightning connector used for charging. The Pencil is compatible with the first and second generation iPad Pro models, and all other iPads released in 2018 and later with a Lightning port. The second generation Apple Pencil was announced on October 30, 2018 alongside the third generation iPad Pro. It uses a magnetic connector on the side of the tablet for charging rather than a Lightning connector, and includes touch-sensitive areas that can be tapped to perform actions within supported apps. It is compatible with all iPads with a USB-C port, including the 2020 iPad Air. Specifications alt= = First generation = The Apple Pencil has pressure sensitivity and angle detection, and was designed for low latency to enable smooth marking on the screen. The Pencil and the user's fingers can be used simultaneously, while rejecting input from the user's palm. One end of the device has a magnetically-fastened removable cap which covers a Lightning connector which is used for charging from an iPad's Lightning port. The initial charge lasts about 12 hours, but 15 seconds of charging provides sufficient power for 30 minutes of use. The Pencil ships with a female-to- female Lightning adapter which allows it to be used with charging cables. Apple has promoted the Pencil as being oriented towards creative work and productivity; during its unveiling, the Pencil's capabilities were demonstrated using the mobile version of Adobe Photoshop, and its document annotation capabilities on several Microsoft Office apps. The Apple Pencil uses an STMicroelectronics STM32L151UCY6 Ultra-low-power 32-bit RISC ARM-based Cortex-M3 MCU running at 32 MHz with 64 KB of flash memory, a Bosch Sensortech BMA280 3‚Äêaxis accelerometer and a Cambridge Silicon Radio (Qualcomm) CSR1012A05 Bluetooth Smart IC for its Bluetooth connection to the iPad. It is powered by a recyclable rechargeable 3.82 V, 0.329 Wh lithium-ion battery. = Second generation = On October 30, 2018, Apple announced an updated Pencil alongside the third generation iPad Pro. It is similar in design and specifications to the first model, but without the detachable connector, and part of the stylus is flattened to inhibit rolling. It contains tap-sensitive zones on its sides that can be mapped to functions within apps. Custom laser engraving is available when purchased via the Apple Store online. Rather than a physical Lightning connector, the second generation Pencil is paired and charged using a proprietary magnetic wireless charging connector on the tablet instead. As such, it is only supported by the third and fourth generation (2020) iPad Pro and the fourth generation (2020) iPad Air. These models also have USB-C ports in lieu of Lightning, making them incompatible with the first generation Pencil. iPads released in 2018 or later with a Lightning port, including the third generation iPad Air, fifth generation iPad Mini, and the 2019 10.2-inch iPad, only support the first generation Pencil.

The song was released on 25 September 2015, as the second single from the album. Produced by Steve Mac, he co-wrote the song with Iain James, Camille Purcell and James Newman. Backed by an instrumental of pianos, bells, sax and percussion, the song is a down-tempo retro homage to doo-wop, with lyrics about puppy love. Its composition was compared by several critics to Motown artists of the 1950s and 1960s, namely The Ronettes, The Supremes and Shadow Morton. Critical response to \\"Love Me Like You\\" was positive: critics praised its vintage style and highlighted it as an album standout. It reached number 11 on the UK Singles Chart and has been certified platinum by the BPI. The accompanying music video for the song is set at a high school dance. Unbeknownst to each member of the group, they had been invited to attend by the same date after previously meeting him in different situations. He arrives with another girl near the end of the night, and they realise that they had all been invited by the same man, and end up alone. Little Mix have performed the track on both the Australian and British versions of The X Factor and on Good Morning America in the United States. Background and release \\"Love Me Like You\\" was written by Steve Mac, Camille Purcell, Iain James and James Newman for Little Mix's third studio album, Get Weird (2015). It was published by Rokstone Music Ltd. under exclusive licence to BMG Rights Management (UK) Ltd; Kobalt Music Group; Sony/ATV Music Publishing; Black Butter Music Publishing and BMG Rights Management. The song was produced by Mac and mixed by Serban Ghenea at Mixstar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia. It was engineered for mixing by John Hanes and engineered by Chris Laws and Dann Pursey, and mastered by Tom Coyne and Randy Merrill at Sterling Sound Studios in New York. The track was recorded at Rokstone Studios in London. Purcell also provided background vocals. The keyboards were performed by Mac, and the guitars were played by Paul Gendler. Laws and Pursey performed the drums and the percussion, respectively. The group announced on 9 September 2015 that \\"Love Me Like You\\" would be the second single to be released from the album, and that it would be made available to pre-order on 11 September, and be released on 25 September. It was released by Syco and Columbia in Ireland and the United Kingdom on 25 September 2015.\\"Love Me Like You\\" was released as a single in Ireland and the UK on 25 September 2015: The single's artwork was released on the same day. In their review, MTV News joked that the group were suggesting that it would be number-one due to each of the band members eyeline, writing \\"We can't help but get the hint they're on the hunt for ANOTHER chart topping trophy. Leigh-Anne clearly thinks she can see it in the distance, Jesy is just imagining it with her brain, Jade definitely thinks she can hear the noise of records being sold and Perrie is convinced it's on the floor.\\" M magazine writer Heather Thompson described the artwork as \\"vibrant\\". A collection of alternate versions called \\"Love Me Like You (The Collection)\\" was also released in Australia and New Zealand in addition to Ireland and the United Kingdom on 16 October 2015. It consists of a Christmas mix, several remixes and an instrumental version of \\"Love Me Like You\\", an exclusive interview and another album track called \\"Lightning\\".\\"Love Me like You (The Collection)\\" was released in Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and UK on 16 October 2015:  * Composition \\"Love Me Like You\\" has been described as a down-tempo \\"ode to '60s doo-wop\\" retro style pop song, which lasts for a duration of three minutes, seventeen seconds. The song is composed in the key of G major using common time and a tempo of 106 beats per minute. Instrumentation is provided by \\"vintage\\" pianos, bells and a \\"pumping\\" tenor sax. The use of percussion gives the a track a more modern style. During the track, the band members vocal range spans one octave, from the low note of D4 to the high note of E5. The song opens with the group harmonising \\"Sha la la la\\" over pianos. The lyrics are about puppy love, as they yearningly sing \\"Last night I lay in bed so blue / Cause' I realized the truth/ They can't love me like you / I tried to find somebody new / Baby they ain't got a clue/ Can't love me like you.\\" Fuse writer Jeff Benjamin described the song as being reminiscent of 1960s girl group The Ronettes but with a more modern feel for 2015 radio, highlighting the line \\"They try to romance me but you got that nasty and that's what I want\\" as an example. Digital Spy writer Lewis Corner thought that the line \\"He might got the biggest ca-aa-ar\\" does not fool listeners into thinking that \\"they're not actually talking about his Fiat 500.\\" Several music critics compared the song to recordings from the Motown era in the 1950s and 1960s, with Andy Gill of The Independent likening it to material composed by Shadow Morton. Emilee Lindner of MTV News likened the production to material composed by Phil Spector. The Christmas mix version features added church bells and jingles. Critical reception Andy Gill of The Independent described the track as having a \\"nice\\" retro sound, and singled it out as being one of his top three songs from the album to download, along with \\"Black Magic\\" and \\"Grown\\". Writing for NME, Nick Levine thought that \\"Love Me Like You\\" was reminiscent of songs recorded by Stooshe, but added that Little Mix performed the Motown style \\"without the forced sense of fun.\\" Similarly, Billboard writer Malorie MaCall and Digital Spy critic Jack Klompus likened the retro style to songs performed by Meghan Trainor and The Supremes, respectively. Music Times writer Carolyn Menyes praised its composition for being \\"charming\\" and described the track as \\"totally charming.\\" A reviewer for Press Play OK commented that the song was \\"less club night and more prom night.\\" Broadcaster Stephen Fry criticised the track when interviewed by Newsbeat about his review of a selection of songs released in 2015. He described it as \\"horrible\\" and a modern-day \\"hideous, toxic compound\\" take on a Phil Spector song. Chart performance In the United Kingdom, \\"Love Me Like You\\" debuted at number 21 on the UK Singles Chart on 8 October 2015. It later peaked at number 11 on 7 January 2016. It also peaked at number nine on the UK Singles Downloads Chart. The track has been certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for 600,000 combined sales and streaming units. In Scotland, the song reached number five. It achieved success in Ireland, reaching number 8 on 31 December 2015. It peaked at number 66 on the Belgium Ultratip Flanders chart on 31 October 2015. It also peaked at number 64 in Slovakia, number 81 in the Czech Republic, and number 140 in France. Outside of Europe, \\"Love Me Like You\\" reached number 80 on the Japan Hot 100, number 27 in Australia, and number one on the New Zealand Heatseekers chart. Music video The accompanying music video for \\"Love Me Like You\\" was released on 10 October 2015. The video takes place at a school dance, where a professor in the hall (the same man who appeared in their previous single's video \\"Black Magic\\") tells everyone that it is the last dance. Jade, Leigh- Anne, Jesy and Perrie are waiting for their dates to arrive. Scenes of the girls waiting for their date are intercut throughout the video of them sitting at a table while all of the other couples are dancing. Unbeknownst to them, the man, played by Power Rangers Samurai star Hector David Junior, has invited each of them to go to the dance after meeting them in different situations prior to that night. He asked Jade by picking her up in his car to go on a date. As she gets in, he invites her to be his date at the dance and presents her with a corsage to wear on her wrist on the night. He meets Leigh-Anne at a high school basketball game, where she and her girlfriends were watching him and some other boys play on the court. He sees that she is infatuated by how good he is at the sport, walks up to her, and asks her to be his date by giving her a corsage. He asked Jesy to be his date while they were at the cinema as they shared a bucket of popcorn. As he gives her the corsage, she throws the bucket over her shoulder and eagerly jumps on his lap, causing them to fall off the chair. Finally, he invited Perrie to be his date after she fell off her bike while staring at him work out on a field and pouring water over his torso to cool down. He helps her up, and gives her a corsage. Toward the end of the video, they sit on a bench next to the entrance, and see their date walk in with another girl wearing the same corsage as the ones that he had given each of them. They realise that they have all been two-timed by the same guy, and are all dateless. It ends with the girls being each other's date and solemnly dancing whilst everyone else has a good time. Metro writer Rebecca Lewis noted that the man in the video strongly resembled Perrie's former fianc√© Zayn Malik of One Direction. She also wrote that fans had noticed that she was still wearing her engagement ring in the video, meaning that the video was filmed before they split up in August 2015. Live performances Little Mix performed \\"Love Me Like You\\" live on the seventh season of The X Factor in Australia on 13 October 2015. Capital praised their performance, writing that it set an \\"amazing example\\" for the contestants on the show and that their vocals were \\"pitch perfect\\". On 1 November, the group performed a \\"Love Me Like You\\"/\\"Black Magic\\" medley on the twelfth series of The X Factor in the United Kingdom.

It was announced along with the iPad Pro on September 9, 2015, and released the same day. The iPad Mini 4, which replaced the iPad Mini 3, was discontinued on March 18, 2019, when it was replaced by the fifth-generation iPad Mini. History The iPad Mini 4 was announced during the \\"Hey Siri\\" Apple Special Event on September 9, 2015, alongside other new or refreshed products, including the iPad Pro, the iPhone 6s and the Apple TV. However, there was minimal focus directly on the new device, with only a brief mention at the end of the iPad Pro portion of the keynote. Features =Software= The iPad Mini 4 ships with the iOS 9 operating system pre-installed, and was the first device to do so. With an additional 1 GB of RAM compared to the previous generations' Mini, the iPad Mini 4 is capable of utilizing the Slide Over, Split View and Picture in Picture multitasking functions in iOS 9. The device is compatible with iOS 9.1, which was released on October 21, 2015, which adds the News app for the UK and Australia as well as additional emoji and other bug fixes. It was revealed at WWDC 2019 that the iPad Mini 4 would support iPadOS, despite rumours saying that it wouldn't. It does lack the support for some features though such as Memoji Stickers, Apple's ARKit based applications and support for Sidecar in macOS Catalina, due to it having the Apple A8 Processor. Apart from this, most of the features that were introduced in iPadOS will work with this iPad, including support for external USB drives (using the camera connection kits), the redesigned split screen and multitasking interface (with support for two apps to be open at once) and support for Haptic Touch (no haptic feedback will be felt as the iPad family don't have Taptic Engines). =Design= The iPad Mini 4 was the first major redesign of the iPad Mini line, with a slightly taller and wider body (though with no increase in screen size) compared to the iPad Mini 2 and Mini 3. There is also a much thinner design, with the device mirroring the depth of the iPad Air 2 at 6.1 millimeters. This device is also lighter than the previous generation by 33.2 grams. Due to the redesign, this device is incompatible with cases that would otherwise work with the iPad Mini 2 or iPad Mini 3. To compensate for this, Apple released a Smart Cover and Silicone Case for the Mini 4, which can be used separately or together as a fully protective case. Unlike the iPad Air 2, there is no leather Smart Case made by Apple for the device. The mute switch was removed, as was done for the iPad Air 2. As with the iPad Mini 3, the iPad Mini 4 is available in three colors: Space Gray, Silver, and Gold. =Hardware= While the iPad Air 2 and iPad Mini 3 were both released in October 2014, the Mini 3 carried over the Mini 2's internals including the A7 processor in place of the hardware found in the iPad Air 2. The iPad Mini 4 features upgraded hardware closer in specs to the iPad Air 2. However, the Mini 4 sports a dual-core A8 processor in place of the tri-core A8X. Apple claims that this processor is \\"1.3x faster\\" at CPU tasks and \\"1.6x faster\\" at graphics tasks over the A7 processor found in previous Mini models. Along with the iPad Air 2, there are 2 GB of RAM, allowing the device to support the advanced multitasking features made available with the iOS 9 operating system. Like the iPad Mini 3 that came before it, the iPad Mini 4 is capable of making mobile payments via Apple Pay in combination with the Touch ID sensor, although this can only be done in apps as the device lacks the NFC antenna required for payments at a merchant terminal. With iOS 10, Apple Pay is supported within the Safari app. The device shares the same camera module as the iPad Air 2 with an 8 megapixel camera with a ∆í/2.4 aperture. The screen is the same Retina Display that has featured since the iPad Mini 2, although it is fully laminated (also like the iPad Air 2) and contains an anti- reflective coating, resulting in drastically improved picture quality compared to its predecessors. The iPad Mini 4 display features much improved color accuracy due to the increase to 101% sRGB Color Gamut compared to poor ~62% on the previous models.http://www.displaymate.com/news.html#iPad_mini_4 Retrieved 31.Mar.2016 It has a slightly smaller battery compared to the previous generations though Apple claims the runtime to be the same 10 hours as its predecessor. There is also an updated wireless module adding support for 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2. As with its predecessor, the iPad Mini 4 was available with storage options of 16, 32, 64 or 128 GB, although by March 2017 all but the 128 GB model was discontinued. Although the Apple Pencil was released alongside the iPad Mini 4 in September 2015, it was exclusively compatible with the iPad Pro released at the same time. Pencil support on the iPad Mini did not arrive until the 5th generation in 2019. Reception Reviews have generally been positive, with The Verge giving the iPad Mini 4 a 9/10, praising the display, fast performance, great camera, and multitasking but disappointed with the speakers and chamfered edges. Apple iPad Mini 4 review The Verge September 28, 2015. Retrieved 2 November 2015. CNET also praised the new \\"more vivid\\" display and the slimmer design as well as the new features in iOS 9 that the device can utilize. However, they also criticized it for being more expensive than other 8-inch tablets and the multitasking features not working as well on the smaller screen. There was also criticism of the iPad Mini 4's A8 processor which was a year old, regarded as a \\"step down\\" from the iPad Air 2's A8X and iPhone 6S's A9 processors. This contrasts with the iPad Mini 2 which featured the A7 processor used in the iPad Air and iPhone 5S when they were released in Fall 2013.

It first appeared in the iPad Pro, which was announced on September 9, 2015 and was released on November 11, 2015. The A9X has the M9 motion coprocessor embedded in it, something not seen in previous chip generations. It is a variant of the A9 and Apple claims that it has 80% more CPU performance and twice the GPU performance of its predecessor, the A8X.  Design  The A9X features an Apple-designed 64-bit ARMv8-A dual-core CPU called \\"Twister\\". It offers double the memory bandwidth and double the storage performance of the Apple A8X. Unlike the A9, the A9X does not contain an L3 cache due to its significant DRAM bandwidth. The A9X is paired with 4 GB of LPDDR4 memory in the 12.9\\" iPad Pro and 2 GB of LPDDR4 memory in the 9.7\\" iPad Pro with a total bandwidth of 51.2 GB/s. This high bandwidth is necessary to feed the SoC's custom 12-core PowerVR Series7XT GPU. The RAM is not included in the A9X package unlike its sibling, the A9. The A9X uses the same NAND interface as the A9, which uses an Apple-designed NVMe-based controller that communicates over a PCIe connection. The iPad Pro's NAND design is more akin to a PC-class SSD than embedded flash memory common on mobile devices.

The purpose of the program, which began in 1997, is to support NASDDDS member agencies (state developmental disabilities agencies) to gather a standard set of performance and outcome measures that can be used to track their own performance over time, to compare results across states, and to establish national benchmarks. The primary aim of NCI is to collect and maintain valid and reliable data about the performance of public developmental disabilities service systems. NCI states and project partners use NCI data not only to improve practice at the state level but also to add knowledge to the field, to influence state and national policy, and to inform strategic planning initiatives for NASDDDS. Through participation in the program, NCI states make a commitment to share information with stakeholders so that data can be used for policy change and quality improvement. To that end, the National Core Indicators website provides public access to NCI data and current information about how the results are being used at the state and national levels to support policy, research, and advocacy efforts.  The National Core Indicators framework  The NCI framework comprises an In Person Survey, three family surveys (The Adult Family Survey, The Family/Guardian Survey and The Children/Family Survey) and The Staff Stability Survey. = The In Person Survey = The In-Person Survey, formerly called the Adult Consumer Survey is completed with a minimum of 400 individuals (per participating state) who are 18 years of age or older and receiving at least one paid service in addition to case management. There are over 100 key outcome indicators in the survey that are designed to gather valid and reliable data across five broad domains: individual outcomes; family outcomes; health, welfare and rights; staff stability; and system performance. The survey has three components; background data, and two interview sections. The background data is most frequently completed by service coordinators prior to the face- to-face survey and includes information about general demographics; where people live, work, health information, etc. The interview part of the survey must be conducted face to face with the individual receiving services. The first section can only be answered by the individual. The second section of the survey may be completed by a proxy if the interviewer determines the individual cannot answer for him or herself or if the individual does not want to respond the NCI team provides training for interviewers who administer the survey. Completed surveys are entered using a secure online data entry system designed by HSRI. = The National Core Indicator Family Surveys =  The Adult Family Survey  The Adult Family Survey is completed by a minimum of 400 respondents (per participating state) who have an adult family member with I/DD living in the family home. This survey is mailed out to families to be completed. Returned survey information is entered into a secure on-line data entry system designed and managed by HSRI. States report response rates of between 35%- 40%.  The Family/Guardian Survey  The Family/Guardian Survey is completed with a minimum of 400 respondents (per participating state) who have an adult family member with I/DD living outside the family home. This survey is mailed out to families to be completed. Returned survey information is entered into a secure on-line data entry system designed and managed by HSRI. States report response rates of between 35%- 40%.  The Children/Family Survey  The Children/Family Survey is completed with a minimum of 400 respondents (per participating state) who have a child family member with I/DD living in the family home. This survey is mailed out to families to be completed. Returned survey information is entered into a secure on-line data entry system designed and managed by HSRI. States report response rates of between 35%- 40%.  The Staff Stability Survey  The Staff Stability Survey is completed by all provider agencies (within participating states) supporting adults with I/DD in residential, employment, day services and other in-home or community inclusion programs. The survey is intended to capture information about the direct support professional (DSP) workforce such as turnover, vacancy rates, wages, types of services provided, and benefits offered. Each state provides HSRI with agency emails and the provider agencies respond directly into HSRI's on-line data entry system.  Reports and publications  Data from NCI surveys are aggregated and analyzed in reports produced yearly. These data are used to support state efforts to strengthen long term care policy, inform the conduct of quality assurance activities, and compare performance with national norms. Additionally, NCI data have been used as the basis of data briefs on specific areas of interest such as employment, dual diagnosis, self-directed services, and autism spectrum disorders, and the results of analyses of the multi-state dataset have been published in academic research journals and presented at conferences. NCI has also been cited as a \\"Resource on Autism\\" by NBC News. NCI indicators contribute to the calculation of state rankings in United Cerebral Palsy's report The Case for Inclusion. Data from the National Core Indicators surveys also provide a rich source of data on demographics, personal characteristics, work status, and services received. These data, together with NCI data on outcomes, have been used in many peer-reviewed research articles and presentations. NCI data is available to researchers through a data request process.

Lanah Sawyer was a 17-year-old seamstress who, in 1793, claimed to have been raped by prominent New York socialite, Henry Bedlow. Sawyer took Bedlow to trial but he was acquitted by an all-male jury after only fifteen minutes of deliberation. Protests following the trial incited debate about upper-class privilege and gender bias in the American court system. The trial is cited by many authors as evidence of the sexual double standard that existed in colonial America. Rape and trial Lanah Sawyer claimed that while on a walk with Harry Bedlow, the wealthy New Yorker, who she had thought to be a gentleman, forced her into a brothel and made sexual advances despite her protests. Sawyer took Bedlow to trial, but after only fifteen minutes of deliberation, Bedlow was acquitted of the crime by an all-male jury. Bedlow's defense argued that Sawyer's agreement to go for a walk with Bedlow was implied consent.Sanday, P. (1996). A woman scorned: Acquaintance rape on trial (1st ed.). New York, NY:Doubleday. This belief stemmed from a change in the perception of female sexuality, which had developed over the course of the 18th century. Gone was the Puritan perception of women as reserved, non-sexual beings. In its place surfaced a stereotype of a female temptress, developed from the abundance of literature, both poems and novels, published during the 18th century, which featured female characters actively pursuing men with a permissive attitude towards sex. This new perception of women spawned a new attitude towards rape as well. In the 17th century women who made claims of rape were more often than not automatically believed since it was thought that a woman would not be so bold as to falsely accuse a man or dare to actively pursue sexual activity on her own, therefore she must have been raped.Millender, Michael Jonathan. \\"The Transformation of the American Criminal Trial, 1790-1875.\\" Order No. 9701246 Princeton University, 1996. Ann Arbor: ProQuest. Web. 21 Sep. 2015. By the late 18th century however, this new perception of women as sexually uncontrollable made the claim of rape less believable, making trials like Lanah Sawyer's, in which rapists got off uncharged, much more common.Freedman, Estelle B. \\"The Narrowing Meaning of Rape.\\" Redefining Rape: Sexual Violence in the Era of Suffrage and Segregation. Cambridge: Harvard UP, 2013. 17-19. Print. This dismissal of female claims was made worse by the fact that women were also not considered full citizens at the time of Lanah Sawyer's rape. In her trial, Sawyer's female neighbor testified in defense of Lanah's character, corroborating the opinion that Sawyer would not willingly go to bed with a man prior to marriage, however the neighbor's testament was ignored due to the fact that she was a woman too, and could therefore not be trusted to have a sound legal opinion. It was argued that putting the life of a citizen in the hands of a woman was not proper, a statement that resonated with the male jury, allowing ultimately for Bedlow's acquittal.Sommerville, Diane Miller. \\"\\"PMS MADE ME DO IT\\" AND OTHER GENDERED LEGAL DEFENSES.\\" Reviews in American History 38.3 (2010): 499-505. ProQuest. Web. 21 Sep. 2015. Significance and aftermath Bedlow's acquittal sparked a series of protests including riots at the brothel in which the rape supposedly occurred, however these riots were not on behalf of the victim, but were instead a critique of the upper class. The crowd that made up these riots was primarily working class and Negroes who felt as though Bedlow was acquitted not because of his innocence but because of his high-class status, which was in opposition to Lanah's position as a seamstress, and her father's position in the fishing industry. There was however one anonymous letter written to the newspaper under the pseudonym \\"Justitia\\", which featured a searing criticism of the outcome of the trial, as well as condemnation of the entire institution of brothels and their male patrons. The points brought up in the letter were thoroughly ignored by the public however, which attacked the author of the letter with questions of her own moral character and honor.Stansell, Christine. \\"Eve's Daughters in the Republican City.\\" City of Women: Sex and Class in New York, 1789-1860. New York: Knopf, 1986. Print. The rape trial of Lanah Sawyer and the backlash that followed bring to light the injustice faced by women, particularly lower class women, in the colonial period.

He moved to the United States whose most lasting contribution to American society was popularizing the mandolin in American music by starting a national \\"grass-roots mandolin orchestra craze\\" (that lasted from 1880 until the 1920s). He also contributed to Mexican society in 1884 by creating one of Mexico's oldest orchestras, the Mexican Typical Orchestra. The orchestra under his leadership represented Mexico at the New Orleans Cotton Exhibition. As with his Spanish Students, Curti dressed his Mexican band in costumes, choosing the charro cowboy outfit. The patriotic value of having Mexico represented on the international stage gave a boost to mariachi bands (which had normally been repressed by social elites); the mariachis began using charro outfits as Curti's orchestra had done, expressing pride in being Mexican. Curti's Orquestra T√≠pica Mexicana has been called the \\"predecessor of the Mariachi bands.\\" He was an orchestra leader, composer, educator at the Conservatorio Nacional de M√∫sica (Mexican National Conservatory of Music), xylophonist, violinist, mandolinist and author of a mandolin method. He directed the orchestra at the New York's Waldorf-Astoria hotel in his later career. Also known as a composer of zarzuelas and dance music, among his most noted tunes are \\"La Tipica\\" and \\"Flower of Mexico\\". His brother was harpist Giovanni (Juan or John) Curti, who also was a member of his orchestra. Spanish Students (1880 ‚Äî 1884) Advertisement for a December 1880 show that included \\"Curti's Original Spanish Students\\" Curti was born in Gallicchio, province of Potenza, Basilicata. About five years after he arrived in the United States (c.1875), Curti saw the opportunity to imitate one of the great acts of his day, the Estudiantina Figaro, also known as the Estudiantina Figueroa or \\"Spanish Students\\" troupe, a costumed, dancing, bandurria-playing group from Spain that was touring in the United States (as well as the United Kingdom and parts of South America in the early 1880s).Carlos Curti in the 1910 United States Federal Census Year: 1910; Census Place: Manhattan Ward 12, New York, New York; Roll: T624_1027; Page: 3B; Enumeration District: 1420; FHL microfilm: 1375040 Curti had experience in show business, working with a small traveling opera, along with his brother John. He took advantage, figuring that people wouldn't see the difference when he (an Italian) pretended to be Spanish. He even started using Carlos, instead of Carlo. He established a group similar to the Spanish Students, but made up of Italians playing mandolins (because of the similarity to violins, which they knew). The group blatantly used the Spanish Students' name while touring the United States. He later admitted what he had done, and started another group or changed his groups' name to the \\"Roman Students\\". The imitators' use of mandolins helped to generate enormous public interest in an instrument previously relatively unknown in the United States. They left an impression on the people who saw them, and the mandolin, rather than the bandurria became established in the United States and Europe. Mexican Typical Orchestra (1884 ‚Äî 1887) =Beginning in 1884= Mexican Typical Orchestra (La Orquesta T√≠pica de la Ciudad de M√©xico) c. 1885. Photo would have been taken while Curti was bandleader, and he has been identified on some websites as sitting on the far right with a bandol√≥n (18 string guitar-sized instrument) leaning against him. Curti took his knowledge of the elaborate costumed performances he had participated in and organized since coming to the United States, and created a new show in Mexico, what became the Orquesta T√≠pica Mexicana (Mexican Typical Orchestra). The Mexican Typical Orchestra was originally conceived by the salterio player Encarnaci√≥n Garc√≠a and bandol√≥nist Andr√©s D√≠az de la Vega but its creation was consolidated in the hands of its director and founder, xylophone player and composer Carlos Curti, in August 1884. It initially consisted of 19 musicians, most of them from the Conservatorio Nacional de M√∫sica (Mexican National Conservatory of Music) and distributed as follows: *Flute. Anastasio Meneses. *Harp. Juan Curti. *Salterios. Maria Encarnaci√≥n Garc√≠a and Mariano Aburto. Garcia played a 99 string Salterio that resembled a dulcimer. *First Bandol√≥ns. Andr√©s D√≠az de la Vega. Pedro Zari√±ana, Mariano Pagani y Apolonio Dom√≠nguez. Bandol√≥ns were shaped like a cittern or bouzouki with 18 strings (6 courses of 3 strings). *Second Bandol√≥ns. Vidal Ordaz, Vicente Sol√≠s y Jos√© Borbolla. *Guitars. Pantale√≥n D√°vila and Pedro D√°vila. *Violins. Antonio Figueroa and Enrique Palacios. *Viola: Buenaventura Herrera. *Cellos. Rafale Galindo and Eduardo Gabrielli. *Xylophone. Carlos Curti. Advertisement for the Mexican Typical orchestra from the Los Angeles Herald, January 21, 1886. =First concert= The orchestra debuted Saturday night September 20, 1884 at a private concert, held at the Conservatory Orchestra's Theatre and alternated in the concert with the Conservatory Orchestra. The Mexican Typical Orchestra played the following five works during the third part of programming: *1. Obertura of the Opera \\"Raymond\\" by Ambroise Thomas *2. Mazurca \\"Los Ecos\\" para solo de Salterio by Encarnaci√≥n Garc√≠a *3. Fantas√≠a sobre la Opera \\"Norma\\" by Vincenzo Bellini *4. Marcha de la Opera \\"Tanh√§user\\" by Richard Wagner *5. Aires Nacionales Mexicanos by Carlos Curti. =Presidential endorsement= This concert was attended by the president of Mexico, General Porfirio Diaz, who at the time named the group \\"Orquesta T√≠pica Mexicana\\". The president was interested in supporting the group, because he had issues during his election campaign in which his opponents used folk music as propaganda against him. The president wanted to bring order and stability and modernity to Mexico, and music was one of the tools he used. The \\"Aires Nacionales Mexicanos\\" (Mexican National Tunes) put together by Curti along with ethnic instruments like the salterio impressed the General. The orchestra toured Mexico, the United States and Europe. They gave performances in several places in the Mexican capital. The orchestra performed at the Arbeu Theater in a performance dedicated to the Honorable Foreign Colonies and to the Mexican students; this was also an audition, performed on December 3, 1884, and of Carlos Curti's arrangement of \\"Mexican National Tunes\\" was endorsed. As a result, the orchestra was invited to perform at the New Orleans Universal Expo. Over the next three years the band made several tours; the first to the United States, starting for the Universal Exhibition in New Orleans and continuing to New York and several cities in the US. The second tour started in January 1886, visiting Zacatecas on January 8, and then again the US, Canada and Cuba returning to the City Mexico in July 1887. The band disintegrated abruptly in the city of Puebla, and little is known of its fate after so sudden dissolution. It was understood that the musicians who should return to their academic activities at the National Conservatory of Music that had been abandoned during the touring. Among these was Mr. Curti, who later dedicated himself to conduct the orchestra Circo Orr√≠n. =The orchestra after Carlo Curti= The Mexican typical orchestra would continue in 1901 with conductor Juan Vel√°zquez, who was with the orchestra and Carlos Curti during his second tour. The third lead was Miguel Lerdo de Tejada who organized it as the Orquesta T√≠pica Lerdo in 1901. The orchestra is still in existence, after 120 years, and was declared a \\"Intangible Cultural Heritage of the Capital\\" (of Mexico) on May 31, 2011. Last years After fourteen years in Mexico, Curti returned to New York in 1897. At the beginning of the 1900's, he was conductor of the Waldorf‚ÄìAstoria Orchestra for several years. He also formed another group called \\"Orquesta Mexicana Curti\\" with whom made recordings for Columbia Records in 1905, 1906 and 1912. His later life was marked by tragic events: he suffered financial difficulties and his wife Carmen shot herself on January 28, 1914, after he had lost his job at the Waldorf-Astoria. Then Curti came back to Mexico City, where he committed suicide in 1926. Works My Irish Home sheet music with music by Carlo Curti and words by Joe A. Burgess, published Chicago, 1882.

The cable is jointly owned by Energinet.dk and TenneT. Its purpose is to improve the European transmission grid and thus increase the amount of variable wind power in the system while improving supply reliability. Its 700 MW capacity corresponds to an annual transmission capacity of 6.1 TWh. The interconnector has a length of , consists of two parallel cables each with a diameter of and includes fiber-optic communication. The connection has been designed in such a way as to enable the connection of an offshore wind farm at a later stage. This contributes to the realisation of a sustainable international energy landscape, a key aim of the European Union. On the Danish side the interconnector reaches land on the western coast of the island of Fan√∏ and end on the mainland at the converter station near Endrup where an existing power facility has been extended with . The building itself has a footprint of 125 m √ó 36 m and a height of 21 m. A group of local residents have collaborated with Energinet.dk in deciding the outer appearance of the building and its surrounding vegetation. The COBRAcable is a cross-border project of European significance. The European Commission has therefore allocated a subsidy to the project under the EU Economic Recovery Plan, and has designated the COBRAcable as a Project of Common Interest (PCI). In November 2015, the project was put on the EU \\"Projects of Common Interest\\" list, along with Viking Link between Denmark and England, and Kriegers Flak Combined Grid Solution between Denmark and Germany. Construction contracts were signed with Siemens and Prysmian in 2016 and in June 2016 Prysmian subcontracted the marine survey for the cable placement to the Swedish marine survey provider MMT. Onshore construction started in Denmark in October 2016 and in the Netherlands in January 2017. In 2015 COBRACable was expected to be operational from early 2019, in Q1 2019 commercial operation was expected to start during Q3 of 2019. After tests between July and September 2019, the COBRAcable was commissioned in September 2019. In its first half year of operation, it had a 79% capacity factor and transported 1,400 GWh to Netherlands and 700 GWh to Denmark.

About 2000 described species are in over 160 genera distributed worldwide. These are usually very small flies, yellow or black and appearing shiny due to the virtual absence of any hairs. The majority of the larvae are phytophagous, mainly on grasses, and can be major pests of cereals. However, parasitic and predatory species are known. A few species are kleptoparasites. Some species in the genera Hippelates and Siphunculina (S. funicola being quite well known in Asia) are called eye gnats or eye flies for their habit of being attracted to eyes. They feed on lachrymal secretions and other body fluids of various animals, including humans, and are of medical significance.Robert Matheson (2008) Medical Entomology. Read Books. Uruyakorn Chansang, Mir S. Mulla (2008) Field Evaluation of Repellents and Insecticidal Aerosol Compositions for Repelling and Control of Siphunculina funicola (Diptera: Chloropidae) on Aggregation Sites in Thailand. Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association 24(2):299-307 There are scant records of chloropids from amber deposits, mostly from the Eocene and Oligocene periods although some material may suggest the family dates back to the Cretaceous or earlier. Family characteristics For terms see Morphology of Diptera. Chloropidae are minute to small (1.0 to 4.0 mm), rarely medium-sized, flies (6.0 to 9.0 and 12 mm) They are either black, gray, yellow, or greenish and the mesonotum often has a pattern of three to five dark longitudinal stripes against a light-colored background. The head in profile is trapezoidal or triangular. Bristles on the head are weakly developed. Long orbital bristles on the head are present only in a few genera. The vertical triangle is often large, (occupying almost all of the frons), and glossy, or matte (making it almost imperceptible). Arista for the most part thin with short sparse pubescence. Rarely the arista is densely pubescent in which case it appears thickened, or sometimes thickened and flattened. The proboscis is usually short and soft, only rarely with elongated sclerotized labella. The margin of the mouth is extended with elongation of proboscis and the vibrissal corner is raised beyond the margin of the eye. The wings usually developed, only sometimes slightly shortened, rarely reduced to small disks (plates), with reduced venation. Sometimes femora 3 rarely femora 1 thickened; in the latter case the corresponding (1) tibia is usually curved. The preabdomen in male consists of five segments: tergites 1 and tergite 2 are fused. Between tergite 5 of the abdomen and the hypopygium only one sclerite is present dorsally, with two close-set spiracles on each side. Sometimes this sclerite is reduced and rarely membranous swellings occur in this region, which are usually retracted and visible only in macerated specimens. In the subfamily Oscinellinae the hypopygium usually has well developed cerci and edites. The cerci in subfamily Chloropinae usually fused and for the most part reduced, and edites are reduced in size, pushed under the epandrium, and sometimes fused with it. The gonites are usually small, for most part membranous, and rarely highly sclerotized (Meromyza Mg.). For many species an examination of the genitalia of male, rarely of female, is essential for a precise species identification. See Biology Larvae are mainly phytophages of Poaceae, Cyperaceae, and Typhaceae; they develop inside the vegetative or reproductive parts, sometimes directly in the inflorescence or seeds. Some species cause the formation of unusual cigar-shaped galls on stems. Many species are known as serious pests of grain cereals. These include Oscinella frit L. and O. pusilla Mg., Chlorops pumilionis Bjerkander, Chlorops oryzae Matsumura an important pest of rice in eastern Asia and Meromyza saltatrix L., and M. nigriventris Mcq. flies of the genus Dicraeus Lw. damage the seeds of some bromes and wheat grasses. Many larvae are saprophages living in rotting or dying wood, usually in association with other insects, and in dead parts of herbaceous plants damaged by other insects. More rarely they feed in fungi. In a small number of species the larvae are predators and live in the egg cocoons of spiders, praying mantis, or the nests of locusts. Some species prey on root grubs. Chloropid flies assembling on a window Flies of most of the species of Chloropidae commonly in grass. Some species will assemble in large numbers on trunks and branches of trees and shrubs, sometimes on plants in flower. They sometimes assemble in thousands on walls or windows. Larvae of many species in temperate regions will hibernate in winter diapause and in some species the imago also hibernates. Medical and veterinary significance Chloropidae are not of importance in human medicine in the same way as blood sucking parasites such as mosquitoes or Simuliidae. Also, in contrast to specialist pathogens such as Plasmodium or Trypanosoma, the pathogens that Chloropidae transmit are not adapted to particular vectors. However, some Chloropidae are troublesome in that they act as purely mechanical agents of disease transmission. Species that occur in large numbers and are attracted to animal secretions such as tears and dung, sometimes cause serious irritation and infection. Prominent examples include the eye gnat genera: Liohippelates in the Americas and Siphunculina in parts of Asia. Their larvae are soil saprophages that have several generations per year and accordingly can multiply rapidly. In warm seasons they may emerge in huge numbers and swarm about the eyes, up the nostrils and in the mouths of mammals, including livestock and humans. The irritation can be so great as to compel the use of gauze face masks for humans and even for animals. Furthermore, the flies are so small that the gauze must be very fine to offer effective protection. Apart from the irritation however, the flies frequently move from host to host and from anus to face or to open lesions; accordingly they can be dangerous vehicles for many infectious organisms. Bacterial examples, in particular in the Caribbean and parts of South America, include the transmission of Treponema pallidum pertenue, the spirochaete that causes yaws. Less specifically, any of a range of bacterial species can cause human acute conjunctivitis (pinkeye), and understandably the incidence of pinkeye tends to rise sharply when relevant species of Chloropidae are swarming. Haemophilus influenzae biotype aegyptius is the pathogen that causes the highly dangerous Brazilian purpuric fever; in children it usually is rapidly fatal, and various species in the family Chloropidae are potential transmitters of the disease. As another example of bacterial transport, some species of Chloropidae may carry various strains of Streptococcal skin infections. Apart from bacterial pathogens, Chloropidae also may transmit viral diseases; in particular they have been shown to carry the vesicular stomatitis virus. A Batrachomyia larva parasites a Litoria genimaculata frog Though Chloropidae generally do not attack vertebrates directly, the larvae of the Australian frog flies, genus Batrachomyia, are exceptions. They cause myiasis in frogs. The parent fly, like most adult Chloropidae, feeds mainly on plant juices, but it lays its eggs near the frog. The larvae burrow under the skin of the body rather than the head or legs, and there they form visible swellings in which they lie as parasites, presumably feeding on blood and other bodily fluids. Most of the host frogs survive, but some do die.

They can be both biting and non-biting. Most often they fly in large numbers, called clouds. \\"Gnat\\" is a loose descriptive category rather than a phylogenetic or other technical term, so there is no scientific consensus on what constitutes a gnat. Some entomologists consider only non- biting flies to be gnats. Certain universities also distinguish eye gnats: the Smithsonian Institution describes them as \\"non-biting flies, no bigger than a few grains of salt, ... attracted to fluids secreted by your eyes\\". Description Male gnats often assemble in large mating swarms, or ghosts, particularly at dusk. Gnat larvae are mostly free-living, and some are aquatic. Many feed on plants, though some are carnivorous. Larval plant feeders (such as the Hessian fly larva) cause root, stem, or leaf galls to be formed by the host plant. Some species of fungus gnats (families Mycetophilidae and Sciaridae) are pests of mushrooms and roots of potted plants in homes and greenhouses. Black fly and biting midges, also belonging to the gnat category, are small, sometimes barely visible, blood-sucking flies commonly known in many areas as biting gnats, sand flies, punkies or \\"no-see- ums\\". Some South American pleurothallid orchids are pollinated by tiny gnats and have correspondingly small flowers. Life cycle Non-biting gnat populations abide near water, including wet soils; and are usually active in the summer. However, they can occur during any time of year in moist coastal regions. Male gnats swarm at dusk. The mating occurs as soon as the females enter the swarm. The females lay eggs en masse over water or attached to aquatic vegetation. The hatching continues over several days with the young larvae dropping to the bottom and building tubelike structures of debris. Larvae are small worm-like creatures that feed on organic material. The larvae stage continues for about a month after which the species pupate for a few days. Before emerging, the pupa rises to the surface of the water, serving as a nutritious food for fish. The pupal stage culminates in the metamorphosis of larvae into winged adults, which usually last less than seven days. Adults live for about another week and a half during which they produce up to 300 eggs. One female gnat can lay up to 1,000 eggs during its lifetime. Control Adult non-biting gnats do not damage plants and are considered a nuisance. Usually, larvae do not cause serious plant damage, but when present in large numbers can stunt the plant growth and damage its roots. To prevent gnats from spreading, measures have to be taken to target immature stages of development of the species. Physical tactics include eliminating favorable living conditions: reduction of excess moisture, drainage of pools with standing water, and removal of decaying organic matter. Commercially available control agents and insecticides can be used as a control measure, but are not recommended for use in a household. To control adult gnats in smaller areas, pressurized aerosol sprays with pyrethrins can be used. Other control measures in the household can include turning off unnecessary lights at dusk and sealing vents and other openings.

She was the first woman elected to the North Carolina State Senate. Life and career McKee, known around Jackson County as \\"Gert\\" and \\"Miss Gert\\", was born and raised in Dillsboro, North Carolina, which had been founded by her father, William Allen Dills, on a portion of his own farmland. Dills was a prominent local businessman and politician who represented Jackson County in the North Carolina House of Representatives in 1889; his wife, Gertrude's mother, Alice Enloe Dills, was a member of a prominent western North Carolina family as well. McKee attended the local public school before continuing on to Peace Institute in Raleigh; there she became class president before graduating in 1905. After graduation she began work as a schoolteacher at the Dillsboro Graded School in her hometown. In 1913 she married a widower from nearby Sylva, Ernest Lyndon McKee, becoming stepmother to his son; she and her husband would have two further children, William Dills and Ernest Lyndon, Jr. Her new husband was a businessman with various interests in and around Sylva. In 1923 the couple purchased the former summer estate of South Carolina Governor Wade Hampton III, turning it into a resort known as the High Hampton Inn. As the wife of a prominent local businessman McKee soon became active in many local clubs and civic organizations. During World War I she led Liberty bond drives and organized local assistance to the Salvation Army. She served as president of the North Carolina Federation of Women's Clubs between 1925 and 1927, and from 1928 to 1930 led the state's chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. In 1925 McKee managed to persuade Governor Angus McLean to sponsor a study about the conditions of women in industry, something which he had previously refused to do. This was cancelled the following year, but the governor appointed her to the North Carolina Educational Commission, on which she served an eight- month term. From 1926 to 1928 she led the Southern Council of Club Women; from 1927 to 1929 she served on the County Government Commission while presiding over the Southeastern Council of Federated Club Women. In 1931 she joined the Commission for Consolidation of The University of North Carolina, and from 1933 to 1935 she chaired the Board of Education in Jackson County. In 1928 she was a member of the circle of women who founded the first library in the town of Sylva. Throughout her public career she held various trusteeships, including at Western Carolina Teachers College, Peace College, the University of North Carolina, and Brevard College. She was also a member of the State Board of Public Welfare. McKee was also prominent in the Sylva Methodist Church, in whose choir she sang and at which she played the piano; she was also recognized locally for her skills as a homemaker. =North Carolina State Senate= McKee's political career began in 1928, when she campaigned for the election of Zebulon Weaver to the United States Congress. Two years later the local Democratic Party nominated her for the state senate. She campaigned through the district's three counties before winning the largest majority of any candidate elected on the local ticket. She served three non-contiguous terms, from 1931 to 1943, being reelected in 1936 and 1942; she resigned on April 8, 1943, at the end of the year's session. She was reelected again in 1948, but died three weeks after the election without retaking her seat, from a sudden heart attack. During her time in the Legislature McKee sat on numerous committees, including Appropriations; Education; Election Laws; Finance; Internal Improvements; Manufacturing, Labor, and Commerce; Institutions for the Deaf; Mental Institutions; Pensions and Soldiers' Home; Public Health; Conservation and Development; Library; and Printing. She chaired the Public Welfare Committee each term, and the welfare programs which she supported in this role proved to be models for other states. She worked to reform child labor laws as well. She also fought for educational parity for all children in North Carolina, and secured, over opposition, passage of a bill requiring all pupils in the state's schools to complete sixth grade. In 1933 she and state representative Thomas A. Cox obtained funding to pave the road between Sylva and Cullowhee. In jest McKee would sometimes refer to her male colleagues as \\"my children\\". So popular was she that there was speculation from some corners that she might become North Carolina's first female governor. She and her husband would often entertain legislators and other notables at the Inn. McKee is buried in the Keener Cemetery in Sylva. Her descendants continue to operate the High Hampton Inn. Honors and legacy McKee received an honorary doctorate from the Woman's College of The University of North Carolina. In recognition of the assistance she had provided the school over the years, Western Carolina University named McKee Hall on its campus in her honor; the building was constructed in 1939, and has more recently been renovated. A state historical marker in Sylva marks the location of her home, which was torn down in 1964 to make way for a Baptist church. Her portrait hangs in the Jackson County Library in Sylva alongside other local notables, United States Representative David McKee Hall ‚Äì a great- nephew of the McKees ‚Äì and former governor Dan K.

He is the founder of the American electronic dance music label Lunary Records. Career =Early Stages= In 2000, Finne discovered his love for electronic dance music. Finding the style extremely interesting, he started exploring the possibilities of making electronic dance music. He first gained notoriety in an Ernesto vs. Bastian remix contest under the 'Mind Markers' guise. Out of hundreds of contestants, Finne was one of the three winners in the competition. He got in touch with Ernesto vs. Bastian and Sony's FTM label and did further remix work for the duo, remixing hits such as Stop 9.5 and Who's The Starter. Phynn's 'Stop 9.5' remix was picked up by Ti√´sto, who played it on his second Tiesto In Concert edition, and featured it on the official DVD release. In the second half of 2004, Finne (now commonly known as Phynn) decided to make a record with his friend Bart Van Wissen, known as Fictivision. The result was 'Escape' (released on DJ Ti√´sto's Black Hole Recordings), a track that introduced both Phynn and Fictivision onto the international trance map. Soon after that, Phynn followed up with an even bigger hit, this time a solo production, titled 'Lucid'. As of today it remains one of his biggest and most well known records. Lucid was heavily supported by Ti√´sto and was featured on the Tiesto in Concert DVD series as well. =Breakthrough= Finne was introduced to the 'big audience' as a closing act for Ti√´sto at the Heineken Music Hall in Amsterdam, on December 3, 2005, in front of an audience of over 5000 people. One month later, Phynn was declared 'Future Hero' by Mixmag, a well known electronic dance music magazine. Following his global success, Black Hole Recordings asked Phynn to mix the 11th edition of the highly acclaimed In Trance We Trust series. Phynn accepted the offer and followed in the footsteps of legendary trance artists such as Johan Gielen, Cor Fijneman and Mark Norman and delivered the 11th edition of the series. =Trance Energy= In March 2007, Phynn reached a milestone in his career when he was asked to perform at the Main Stage of the world's biggest annual trance event Trance Energy, organized by Dutch event company ID&T.; The audience size at Trance Energy 2007 counted over 25,000 people. At the age of 22, Phynn was the youngest DJ ever to perform at the Main Stage of Trance Energy. In 2008, Phynn performed at Trance Energy again at the 'Future Stage'. ='Metamorphosis' Album= Phynn released his debut artist album in November 2008 on Black Hole Recordings. Titled 'Metamorphosis', the album featured 12 original works, including tracks with vocalists Molly Bancroft and Tiff Lacey. Notable tracks from the album are 'Try Again feat, Tiff Lacey', 'Wait For A Moment feat. Molly Bancroft', 'C U Smile', 'Starfire At Night', 'Metamorphosis' and 'No More Mistakes feat Molly Bancroft'. ='Spacewalk' and 'Hello Love'= In 2009, Phynn released 'Spacewalk' on Black Hole Recordings. The song was an instant success, and top DJ's like Markus Schulz played the record for many months after its initial release, and it was placed on many compilations worldwide. Following up on 'Spacewalk', Phynn's next project was 'Hello Love' featuring Antonia from Jets Overhead. Just like 'Spacewalk', 'Hello Love' was a big hit with fans around the world, leading Ferry Corsten to include it on his Once Upon A Night mixed compilation. =Remixing for Coldharbour Recordings= As a result of the success of 'Spacewalk' and 'Hello Love', world-famous DJ Markus Schulz approached Phynn in 2010 to do remixes for Coldharbour Recordings. Phynn's remixes for Coldharbour Recordings became a huge success. Phynn composed and produced remixes for 'Mike Foyle pres. Statica - Deadly Nightshade', 'Rex Mundi - Opera of Northern Ocean', 'Hammer & Bennet - Language' and 'Markus Schulz - Rain'. As a result of the success of these high-profile remixes, Phynn became in high demand by record labels such as Perfecto Records, Black Hole Recordings and Euphonic Records for remixes. =Lunary Records = In mid-2013, Phynn launched his own record label Lunary Records, headquartered in the United States of America. Lunary Records focuses mainly on Techno music, but also releases other electronic music genres. =Departure from Trance= In June 2014, Phynn announced on his Facebook page that he will no longer be making Trance music, and that he is taking a new musical direction and will focus on Techno going forward.

The film was released on July 22, 1956, by Allied Artists Pictures. Plot Under contract with an oil company, engineer Bix Decker and geologist Frank Sommers have been working in South America, but now Bix intends to go home. He changes his mind when replacement Jane Rivers shows up, at first skeptical because she's a woman, then eager to work together. A rival oil rigger, Werner Jackson, enjoys taunting Bix about a woman doing his job and punches Frank when he tries to intervene. Bix is impressed by Jane's work, but when he tries to kiss her, he gets slapped. His girlfriend Julie also is upset at seeing them together. During an emergency, after a casing fails, Bix and Frank try to drive nitroglycerine to the well to blow it up and extinguish the fire. Werner blocks the way, but Bix uses a bulldozer to cover him in dirt. A gusher erupts, dousing the blaze. It's time for Bix to return home, but his contract is extended six more months so he can stay behind and work with Jane.

Such was the case, and many soldiers of other organizations pass them selves off as 75ers, and under this pretense got beyond the pickets, committing shameful thefts and outrages in the surrounding country. Thus in time complaints of ill-treatment reached headquarters, and the regiment, undeservedly, received a reprimand... On these occasions, as when capturing horses and saddles, the soldiers pitied those whom they were robbing, satisfying their consciences with the thought that those who had brought on this distressing war were the ones who were to blame for its fruits.\\" -James Jabez HallHall, Henry and Hall, James Jabez.

He is a specialist in Baroque music, especially works by Bach, but is open to music of other eras including contemporary music.  Career  Born in Gr√ºnstadt, W√∂rner studied music at the State University of Music and Performing Arts Stuttgart, in Fribourg, Bern and Z√ºrich. He studied church music, voice and musicology, voice with Jakob St√§mpfli and Lied with Irwin Gage. W√∂rner has performed with conductors such as Carl St.Clair, Christophe Coin, Thomas Hengelbrock, Philippe Herreweghe, T√µnu Kaljuste, Sigiswald Kuijken and Helmuth Rilling. He has recorded especially music by Johann Sebastian Bach, such as the vox Christi in his St John Passion and the Mass in B minor. He recorded several cantatas in the project conducted by Masaaki Suzuki with the Bach Collegium Japan to record all sacred Bach cantatas, including volume 33 in 2005 and volume 36 in 2006. He took part in Sigiswald Kuijken's project to record Cantatas through the Liturgical Year with the ensemble La Petite Bande on period instruments and one voice per part (OVPP). He recorded Bach's solo cantatas for bass such as Ich will den Kreuzstab gerne tragen, BWV 56, for example in 2013 with Ryo Terakado conducting the ensemble il Gardellino.

In 2006 he recorded Lieder from Vienna written in the fin de si√®cle period, titled \\"Hugo Wolf und der Wiener Jugendstil\\", by composers such as Alban Berg, Arnold Sch√∂nberg, Franz Schreker and Hugo Wolf, writing the program notes himself. A review of the \\"ambitious project\\" noted: \\"W√∂rner's quiet but colorful bass-baritone and reflective attitude toward the text are evocative of the small gatherings in which the music of the Second Viennese School took shape\\". W√∂rner recorded with his own Ensemble Kirchheimer BachConsort Christoph Graupner's cantatas for epiphany and also Bach's Dialog- cantatas with Hana Blazikova. W√∂rner appeared on the opera stage at the Solothurn theatre in the title role of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Le devin du village, which was recorded. He premiered works composed for him, such as Canticum Canticorum by Marco Sofianopoulo, first performed in the Trieste Cathedral, and Werner Jacob's Lamentatio and Triptychon in St. Sebald in Nuremberg, for the broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk.

Critical reception JoshIVM wrote: \\"I'm so glad they stand away from the cliche southern metal vocals. Mark's raspy yelling fits perfectly and sets it apart from many of the clones out there. Although it may not be terribly original musically it is one enjoyable listen! This has been a good year for debut acts on Facedown and RTV are one of the better ones. (8.5/10)\\" E.
