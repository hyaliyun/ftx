History Gardner was born in Birkenhead, England, to the (Independent Presbyterian) Rev. John Gardner and his wife Catherine Gardner n√©e Forrest. :The Rev. Dr. Gardner, wife, servant and three children arrived in South Australia aboard Condor in March 1850 after accepting a call to take over the newly erected Chalmers Church (now Scots Church) on North Terrace, Adelaide, and served that congregation with distinction until 1868, when he accepted a call to Launceston Tasmania (which appointment got off to a bad start, then deteriorated and ended in bitter hostility). Gardner was educated at J. L. Young's Adelaide Educational Institution and found employment in 1867 at the English, Scottish and Australian Bank (later ANZ), first at Adelaide, then at Port Darwin, and later at Mount Gambier. He left the bank to go into business on his own account, and served as secretary to various companies. At the formation of the Adelaide Stock Exchange in 1887 he was one of the original 50 members, of which number only S. E. Beach, D. Fotheringham, A. F. Weaver, and S. Wills outlasted him. He had an office in the Royal Exchange building, 96 King William Street, from 1888 to 1917. At that meeting he was appointed hon. secretary and treasurer pro tem under president Henry Bellingham, and in March 1889 he was elected to the committee under George Sydney Aldridge, which seat he retained for four years. In 1896 he severed his connection with the exchange, but purchased a seat again in 1911, and continued to be a member up to the time of his death. His close involvement with the minutiae of stock trading made him something of an authority, and his advice was frequently sought and freely given. As a young man Gardner was a keen horseman, and in later years gardening was his chief recreation. He was a noted collector of fine china and works of art, on which he was considered an authority. He died after a long illness at his home \\"Airlie\\" on Trinity street, St Peters, South Australia. The Exchange suspended trading for a quarter of an hour as a mark of respect, and a letter of consolation sent to his widow by the president, Mr. W. B. Carr.

Since 1986 he has released over fifteen albums as a band leader and has appeared on over 75 recordings as a guitarist, sideman, producer, and arranger. He has been nominated for two Grammy Awards and was the recipient of two NAIRD Awards by the American Association of Independent Music. In 1993 Munro founded the Purchase College Jazz Studies program and served as director from 1993‚Äì2002. He is on a faculty member and Director Emeritus of the Jazz Studies program at the Conservatory of Music at Purchase College. He has written four books on jazz guitar improvisation techniques for Alfred Music, including Swing to Bebop. His preferred guitars are the Gibson ES175 Herb Ellis model, Godin Multiac Nylon Duet, Dell'Arte Legend 503, Martin D-35, and the Fender Telecaster.  Early life  Douglas Anthony Munro was born July 9, 1953 in Yonkers, New York. He started his musical studies at age seven, taking drum lessons. By age fourteen, he was playing dances in Yonkers and New York City. At age 20, Munro broke his back in a gymnastics accident, which ended his career as a drummer. in 1977 at age 24, he underwent a successful back surgery, after which he began playing guitar as a way to pass the time during recovery.  Career as a guitarist  After his recovery from spinal surgery, became a guitarist, performing locally and teaching guitar lessons. In 1986 he released the LP Courageous Cats. The album included Marshall Toppo on bass and John Jones III on drums. In the late 1980s Munro met record producer Joe Ferry, and the two would have a professional relationship for over 25 years. In 1990 Joe Ferry introduced Munro to David Drozen, owner of Optimism Records. Optimism released Munro's album When Dolphins Fly, which was recorded with Bob Berg, Charles Blenzig, Joe Bonadio, Will Lee, Al Orlo, Ken Ross, and Marshall Toppo. Based on the success of the album, Munro received a contract to record a second album, Autumn in Blues, with Jeff Andrews, Rob Aries, Charles Blenzig, Joe Bonadio, Tony Cimorosi, Alex Foster, Adam Nussbaum, Lew Soloff, and Marshall Toppo. Optimism went out of business before releasing the album, resulting in a legal dispute over the master recordings. The album was released in 1993 by the Chase Music Group. In 1995 Munro returned to his trio roots with the album Blue Lady. The album featured Will Lee and Will Calhoun. Munro divided his career into arranging, performing, teaching, and producing with friend and collaborator Joe Ferry. In 1999 he taught in a study abroad program sponsored by Purchase College. in Burgos, Spain. He performed with flamenco guitarist Mariano Mangas. They toured Europe and recorded the album Jazz/Flamenco Guitars on the Purchase College label. In 2000 Munro recorded the first of two albums with his organ group II-V-I. The first album, Blueness, was recorded with Jerry Z, Mike Thompson, Alana Alexander, and Ken Gioffre. The second, Up Against It, featured Jerry Z and Jason Anderson. In 2004 he started a series of four Boogaloo recordings for Scufflin' Records. The first, Boogaloo to Beck featured Lonnie Smith, David \\"Fathead\\" Newman, and Lafrae Olivia Sci. In 2004 and 2007, respectively, Munro released two Brazilian jazz albums with his group Big Bossa Nova. The first, Big Boss Bossa Nova, featured Ray Vega, Javon Jackson; Richie Morales, and Michael Goetz. Big Boss Bossa Nova 2.0 featured Michael Goetz, Jason Devlin, and Jason Anderson. These would be the last two recordings Munro would do for Chase Music Group. In 2010, following the appearance of Napster and the easy accessibility of recorded music, he formed his record label GotMusic. In 2010 he released Alone But Not Alone Vol. 1, an album of a solo guitar that used loops. During the next year, he released A Very Gypsy Christmas with his gypsy swing group La Pompe Attack featuring Cyrille Aim√©e, Howie Bujese, Michael Goetz, Ken Peplowski, and Ernesto Pugliese. In 2014 he released the enhanced DVD Loop-Mania!, which included six original compositions performed and filmed live using loops. It also included a section where he breaks down what he is playing and how he is using the technology on each song. There are downloadable mp3's of the music and downloadable .pdf files of the charts for each song. The fourth album on GotMusic was Doug Munro and La Pompe Attack: The Harry Warren Songbook. This is a sixteeen-track tribute Munro's great uncle, Harry Warren. There are fourteen compositions by Warren and two by Munro. The album was recorded with Howard Alden, Vic Juris, Vinny Raniolo, Ted Gottsegen, Ernesto Pugliese, Andrei Matorin, Howie Bujese, Matt Dwonszyk, and Michael Goetz.  Career as arranger and producer  In 1991 Munro began arranging and producing with Joe Ferry. Ferry and Munro's first album was We Remember Pastorius, a tribute to jazz bassist Jaco Pastorius. Musicians on the album included Glenn Alexander, Rob Aries, Charles Blenzig, Andy Bloch, Joe Bonadio, Chris Botti, Randy Brecker, Hiram Bullock, Joey Calderazzo, Tommy Cosgrove, Kenwood Dennard, Dr. John, Mark Egan, Alex Foster, Eddie G√≥mez, Scott Healy, Anthony Jackson, Will Lee, George Mraz, Adam Nussbaum, and Dave Weckl. In 1992 Munro co-produced and arranged a series of recordings for Shanachie Records called The Soul of R&B; (Vol 1, 2, 3). The series culminated in a live album and film recorded at the Lonestar Roadhouse in New York City. Musicians on the album included Cissy Houston, Chuck Jackson, Lani Groves, Johnny Kemp, Billy Vera, Cornell Dupree, Will Lee, Richard Tee, Dave Weckl, and the Uptown Horns. In 1993 Munro and Ferry did two more tribute albums for Shanachie, People Get Ready: A Tribute to Curtis Mayfield and Back to the Streets: Celebrating the Music of Don Covay. From 1993‚Äì1995 Munro continued to work with Joe Ferry as co-producer and arranger for Bluesiana Hot Sauce, and Bluesiana Hurricane which was recorded with Ray Anderson, Joe Bonadio, Michael Brecker, Will Calhoun, Eddie G√≥mez, Paul Griffin, Chuck St. Troy, Toots Thielemans, and Allen Toussaint. The Bluesiana recordings were the last recordings co-produced and arranged by the Munro/Ferry duo and the last for Shanachie. In 1994 Munro joined the ska band The Skatalites as co-producer and arranger for 1994's Hi-Bop Ska and 1996's Greetings from Skamania. The albums were produced by Ferry and recorded by the original Skatalites, Lloyd Brevett, Lloyd Knibb, and Tommy McCook, with guest appearances by Nathan Breedlove, Prince Buster, Devon James, David Murray, Bill Smith, Steve Turre, and Bobby Watson. Both albums received Grammy nominations. Munro and Ferry co-wrote the song \\"Skalloween\\" from Greetings from Skamania. In 1997 Munro added orchestrations to the original motion picture soundtrack for the Muhammad Ali documentary When We Were Kings which won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Film. In 2002 he started a nearly ten-year collaboration with Vitamin Records. The year also marked the start of a collaboration with producer and engineer Eric Helmuth. They worked on over 40 recording albums. Munro wrote string arrangements for over 300 songs on 34 different recordings for Vitamin Record's String Quartet Tribute albums. The first album was a tribute to Pink Floyd, the last (34th) was a tribute to Star Wars. The prominent featured players were Dave Keen, Deborah Assael-Migliori, and Michael Goetz (bass). Munro wrote compositions for the recordings, sometimes collaborating with Joe Ferry. Since 2010 Munro has done arranging for Vitamin Records. He has also produced lessons for Just Jazz Guitar, Premier Guitar, and TrueFire.com.  Author and educator  Munro founded the jazz studies program in the Conservatory of Music at Purchase College in 1993, and served as the director of the program from 1993-2002. He retired in 2019 as Professor Emeritus and Director Emeritus of the Jazz Studies program at the Conservatory of Music at Purchase College. In addition to his career as a musician and educator, Munro has authored four books about jazz guitar technique, published by Alfred Music and he is the producer and director of an interactive guitar instructional DVD entitled Loop-Mania!

Paying with mobile money is free, but credit cards, bitcoin, PayPal and Bank accounts have a 3% fee for each transaction. If a user does not have enough funds on VugaPay itself when making a transaction, it will automatically withdraw the supplemental funds from the registered mobile money, bank account or card.  History  VugaPay was founded by two Rwandan brothers, Patrick Muhire and Cedrick Muhoza. After a few years of watching M-pesa evolve from a small transfer platform into a full-blown payment solution, Patrick wondered what it might look like if it were redesigned from the ground up; purely for all countries. According to Patrick, the idea of VugaPay originated when Patrick wanted to transfer money from one mobile network operator to another. The process of sending money from one mobile network operator to another was a hassle, so they started working on a way to send money across all mobile network operators, interoperability for mobile money. Their original prototype sent money through MTN, TIGO, AIRTEL in Rwanda, but they eventually transitioned from Rwanda to the whole of East Africa, connecting telecoms in those regions. The app went public during the 2015 Transform Africa Summit (TAS) in Kigali. Initially, VugaPay was based on mobile money. VugaPay interoperable transfers are considered a hack through mobile money carriers and can be conducted on any carrier with mobile money services. These transfers are instant, with a large number of carriers from Africa. The East African reports some Confidence trick exploit this on mobile money systems and other services. In late 2016, Timothy C. Draper made his second-African investment in VugaPay. VugaPay later introduced an open source mobile money api, for merchants who would accept mobile money as payment.

The demonstration marked the first large rally organized primarily by and for gay and transgender people since Trump's inauguration. Trump's elimination of protections for transgender people promoted hundreds to protest outside the White House. Ellen DeGeneres, a lesbian and LGBT rights activist, said of Trump's actions: \\"Just seeing the news about removing laws protecting trans people. This isn‚Äôt about politics. It's about human rights, and it's not okay.\\" In late February, after the Trump administration reduced protections for transgender students in public schools, demonstrators planned a \\" Stand Up for Transgender Rights\\" rally in Chicago.

These differences distinguish SFE applications from current imaging approaches such as IVUS and Intracoronary OCT. Applications for the device (which is pending FDA review and approval), are expected to include medical diagnosis and support in determining interventional treatments such as surgery or biopsy. Providing both full-color images and a wide-field, real-time surgical view into the inner depths of arteries, enables physicians to circumnavigate hard to reach internal tissues to assess for potential disease.  Methods  The SFE technology was developed at the University of Washington for the purpose of providing high-quality laser-based imaging within an ultrathin and flexible endoscope. It is believed that the concept of moving an optical fiber to produce 2D images with confocal sectioning and laser illumination was first proposed for endoscopic applications by Giniunas et al., in 1993. A major advancement of the SFE is rapid scanning and generation of high-quality images using an amplitude-modulated resonating fiber. Using a single-mode fiber that vibrates in resonance, the SFE scans over tissue highlighted by a focused laser spot. A detector records the time-multiplexed backscatter signal. To access hard to reach arterial areas, the SFE fiber and tube are extremely small. The piezoelectric tube is 400-micron in diameter and this houses the single mode optical fiber. The fiber tip is driven by the tube and has a current resonance frequency of 5 kHz which spirals in an expanding pattern of 250 spirals (500-pixel diameter image) at a frame rate of 15 Hertz. The 1.06 mm diameter distal tip houses the lens system, which determines the imaging parameters. Prototype systems provide a 70-degree field-of-view and 10-micron resolution. Laser sources are coupled into the single scanning fiber and they use red, green, and blue lasers to create color images. To collect backscattered light, twelve 250 micron multimode fibers are placed around the periphery of the micro scanner, creating a 1.6 mm distal tip.  Advantages  Most medical imaging of internal organs is segmented into two groups: # x-ray computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound, which are used to image structures and typically, at low spatiotemporal resolution (millimeters, seconds); and # optical endoscope technologies, which are used to image surfaces at high spatiotemporal resolution (micrometers, milliseconds). Endoscopic imaging requires direct visualization of internal organ surfaces. This means both illumination and detection components need to navigate through often extremely challenging anatomy to see a specific area Both the size and flexibility- of the endoscope dictate the ability to access these regions. Endoscopes that are smaller in diameter and highly flexible, can reduce tissue trauma, sedation medication used for sedation, and patient pain [1]. The ability to achieve clear resolution while significantly reducing the device diameter to enhance arterial navigation is an SFE advantage. Current flexible endoscope technologies using 1 mm coherent fiber bundling technologies are about the same thickness as a human finger. When these devices are reduced in size, they suffer severe resolution degradation, resulting in an image quality that equates to legal blindness for the clinician using them.  Disadvantages  All flexible endoscope designs are limited by the diffraction of light. The objective lens and the illumination properties both determine the spatial point spread function (PSF) imparted on the image. The PSF in endoscopes has the greatest impact are the inside the device at the real focal plane.

Clinical applications  = Coronary = There are 800,000 Chronic Total Occlusions (CTO) per year in the USA. Due to difficulty, only 25% of these occlusions receive therapy [100]. Per the CDC, in 2010 there were 4.5M procedures for viewing the coronary artery, including 454,000 stent replacements; 500,000 balloon angioplasty/stent/coronary procedures; 1M coronary catheterizations = Stroke = Recent successes in acute stroke care are driving the need for every stroke center to perform endovascular reperfusion interventions. In the US, 500,000 endovascular reperfusions interventions are performed annually. The SFE provides the interventionist with a real-time view of stent deployments, and assessment of opposition, stent strut symmetry, side branch interaction, dissection, thrombus formation. Expected diagnostic applications include plaque luminal characterization for better device selection, endothelization of prior placed stents. SFE may also enable the interventionist to use less angiography ‚Äì the angiography would be used as a roadmap, and the SFE to assist in wiring the vessel, see the proximal surface of totally occluded vessels and other unique vascular nuances.

They are among roundworms that cause the parasitic disease filariasis. Specifically, of the three species known, Brugia malayi and Brugia timori cause lymphatic filariasis in humans; and Brugia pahangi and Brugia patei infect domestic cats, dogs and other animals. They are transmitted by the bite of mosquitos. Discovery The first species discovered was B. malayi. It was reported by a Dutch parasitologist Steffen Lambert Brug in 1927 from Southeast Asia (Malaya, for which the name was given). It was originally believed to be similar or closely related to another filarial roundworm then named Microfilaria bancrofti (now Wuchereria bancrofti), described by an English naturalist Thomas Spencer Cobbold in 1877. It was for this reason that Brug gave the original name Microfilaria (Filaria) malayi. Brug was aware of the difference mainly on the basis of their occurrence. He found both the worms in Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and Celebes; but in New Guinea only W. bancrofti was present, but not the new species. They are so similar that even after a decade of research, there were still arguments of B. malayi as a separate and valid species. As such S. Sundar Rao and P.A. Maplestone assigned the name Wuchereria malayi in 1940. The scientific name was retained for two decades. When a new species (now called Brugia pahangi) was discovered in 1956 from dog and cat, J. J. C. Buckley and J. F. B. Edeson named it Wuchereria pahangi after the village Pahang in Malay, where it was discovered. Another species Wuchereria patei was described by Buckley, with G. S. Nelson and R. B. Heisch, in 1958. It was discovered from cats and dogs in Pate Island, Kenya. Buckley reexamined all the Wuchereria species in 1960, and concluded that the genus should contain only W. bancrofti. He created a new genus Brugia in honour of the original discoverer, thus renaming B. malayi, B. pahangi, and B. patei. In 1977, a new species B. timori was reported from Flores Island in Indonesia. Description Brugia roundworms are small, measuring less than a centimetre. The longest female is 60 mm long and 0.19 mm wide, and male is 25 mm long and 0.1 mm wide. Like other roundworms, the females are larger and longer than the males. The young ones called microfilariae are less than half a millimetre. They are enclosed in a sheath (egg shell) which are easily stained with Giemsa stain (but not for B. timori). The sheath protects them while moving in the blood stream. Species of Brugia are similar to W. bancrofti and Loa loa. But they can be differentiated from their smaller microfilariae, complex spicules, and fewer caudal papillae (typically 11, while it is 24 in W. bancrofti). Life cycle Brugia roundworms complete their life cycle in two different hosts. Mosquitos are the intermediate host in which the young larvae develop, and thus they are also the vectors of filariasis. Different species of Mansonia and Aedes act as the intermediate hosts. Humans (for B. malayi and B. timori), and animals (for B. pahangi and B. patei) acts as the definitive hosts in which the adult worms cause filariasis. The infective larvae called L3 (third stage) larvae are transmitted by an infected mosquito onto the skin of the definitive host. Once reaching the blood stream, they grow into adult roundworms. Male and female worms reproduce to release the young worms called microfilariae. These microfilariae move to peripheral blood stream from where they are picked up by another mosquito. Inside the mosquito, they became larvae, first L1 and then L3. The L3 larvae are stored in the proboscis from where they are ejected into the host during biting.

The school opened 1898 as part of the federal government's off-reservation boarding school movement for Native Americans and was shut down in 1933 to become a tuberculosis center. The hospital in the past few years has been listed on the market and is currently being considered for demolition, even though local tribes had tried to claim back the land in the past. Indian boarding schools These schools were put in place by the government for two main reasons: to require the mastery of English and to \\"civilize\\" the Indians. There were roughly 100 Indian boarding schools that the US government operated, often forcing children away from their families for schooling. Twenty-five of these schools were off-reservation boarding schools in 1900, holding 7,430 students. Every day was filled with strict schedules and specific activities for girls and boys, home-making skills for the former and carpentry for the latter. Some students were forced against their will to go, others were in poverty and the boarding schools were a way out, and others wanted education and to meet other people from different tribes. Reports on these Indian boarding schools are largely negative, with most students found to be \\"malnourished, overworked, harshly punished and poorly educated.\\" While the conditions at the schools weren't ideal, they were better than the certain poverty that most children faced at home in their reservations.  Rapid City school years  Three reservations were close enough to the school to enroll students: the Pine Ridge, Rosebud, and Cheyenne River reservations. Towards the 1900s, approximately 650 children went to Rapid City Indian School from Wyoming, Montana, and western South Dakota. Indian police around the different reservations would make sure that students came to school each day, including an escort for a child if they had missed school the day before. The first superintendent, Ralph P. Collins, made controversy with reservation officials by travelling around to different reservations to recruit children to the school then forcing them all to travel by wagon to Rapid City, taking away students from the on-reservation schools. His tactics were criticized as many opponents viewed this as similar to the slave trade, causing the commissioner of Indian Affairs, Francis Ellington Leupp, to ban recruiters going to reservations in 1908. The early 1900s to 1930s showed many families wanting to keep their families together, prompting the school to keep their lower grades available to keep up enrollment, as many boarding schools split up the younger elementary grades from the older grades. Some students and families who decided to have their children attend Rapid City decided so based on the extensiveness of the course catalog and due to the fact that the parents or relatives of these students gained jobs at the school. Rapid City ran a very strict program. Their techniques stemmed from military drills and discipline, requiring students to walk in straight lines, walk in an orderly fashion, be at their dormitories during certain times of the day, and only allowing rowdiness during recess. The teacher-student ratio was extremely low, resulting in a lax of discipline with teachers stretched so thin during the day. However, teachers were able to enforce their power over the students through verbal abuse and humiliation, fueling students to run away as a way to enforce their own power over the administration. Regarding student health, nutrition at the school increased after World War I, while health care was never adequate in checking for or in preventing diseases and illnesses. Many families were wary of sending their children to the school for health reasons, for example some parents refused to send back their children in 1911 after two children died the previous school year. The school didn't offer very much nutrition or variety in meals, and hunger from measly meals resulted in some students trying to run away. As for disease, boarding schools became a main source of infection and transmission. Some believed the children learning more hygienic habits would result in a decline of sickness, yet many children passed different forms of the flu and colds between each and brought them home to the reservations. The Rapid City school required uniforms like other federal off-reservation schools. Students received dress clothes, school clothes, and working clothes, and, with money the students earned and under strict regulation, could occasionally purchase their own clothes. Female students had a hard time affording to dress with the times and to have acceptable clothing, as for many families paying for these clothes was enough to pay for a full set of home furniture. The curriculum at the school focused on English, as all Indian boarding schools did. Other focuses in the curriculum included vocational jobs, such as blacksmiths and the dairy industry for boys, and classroom work. Girls education focused on clothes' making and household chores, mainly focusing on learning to clean different objects and areas. Rapid City followed the model of other urban schools at the time by having two teachers to teach 80 students in 1898 and by 1916, only employing four teachers for the whole school.  Closure and aftermath  The school was closed in 1933 to become a tuberculosis sanatorium, named Sioux Sanatorium or \\"Sioux San,\\" splitting up the families within the school by taking younger students to a different boarding school and the older students to another. The land was split into three lots owned by the federal government, with the Sioux San Hospital being the last remaining structure of the school. In 2014, sixteen tribes from South Dakota, North Dakota, and Nebraska requested that the land be turned back over to tribal care because the land is listed as a plot of spiritual land guaranteed to the Sioux Nation under the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie.

During the Panthers presentation night, chairman Phil Gould said he personally recruited Harawira- Naera from New Zealand, as he fought back tears as he spoke about the hard- hitting forward. \\"We got a tip on a couple of young players - James Fisher- Harris and Corey Harawira-Naera,\\" Gould said. \\"These were two boys who were young and very raw and came over here with nothing more than a dream. \\"I think their first accommodation was out on top of the horse stalls at Fernhill Equestrian Centre. They lived with the horses and worked on the property. They got up early every morning and went to work and we could see their character straight away.\\" \\"Those two players mean a lot to me, they'll always be Panthers and they'll always be welcome at this club and I'm only bouyed by the fact that they've both got great deals and can set their families up for life with the deals that they have. Harawira-Naera finished his last year with the Penrith Panthers with him playing in 24 matches and scoring 6 tries in the 2018 NRL season. On 1 October 2018, Harawira-Naera was named in the New Zealand Kiwis 24-man squad for their tour of England and their test match against Australia. A few days later on 4 October 2018, Harawira-Naera withdrew from the Kiwis squad from a groin injury. =2019= On 15 February 2019, Harawira-Naera represented the MƒÅori All Stars against the Indigenous All Stars in the 2019 All Stars match, playing off the interchange bench in the 34-14 loss at AAMI Park. In Round 1 of the 2019 NRL season, Harawira-Naera made his club debut for the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs against the New Zealand Warriors, playing off the interchange bench in the 40‚Äì6 loss at Mt Smart Stadium. In Round 7 against the North Queensland Cowboys, Harawira-Naera starred for the Bulldogs in a Man of the Match performance, scoring his first and second club tries in the second half and pulled off a try saving tackle on Cowboys forward Gavin Cooper in the 24‚Äì12 win at ANZ Stadium. =2020= Upon winning his appeal against Canterbury-Bankstown over his dismissal, Harawira- Naera opted not to stay with the club asking for an immediate release. He signed a 2.5 year deal with the Canberra Raiders effective immediately on July 22. https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/6844389/harawira-naera-out-of-the- doghouse-set-to-join-raiders/ He played 11 games for Canberra towards the end of the season including the club's three finals games where they were defeated by Melbourne in the preliminary final. Controversy On 10th March 2020, Harawira-Naera and teammate Jayden Okunbor were stood down by Canterbury two days before the start of the 2020 NRL season after it was alleged that while on a pre-season trip to Port Macquarie earlier in March they brought two teenage schoolgirls to the team hotel where sexual activity may have taken place. Okunbor is alleged to have met the girl during a visit to a local school, while Harawira-Naera met one of the girls independent to that visit. Both players were asked to ‚Äúshow cause‚Äù why the NRL should not cancel or suspend their registrations as players. On 11th March 2020, it was announced that because of the two players actions, new major sponsor Rashays had cancelled their $2 million sponsorship with the club. Rashays had signed on to become Canterbury's front of shirt sponsor. Rashays owner Rami Ykmour released a statement saying \\"It‚Äôs a shame two players could wreck it for everyone, It‚Äôs disgusting. It's repulsive, to be honest. That‚Äôs something else. If they sack them, I would stand by the club and the NRL‚Äôs decision\\". On 1st April 2020, Harawira-Naera had his contract terminated by Canterbury-Bankstown and was also deregistered by the NRL. Canterbury released a statement saying ‚ÄúThe NRL have today deregistered both Jayden Okunbor and Corey Harawira-Naera with immediate effect and as a result their playing contracts with the Bulldogs have been cancelled, The conduct of the two players, on the eve of our final trial match, demonstrated an unacceptable lack of respect for their teammates, their coach and club officials, our hosts in Port Macquarie and fans of the game everywhere\\". On 8th April 2020, both players opted to appeal their contract terminations at an NRL Appeals Tribunal (an independent hearing headed by high court judge Ian Callinan AC QC). On 13th July 2020, the NRL Appeals Tribunal agreed (with the players appeal) that the punishment was too harsh, reversing the decision to deregister both Harawira-Naera and Jayden Okunbor effective immediately. Harawira-Neara received a retrospective 10 game ban (from the date of contract termination), and a $15,000 fine. Jayden Okunbor was retrospectively given a 14 game ban (from the date of contract termination), a $22,500 fine and a course of counselling / community service. Upon winning his appeal, Harawira-Naaera asked the Canterbury club for a release and signed a 2.5 year contract with the Canberra Raiders. https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/6844389/harawira-naera-out-of-the- doghouse-set-to-join-raiders/ References External links *Canterbury- Bankstown Bulldogs 1995 births New Zealand rugby league players New Zealand MƒÅori rugby league players New Zealand MƒÅori rugby league team players Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs players Penrith Panthers players Rugby league second-rows People from the Hokianga Living people ","title":"Corey Harawira-Naera"},{"id":"53582184","text":"Stourport-on-Severn railway station was the main station in Stourport-on- Severn, Worcestershire, England.

A major tributary of Buffalo Bayou, the Brays flows for from the western edge of the county, south of Barker Reservoir along the border with Fort Bend County, east to its convergence with the Buffalo at Harrisburg. Nearly all of the river is located within the city of Houston; it is a defining geographic feature of many neighborhoods and districts, including Meyerland, Braeswood Place, the Texas Medical Center, and Riverside Terrace. As a result of its central route through Harris County, the Brays Bayou watershed is heavily urbanized. Over 700,000 people reside within its drainage area, which contains of open-channel waterway, mostly from artificial drainage channels. This high level of development, combined with a relative lack of flood control infrastructure, means Brays Bayou is extremely prone to flash flooding events.  Name  The origin of the name Brays Bayou is unclear, and the alternate spellings Braes and Bray's have been used throughout its history, most prominently in Braeswood Place, a neighborhood which straddles the bayou southwest of Rice University, and Braeswood Boulevard, which runs along the river between Interstate 610 and Texas State Highway 288. Braeswood may have originated from the Scottish word brae, for hill or slope. An early settler along Brays Bayou, Henry MacGregor (the namesake of MacGregor Drive in the Third Ward), may have coined the name. The name Brays has been used to describe the river since the arrival of the Old Three Hundred at Stephen F. Austin's colony in the 1820s. In 1822, a man named Bray settled along the bayou, possibly providing its name.  Route  Brays Bayou has its source at an artificial stormwater detention basin south of Barker Reservoir in extreme western Harris County. It flows eastward, north of Mission Bend and parallel to the Westpark Tollway, into Alief. After briefly entering Westchase, the Brays turns southward, bisects the International District, and straddles the western edge of Sharpstown. After passing under Interstate 69, the bayou flows east-northeast through Meyerland, underneath the Interstate 610 loop, and past the Texas Medical Center and Hermann Park. The bayou passes under State Highway 288, enters the Third Ward, and exits into the East End after passing under Interstate 45. Significantly wider at this point, Brays Bayou then empties into Buffalo Bayou at the Houston Ship Channel and historic townsite of Harrisburg.  History  The confluence of Brays and Buffalo bayous was the original focal point for Anglo-American settlement in the region with the founding of Harrisburg in 1825. In 1836, Houston was founded upstream Buffalo Bayou at the confluence with White Oak Bayou. Harrisburg would remain the region's primary trade center until after the American Civil War, when economic momentum shifted to Houston. Other early settlements along Brays Bayou included Riceville, founded in 1850, and Alief, founded in 1861. Frequent flooding along the Brays made its floodplain ideal for growing rice, which became a cash crop in Alief through the early 20th century. As a result of its familiarity with flooding, Alief was home to the region's first flood control district, which was created in 1909. 1925 view of Brays Bayou looking north. The forested area is today the Texas Medical Center. Rice University and Memorial Hermann Hospital can be seen at the top left, and Hermann Park can be seen at the top right. Harris Gully, which has been rerouted into an underground culvert, runs from the left side of the photograph into Brays. By the first half of the 20th century, suburbs of Houston had reached the banks of Brays Bayou. Rice University was established on a large plot of land adjacent to Harris Gully, a tributary of the bayou, in 1912, and the University of Houston was established just north of the bayou in the Third Ward in 1927. Harrisburg was annexed by the city in 1926. During the 1930s, Riverside Terrace, south of the Third Ward, became home to the large forested estates of Houston's wealthy Jewish community, which had been segregated out of River Oaks. The Texas Medical Center began in the 1940s with the construction of the MD Anderson Cancer Center. Meyerland, located immediately west of the southwest corner of Interstate 610, was opened in 1955 as one of Houston's first master-planned communities. Brays Bayou continues to serve as a greenway connecting these affluent neighborhoods and districts. Like many other Houston bayous, Brays Bayou was channelized by the United States Army Corps of Engineers between 1955 and 1960 after severe flooding earlier in the decade. By 1980, the Brays Bayou watershed was home to a population of over 412,000, and inadequate drainage infrastructure was still a major concern. A 1976 flood caused major damage to the Medical Center, Rice University, the University of Houston, and institutions in the Museum District. Beginning in the 1970s, the Harris County Flood Control District began implementing restrictions on upstream development to reduce the likelihood of flooding. In 2001, Tropical Storm Allison, the most destructive tropical storm in U.S. history, devastated the Brays Bayou watershed. 6,000 homes along the Brays were flooded, and the Texas Medical Center was inundated, damaging important medical facilities. Damage to the University of Texas Health Science Center alone exceeded $740 million ($ in dollars). In May 2015, an extreme rainfall event flooded over 400 homes in Meyerland. One year later, in April 2016, the neighborhood was again impacted by floods. In 2017, the area was hit by significantly more severe flooding due to Hurricane Harvey.  Project Brays  The Brays Bayou Federal Flood Risk Reduction Project, also known as Project Brays, is an ongoing $480 million project by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Harris County Flood Control District (HCFCD) to retrofit the Brays Bayou watershed with new and improved flood control infrastructure. Overall, the project includes 75 individual components, including deepening and widening of the bayou, modifying or reconstructing 30 road bridges, and constructing four large stormwater detention basins with a total capacity of . Planning for Project Brays began in 1988 when the Army Corps of Engineers released a cost‚Äìbenefit analysis for a flood damage reduction project in the Brays watershed. The Harris County Flood Control District took over planning and implementation of the project in 1998, and construction began in 2001. The project, which has a tentative completion date of 2021, has been continuously delayed by gaps in federal funding, though the urgency of the 2015 and 2016 floods has hastened efforts to complete it. Once completed, Project Brays will remove 15,000 structures from the 100-year (0.1%) floodplain.  Parkland  The Brays Bayou Greenway serves as an important linear park through a broad region of Houston, providing of grade-separated hike-and-bike trails. Under the City of Houston's Bayou Greenways 2020 project, Brays Bayou has been the focus of a number of projects to fill gaps in the trail network, add new park space, and provide increased connectivity to adjacent neighborhoods and across the bayou. Public parks which connect to the greenway include (from west to east): Mike Driscoll Park, Arthur Storey Park, Hermann Park, MacGregor Park, and Mason Park. Arthur Storey Park doubles as a large stormwater detention basin which can hold up to (about 3,376 acre feet) of water during flood events.

Life He was born in Yorkshire, and was educated first under private tuition at Scarborough, and then at a grammar school at Hull under Joseph Milner. He entered Magdalene College, Cambridge in 1782. Brown did not take a degree, but was ordained deacon in the Church of England in 1785, by Richard Watson. He was appointed to a chaplaincy in Bengal. Brown reached Calcutta in 1786, and was placed in charge of an orphanage. At the same time he was appointed chaplain to the brigade at Fort William. In addition to these duties Brown took charge of the Old Mission Church of Calcutta. That year he met Charles Grant, and put together a \\"Proposal for Establishing a Protestant Mission in Bengal\\". It was passed to Charles Simeon, and then to William Wilberforce. Grant returned to Great Britain, and recruitment of evangelical chaplains for India got under way. In 1788 Brown gave up the orphanage position, incompatible with his work as pastor at the Old Mission Church founded by John Kiernander. In 1794 Brown was appointed presidency chaplain. Among his close friends were Henry Martyn, Claudius Buchanan, and Thomas Thomason. He became senior chaplain in 1797, when Thomas Blanshard left. Ruined Hindu temple in Serampore, in the garden of Aldeen House, the property in the early 19th century of David Brown, and used by Henry Martyn In 1803 Brown bought Aldeen House in Serampore, and made it his home. The grounds included a deserted temple. At this time Serampore was a colony of Danish India, and while the East India Company opposed missionary activity, the Lutheran Danish government was sympathetic, in particular to William Carey. Under the name the Pagoda, the abandoned Radha-vallabha temple next to the River Hooghly was used as an oratory by Henry Martyn, who often stayed with Brown. Aldeen House became a place of meeting of Baptist missionaries such as Carey, and the group of evangelical Anglican chaplains in Bengal. While personal relations were good, there were also tensions: Brown opposed Baptist efforts with the Calcutta Benevolent Institution, a free school, and there was a power struggle within the Serampore mission. Brown's health was failing in 1812. He embarked, for the benefit of sea air, in a vessel bound for Madras, which was wrecked on the voyage down the Bay of Bengal. The passengers and crew were rescued by another vessel and taken back to Calcutta. Brown died on 14 June 1812, at the house in Chowringhee of John Herbert Harington, president of the Calcutta Bible Society set up in 1811, as he was the secretary. Funeral sermons were preached by Daniel Corrie and Thomas Thomason. Family Brown married, first, a Miss Robinson of Hull, who died in 1794; and then in 1796, to Frances Cowley, daughter of Hannah Cowley. On his death he left nine children. Buchanan mentioned three sons, who had been schooled in languages. The family received support from the East India Company, moved to London, and Frances Brown died in Bristol, in 1822.

Due to its mlo mildew resistance (Erysiphe graminis ssp. hordei) coming from the variety Trumpf and the denso dwarfing gene combined with an excellent brewing quality Alexis has been a milestone in malting barley breeding. thumb Besides Germany, Alexis was listed in Spain, Denmark, Ireland, Hungary, Great Britain, France und Italy. Mainly in Germany Alexis has been the dominant malting barley for more than a decade. There it had been the main source for malt for most of the - small or big - breweries. Its peak was in 1992 when she had 9048 ha of multiplication area. Alexis has been so far the variety with the highest multiplication area in Germany over the last 30 years. It has been supplanted by newer varieties with better agronomics, but it is in growing demand for premium products. It is one of the few barley malts marketed today by variety. Alexis is popular both in homebrewing circles and among traditional real ale breweries, many of whom note their exclusive use of Alexis in their promotional literature. It carries a price premium to most other varieties. Due to its broad acceptance and its consistently good results Alexis is one of the varieties most often used in modern pedigrees.

Description The house is located outside Genoa's 14th-century walls. During the Renaissance, the area became subject to intense building, mainly consisting of public housing. Columbus was born in 1451, and historical documents indicated that Columbus lived here between approximately 1455 and 1470. At this time, the house had two or maybe three stories, with a shop on the ground floor, and the front door to the left of the shop. According to historian Marcello Staglieno, the original house was most likely destroyed in the French Bombardment of Genoa in 1684. It was rebuilt in the early 18th century on the basis of the original ruins. The rebuilt structure had a height of five stories. However, the upper stories were built by placing their beams on the neighboring buildings. When the neighboring buildings were demolished around 1900, as part of the construction of Via XX Settembre, the upper stories of this building were removed, and it was reduced to its current height of two stories. Currently the building operates as a museum, under the management of the \\"Porta Soprana\\" Genovese cultural association.

It is the one of the largest panchayats, both by area and population, of the state. The origin of the name Khajuraha is unknown. Khajuraha is part of the Sonbarsa Raj block of the Saharsa district. Some of the neighbouring places include Chandiasthan Gazipaita (2 km south), Biratpur, Lagma, and Golma. Saint Pritamnath (Babajee) lived in this village.  Geography  Khajuraha and its surrounding areas are a flat alluvial plain forming part of the Kosi river basin. This makes the land very fertile.left Flooding was a major reason for the poor connectivity of the area, as bridges tend to get washed away. Newer roads are more stable, and there has been less flooding in the last few decades.  Population  Khajuraha is highly populated village but it is well distributed among tollas and there is considerable area gap between tollas. As per Population Census 2011, Khajuraha village has total population of 8291 consisting of 4358 males and 3933 females. So the sex ratio of Khajuraha village is 902 which is less but is similar like other surrounding village of Bihar. But it has been observed that child sex ratio is better in Khajuraha. As per 2011 census report, literacy rare is around 51.26%. Male has higher literacy rate as 62.61% as compared to female literacy rate as 38.59%.  Agriculture  Khajuraha and its surrounding areas are basically dependent on agriculture. Agriculture remained prime occupation for villagers since a long time. Total economy of this village is either dependent on agriculture or service class occupations. The farmers in the village mostly cultivate Dhaan (paddy crop), Makai (maize), Gahum (wheat) and Moong (a type of lentil) in their farms. Since the climate of this region is most suitable for Dhaan (the paddy crop), a good crop brings happiness to many farmers in the village. Though, people do try to grow wheat crops, only few farmers get good yields. Most of the farmers have moderate harvest and hence it is not as popular as harvesting of Dhaan. Instead, maize is the second-best crop for the farmers of this village. The timing of Dhaan harvesting is especially notable as the villagers are happy in general for several reasons. The reaping of the crop starts somewhere around mid November and is usually followed by some of the most important Hindu festivals namely Durga Puja and Diwali. Six days after Diwali brings another festival called Chhath which is one of major festivals of Bihar. In between, Diwali and Chhath is another festival that is known as Bhardootiya (Bhai Dooj) in which brothers go to see their sisters. So before the onset of the harvesting the festive mood is already set and green fields that start showing the golden shades of ripe Dhaan crop are extremely pleasant to watch. Now for nearly two months it is the time of farmers to remain cheerful. The fresh crop of Dhaan reaches every home. Whether you are owner of the land, or the farmer or just the harvester, the Dhaan is bound to come to every household. It can be cooked straight or flattened to make Chura (flaked rice) which makes an amazing food when combined with fresh Sakkar (Jaggery) and \\"Dahi\\" (Curd). It has been observed that farmers tried to opt for different crops also like sunflower, banana farming but could not get much success. Villagers grow potatoes, brinjal, Parwal, onions and other vegetables. But those productions are only limited for their own consumption and does not have any commercial values for farmers. Similarly, fruits like mango, banana, coconut, litchi, guava, papaya are grown in Khajuraha, but mostly consumed by villagers only. In past, Khajuraha was famous in cultivating sugarcane and Jute. But we all know that Jute industry was heavily effected after partition and that affected Jute cultivation in Khajuraha also Similar story was observed for Sugar production in Bihar.  Art and culture  Ram Navmi, Holi, Durga Puja and Chhath are the main festival of Khajuraha. There is famous Hanumaan sthan in this village. There was an ancient Peepal tree situated there and every family of this village were big followers of that tree and it was believed that Lord Hanumaan is present there. Later Villagers made Hanumaan temple near to Tree in 1992. There is one Shiva Temple available at same place. Ram Navmi is also celebrated every year at same place. = Holi = The celebration of Holi is three-day long in Khajuraha. The first day being Dhurkhel (playing with dirt) and the second day for colours and third day is for Mahavir Holi. The Holi festival in this village is normally celebrated one day in advance to the rest of the country. During the Holi festival, people get to meet each other. Many people from this village who live in other cities of India and abroad come back home on this occasion to be with their family. Traditionally, people used to go in groups beating drums and singing Holi songs and Jogiras. At few places, there are big stocks of bhang (a cannabis intoxicant) in the form of Dudhbhanga (milk laced with bhaang extracts and dry fruits), Tikri (a type of Indian sweet stuffed with bhaang) and bhangjilebi (another Indian sweet laced with bhaang). Elders are greeted with this intoxicant but youngsters also find a way to have this. Villagers make one holi toli and they visit every home of village and whole villagers enjoy together first and second day. Whereas, All villagers gather at hanuman sthan on third day and celebrate Mahavir Holi. = Ram Navmi = Ram Navmi statue of Khajuraha Ram Navmi is one of the most famous festival where all the villagers can be seen participating. The major events of this festival are Ram Janam (Sri Ram's birthday celebration), Mela (Fair) and Bhasaan (immersion of the idol in Mani Kanth Jha's pokhad situated in village). Because of Mela, many relatives from nearby villages visit. This is very popular for kids and younger people as well as females of the village. Kids go to this fair for buying toys that can't usually be bought because of the unavailability. On the other hand, females seem interested in shopping cosmetics and some household items. The elder males feel happy in taking their grandchildren to the fair and shop for them. Usually elders are not seen shopping other than sweets and Paan. In past, there used to have some cultural nights program but recently villagers opted to go for clean Puja program and are not arranging cultural nights. = Durga Puja = Oldest temple of Bihar Maa Chandika Bhawani Temple is situated just 1 km south from Khajuraha. It is said that Chandi maa temple was created in dwapara era and it was the capital of ‚ÄòKing Birat‚Äô therefore its surrounding village is called as Biratpur. It is said that the five Pandavas with their wife Draupadi spent the period of agyaatvaas here. There are some conflict between Birtapur of this place and Biratnagar of Nepal regarding Pandavas spending their time during agyaatvaas. Chandi Sthan It is one of the important and viewable places in 51 Shakti peeth because head of Maa Sati is available in this temple. Chandi sthan is archaeological site as villagers surroundings this village found bronze plate so many times in past. Chandi Sthan is also famous for Managal Mela (local fair on every Tuesday) and durga puja fair. People from surroundings village Biratpur, Khajuraha, Jalseema, Nanoiti, Atalkha, Sahsaul, Golma, etc. pay visit to Chandi Sthan mostly on Tuesday. You can find huge rush of devotees on Tuesday and mostly during Navratri. It is said that there used to be huge fights among different villagers in past about first preference of Bali (sacrifice of goat) specially during Navratri. Later it was agreed among villagers and particular day have been fixed for different village. It is also proud moment for all Khajuraha people that Khajuraha was given 1st priority day during Navratri. = Chhath Puja = Chhath Puja is an important Hindu festival that is mainly celebrated in Bihar and some regions of Nepal. The puja is dedicated to the worship of the Sun god and his wife Usha. During the occasion, devotees perform puja to thank god for supporting life on earth and seek the divine couple's blessing. According to Hindu religion, the Sun is believed to heal many severe health conditions and ensure longevity, prosperity, progress and well-being. People celebrate the festival by following a rigorous routine that lasts four days. The rituals include: fasting (including abstinence from drinking water), holy bathing, offering prayers to the rising and setting sun, and meditating by standing in water. In addition to Bihar, many other states such as Jharkhand, eastern UP, regions of Nepal, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Bangalore, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh also fervently celebrate the festival. Chhath Puja is so called as it is celebrated on the sixth day of the month of Karthika in the Vikram Samvat. It is also celebrated in the summers, some days after Holi. However, Karthika month's Chhath is more ardently followed by people. Chhath Puja is celebrated at grand scale in Khajuraha. Villagers mostly celebrate Chhath Puja on Mani Kanth Jha's Pokhad but there are some other Pokhad also where Chhath puja are celebrated. Recently villagers have started cultural program in Chhath Puja night. Society, religion and safety  The village population consists of Maithil Brahmins mostly. Brahmins, by definition of the social classification in ancient India, are the highest-ranked. The Brahmins are traditionally supposed to have teaching as their profession. After independence this population of Maithil Brahmins have been involved in all profession such as administration, engineers, doctors, farming, business, serving the military and para-military forces to name a few. Apart from Brahmins, Rajputs, Kalwar (Baniya) and Sonar (Goldsmith) also live in Brahmins tola. Many others belonging to the other castes also reside but in other tola called as Baghial. Bagail is mostly dominated by Yadav caste. There is a small percentage of Muslims as well who mostly live in the Miyaaantoli area of the village. These Muslims of the village rely predominantly on growing vegetables for their livelihood (often referred as Kujras).  Natural calamities  = Flood = Khajuraha is part of Kosi Region which is known as the sorrow of Bihar. So it was common to have flood situations in almost all villages of Saharsa district in past. Kosi embankment was created and completed by 1950 and since then Khajuraha and its surrounding villages had not seen major flooding. Whereas in September 1984, Kosi embankment breached near Nauhatta in Supaul district and that resulted major flood situations in Saharsa district. Khajuraha village was not flooded fully but its surrounding villages were heavily effected and Khajuraha became like islands and almost got connectivity with the surrounding area after one week. In 2008, Kosi River once again changed its course but it affected mainly surrounding districts like Madhepura and Supaul. However, flooding or water logging due to heavy monsoon rains is a major reason for the poor connectivity of the Khajuraha as bridges in surrounding villages tend to get washed away. Recently Aapda Bhavan have been created near Babaji Kutti. Aapda Bhavan have been created to give shelter to villagers and their cattle if flood-like situations will come again in future. = Earthquake = Apart from floods, the seismic activity of Himalayan region is responsible for earthquakes that this village has faced. It is believed that the Indian plate is penetrating into the Eurasian plate at a rate of 5 cm/year. Because of this movement, this reason is prone to earthquakes too. In 1934, a massive earthquake in the village that caused much damage. Back again in 1988, there was another quake of much lower intensity which affected only the few buildings in the village. None of the homes were toppled. On the night of quake in 1988, The ground started shaking and people rushed outside to seek refuge. The tube wells and wells in the village started pouring water out but nobody was hurt. After that earthquakes have been experienced again in April 2015, but this had little impact and there were no reported casualties. = Fire (Aagjani) = In the past, fire was common in Indian villages during March‚ÄìApril because of huts. Indian huts are made from bamboo and hays which are very prone to fire. Even villagers were using woods and cow dung cakes for cooking, so catching fire was common in village but due to strong wind during March and April fire used to spread fast in surrounding area. Khajuraha has seen major fire in 1988 when almost all houses of Brahmins tollas were burnt. Only few houses near Hanuman Sthan were not burnt. There was heavy property damage in that fire as people did not get time to bring out their belongings from house before it caught fire. It is said that after that year, Villagers stopped building huts and they started building houses made from bricks and Irons. Nowadays, Khajuraha is having very few houses made from bamboo and hays. Fire is not common now but you can still feel the fear of fire among villagers and old people still keep reminding new generations regarding major fire and that makes everyone careful and they always rush to help others in case of any reported fire inside and outside Khajuraha.  Sports  Football was famous and most liked game during the 1990s but current generation are preferring to play cricket. A cricket tournament is being held every year at Khajuraha field where almost all the surrounding villages participate. right Other Popular games are : :1. Kabaddi :2. Volleyball :3. Pitto (local game) :4. Seven stone Pitto (local game)  Education  = Colleges = There is no any college situated particularly in Khajuraha. Nearby colleges are in Biratpur and Sonbarsha. But students from Khajuraha village prefer to go other cities for higher educations. right = High schools = :1. Senior secondary school (+2), Khajuraha :2. Chandi High School, Biratpur = Schools = :1. Middle School, Khajuraha :2.

Due to shortcomings in the historical record, very little is known about the origins of Macedonian governmental institutions before the reign of Philip II of Macedon (r. 359‚Äì336 BC), during the final phase of Classical Greece (480‚Äì336 BC). These institutions continued to evolve under his successor Alexander the Great and the subsequent Antipatrid and Antigonid dynasties of Hellenistic Greece (336‚Äì146 BC). Following the Roman victory in the Third Macedonian War and house arrest of Perseus of Macedon in 168 BC, the Macedonian monarchy was abolished and replaced by four client state republics.; ; ; see also for further details. However, the monarchy was briefly revived by the pretender to the throne Andriscus in 150‚Äì148 BC, followed by the Roman victory in the Fourth Macedonian War and establishment of the Roman province of Macedonia.; ; . It is unclear if there was a formally established constitution dictating the laws, organization, and divisions of power in ancient Macedonia's government, although some tangential evidence suggests this. The king (basileus) served as the head of state and was assisted by his noble companions and royal pages. Kings served as the chief judges of the kingdom, although little is known about Macedonia's judiciary. The kings were also expected to serve as high priests of the nation, using their wealth to sponsor various religious cults. The Macedonian kings had command over certain natural resources such as gold from mining and timber from logging. The right to mint gold, silver, and bronze coins was shared by the central and local governments. The Macedonian kings served as the commanders-in-chief of Macedonia's armed forces, while it was common for them to personally lead troops into battle. Surviving textual evidence suggests that the ancient Macedonian army exercised its authority in matters such as the royal succession when there was no clear heir apparent to rule the kingdom. The army upheld some of the functions of a popular assembly, a democratic institution which otherwise existed in only a handful of municipal governments within the Macedonian commonwealth: the Koinon of Macedonians. With their mining and tax revenues, the kings were responsible for funding the military, which included a navy that was established by Philip II and expanded during the Antigonid period. Sources and historiography The stele of Polybius depicting him in a carved relief, Hellenistic art, 2nd century BC, Museum of Roman Civilization The earliest known government in ancient Macedonia was their monarchy, which lasted until 167 BC when it was abolished by the Romans.. Written evidence about Macedonian governmental institutions made before Philip II of Macedon's reign is both rare and non- Macedonian in origin. The main sources of early Macedonian historiography are the works of Herodotus, Thucydides, Diodorus Siculus, and Justin. Contemporary accounts given by those such as Demosthenes were often hostile and unreliable; even Aristotle, who lived in Macedonia, provides us with terse accounts of its governing institutions. Polybius was a contemporary historian who wrote about Macedonia, while later historians include Livy, Quintus Curtius Rufus, Plutarch, and Arrian.. The works of these historians affirm the hereditary monarchy of Macedonia and basic institutions, yet it remains unclear if there was an established constitution for Macedonian government.; Contrary to Carol J. King, however, N.G.L. Hammond and F.W. Walbank write with apparent certainty and conviction when describing the Macedonian constitutional government restricting the king and involving a popular assembly of the army. . The main textual primary sources for the organization of Macedonia's military as it existed under Alexander the Great include Arrian, Quintus Curtius, Diodorus, and Plutarch, while modern historians rely mostly on Polybius and Livy for understanding detailed aspects of the Antigonid-period military. writes the following: \\"... to this we can add the evidence provided by two magnificent archaeological monuments, the 'Alexander Sarcophagus' in particular and the 'Alexander Mosaic'... In the case of the Antigonid army ... valuable additional details are occasionally supplied by Diodorus and Plutarch, and by a series of inscriptions preserving sections of two sets of army regulations issued by Philip V.\\" Division of power The Vergina Sun, the 16-ray star covering the royal burial larnax of Philip II of Macedon (), discovered in the tomb of Vergina, formerly ancient Aigai. At the head of Macedonia's government was the king (basileus). From at least the reign of Philip II the king was assisted by the royal pages (basilikoi paides), bodyguards (somatophylakes), companions (hetairoi), friends (philoi), an assembly that included members of the military, and magistrates during the Hellenistic period.; see also for further details. Evidence is lacking for the extent to which each of these groups shared authority with the king or if their existence had a basis in a formal constitutional framework.; for an argument about the absolutism of the Macedonian monarchy, see . Before the reign of Philip II, the only institution supported by textual evidence is the monarchy.. In 1931, Friedrich Granier was the first to propose that by the time of Philip II's reign, Macedonia had a constitutional government with laws that delegated rights and customary privileges to certain groups, especially to its citizen soldiers, although the majority of evidence for the army's alleged right to appoint a new king and judge cases of treason stems from the reign of Alexander III of Macedon.; . Pietro de Francisci was the first to refute these ideas and advance the theory that the Macedonian government was an autocracy ruled by the whim of the monarch, although this issue of kingship and governance is still unresolved in academia.; ; see also for further details. Institutions =Kingship and the royal court= Hades abducting Persephone, fresco in the small Macedonian royal tomb at Vergina, Macedonia, Greece, c. 340 BC The god Dionysos riding a cheetah, mosaic floor in the \\"House of Dionysos\\" at Pella, Greece, c. 330‚Äì300 BC The Macedonian hereditary monarchy existed since at least the time of Archaic Greece, perhaps evolving from a tribal system, and with roots in Mycenaean Greece in view of its seemingly Homeric aristocratic attributes.. Thucydides wrote that in previous ages Macedonia was divided into small tribal regions each having their own petty king, the tribes of Lower Macedonia eventually coalescing under one great king who exercised power as an overlord over the lesser kings of Upper Macedonia.. The Argead dynasty lasted from the reign of Perdiccas I of Macedon until that of Alexander IV of Macedon, supplanted by the Antigonid dynasty during the Hellenistic period. The direct line of father-to-son succession was broken after the assassination of Orestes of Macedon in 396 BC (allegedly by his regent and successor Aeropus II of Macedon), clouding the issue of whether primogeniture was the established custom or if there was a constitutional right for an assembly of the army or of the people to choose another king.. It is also unclear whether certain male offspring were considered more legitimate than others, since Archelaus I of Macedon was the son of Perdiccas II of Macedon and a slave woman, although Archelaus succeeded the throne after murdering his father's designated heir apparent and son from another mother.. Historical sources confirm that the Macedonian kings before Philip II at least upheld the privileges and responsibilities of hosting foreign diplomats, initiating the kingdom's foreign policies, and negotiating deals such as alliances with foreign powers.. After the Greek victory at Salamis in 480 BC, the Persian commander Mardonius had Alexander I of Macedon sent to Athens as a chief envoy to orchestrate an alliance between the Achaemenid Empire and Athens. The decision to send Alexander was based on his marriage alliance with a noble Persian house and his previous formal relationship with the city-state of Athens. With their ownership of natural resources including gold, silver, timber, and royal land, the early Macedonian kings were also capable of bribing foreign and domestic parties with impressive gifts.. Little is known about the judicial system of ancient Macedonia except that the king acted as the chief judge of the kingdom. The Macedonian kings were also supreme commanders of the military, with early evidence including not only Alexander I's role in the Greco-Persian Wars but also with the city-state of Potidaea accepting Perdiccas II of Macedon as their commander during their rebellion against the Delian League of Athens in 432 BC.; . In addition to the esteem won by serving as Macedonia's supreme commander, Philip II was also highly regarded for his acts of piety in serving as the high priest of the nation. He performed daily ritual sacrifices and led religious festivals.. Alexander imitated various aspects of his father's reign, such as granting land and gifts to loyal aristocratic followers. However, he lost some core support among them for adopting some of the trappings of an Eastern, Persian monarch, a \\"lord and master\\" as Carol J. King suggests, instead of a \\"comrade-in-arms\\" as was the traditional relationship of Macedonian kings with their companions.; for further context, see . Yet it was his father Philip II who had already shown signs of being influenced by the Persian Empire when he adopted similar institutions, such as having a Royal Secretary, royal archive, royal pages, and a throne, although there is some scholarly debate as to the level of Persian influence in Philip's court.. =Royal pages= votive relief depicting a youth ladling wine from a krater next to a round table with vases, from the agora of Pella, end of 4th century BC, Archaeological Museum of Pella The royal pages were adolescent boys and young men conscripted from aristocratic households and serving the kings of Macedonia perhaps from the reign of Philip II onward, although more solid evidence for their presence in the royal court dates to the reign of Alexander the Great.; According to Carol J. King, there was no \\"certain reference\\" to this institutional group until the military campaigns of Alexander the Great in Asia. However, N.G.L. Hammond and F.W. Walbank state that the royal pages are attested to as far back as the reign of Archelaus I of Macedon. . Royal pages played no direct role in high politics and were conscripted as a means to introduce them to political life.. After a period of training and service, pages were expected to become members of the king's companions and personal retinue.. During their training, pages were expected to guard the king as he slept, supply him with horses, aid him in mounting his horse, accompany him on royal hunts, and serve him during symposia (i.e. formal drinking parties).. While conscripted pages would have looked forward to a lifelong career at court or even a prestigious post as a governor, they can also be regarded as hostages held by the royal court in order to ensure the loyalty and obedience of their aristocratic fathers.. The abusive punishment of pages, such as flogging, carried out by the king at times, led to intrigue and conspiracy against the Crown, as did the frequent homosexual relations between the pages and the elite, sometimes with the king.. Although there is little evidence for royal pages throughout the Antigonid period, it is known that a group of them fled with Perseus of Macedon to Samothrace following his defeat by the Romans in 168 BC.. =Bodyguards= Royal bodyguards served as the closest members to the king at court and on the battlefield. They were split into two categories: the agema of the hypaspistai, a type of ancient special forces usually numbering in the hundreds, and a smaller group of men handpicked by the king either for their individual merits or to honor the noble families to which they belonged. Therefore, the bodyguards, limited in number and forming the king's inner circle, were not always responsible for protecting the king's life on and off the battlefield; their title and office was more a mark of distinction, perhaps used to quell rivalries between aristocratic houses. =Companions, friends, councils, and assemblies= atrium with a pebble- mosaic paving, in Pella, Greece The companions, including the elite companion cavalry and pezhetairoi infantry, represented a substantially larger group than the king's bodyguards.. The ranks of the companions were greatly increased during the reign of Philip II when he expanded this institution to include Upper Macedonian aristocrats as well as Greeks.. The most trusted or highest ranking companions formed a council that served as an advisory body to the king.; . A small amount of evidence also suggests that an assembly of the army during times of war and a people's assembly during times of peace existed in ancient Macedonia.. The first recorded instance dates to 359 BC, when Philip II called together a number of assemblies to address them with speech and raise their morale following the death of Perdiccas III of Macedon in battle against the Illyrians. Members of the council had the right to speak their minds freely, and although there is no evidence that they voted on affairs of state or that the king was even obligated to implement their ideas, it is clear that he was at least occasionally pressured to do so.. The assembly was apparently given the right to judge cases of high treason and assign punishments for them, such as when Alexander III acted as prosecutor in the trial and ultimate conviction of three alleged conspirators in the plot to assassinate Philip II (while many others were acquitted).. However, there is perhaps insufficient evidence to allow a conclusion that councils and assemblies were regularly upheld, constitutionally grounded, or that their decisions were always heeded by the king.; . At the death of Alexander the Great, the companions immediately formed a council to assume control of his empire; however, it was soon destabilized by open rivalry and conflict between its members.; . The army also used mutiny as a tool to achieve political ends. For instance, when Perdiccas had Philip II's daughter Cynane murdered to prevent her own daughter Eurydice II of Macedon from marrying Philip III of Macedon, the army revolted and ensured that the marriage took place.; . =Magistrates, the commonwealth, local government, and allied states= A fragmentary inscription bearing the names of six city archons (politarchs), 2nd century BC, Archaeological Museum of Pella There is epigraphic evidence from the Hellenistic period and Antigonid dynasty that the Macedonian kingdom relied on various regional officials to conduct affairs of state.. This included a number of high-ranking municipal officials, including the military- rooted strategos and politarch, i.e. the elected governor (archon) of a large city (polis), but also the politico-religious office of the epistates. Although these were highly influential members of local and regional government, Carol J. King asserts that they were not collectively powerful enough to formally challenge the authority of the Macedonian king or his right to rule. Robert Malcolm Errington affirms that no evidence exists about the personal backgrounds of these officials, although they may have been picked from the available aristocratic pools of philoi and hetairoi that were used to fill vacancies of officers in the army.. In ancient Athens, the Athenian democracy was restored on three separate occasions following the initial conquest of the city by Antipater in 322 BC.. However, when it fell repeatedly under Macedonian rule it was governed by a Macedonian-imposed oligarchy composed of the wealthiest members of the city-state, their membership determined by the value of their property.: under Antipater's oligarchy, the lower value in terms of property for acceptable members of the oligarchy was 2,000 drachma. Athenian democracy was restored briefly after Antipater's death in 319 BC, yet his son Cassander reconquered the city, which came under the regency of Demetrius of Phalerum. Demetrius lowered the property limit for oligarchic members to 1,000 drachma, yet by 307 BC he was exiled from the city and direct democracy was restored. Demetrius I of Macedon reconquered Athens in 295 BC, yet democracy was once again restored in 287 BC with the aid of Ptolemy I of Egypt. Antigonus II Gonatas, son of Demetrius I, reconquered Athens in 260 BC, followed by a succession of Macedonian kings ruling over Athens until the Roman Republic conquered both Macedonia and then mainland Greece by 146 BC. Yet other city-states were handled quite differently and were allowed a greater degree of autonomy. After Philip II conquered Amphipolis in 357 BC, the city was allowed to retain its democracy, including its constitution, popular assembly, city council (boule), and yearly elections for new officials, but a Macedonian garrison was housed within the city walls along with a Macedonian royal commissioner (epistates) to monitor the city's political affairs.. However, Philippi, the city founded by Philip II, was the only other city in the Macedonian commonwealth that had a democratic government with popular assemblies, since the assembly (ecclesia) of Thessaloniki seems to have had only a passive function in practice.. Some cities also maintained their own municipal revenues, although evidence is lacking as to whether this was derived from local taxation or grants from the royal court.. The Macedonian king and central government otherwise sustained strict control over the finances administered by other cities, especially in regards to the revenues generated by temples and cultic priesthoods.. Within the Macedonian commonwealth, or the Koinon of Macedonians, there is some epigraphic evidence from the 3rd century BC that foreign relations were handled by the central government. Although Macedonian cities nominally participated in panhellenic events on their own accord, in reality the granting of asylia (inviolability, diplomatic immunity, and the right of asylum at sanctuaries) to certain cities (e.g. Kyzikos in Anatolia) was handled directly by the king or a preexisting regulation.. Likewise, the city- states within contemporary Greek koina (i.e., federations of city-states, the sympoliteia) obeyed the federal decrees voted on collectively by the members of their league.Unlike the sparse Macedonian examples, ample textual evidence of this exists for the Achaean League, Acarnanian League, and Achaean League; see . In city-states belonging to a league or commonwealth, the granting of proxenia (i.e. the hosting of foreign ambassadors) was usually a right shared by local and central authorities.. While there is plenty of surviving evidence that the granting of proxenia was the sole prerogative of central authorities in the neighboring Epirote League, a small amount of evidence suggests the same arrangement in the Macedonian commonwealth.. However, city-states that were allied with the Kingdom of Macedonia and existed outside of Macedonia proper issued their own decrees regarding proxenia.. Foreign leagues also formed alliances with the Macedonian kings, such as when the Cretan League signed treaties with Demetrius II Aetolicus and Antigonus III Doson ensuring enlistment of Cretan mercenaries into the Macedonian army, and elected Philip V of Macedon as honorary protector (prostates) of the league.. =Military= Early Macedonian army The basic structure of the army was the division of the companion cavalry (hetairoi) with the foot companions (pezhetairoi), augmented by various allied troops, foreign levied soldiers, and mercenaries.; . The foot companions existed perhaps since the reign of Alexander I of Macedon, while Macedonian troops are accounted for in the history of Herodotus as subjects of the Persian Empire fighting the Greeks at the Battle of Plataea in 479 BC.. Macedonian cavalry, wearing muscled cuirasses, became renowned in Greece during and after their involvement in the Peloponnesian War (431‚Äì404 BC), at times siding with either Athens or Sparta and supplemented by local Greek infantry instead of relying on Macedonian infantry.; see also for further details. Macedonian infantry in this period consisted of poorly trained shepherds and farmers, while the cavalry was composed of noblemen eager to win glory.. An early 4th-century BC stone-carved relief from Pella shows a Macedonian infantryman wearing a pilos helmet and wielding a short sword showing a pronounced Spartan influence on the Macedonian army before Philip II.. Nicholas Viktor Sekunda states that at the beginning of Philip II's reign in 359 BC, the Macedonian army consisted of 10,000 infantry and 600 cavalry, the latter figure similar to that recorded for the 5th century BC.. However, Malcolm Errington cautions that any figures for Macedonian troop sizes provided by ancient authors should be treated with a degree of skepticism, since there are very few means by which modern historians are capable of confirming their veracity (and could have been possibly lower or even higher than the amount stated).. Philip II and Alexander the Great Imitating the Greek example of martial exercises and issuing of standard equipment for citizen soldiery, Philip II transformed the Macedonian army from a levied force of unprofessional farmers into a well-trained fighting force. writes the following: \\"the crucial necessity of drilling troops must have become clear to Philip at the latest during his time as a hostage in Thebes.\\" Philip II's infantry wielded peltai shields that already disembarked from the hoplon style shield featured in sculpted artwork of a Katerini tomb dated perhaps to the reign of Amyntas III of Macedon. His early infantry were also equipped with protective helmets and greaves, as well as sarissa pikes, yet according to Sekunda they were eventually equipped with heavier armor such as cuirasses, since the Third Philippic of Demosthenes in 341 BC described them as hoplites instead of lighter peltasts.; see also for further details. As evidenced by the Alexander Sarcophagus, troops serving Alexander the Great were also armored in the hoplite fashion.. However, Errington argues that breastplates were not worn by the phalanx pikemen of either Philip II or Philip V's reign periods (during which sufficient evidence exists).. Instead, he claims that breastplates were only worn by military officers, while pikemen wore the kotthybos stomach bands along with their helmets and greaves, wielding a dagger as a secondary weapon along with their shields. The elite hypaspistai infantry, composed of handpicked men from the ranks of the pezhetairoi and perhaps synonymous with earlier doryphoroi, were formed during the reign of Philip II and saw continued use during the reign of Alexander the Great.; . Philip II was also responsible for the establishment of the royal bodyguards (somatophylakes) and royal pages (basilikoi paides).. Philip II was also able to field archers, including mercenary Cretan archers and perhaps some native Macedonians.; . It is unclear if the Thracians, Paionians, and Illyrians fighting as javelin throwers, slingers, and archers serving in Macedonian armies from the reign of Philip II onward were conscripted as allies via a treaty or were simply hired mercenaries.. Philip II hired engineers such as Polyidus of Thessaly and Diades of Pella, who were capable of building state of the art siege engines and artillery firing large bolts. Following the acquisition of the lucrative mines at Krinides (renamed Philippi), the royal treasury could afford to field a permanent, professional standing army.. The increase in state revenues allowed the Macedonians to build a small navy for the first time, which included triremes.; ; . Although it did not succeed in every battle, the army of Philip II was able to successfully adopt the military tactics of its enemies, such as the embolon (i.e. 'flying wedge') formation of the Scythians.. This offered cavalry far greater maneuverability and an edge in battle that previously did not exist in the Classical Greek world. thorakites) wearing chainmail armor and bearing a thureos shield, 3rd century BC, ƒ∞stanbul Archaeology Museums During the reign of Alexander the Great, the only Macedonian cavalry units attested in battle were the companion cavalry. However, during his campaign in Asia against the Persian Empire he formed a hipparchia (i.e. unit of a few hundred horsemen) of companion cavalry composed entirely of ethnic Persians.. When marching his forces into Asia, Alexander brought 1,800 cavalrymen from Macedonia, 1,800 cavalrymen from Thessaly, 600 cavalrymen from the rest of Greece, and 900 prodromoi cavalry from Thrace.. Antipater was able to quickly levy 600 native Macedonian cavalry to fight in the Lamian War when it began in 323 BC. For his infantry, the most elite members of his hypaspistai were designated as the agema, yet a new term for hypaspistai emerged after the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC: the argyraspides ('silver shields').; . The latter continued to serve after the reign of Alexander the Great and may have been of Asian origin.; see also : in regards to both the argyraspides and chalkaspides, \\"these titles were probably not functional, perhaps not even official.\\" Overall, his pike-wielding infantry numbered some 12,000 men, 3,000 of which were elite hypaspistai and 9,000 of which were pezhetairoi.; In contrast to Nicholas V. Sekunda and in discussing the discrepancies among ancient historians about the size of Alexander the Great's army, N.G.L. Hammond and F.W. Walbank choose Diodorus Siculus' figure of 32,000 infantry as the most reliable, while disagreeing with his figure for cavalry at 4,500, asserting it was closer to 5,100 horsemen. . Alexander continued the use of Cretan archers, yet around this time a clear reference to the use of native Macedonian archers was made. After the Battle of Gaugamela, archers of West Asian backgrounds became commonplace and were organized into chiliarchs.. Antigonid period military The Macedonian army continued to evolve under the Antigonid dynasty. It is uncertain how many men were appointed as somatophylakes, which numbered eight men at the end of Alexander the Great's reign, while the hypaspistai seem to have morphed into assistants of the somatophylakes rather than a separate unit in their own right.; : \\"Other developments in Macedonian army organization are evident after Alexander. One is the evolution of the hypaspistai from an elite unit to a form of military police or bodyguard under Philip V; the only thing the two functions had in common was the particular closeness to the king.\\" At the Battle of Cynoscephalae in 197 BC, the Macedonians commanded some 16,000 phalanx pikemen.. Alexander the Great's 'royal squadron' of companion cavalry were similarly numbered to the 800 cavalrymen of the 'sacred squadron' (Latin: sacra ala; Greek: hiera ile) commanded by Philip V of Macedon during the Social War of 219 BC.. Due to the Roman historian Livy's accounts of the battles of Callinicus in 171 BC and Pydna in 168 BC, it is known that the Macedonian cavalry were also divided into groups with similarly named officers as had existed in Alexander's day. The regular Macedonian cavalry numbered 3,000 at Callinicus, which was separate from the 'sacred squadron' and 'royal cavalry'. While Macedonian cavalry of the 4th century BC had fought without shields, the use of shields by cavalry was adopted from the Celtic invaders of the 270s BC who settled in Galatia, central Anatolia. Roman naval bireme depicted in a relief from the Temple of Fortuna Primigenia in Praeneste (Palastrina),. which was built c. 120 BC;. Museo Pio-Clementino, Vatican Museums. Thanks to contemporary inscriptions from Amphipolis and Greia dated 218 and 181 respectively, historians have been able to partially piece together the organization of the Antigonid army under Philip V, such as its command by tetrarchai officers assisted by grammateis (i.e. secretaries or clerks).; for the evolution of Macedonian military titles, see also for further details. The most elite, veteran Antigonid-period Macedonian infantry from at least the time of Antigonus III Doson were the peltasts, lighter and more maneuverable soldiers wielding peltai javelins, swords, and a smaller bronze shield than Macedonian phalanx pikemen, although they sometimes served in that capacity.; writes the following: \\"The other development, which happened at the latest under Doson, was the formation and training of a special unit of peltastai separate from the phalanx. This unit operated as a form of royal guard similar in function to the earlier hypaspistai.\\" Among the peltasts, roughly 2,000 men were selected to serve in the elite agema vanguard, with other peltasts numbering roughly 3,000.. The amount of peltasts varied over time, perhaps never more than 5,000 men (the largest figure mentioned by ancient historians, an amount that existed in the Social War of 219 BC).. The peltasts fought alongside the phalanx pikemen, divided now into chalkaspides 'bronze shield' and leukaspides 'white shield' regiments, up until the very end of the kingdom in 168 BC.. Following the initiative of Philip II, Macedonian kings continued to expand and equip the navy.. Cassander maintained a small fleet at Pydna, Demetrius I of Macedon had one at Pella, and Antigonus II Gonatas, while serving as a general for Demetrius in Greece, used the navy to secure the Macedonian holdings in Demetrias, Chalkis, Piraeus, and Corinth.. The navy was considerably expanded during the Chremonidean War (267‚Äì261 BC), allowing the Macedonian navy to defeat the Ptolemaic Egyptian navy at the 255 BC Battle of Cos and 245 BC Battle of Andros, and enabling Macedonian influence to spread over the Cyclades. Antigonus III Doson used the Macedonian navy to invade Caria, while Philip V allegedly sent two-hundred ships, some of them captured from the Ptolemies, to fight in the (unsuccessful) Battle of Chios in 201 BC. The Macedonian navy was reduced to a mere six vessels as agreed in the 197 BC peace treaty that concluded the Second Macedonian War with the Roman Republic, although Perseus of Macedon quickly assembled some lemboi at the outbreak of the Third Macedonian War in 171 BC. Currency, finances, and resources Tetradrachms (above) and drachms (below) issued during the reign of Alexander the Great, now in the Numismatic Museum of Athens The minting of silver coinage began during the reign of Alexander I as a means to pay for royal expenditures. Archelaus I increased the silver content of his coins in addition to minting copper coins in order to promote foreign and domestic commerce.. Macedonians were the first who issued different coins for internal and external circulation, a sophisticated approach which shows an elaborate monetary system at an early date.. In order to properly pay the soldiers of the Macedonian army with something other than general spoils of war, the minting of coinage significantly increased during the reigns of Philip II and Alexander the Great, especially after the increase in state revenues following the seizure of the Pangaion Hills.. During the Hellenistic period the royal houses of Macedonia, Ptolemaic Egypt, and the Kingdom of Pergamon exercised full monopolistic control over mining activities, largely to ensure the funding of their armies.. By the end of the conquests of Alexander the Great, nearly thirty mints stretching from Macedonia to Babylon were producing nearly identical standard coins.. Yet the right to mint coins was shared by the central and some local governments, i.e. the autonomous municipal governments of Thessaloniki, Pella, and Amphipolis within the Macedonian commonwealth.. In addition to mining, the crown and central authorities also raised revenues by collecting produce from arable lands, timber from forests, and taxes on imports and exports at harbors.. The king was capable of exploiting the mines, groves, agricultural lands, and forests belonging to the Macedonian state, although these were often leased as assets or given as grants to members of the nobility such as the hetairoi and philoi.. Tariffs exacted on goods flowing in and out of Macedonian seaports began since at least the reign of Amyntas III of Macedon, while the Oikonomika by Pseudo-Aristotle explains how Callistratus of Aphidnae (d. c. 350 BC) aided Perdiccas III in doubling the kingdom's annual profits on customs duties from 20 to 40 talents.; . After the defeat of Perseus at the Battle of Pydna in 168 BC, the Roman Senate allowed the reopening of iron and copper mines, but forbade the mining of gold and silver by the four newly established autonomous client states replacing the monarchy in Macedonia (i.e., before the resumption of the monarchy in 148 BC and creation of the Roman province of Macedonia in 146 BC).; see also for further details. The Roman-era historians Livy and Diodorus Siculus asserted that the law was originally conceived by the Senate due to the fear that material wealth gained from gold and silver mining operations would allow the Macedonians to fund an armed rebellion.; see also for further details. It is also possible that the Romans were concerned with stemming inflation caused by an increased money supply from Macedonian silver mining.. The Macedonians continued minting silver coins between 167 and 148 BC, and when the Romans lifted the ban on Macedonian silver mining in 158 BC it may have only reflected the local reality of this illicit practice continuing regardless of the Senate's decree..

Ounastunturi is separated from the neighbouring Pallastunturi fell in the south by the Hannukuru valley. The nearest large lake is Ounasj√§rvi north of the fell. The highest summit is Outtakka with a height of 723 m a.s.l. in the southern part of the fell (), followed by Pyh√§kero with a height of 713 m a.s.l. in the north (). North of Ounastunturi and the valley containing Ounasj√§rvi lake the terrain rises towards the highest parts of Finland, towards the south beyond Pallastunturi it is comparatively flat. The region around Ounastunturi is almost uninhabitated with less than 2 people per square kilometre. The nearest larger settlement is Enonteki√∂ north of the mountain. The vegetation is sparse and consists mostly of low subarctic woodland. The fell is in the subarctic climate zone with a mean annual temperature of -4 ¬∞C.

He composed it in Meiningen in 1912 and dedicated it to Anna Erler-Schnaudt, the singer of the first performance. It was published by Edition Peters the same year.  History  Reger composed the orchestral song in Meiningen in 1912. It was his only attempt in the genre, while he orchestrated some of his other songs originally set for voice and piano. It was his first setting of a text by Friedrich H√∂lderlin, his poem \\"An die Hoffnung\\". Reger had an affinity to the alto voice, collaborating with the singer Anna Erler-Schnaudt whom he met probably in 1906. Reger dedicated the work to her, and she was the soloist in the first performance in Eisenach on 12 October 1912. The composer conducted the Meininger Hofkapelle. The song was published by Edition Peters the same year, the vocal score in September, the parts in November. Reger requested the singer to perform in his memorial service in case of his death. She remained dedicated to him after his death, giving the autograph of the piano version of An die Hoffnung and several other memorabilia to the Max-Reger-Institute.  Text and music  The poem was published in two versions, the first titled \\"Bitte\\" (Request), the second \\"An die Hoffnung\\". Reger combined the text of the first, making minor changes to the wording, with the title of the second. Reger scored work for a low female voice (alto or mezzo-soprano), and an orchestra of two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three timpani and strings. The music is influenced by Wagner's Tristan und Isolde. Reger made a piano version.  Selected recordings  Carl Schuricht conducted in 1955 the first recording, with Christa Ludwig and the NDR Symphony Orchestra, complementing Bruckner's Symphonies No. 7 and 8. Hermann Scherchen recorded it along with other works by Reger in 1960 with the Nordwestdeutsche Philharmonie and Margarethe Bence as the soloist. Leon Botstein conducted in 2001 a recording with Catherine Wyn-Rogers and the London Philharmonic Orchestra, complementing Reger works such as Vier Tondichtungen nach A. B√∂cklin.

It was founded in 1975 in short term locations, later gaining a permanent location in 1988. All of the museum's exhibits are about hot air ballooning and gas ballooning. The museum is in the shape of a hot air balloon's gondola. There are only two balloon museums within the United States, the other one being located in Albuquerque, New Mexico. History The National Hot Air Balloon Championship preliminaries were held in Indianola in 1970. Due to the success of the competition, the championships started happening every year which led to exhibits being created yearly for the competition. However, the exhibits could only be put up temporarily. The short term exhibits created a need for a museum where they can be stored year round. The exhibits are from the Balloon Federation of America, covering over 200 years of history. Included in the museum's collection is the first hot air balloon that crossed the English Channel. Located within the museum is the U.S. Ballooning Hall of Fame, a children's area and a library. The children's area has photo shoots and books about ballooning. All of the museum's workers are volunteers. 24,000 people visit the museum each year, with the visitors coming from twenty countries. The museum has hosted a nine day long festival, titled the National Balloon Classic, yearly in late July since 1989. A large donation was received to continue the museum's operation in 2015. The donation was left in a will and was in a large unspecified amount.

The structures were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. History Saugatuck began its history as a lumber and shipping town, with shipments operating out of the city as early as the 1830s. In 1838, the Federal government erected a lighthouse to serve the port. Some time in the mid-1800s, private parties dredged the Kalamazoo River channel and constructed two slab piers at the mouth of the river. In 1869, the United States Army Corps of Engineers began work improving the Saugatuck harbor, and by 1883, the piers had been extended to a total length of 1,907 feet on the north and 3,863 feet on the south side. The channel, however, required constant dredging, and would quickly silt up. In 1896, to solve the maintenance problem, the Corps proposed abandoning the existing river mouth channel and cutting a new channel from the Kalamazoo River to Lake Michigan north of the existing river entrance. The proposed location cut through gravel, and was less prone to silting. In 1903, the firm of Burke, Smith & Nelson was contracted to construct the piers, and in 1904 land was obtained and construction began. Cribs for the piers were constructed in Muskegon and towed to Saugatuck for placement, and the balance of the work was done in place. Construction was completed in 1906 at a total cost of $273,783.23. In 1936-38, repairs were made to the structure and the piers capped with concrete. Further repairs and upgrades were made in 1974 and again in 1981/82. Description The Navigation Structures at Saugatuck Harbor consist of two piers, 200 feet apart and parallel, flanking the mouth of the Kalamazoo River. The North Pier is 2,778 feet long and the South Pier is 2,514 feet long. Lights are located on the end of each pier. The extreme outer portions of the piers are stone filled timber cribs, each 24 feet wide and 100 feet long Riprap is placed on both sides of the crib. Inland of the cribs, the remaining pier sections are constructed of wood piling spaced 13 feet apart and filled with stone. The shoreward sections are 13‚Äì14 feet wide and built with wood pilings and filled with stone. The piers were capped with concrete in the 1930s.

There are suggestions, however, that his greater scholarly passion lay in Oriental studies. Latin language sources identify him as Joannes Ernestus Gerhardus (or Gerhardus, Joannes Ernestus).  Life  Johann Ernst Gerhard was born in Jena, a well established center of Protestant scholarship. His father Johann Gerhard (1582-1637), was a leading theologian, and some sources hint or suggest that the son never fully measured up to his father's intellectual stature. Johann Ernst Gerhard was the first child of his father's second marriage, to Maria Gerhard,(born Maria Muttenberg). Gerhard attended school in Jena till he was 15, when in 1637 he enrolled at Jena University, the focus of his studies being on Philosophy, Theology and Oriental languages. His principal tutor was Johann Michael Dilherr, a theologian also, at that time as professor of history and oratory. His other teachers included Balthasar Cellarius, Johannes Musaeus and Christian Chemnitz. In 1640 he transferred to Altdorf where he was able to make progress with his study of oriental languages. By his early twenties he had mastered Hebrew, Aramaic, Syriac, Arabic, and Ge‚Äôez. At the end of his time in Altdorf he traveled to Regensburg, at that time the permanent seat of the Imperial Diet (Council), then returning to Jena by an indirect route involving Lower Saxony, stopping off at Helmstedt, Leipzig and Wittenburg. He was back at Jena by 8 August 1643, which was the day on which he received his Magister degree in Philosophy. In 1646 he began a lengthy assignment at Wittenburg University where in 1649 he became an Adjunct in the Philosophy faculty. In the meantime he produced in 1647 his first major published work, \\"Harmonia linguarum orientalium, scil. Chaldaicae, Syriacae, Arabicae, Aethiopicae cum Ebraica\\". This was a \\"polyglot grammar\\", taking as its starting point Wilhelm Schickard's 1624 Hebrew Grammar. Gerhard, for his update, built not merely on the Hebrew section, but added a further four parallel columns incorporating equivalent information for Aramaic, Syriac, Arabic, and Ge‚Äôez grammar. Work on the \\"Harmonia linguarum orientalium\\" brought Gerhard into contact with a brilliant student in oriental studies, three year his junior, called Hiob Ludolf. Their friendship, conducted almost entirely by letter, began in 1644, and is unusually well documented, the relevant correspondence being included in an extensive Gerhardt archive held at the Gotha University research library. By the end of the 1640s Ludolf was working in Paris as a tutor to the children of his patron, who was the Swedish ambassador, following which the ambassador sent him on a lengthy scholarly assignment to Rome, but earlier in the decade he had studied for some years at Leiden University, which was a centre for Oriental Studies. He was able to provide his friend with a long list of important orientalist scholars and early in 1650 Gerhardt set off on his own \\"peregrinatio academica\\" (\\"academic pilgrimage\\") to Leiden. In the end Gerhardt's \\"peregrinatio academica\\" lasted two years, taking in not merely Holland, but also France, Burgundy and Switzerland. He had barely returned to Jena when, in 1652, he was appointed a \\"Professor historiarum\\" (\\"Professor of History\\"). He received his Doctorate in Theology the next year, and two years after that, in 1655, was appointed a Professor of Theology. During the next few years he held various academic posts, showing himself according to one source to be \\"a man of liberal spirit but of poor health and of moderate gifts\\".\\"... [er] bekleidete verschiedene akademische W√ºrden, war ein Mann von liberaler Gesinnung, aber von schwacher Gesundheit und wol auch m√§√üiger Begabung.\\" Gerhard also took his share of administrative responsibilities. Between 1555 and 1931 Jena University rotated its senior administrative function twice a year. Gerhard served as University Rector during the winter semester of 1661 and again during the winter semester of 1667. Johann Ernst Gerhard died of a high fever on 14 February 1668.  Personal  Johann Ernst Gerhard received his doctorate on 12 July 1643. That same day he married Katharina Elisabeth Plathner (1626-1671), originally from Langensalza. At the time of their marriage she was the widow of Christoph Schelhammer, a professor of medicine. Children of this marriage are known to have included: * Johann Friedrich Gerhard (1654-1705) * Sophie Elisabeth Gerhard * Maria Elisabeth Gerhard (1659-1722) who married Johann Adrian Slevogt in 1682 * Johann Ernst Gerhard (1662-1707)  Published output (selection)  * Harmonia linguarum orientalium, scil.

The station forms a railway junction with a former marshalling yard, which is still partly used as a freight yard. At the station, the Eifel Railway from Cologne connects with the Koblenz‚ÄìTrier railway. Until 1983, Ehrang station was also the starting point of the Trier West Railway to Igel, which connected with Wasserbillig / Luxembourg.  History Ehrang station was opened in 1870 by the Rhenish Railway Company (Rheinische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft). General operations began on 25 March 1871 at the opening of the railway from Trier to Gerolstein, including the section of line west of the station that became part of the Trier West Railway. The station building at Ehrang resembled those along this line, which were each built as small \\"palaces\\" (Schl√∂sser). These were financed from the money that France had to pay as reparations to Germany after the Franco-Prussian War. It was expected that it would take many years to settle this debt. But in a one- time payment the whole debt was repaid. Now the German Empire could afford to erect these stations. The design of the building in Ehrang comes from the famous architect Julius Carl Raschdorff, who also designed the stations of Kyllburg, Bitburg-Erdorf and Speicher.Manfred Stoos, Bitburg-Erdorf, 2010 As part of the strategic Kanonenbahn (\\"cannons railway\\") from Berlin to Metz, now in France, the railway from Koblenz along the Mosel to Trier was built between 1874 and 1879, making Ehrang station a small railway junction. The entrance building is still largely in its original state, although it is no longer owned by Deutsche Bahn.  Entrance building The entrance building, including the side buildings and the water tower, are listed under the Rhineland-Palatinate Monument Protection Act (Denkmalschutzgesetz) as a cultural monument. The water tower is a spherical water tank, which was built on a cone-shaped base of cast iron plates between 1907 and 1913. Today, the water tower is a relatively rare representative of the water towers built around 1900 to the Intze design. The ensemble of the entrance building, rail sheds and employees accommodation is a picturesque group building with red sandstone fa√ßades. The whole ensemble is listed at the address of Ehranger Stra√üe 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8.

Each tanning operation included a dumping bump for crushing the oak bark. But it was also used to destroy animal bones. The peasants brought the crushed bones as fertilizer to the fields. From the middle of the 18th century onwards, fertilization became more and more important. The Economic Society of Berne supported the systematic collection of manure and urine into manure pits. Since farmyard fertilizers soon could no longer meet demand, the demand for bone meal, marl, and lime rose since the beginning of the nineteenth century.

Opened prior to 1881, The exchange's building was destroyed by the Great Baltimore Fire of 1904, and was then located at 210 East Redwood Street in Baltimore's old financial district. In 1918, the exchange had 87 members, with six or seven members at the time serving the United States in World War I. The Baltimore Stock Exchange was acquired by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange in 1949, becoming the Philadelphia-Baltimore Stock Exchange. The Baltimore Stock Exchange Building was sold and renamed the Totman Building. History =1880s-1899: Formation= For a time the Baltimore Stock Exchange was the main tenant of Redwood Street, a former financial district in Baltimore. The location was at 210 East Redwood Street. In July 1881, the exchange sent a letter of sympathy to the Secretary of State for the US president James A. Garfield's improving state after he was shot that week. On May 14, 1884, the New York Times reported that the members of the Baltimore stock market were \\"not directly affected by the demoralization in Wall-street, as only local securities are dealt in here,\\" despite the suspension of the Metropolitan Bank and others. Derek Fahnestock became president of the Baltimore Stock Exchange around 1888. The New York Times reported on January 2, 1893 that the \\"Baltimore Stock Exchange has not been especially lively during the year, but there has been a usual average of dealings, largely in the local stocks, especially Gas.\\" At the time, Baltimore was the third export city in the country. John C. B. Pendleton adjoined the exchange as a member in 1897, and in 1899, Legg Mason got its start selling stocks out of a back office in the Baltimore Stock Exchange. On March 13, 1899, a seat in the exchange sold for $3,025, the highest price ever for a seat, with a bid of $3,000 for another seat declined. A few years prior, seats were quoted as low as $50, and they had more than doubled in value in the beginning of 1899. =1900-1947: Regional exchange= On November 10, 1900, the exchange beat its own record for the amount of trading performed on a Saturday, with sales amounting to 7,665 shares of stock and $406,500 of bonds. In particular, trading concerning the United City Railways was on a \\"tremendous scale.\\" The exchange remained active as of March 1901. On June 2, 1903, H. A. Orrick was elected to succeed the recently deceased Derick Fahnestock as president of the exchange, a role he held until 1918. In 1904, the exchange's building was destroyed by the Great Baltimore Fire. In 1906, exchange member Edwin S. Zell filed suit against the Baltimore Stock Exchange in an appeal concerning whether exchange members were allowed to sell their memberships to others. During a financial crisis, on August 5, 1914, the New York Times reported that the New York Stock Exchange and all regional exchanges had voted to close, including Baltimore, the Boston Stock Exchange, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, the Pittsburgh Stock Exchange, and others for Detroit, St. Louis, Chicago, Cincinnati, Columbus, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco. On August 7, the Baltimore Stock Exchange forwarded an urgent request to the Committee of Five, a government group overseeing the matter, to reopen the exchange. Three members of the exchange, along with two members of the Chicago Stock Exchange, appeared before the Committee on Finance, United States Senate, Sixty-fifth Congress in 1918, to \\"most earnestly\\" protest the proposed tax on stockbrokers, which would be \\"based upon the value of seats on the respective stock exchanges and a percentage of the annual dues paid by members of the exchange.\\" The members argued that the Baltimore Stock Exchange business had \\"declined very considerably\\" over the war, as well as smaller exchanges. At the time, the exchange had 87 members, with six or seven members serving the United States in World War I. On August 20, 1934, the Baltimore Stock Exchange's governing committee voted to register the exchange under the National Securities Exchange Act, under exchange president Charles W. L. Johnson. On August 14, 1935, the SEC allowed the United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company to resume trading on the Baltimore exchange, after it was earlier ordered suspended over technical matters. =1948-1949: Merger and legacy= On November 18, 1948, Baltimore Exchange president J. Dorsey Brown announced that for several months, there had been plans considered to merge with the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, then under president William K. Barclay Jr. At the time, the Philadelphia exchange was the oldest stock exchange in the United States, and had 200 members, with 75 issues fully listed, and 381 unlisted securities. In contrast, the Baltimore exchange ad 35 members, 41 listed issues, and many unlisted issues. Barclay said the plan to merge came out of the \\"unprofitable operation\\" of the Baltimore exchange. On December 19, 1948, the two exchanges agreed on a plan to merge under the name Philadelphia- Baltimore Stock Exchange. It was estimated that the merger would be completed in the subsequent few months, with wire facilities set up between the offices. Brown stated that the combined exchange would be the \\"seventh largest in volume of dealings among U.S. stock markets.\\" The Philadelphia Stock Exchange merged with the Baltimore Stock Exchange in 1949, and the exchange was then named the Philadelphia-Baltimore Stock Exchange. On March 7, 1949, the merged exchange was officially renamed and began formal operations in Philadelphia under new president William K. Barclay Jr. The Baltimore Stock Exchange migrated out of its Baltimore Stock Exchange Building, later renamed the Totman Building, to a new home base in Philadelphia. In December 2015, it was reported that a Howard County developer was planning on purchasing the former Baltimore Stock Exchange Building in downtown Baltimore at 208-210 E. Redwood Street, with \\"plans to convert the property into upscale apartments and offices.\\" At the time, it was a 28,000-square-foot bank-owned property known as the Totman Building. Executives For fourteen years since around 1888, Derek Fahnestock served as president of the Baltimore Stock Exchange. He died in 1903, and on June 2, 1903, H. A. Orrick was elected to succeed Fahnestock as president of the exchange. The chairman elected at that time was Clymer Whyte. H. A. Orrick was president of the Baltimore Stock Exchange for 16 years from 1903 and 1918, after joining the Exchange's board of governors in the 1880s. According to the New York Times, Orrick was \\"president when the Exchange's building was destroyed by the great fire of 1904 and was a leader in rebuilding the city.\\" D. Fahnestock's son Harry Fahnestock was elected president of the exchange in 1917. On June 4, 1928, Fahnestock was re-elected for the eleventh consecutive term. As of August 12, 1934, Charles W. L. Johnson was president of the exchange. On November 18, 1948, the Baltimore Exchange president was J. Dorsey Brown.

Origins In the aftermath of the June‚ÄìSeptember 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, President Amin Gemayel, convinced that a strong and unified national defense force was a prerequisite to rebuilding the nation, announced plans to raise a 60,000-man army organized into twelve brigades (created from existing infantry regiments), trained and equipped by France and the United States.Barak, The Lebanese Army ‚Äì A National institution in a divided society (2009), p. 123. On March 1, 1983, the 9th Infantry Regiment was amalgamated with the Anti-tank Regiment, the Engineering Regiment and the 801st battalion into a brigade group numbering 2,000 men, mostly Maronite Christians from the northern Akkar and Koura Districts, though it also contained Sunni and Shia Muslims. Initially designated the General Support Brigade ‚Äì GSB (Arabic: ŸÑŸàÿßÿ° ÿßŸÑÿØÿπŸÖ ÿßŸÑÿπÿßŸÖ  Liwa' al-Daem al-Eami), the new unit changed its name on September 10 of that year to \\"9th Brigade\\", which officially became on January 1, 1984, the 9th Infantry Brigade. Emblem The Brigade's emblem consists of a grip holding a crossed red lightning symbolizing permanent readiness and rapid execution and the sword of Law, surmounted by an Arabic numeral (9) in gold and two drops of blood below symbolizing self-donation with no limits, all set on a black background. Structure and organization The new unit grew from an understrength battalion comprising three rifle companies to a fully equipped mechanized infantry brigade, capable of aligning a Headquarters' (HQ) battalion, an armoured battalion (94th) equipped with Panhard AML-90 armoured cars,Kassis, 30 Years of Military Vehicles in Lebanon (2003), p. 7.Zaloga, Tank battles of the Mid-East Wars (2) (1998), p. 52.

The Brigade also fielded a logistics battalion, equipped with US M151A2 jeeps, Land-Rover long wheelbase series III, Chevrolet C20 and Dodge Ram (1st generation) pickups and US M35A2 2¬Ω-ton military trucks. Headquartered at the Sayyad Roundabout Barracks in the Hazmiyeh district of east Beirut, the brigade was initially commanded by Colonel Mounir Merhi, replaced in 1984 by Col. Ghassan Ged, a Greek Orthodox.Hokayem, L'arm√©e libanaise pendant la guerre: un instrument du pouvoir du pr√©sident de la R√©publique (1975-1985) (2012), p. 100. In 1985 he was replaced by Col.

During the Battle for west Beirut on February 6, 1984, the 91st Infantry Battalion and the 94th Armoured Battalion under the command of Colonel Sami Rihana reinforced the other Lebanese Army units deployed in the western sector of the city fighting the anti-Government Muslim militias. Placed at the disposal of the Seventh Brigade's Command, these two battalions were positioned between the Port district and the Sodeco Square in the Nasra (Nazareth) neighbourhood of the Achrafieh district of east Beirut.Hokayem, L'arm√©e libanaise pendant la guerre: un instrument du pouvoir du pr√©sident de la R√©publique (1975-1985) (2012), p. 87. The post-Chouf years 1984-1990 Regarded as being totally loyal to General Michel Aoun's interim military government, the majority of the brigade's battalions ‚Äì except one (92nd), deployed at the Port district ‚Äì were placed along the Hazmiyeh sector of the Green Line, where they fought successfully the Lebanese Forces (LF) militia faction led by Elie Hobeika during his failed coup attempt to seize control of east Beirut on January 16, 1986.Collelo, Lebanon: a country study (1989), p. 223.Barak, The Lebanese Army ‚Äì A National institution in a divided society (2009), pp. 115; 139. The Brigade battled again the LF in February 1990, this time at the Badaro-Furn esh Shebbak sector during the Elimination War. =The post-civil war years 1990-present= Upon the end of the war in October 1990, the 9th Brigade was re-integrated into the structure of the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF).

Vaird (August 4, 1952 ‚Äì January 2, 1996) was a Philadelphia Police officer who was shot dead by rapper Christopher Roney aka \\"Cool C\\" during a botched armed bank robbery in January 1996. Roney attempted to rob the bank with fellow rapper Warren McGlone aka \\"Steady B\\", and another man, Mark Canty. During the robbery, Vaird was mortally wounded in the abdomen by a gunshot wound, and died soon after. Vaird was Philadelphia's first female police officer to be shot and killed in the line of duty. Background Lauretha A. Vaird was a single mother of two boys. Before she became a police officer, she worked as a teacher's aid at Pickett Middle School in Germantown. She first joined the Philadelphia police force in 1986 at the age of 34. Before her death, she was a 9-year veteran with the 25th District. Murder On January 2, 1996, around 8:20 a.m., Philadelphia rappers Christopher Roney aka \\"Cool C\\" and Warren McGlone aka \\"Steady B\\", and their accomplice, Mark Canty, attempted to rob a PNC Bank branch in Feltonville, at 4710 Rising Sun Avenue, in Philadelphia‚Äôs Feltonville section. The men had stolen a green minivan for the job which was driven by McGlone who acted as the getaway driver. Roney and Canty went into the branch before it was due to open. Canty carried a 9 millimeter semi-automatic handgun and Roney was armed with a .38 caliber revolver. The bank had no security guards, which influenced the men to rob that particular branch. The duo held three bank employees at gunpoint and demanded access to the bank vault. Within moments of entering the bank, the silent alarm was tripped. Officer Lauretha Vaird, who was in the area at the time and riding solo in a patrol car, responded to the bank's silent alarm. Canty forced two of the bank employees to take him to the vault while Roney stood guard by the bank entrance covering the third employee. As Vaird entered the door to the bank with her weapon drawn, she was shot in the abdomen by Roney. Vaird was wearing a bulletproof vest, but it was without its bullet- resistant panels. After he shot Vaird, Roney exited the bank through the front door. Canty fled the bank through a side entrance and left his gun at the scene. Roney then exchanged fire with another police officer, Donald Patterson, who arrived shortly after Vaird. Roney was able to escape and dropped his gun on the sidewalk outside the entrance to the bank. He got into the minivan with McGlone and the two men then fled the scene. None of the three suspects stole anything from the bank. Vaird was taken to St. Christopher's Hospital for Children, where she succumbed to her gunshot wound. She was pronounced dead at 9:56 AM. having been killed by the single shot to the abdomen. Aftermath The two pistols used by the assailants were found separately outside different entrances to the bank. Roney and Canty had dropped them while fleeing the scene. The stolen minivan Roney and McGlone had escaped in was found abandoned about a mile from the bank. The police also found various items of clothing used as disguises by Canty and Roney. This evidence led to their warrants and arrests. The guns were traced back to both Canty and McGlone. The .38 caliber revolver used by Roney belonged to Anthony Brown, a relative of Canty. The gun had been stolen from Brown and was last seen in Canty's possession prior to the bank robbery. The 9mm semi-automatic pistol was traced back to Richelle Parker, a friend of McGlone, who had bought the gun for him. McGlone was arrested outside his home two days later on January 4, 1996. He was charged with murder in the death of officer Vaird. After questioning McGlone, police issued a warrant for the arrests of Canty and Roney. Canty was arrested during a traffic stop in Maryland at a later date. Roney surrendered to the police on January 6, 1996. Vaird died at the age of 43 and is buried at Ivy Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Trial and conviction On October 30, 1996, McGlone and Canty were both sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole. McGlone is currently an inmate at the State Correctional Institution ‚Äì Houtzdale and his inmate ID number is DD6864. Canty is currently an inmate at the State Correctional Institution ‚Äì Mahanoy and his inmate ID number is DD6842. Roney was identified as the actual killer of Vaird, as he had been the one to fire the gun that killed her. On October 30, 1996, Roney was found guilty of first- degree murder, three counts of robbery, conspiracy, aggravated assault, burglary and possession of an instrument of crime. On November 1, 1996, he received the death penalty for murdering Vaird. He is currently on death row awaiting execution and is an inmate at the State Correctional Institution ‚Äì Greene.

Venda Defence Force =Origin= The Venda National Force was established with Venda‚Äôs independence in 1979 and included defence and other services such as police and prisons. Strange enough, traffic policing was part of this national force, but by 1981 it was transferred to the Department of Justice. The Fire Brigade was however still part of the Venda National Force although there was plans to transfer this to the civilian government. Development of the VDF Colonel Gabriel Ramushwana was appointed the Chairman of the Council and Minister of Defence and National Intelligence was second in command as well as the Venda Security Police before being transferred to the VDF as Chief of Staff by State President Mphephu with the aim of his eventual succession as Chief of the VDF. 112 Battalion and One Venda Battalion The VDF itself was formally separated from the National Force on the 27 September 1982 when the SADF‚Äôs 112 Battalion from Madimbo, part of the Soutpansberg Military Area, which was outside the Venda territory, was disbanded and re-established to form One Venda Battalion at Manenu. At that stage this battalion consisted of three companies and was to all purposes a light infantry battalion. SADF 112 battalion emblem Two Venda Battalion Two Venda Battalion was established around 1985/86 and was initially housed in temporary quarters until 1986/1987.

Until that date the Chief of the VDF was a seconded SADF officer, Brigadier Steenkamp, with Ramushwana as his Chief of Staff. State President Ravele was the Commander in Chief and was advised by a Security Council. =Aftermath= After the coup, Ramushwana became Chief of the VDF as well as the Chairman of the Council of National Unity. A Security Working Committee was established to replace the Security Council. The SEWOCOM consisted of: *Ramushwana, now a Brigadier, as chairman, *the Chief of Staff of the VDF, a Colonel W.

Wildman & Co. Tobacco Warehouse is a historic commercial/industrial building at 34 Bridge Street (United States Route 202) in New Milford, Connecticut. Built in 1870, it is the oldest of the surviving tobacco warehouses in the town, which was a major tobacco processing center in the region. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. The building has most recently served as a hotel. Description and history The Wildman Tobacco Warehouse is a 2-1/2 story frame structure standing on the south side of Bridge Street in central New Milford, between Middle Street and the tracks of the Housatonic Railroad. It is long (), with three sections. The front two, a total of sixteen bays long, were built on site, while the rear four bays are an originally separate warehouse that was moved to the site in 1901. This rear section is an extremely rare example of a rural packing barn. The building has a five-bay facade, with a single-story shed-roof porch across its width, and the entrance at the center. The warehouse's front section was built in 1870, the early period in the region's development as a tobacco growing area. By World War I, New Milford was a major producer of cigar wrapping tobacco leaf, and supported twelve packing and warehousing operations. The Wildman Warehouse was one of the first to be built by a commercial packer, where earlier leaf packing operations had typically been run by farmers. Edward Wildman was a native of Brookfield, who served as agent to a major tobacco firm based in New York City. His warehouse was expanded in 1874, and again in 1901 after a surge in production. The building remained in use for tobacco production until about 1950.

Some pieces are porcelain, others described as glazed \\"porcelaneous ware\\" or \\"pottery\\".  History  Black-glazed bowl and cover, \\"porcelaneous ware\\", 1840 Awaji ware was founded in the early 1830s by Minpei Kashu (1796‚Äì1871) (last name also spelled Mimpei) from Iga village. Coming from a wealthy trading family, he was a scholar of classical literature and skillful in the art of chanoyu. He became concerned about the development of industrial resources in his province and devoted himself to the manufacture of ceramics, which he had studied under Ogata Shuhei (1788-1839), a famous Kyoto potter. Returning to his village after his studies, he established kilns in the fifth year of Tenp≈ç (1835/1836) and devoted his whole fortune to his enterprises. Some sources give an earlier founding year of 1831. Lord Hachisuka of Awaji Province subsequently subsidized Minpei's manufactory and appointed him head of the workshops. Thus his efforts were successful, and his manufactory reached a prosperity such that its production equaled in value the rice harvest of the eleven surrounding villages. After Minpei's death in the second year of Bunky≈´ (1862) his successors continued manufacturing ceramics, which became a source of wealth for the province. The Metropolitan Museum of Art has nine pieces of Minpei ware in its permanent collection.  Characteristics  Awaji ware pieces are of a white or cream-colored clay and a blue or yellow glaze, sometimes also green, sharing similarities with sancai colours. There are pieces skillfully imitating Annan ware's articles and blue and white or blue- decorated porcelains.  References   Further reading  * Andsley, George and Bowes, James. Ceramic Art of Japan.

He is a Member of the Jockey Club, and has sat on various committees including the British Horseracing Authorities Security and Investigations Committee. In 1973 Blacker finished fourth on Spanish Steps in the first Grand National won by Red Rum. In 1977 Blacker finished seventh on Happy Ranger to Red Rum, winning his third and final Grand National. Blacker said that 1982 was \\"my one big chance to win the race\\". However, Blacker had taken a ride at Ludlow the day before the Grand National where he fell and broke his arm. In his absence, Royal Mail was ridden by another jockey and the horse fell at Becher's Brook fence. \\"That horse needed a rider that knew him and on that day he didn't\\", commented Blacker afterwards, describing the event as \\"one of the biggest regrets of my life\\". Amongst the 340 races won by Blacker were the: 1981 Welsh Champion Hurdle (Pollardstown), 1980 Aintree Hurdle (Pollardstown), 1980 Whitbread Gold Cup (Royal Mail), and two races at the 1979 Cheltenham Festival; the Stayers' Hurdle (Lighter) and the Triumph Hurdle (Pollardstown). = Sculptor = Blacker is considered as \\"one of the most important names\\" in 20th century sporting art by Stella A.

It has two distinct varieties, one inhabiting taiga habitats and one inhabiting tundra. These are recognised as separate species by the American Ornithologists' Union and the IOC (taiga bean goose and tundra bean goose), but are considered a single species by other authorities, such as the British Ornithologists' Union. It is migratory and winters further south in Europe and Asia.  Description  The length ranges from , wingspan from and weight from . In the nominate subspecies, males average and females average . The bill is black at the base and tip, with an orange band across the middle; the legs and feet are also bright orange. The upper wing-coverts are dark brown, as in the white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons) and the lesser white-fronted goose (A. erythropus), but differing from these in having narrow white fringes to the feathers. The voice is a loud honking, higher pitched in the smaller subspecies. The closely related pink-footed goose (A. brachyrhynchus) has the bill short, bright pink in the middle, and the feet also pink, the upper wing- coverts being nearly of the same bluish-grey as in the greylag goose. In size and bill structure, it is very similar to Anser fabalis rossicus, and in the past was often treated as a sixth subspecies of bean goose.  Taxonomy  The English and scientific names of the bean goose come from its habit in the past of grazing in bean field stubbles in winter. Anser is the Latin for \\"goose\\", and fabalis is derived from the Latin faba, a broad bean. Taiga bean goose (Anser fabalis sensu stricto) on background, tundra bean goose (Anser serrirostris) on foreground and greylag goose (Anser anser) on the right, at Spaarndam, Noord-Holland, the Netherlands A flock of tundra bean geese There are five subspecies, with complex variation in body size and bill size and pattern; generally, size increases from north to south and from west to east. Some ornithologists (including AOU 2007) split them into two species based on breeding habitat, whether in forest bogs in the subarctic taiga, or on the arctic tundra. The taiga and tundra bean goose diverged about 2.5 million years ago and established secondary contact ca. 60,000 years ago, resulting in extensive gene flow. ;Taiga bean goose (Anser fabalis sensu stricto) (Latham, 1787) * A. f. fabalis (Latham, 1787).

He was involved in the development of aircraft and gun-turret hydraulic systems. Early life Frise was born in Bristol, Gloucestershire, an area which is now known as South Gloucestershire. He was educated at Bristol Grammar School and gained a BSc degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Bristol. Early in First World War he served in the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS). Boulton Paul Aircraft In 1915 he started Boulton Paul Aircraft's first aircraft factory at Mousehold Heath, Norwich to make 100 Sopwith Camels. The company was previously a general manufacturing firm that had begun in 1873. Bristol Aeroplane Company In August 1915, Frank Barnwell rejoined Bristol Aeroplane Company and was looking for an assistant. He interviewed Leslie Frise and employed him in 1916; Frank Barnwell would become one of Bristol's main aircraft designers until his death on 2 August 1938 in an aviation accident. With Barnwell he developed the 1916 Bristol F.2 Fighter. Frise aileron He invented the Frise aileron, also known as the slotted aileron, in 1921, which is designed to counteract adverse yaw, which won him the Royal Aeronautical Society's Wakefield Gold Medal (for advances in aviation safety) awarded on 30 May 1933. The Frise aileron has an effect on parasitic drag so that the total drag on both wings is the same when an aircraft executes a roll. In 1934 he developed, with Frank Barnwell, the Bristol Type 143, a monoplane with retractable undercarriage; only one prototype was made. In 1936, when Barnwell became chief engineer, Frise became chief designer. He worked for 32 years for Bristol retiring, as chief engineer, in 1946 on grounds of ill health.\\"Mr Frise resigns\\" Flight 11 April 1946 p258 Percival Aircraft Frise joined Percival Aircraft in 1948 as technical director and chief engineer.

Both shows had regularly aired head-to-head against one another during their peak in popularity in the mid-1990s. Soon after ITV officially confirmed that Gladiators would end, the recently launched digital terrestrial platform ONdigital, co-owned by ITV's two largest regional companies Carlton Television and Granada Television, persuaded LWT (itself owned by Granada) to produce a final mini-series in order to give the show a proper send-off. Gladiators: The Supreme Champion was commissioned by ONdigital for ITV, and all four episodes aired exclusively on the digital terrestrial provider over the Bank Holiday weekend as a back-to- back triple bill on 29 May 1999 and repeated over the next two days on 30 and 31 May before it was then transmitted nationally on the ITV network during Christmas 1999.

Plot  Cheryl (Alexandra Paul) lives with her abusive husband Kurt (Michael Riley) in a small house at Canada. One night, Kurt returns after having accidentally murdered a man while out. Cheryl flees in a car with her baby daughter Emily (Annie Bovaird). Ten years later, Cheryl is living with her new husband Gregory (Bruce Boxleitner). Emily does not know the existence or identity of her biological father. On her tenth birthday, she relapses into leukemia and is hospitalised. A small sample of body tissue is needed to save her from an otherwise certain death; however, Cheryl is found to be incompatible with the required transplant. After much hesitation, she decides to contact Kurt. Cheryl locates Kurt's new house after some searching. She is greeted by his girlfriend, who mistakes her for an investor in Kurt's new bar across town. Kurt, she finds out, is now in serious debt from failed investments, and his bar is struggling to stay afloat. Kurt first refuses to help after the anger of meeting a belligerent and hostile Gregory. Kurt later breaks into Cheryl's house, and admits that he is agreeing to help, in exchange for $600,000 from Cheryl. Additionally, she must not involve Gregory. He demands Cheryl's wedding ring as a \\"deposit\\". Afterwards, he is shown giving the ring to criminal loan shark Russo, in attempt to buy more time before the debt is due to be paid. Russo turns down the offer, saying \\"[his] wife already has enough diamonds\\". Naturally, Gregory is furious when he realises he has been left out proceedings, and that her wife had been blackmailed. He has no choice but to cooperate, helping collect $300,000. They cannot make any more loans from the bank until they have paid off their current loans, meaning they cannot reach $600,000. Kurt is desperate, and even more so when Cheryl visits one day to find his girlfriend's bloodied corpse. Kurt flees to her home, explaining that Russo is close on his heels, and had killed his girlfriend as an urgent warning. Cheryl visits her estranged Uncle Theo, a rich man, hoping to borrow the remaining $300,000. He scolds her for her foolishness in being blackmailed, and points out that because she ignored his advice when he first warned her about marrying Kurt, he has no obligation to pay her for her mistake. The dialogue which ensues reveals that Cheryl wants to save Kurt, as much as Emily. Kurt, meantime, makes friends with Emily (who only knows him as a benefactor). He deceives Emily into believing that her mother has been involved in an accident. He kidnaps her under the guise of taking her to see her mother, and goes to their old, now abandoned house. Cheryl correctly guesses their whereabouts and confronts him. Gregory secretly rescues Emily through a window. The confrontation between Cheryl and Kurt is disrupted when Russo and his henchman arrive. He comments on Kurt's changing relationships with women, and says that he no longer intends to wait for the debt to be paid. His henchman shoots at Cheryl, but Kurt leaps in the way and takes the bullet for her. Russo is taken aback. As his henchman reloads, Kurt pulls out a hidden gun and kills both of them. At hospital, a dying Kurt calls for Cheryl and tells her that \\"[he] gave Emily what she needed\\", and returns her ring. An epilogue shows Cheryl and Gregory waving to Emily from their home, who has now fully recovered.

Although most now speak Spanish, Runashimi or Kichwa, a Quechua dialect, is also spoken and language revitalization efforts are being implemented. Likewise, the Saraguro have retained much of their land, customs and traditional dress. According to the INEC's 2010 population census, the total population of Saraguro canton is 30,183, but that total includes both the Indigenous and non-Indigenous people living in Saraguro. The Saraguro may be the descendants of people re-settled from distant regions in the Inca Empire in the 15th and early 16th century. Origins thumbrightA Saraguro woman wearing a traditional dress. In the 1460s the Inca empire conquered the Saraguro area. The pre-Inca people may have been the barely-known Palta or the Ca√±ari. The ancestors of the modern- day Saraguro people, according to oral traditions, were moved to Saraguro by the Incas from other areas, possibly the Colla or other people from the Lake Titicaca and Cuzco regions. The Incas had a policy of forcibly moving people from one region of the empire to another, thereby diversifying the population and dispersing possible opposition to their rule. The resettlement policy was called mitma. The numbers resettled were large, estimated to be up to 80 percent of the population of some provinces.Ogburn, Dennis J. (nd), \\"Incas Past and Present: Archaeology and the Indigenous Saraguros of Southern Ecuador\\", Stanford Journal of Archaeology, https://web.stanford.edu/dept/archaeology/journal/07Ogburn.pdf, accessed 24 Mar 2017 One Spanish document says that the ancestors of present-day Saraguros were elite soldiers in the Inca army. This statement is bolstered by the fact that the Saraguros live along the Inca road or Kapak √ëan that stretched from Cuzco to Tumebamba (the northern capital of the Incas), and onward to Quito and thus occupied an important link for Inca communications and control of the empire. The town of Saraguro, however, seems to have been founded by the Spanish rather than the Incas although a number of Inca ruins are in the nearby area.Belote, Jim and Belote, Linda (2004), \\"The Incas in the Saraguro Region\\", http://www.saraguro.org/archinka.htm, accessed 24 Mar 2017; Ogburn (nd), pp. 141-143 Whatever the facts about their origins. Saraguro in the 20th century celebrate their Inca heritage. In a debunked theory, some authors ascribe the black clothing typical of the Saraguro as a sign of mourning for the death of the Inca Emperor Atahualpa. Schools have been named after Inca emperors, Inca customs recreated, Inca architecture copied, and efforts made to preserve the Kichwa language.Ogburn (nd), pp. 142-149 Historical records and oral traditions also attribute the traditional black and white colors of their clothing to ceremony and nobility, which were the meanings given by the Incas according to chronicler Cieza de Le√≥n and recounted by the Saraguro. Being descendants of the elite soldiers of the Inca army, they retained that symbolism as well as the male population retained their long-braided hair, which was another marker of nobility among the Incas. Black as a sign of mourning is not part of the Inca symbolism nor among the Saraguros but has been adopted, especially by the young generations. Likewise, they attribute the symbolic concepts of their clothing to a representation of the Curiquingue (carunculated caracara), which has black and white feathers and was a symbolic bird of the Inca royalty. The Curiquingue inhabits the Saraguro parish and p√°ramos and its symbols represented in costumes continue to be present in the Kapak Raymi (the Great Celebration) celebrations in Saraguro. Carunculated Caracara The Saraguros have retained control over their lands more successfully than many of the Andean subjects of Spanish colonization and contemporary colonialism of the independent country of Ecuador. Part of this may be due to their initial hostility to the Spanish and the Indigenous people who collaborated with them. More importantly, however, the Saraguros were required by the Spanish to maintain an important tambo (inn or way-station) along a major communication route. They successfully argued that the operation and maintenance of the tambo required that they retain their land and its resources. They continued to manage the tambo until the 1940s when a motor road reached the area.Belote, Jim and Belote, Linda S.

Music Young Saraguro musicians break from tradition not only to index their aspirations to do something with their lives other than what tradition and stereotypes dictate for them, but also to index their real opportunities to do so as Saraguros. With greater participation in formal education and increased occupational diversity and mobility, young, cosmopolitan Saraguro musicians in the southern highlands of Ecuador are working to reconstitute their Saraguro Kichwa identity in a creative and selective process by which they discard, amplify, and reinvent the aspects of what they perceive to be authentic Saraguro musical culture. They also have found other ways of expressing themselves that are compatible with their self-identification as Indigenous and do not strictly rely on ties to an Inkaic past, or even to a particular expression of Indigeneity. Rather, the tastes and ambitions of many Saraguro youth point to an alternative conceptualization of Saraguro identity that is both firmly rooted in the \\"modern\\" and respectful of a long tradition of Indigeneity. A large number of (primarily male) Saraguro youth affiliate themselves with a subculture of heavy metal music. They listen to nation and international metal bands.

Oghuz tried to invade them but couldn't succeed, so he had to retreat to a small island. Dog-headed men A huge part of Oghuz Khagan Narratives was about \\"invasions on dog-headed men\\". Turks called them \\"Itbaraks\\". \\"It\\" means \\"dog\\" and \\"Barak\\" means a dark, shaggy dog species. When Oghuz Khagan's invasion on Itbaraks failed and he retreated to a small island, one of his dead soldiers' widow wife(could be a beautiful Itbarak woman) gave birth. Oghuz Khagan and his people had no home or tent. So the woman had to birth his child in a hollow. Oghuz named this child \\"Kƒ±p√ßak (Kipchak)\\", meaning \\"hollow\\" in Old Turkic. When Oghuz Khagan had invaded Itbarak lands after 17 years, he gave the lands to Kƒ±p√ßak to rule. Year after years, Kƒ±p√ßak's lineage has believed to become the old Turkic tribe Kipchaks. Oghuz Khagan Narratives The text about Itbaraks in the Narratives: :\\"Barak\\", that's what the Turks called the shaggy dog. :That's how they named the big noble dog. :The Barak is told in the sagas. :It was believed to be other dogs ancestor. :This dog was noble, and enormously big. :Hunting and shepherd dogs was his sons. :In the Northwestern Asia, there was Itbarak. :Turks were far away from them in the Middle Asia. :They had body of a man, head of a dog. :Their color was dark, like the Black Devil. :Their women was pretty and didn't run away from the Turks. :They were medicated, you couldn't spear them. :The saga said Oghuz Khagan was defeated. :He tried to recover on the island he retreated. :After seventeen years, Oghuz defeated them. :Women helped him, and the war has ended. :Oghuz gave this territory to \\"Kƒ±p√ßak-Beg\\" :So Turks called the area \\"Kƒ±p√ßak\\". Similarities to other mythologies Stories about \\"Dog-headed men\\" can be found on European, Indian, Chinese Greek and other mythologies.

Early life and education Livingston was born in Cowichan, Vancouver Island, Canada. He was the son of Clermont Livingston (1850‚Äì1907) and his second wife Mary Ann n√©e Jarvis (1854‚Äì1935). He went to the United Kingdom after the death of his father and gained his Bachelor of Medicine at Jesus College, Cambridge, where he also gained a rowing blue in 1914.

The TPD aims to improve the functioning of the internal market for tobacco and related products, while ensuring a high level of health protection for European citizens. Based on the proposal of the European Commission the Directive entered into force on 19 May 2014 and became applicable in the EU Member States on 20 May 2016. This Directive applies to the manufacture, presentation, and sale of tobacco related products including cigarettes, roll your own tobacco, pipe tobacco, cigars, cigarillos, smokeless tobacco, electronic cigarettes, and herbal products for smoking. To address this situation, the European Union and its Member States have taken various tobacco control measures in the form of legislation, recommendations and information campaigns. Targeting the improvement for function of the internal market for tobacco and related products. The following rules govern the aspects of tobacco sales and requires the tobacco industry to submit detailed reports to the Member States with the ingredients used in tobacco products (includes the health warnings appear on packages of tobacco and related products). The health warnings have to be accurately stated on 65% of the product packaging. This involves the front and back of cigarette and roll-your-own tobacco packages and small containers for certain tobacco products. This directive bans all promotional or misleading sectors on tobacco products, while introducing EU-wide tracking and tracing to prevent illegal trade of tobacco products; allowing Member States to prohibit internet sales of tobacco related products. Setting out the safety and quality requirements for a consumer of electronic cigarettes and compels manufacturers to request literal tobacco products before placing them on the EU market. As an overview, the policies for the Tobacco Products Directive are; the regulation of tobacco products on the EU market (e.g. packaging, labelling, and ingredients), advertising restrictions for tobacco products, the creation of smoke-free environments, tax measures and activities against illegal trade, and acquiring anti-smoking campaigns.  New requirements The enactment and implementation of the new directive will work to restrict the capacity of e-cigarette refill tanks to no more than 2ml and a maximum volume of e-liquids containing nicotine for sale for one refill container to 10ml. The nicotine strength of e-liquids to no more than 20 mg/ml and require products containing nicotine and their packaging to be tamper proof and resistant to child tampering. The new regulation prohibited the use of certain ingredients that included taurine, colourings, and caffeine, the mandatory use of new labelling and health warning signs on the packaging. The new regulations require that the sale of all e-liquids and e-cigarettes should be done after notifying the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for the case of the United Kingdom (UK). The TPD was implemented in the UK through the Tobacco and Related Products Regulations 2016 act that also defined producers of e-cigarettes. The definition described e-cigarette producers as any entity that manufactures, imports, or re-brands any tobacco related products for resale. In accordance with the new regulations, producers are required to provide the relevant authorities with all pertinent information regarding their products to the MHRA.  Enforcement and cooperation The new directive was cognizant of the fact that its success was pegged on the co-operation of all member states that were party to its implementation in their various jurisdictions and pertinent to their internal provisions and laws. All member states were required to ensure that all producers and importers of tobacco and their related products to provide correct information to the pertinent authorities within the provided timelines. The obligation to provide such information was placed primarily on manufacturers and importers of all tobacco and their related products to the relevant authorities. Member states were required to ensure that tobacco and their related products complied with the new directives, failure to which the relevant authorities are empowered to take the appropriate course of action to prevent their entry into the market. The new directive made it the responsibility of member states to formulate and enforce appropriate penalties for the infringement of national and EU provisions and their enforcement. The administration of financial penalties was to be imposed for intentional infringement aimed at accruing financial advantage to the involved entity. The directive required that all member states co-operate with each other to promote the correct application and enforcement of all provisions of the directive in a manner characterised by the sharing of information necessary for its uniform implementation.  Industry response The initial response to the directive by e-liquid manufacturers was to invest heavily in the testing of their range of products in order to achieve directive compliance. This proved costly due to: # The demand for testing increased significantly in the lead up to the implementation date, leading to cost inflation for basic e-liquid compliance testing as the supply of laboratories was limited and was not pre-emptive to the electronic cigarette market. # The directive required each variation of the relevant nicotine containing e-liquid to also undergo compliance testing. For example, where the relevant e-liquid was to be available in 20 mg and 10 mg, two compliance tests would need to be conducted for each particular nicotine strength. If there were also non-nicotine variations, such as in the vegetable glycerol and propylene glycol ratio, further tests would have to be conducted for each additional ratio at each corresponding nicotine strength. Alongside the already inflated price of testing due to the sudden increased demand, batch compliance testing proved costly and the industry sought to attain compliance by another less expensive route. In 2014 Ernst & Young reported that over 73% of the consumer market used e-liquid at 1‚Äì11 mg nicotine strength. With this vast consumer trend towards lower strength nicotine e-liquids, and as the directive only concerns itself with nicotine containing e-liquids as opposed to flavourings and other ingredients, it became clear that dilution of a small quantity of highly concentrated nicotine that would only have to be tested once at the maximum nicotine strength was a viable and more cost-effective route to directive compliance. In essence, dilution involved the creation of a flavourless nicotine-containing e-liquid at a maximum or close to maximum nicotine strength, such as 20 mg, in the maximum capacity bottle size of 10ml to be mixed with a larger bottle of flavoured 0 mg e-liquid in order to create an overall e-liquid concentration that was aligned with the most used nicotine strength. For example, upon mixing 10ml of 18 mg nicotine with a 50ml bottle containing the relevant flavourings, a user can achieve 60ml of e-liquid with an overall nicotine strength of 3 mg. These small 10ml nicotine bottles containing highly concentrated nicotine have become known as ‚Äònicotine shots‚Äô, and the market has adapted to now recognise this method as the norm.

He was born in Vinnytsia, in the Podolia Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Ukraine), to a family of Russian-Jewish Traders. Vail spent his childhood in Odessa, where he graduated at Grekov Odessa Art school, later enrolling at the Imperial Academy of Arts, St.Petersburg. Vail began painting studies (life- drawing, sketching and anatomy) at the age of 17\\\\. Leonid Isaakovich Vail in Zurich Studio c.1917It was during his student years in St.Petersburg that he witnessed the events of the 1905 Bloody Sunday Massacre. According to his manuscripts this had a profound effect on his work, ‚ÄòArt in its current form only serves to empower the higher classes, we must look elsewhere if we are to create an art that is our own‚Äô. Vail spent the pre-war years between Germany and Russia, teaching at the Munich Academy of Fine Arts and eventually emigrating to Zurich in order to flee rising political tensions. A strong and vocal proponent of the anti-war movement, Vail remained a pacifist his entire life, frequently contributing articles and essays to Russian periodicals, including the communist affiliated Pravda, decrying what he considered an abhorrent misuse of power from all sides. In Zurich, 1916, Vail attended the inaugural Cabaret Voltaire, where he met the likeminded Dadaists, producing a series of absurdist collages with Tristan Tzara and Sophie Taeuber. Vail‚Äôs most politically significant meeting of the time, however, was his passing acquaintance and correspondence with Lenin who often frequented the Zurich Library where Vail would write. After WWI, Vail lived in France until he was exiled in 1927 for political dissension, at which point all known records and correspondence cease in what was erroneously reported as a political assassination. He was found dead in Mexico City circa 1945, he died of natural causes.

The complementary cylinder is a purely mechanical design and is able to read the internal bittings of the key. If the code is matching, the user is then able to turn the cylinder and open the lock. History The Stealth key concept originated as the response to an important physical security breach: unauthorized key duplication by 3D printing. With 3D printers and 3D scanners reaching the consumer market in early 2010 the key copy and patent protection of most security keys was made obsolete. Many amateur users were reported duplicating security keys and several companies offering key duplication services using smartphone images began commercial operation In essence mostly any object can be 3D printed, the core point is if the mechanical code of the key can be 3D scanned or photographed, with code concealing being one of the most secure ways to protect it. Additive manufacturing of keys Unlike most ordinary keys which were produced by key blank stamping and subsequent hole drilling, the Stealth key is a mechanical key made by additive manufacturing (3D metal printed). It was a major disruption to the key manufacturing status quo and took full advantage of the novel manufacturing process, i.e. complex internal features and a batch size of one (each single key in the printed batch is unique).

Biography During her youth, she studied religious writers like Saint Teresa de Jesus, Fray Luis de Leon and Fray Luis de Granada. When she was about twenty years old, she published in the newspapers of Palma her first compositions written in Spanish, and in 1855 she gave to the stamp a chosen collection of religious rhymes. She then began writing with a group that published the magazine El Plantel, where she met Miquel Amer, with whom she would marry and move to Barcelona in 1859, since the husband was named administrator of the Northern Railway. She had his support, although she expressed in her poetry the sadness caused by the death of her younger children. Amer's participation in the foundation and maintenance of the Barcelona Floral Games facilitated Victoria's participation in poetic contests. She obtained an award in 1859 with \\"Anyoran√ßa\\" (\\"Yearning\\") and was still awarded several times: 1865 for \\"Amor de mare\\" (\\"Motherly love\\"), 1873 for \\"Una visita a ma p√†tria\\" (\\"A visit to my homeland\\"), 1880 for \\"Joventut perduda\\" (\\"Lost youth\\") and 1883 for \\"Lo meu niu\\" (\\"My nest\\").

It was the residence of the family of Ferdinand Marcos when he was the President of the Philippines. History  The residence was built by the Philippine Tourism Authority (PTA; now the Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority or TIEZA) in 1977 for Marcos's 60th birthday, and served as an official residence for the president's family when they were staying in Ilocos Norte. It is a two-story mansion overlooking the Paoay Lake, and consists of seven (supposedly a lucky number for Marcos) rooms, with each room having a theme of historical events from the Marcos era: Study, Agriculture, Diplomacy, OFW (overseas Filipino workers), Culture, Nation Building and Family. While being administered by TIEZA, Cecile Licad played a Fr√©d√©ric Chopin program at the property in 2001. Usage of the property was turned over by the former president Benigno Aquino III to the Ilocos Norte provincial government in 2010. Governor Imee Marcos, Ferdinand Marcos's daughter, then had the property refurbished to be one of the province's tourist attractions. Eric Zerrudo, of the University of Santo Tomas Center for Conservation of Cultural Property and Environment in the Tropics, was commissioned to put together the exhibits in every room, with each room centering on a theme of Marcos's public programs. The Sandiganbayan anti-graft court stripped the Marcoses of the property in 2014, after it voided a 1978 agreement between Marcos and the then PTA, deciding that since it is a national park, Marcos had no legal rights over it since national parks are \\"inalienable public domain\\", despite claims by Bongbong Marcos, the son of the former president, that the property was owned by their family.

The H√¥tel de Brucelles in Toulouse, France, is a gothic and Renaissance h√¥tel particulier (palace) of the 16th century. It is a listed historical monument since 1925. H√¥tel d'Arnaud de Brucelles History The Hotel de Brucelles is located at 19 rue des Changes, in the historic center of Toulouse and was built circa 1544 for the capitoul Arnaud de Brucelles. Description Situated at the heart of the merchant quarter, H√¥tel de Brucelles was built in 1544 by the cloth merchant Arnaud de Brucelles (elected capitoul in 1534-1535) on a very small plot overlooking Rue des Changes. Restricted by the dimensions of the site, he expressed his ambitions upwards by building a very high polygonal staircase tower and a brick turret, both adorned with stone sculptures. Entry to the site was gained through the tower, the latter giving access to the house at the back of the courtyard and, through three superimposed galleries, the building on the street. To augment the luxury of his home, Arnaud de Brucelles commissioned several stone windows, each featuring small columns, in accordance with the new fashion instigated in Toulouse by one of its most prominent citizens, Jean de Bagis. The spaces above the entrance to the staircase tower and each of the six windows feature the sculpted bust of a man or woman dressed in classical attire (breastplate, toga) or the fashion of the sixteenth century. For the owner, choosing mythological or allegorical figures was a good way to express their virtue and social success. The capitals of the columns surrounding each window take up the superposition of classical architectural orders: Doric, Ionic, Corinthian. To the left of the tower, the balusters adorning the superimposed galleries (not originally walled) are also Corinthian, Ionic and Doric.

The experiment is located in the underground laboratory of Gran Sasso, LNGS-INFN, near the town L'Aquila in Italy. It is run by an international collaboration of researchers from Austria, Italy, France and Romania. The sources for funding include the INFN (Italy), the Austrian Science Fund and the John Templeton Foundation (JTF). Within the JTF project, also the implications for physics, cosmology and philosophy are being investigated. Principle of the experiment The different approaches to investigate the Pauli exclusion principle need to be distinguished concerning their possible fulfillment of the Messiah‚ÄìGreenberg superselection rule. This rule states that the symmetry of the wave function of a steady state is constant in time. As a consequence, the symmetry of a quantum state can only change if a particle, which is new to the system, interacts with the state. One way to fulfill this rule and test the Pauli exclusion principle with high precision is to introduce \\"new\\" electrons in a conductor. The electrons form new quantum states with the atoms in the conductor. These \\"new\\" states could violate the Pauli exclusion principle. The aim of VIP2 is to search for new quantum states, which have a symmetric component in an otherwise antisymmetric state. These non-Paulian states can be identified by the characteristic X-rays emitted during Pauli exclusion principle‚Äîprohibited atomic transitions to the ground state. An example for a transition of this kind would be a third electron arriving on the 1s level. The emitted X-rays are detected by silicon drift detectors. Comparison of normal (left) and non-Paulian (right) atomic 2p to 1s transitions. The energies of the transitions between Pauli-forbidden states were calculated using a multi-configuration Dirac‚ÄìFock method and they differ slightly from the corresponding normal transition. For example the Pauli-forbidden K-alpha transition in copper, which is used in VIP2, where 2 electrons are in the 1s orbital before the transition happens, is shifted by 300 eV to lower energies with respect to the normal transition. VIP2 runs at LNGS, where the background radiation introduced by cosmic rays is strongly reduced. Data are taken in alternating runs without current (background) and in runs with current (signal). By analysing the detected energy spectra in the region where Pauli exclusion principle violating transitions are expected, upper limits on the probability for a violation of the Pauli exclusion principle are obtained. Results VIP collaboration group picture at the experiment site at LNGS in November 2015. The experiment is taking data in stable conditions since summer 2016 in the Gran Sasso underground laboratory. With the data taken until the end of 2016, a preliminary upper limit can be set for the probability that the Pauli exclusion principle is violated in an atom of :p(\\\\text{violation}) < 1.4 \\\\times 10^{-29}. The data taking will go on for the next 3‚Äì4 years until around 2020‚Äì2021, at the end of which the limit on the Pauli exclusion principle violation will be lowered by another 2 orders of magnitude, or alternatively, a violation of the Pauli exclusion principle will be discovered.

According to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs in 2019, the population of the Singaporean diaspora stands at 340,751 and according to official statistics from the Singaporean government, 217,200 of Singaporeans overseas retained their citizenship. Majority of the Singaporean diaspora are located in Malaysia, Australia, United Kingdom and United States.  Overview  Most Singaporeans abroad are expatriates accompanied by their families as professionals are sought after in various industries in regions such as China, India, the Middle East, Malaysia, Vietnam and Indonesia, as they are bilingual and highly skilled. Other reasons for living aboard includes students seeking to study in overseas universities or Singaporeans that settled in the home countries of their foreign spouses. Population of the Singaporean diaspora was at 156,468 in 1990, with the United Kingdom having the largest community of Singaporeans at 33,320 and the second largest in Malaysia, with a population of 31,269. In 2000, the population of the diaspora increased to 192,989, which was a 23.3% increase since 1990. In the same year, the number of Singaporeans in Malaysia increased to 44,779 individuals, surpassing the community in the United Kingdom, which had a population of 39,131. From 2000 to 2015, the number of Singaporeans moving aboard increased to 314,281 individuals. By 2019, there were 340,751 overseas Singaporeans, with 123,551 individuals holding other nationalities. Although more Singaporeans are moving aboard, there was only an average of 1,200 Singaporeans renouncing their citizenship annually, according to official government statistics. In recent years, however, more Singaporean students living aboard have plans to return to Singapore after completing their studies as countries such as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States introduced stricter policies on working visas and immigration. According to a 2016 survey conducted by the Institute of Policy Studies, 48.5% of Singaporeans aged between 19 and 30 stated that they could achieve the goals they have without migrating and 42.6% \\"preferred to improve\\" their socio-economic wellbeing without migrating. = Reasons for emigration = According to a 2014 survey conducted by Singapore Polytechnic, some of the top reasons why Singaporeans would want to leave the country were \\"the high costs of living, having more opportunities overseas for work and education and a slower pace of life\\". Other factors includes different lifestyles, such as having access to more recreational activities in other countries.

Henry Dexter (1806‚Äì1876) was a prominent American sculptor in the 19th century. Life and career Born in Nelson, New York he was apprenticed to a blacksmith shortly after his father's death when his family moved to Connecticut. Dexter taught himself to paint, but was aided in the process by artist Francis Alexander who was his wife's uncle. He moved to Boston in 1836 and opened his own portrait studio. 2 years later he began to sculpt famous people, starting with the Reverend Dr. Anderson. Dexter was completely self-taught and did not seek to study the European or classical Greek styles of his compatriots, for this reason he is considered among the first true American sculptors. Henry Dexter sculpted over 200 busts in plaster and marble between the years of 1838 and 1875. Some of his most famous sculptures are his portraits of Charles Dickens and President James Buchanan. His depiction of President Buchanan was later used to model his U.S. postage stamp which was part of a series depicting the presidents of the United States. =Portrait gallery= Henry Dexter was a patriot who hoped to create a gallery of sculptural works depicting the president of the United States and the governors of every US state in the late 1850s on the cusp of the Civil War. He hoped to achieve a unifying official portrait of this period in America's history. This initiative was self-funded at its conception, utilizing his own moneys Dexter traveled some 20,000 miles with all of his tools for modeling and casting. His initial plan was to model each governor in clay and later plaster and with the hope that individual states would then purchase marble renderings post facto for the sum of $500, thus helping him recuperate his costs. This gigantic undertaking began in 1859 as Dexter first traveled to every state in New England having governors of each state sit for him and sending the modeled clay busts back to his workshop in Boston. He then began to work his way along the Mason-Dixon line and finally across the South. He returned to the North to model the recently deceased Governor William Henry Bissell of Illinois before heading to Wisconsin and presumably Minnesota, Michigan and Indiana between the months of April - June 1860. It is likely that Dexter was in Indiana in late April or early May given a letter of introductory correspondence between Michigan Governor Moses Wisner to Governor Willard dated April 25, 1860. (Governor Willard died in October 1860). This expedition resulted in thirty one finished busts which were intended to be displayed in the Capitol building in Washington, D.C. However, due to the volatility bred by the recent secession of the Southern states, the totality of the collection was not able to be displayed. By his own admission this endeavor was a failure financially, it left him impoverished for years after his eighteen months of travel across the country. However, historically Dexter's renderings of some of the prominent gubernatorial figures of the United States became a study of many of the most powerful men who were key players in the Civil War. Far from being aware of the long term historical significance of his work Dexter hoped only to accomplish a unifying collection of the nation's administrators. After his death June 23, 1876, the bulk of his collection of governors was donated to the Smithsonian Institution in 1889. Some of the busts remain with private owners or in the collections of some of the states who purchased copies for their own collections.

Douglas County School Dist. RE‚Äì1, 580 U.S. _ (2017), was a United States Supreme Court case that held that the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\\"IDEA\\"), et seq. required schools to provide students an education that is \\"reasonably calculated to enable a child to make progress appropriate in light of the child‚Äôs circumstances.\\", slip. op. at 11. In a unanimous opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Court vacated the judgment of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. The central issue in the case was about \\"the level of educational benefit school districts must provide students with disabilities as defined by IDEA. The Supreme Court held that the proper standard under the IDEA \\"is markedly more demanding than the 'merely more than de minimis' test applied by the Tenth Circuit.\\"Endrew F., slip op. at 14, 16. The Court added that meaningful, \\"appropriately ambitious\\" progress goes further than what the lower courts had held.The Supreme Court Rules In Favor Of A Special Education Student NPR News, Retrieved March 24, 2017 The Court, however, rejected a stricter equal access or equal opportunity standard for a free and appropriate education proposed by the plaintiff. The case was described by advocates as \\"the most significant special-education issue to reach the high court in three decades.\\" Case background In 2010, Endrew, who was in Grade 5 at the time at Summit View Elementary school in Douglas County School District RE-1 in Colorado, began to exhibit \\"severe behavioral issues.\\" The parents removed their child from Summit View and enrolled him in a specialized school for children with autism, Firefly Autism in Denver, with an annual tuition of $70,000. The family requested reimbursement for the Firefly tuition claiming the Douglas County School District had not fulfilled the requirements of IDEA. On May 15, 2016, they lost their case before the United States District Court for the District of Colorado with circuit judges Harris Hartz, Timothy Tymkovich, and Gregory A. Phillips presiding. Their argument was that \\"the federal statute only requires that schools provide students with \\"some educational benefit.\\"\\" In an amicus brief submitted by the Office of the Solicitor General, the Supreme Court was urged to take the case stating that the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals \\" had set the bar ‚Äî a standard of \\"merely ‚Ä¶ more than de minimis\\" educational benefit ‚Äî too low.\\" Supreme Court takes the case In September 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court announced that it would hear the \\"potentially groundbreaking case\\" brought by a \\"Douglas County couple who claim that their autistic son was not provided an adequate education in the public school system as required by federal law.\\" Access to public education through IDEA was affirmed in 1982 in Board of Education v. Rowley, but the quality of guaranteed education for students with disabilities under IDEA had not been addressed. This Supreme Court case has the potential to \\"affect the education of 6.7 million children with disabilities\\" as the Court \\"struggles \\"to decide whether it should require public schools to do more under a federal law that calls for them to provide a free education that addresses the children's needs.\\" In the Solicitor General's Amicus brief, the Supreme Court was advised that \\"Resolving the conflict among the circuits will ensure that millions of children with disabilities receive a consistent level of education, while providing parents and educators much-needed guidance regarding their rights and obligations.\\" On November 21, 2016, 118 lawmakers filed a bicameral amicus brief supporting the rights of students with disabilities to receive a \\"meaningful\\" public education. Since August 2016, National Education Association (NEA), the United States' largest trade union, former officials of the U.S. Department of Education, the National Disability Rights Network, the National Education Association, the Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, the National Center for Special Education in Charter Schools, and others have \\"submitted amicus briefs in support of the child.\\" Supreme court argument Supreme Court Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Samuel A. Alito Jr., and Anthony M. Kennedy expressed concerns about the implications of implementing IDEA with changes in quality of education standards. Breyer cautioned about potential rising costs of litigation, for example, extraneous lawsuits. Kennedy questioned the financial cost to districts with severely disabled students; Alito considered the burden on poorer school districts. Not all of the eleven circuit courts have considered the issue of standards and in those that have, only two set \\"meaningful educational benefit\\" standard. The Supreme Court will decide whether a uniform standard should apply nationally. Alito expressed frustration with the \\"blizzard of words\\" produced in the last thirty years of appeals courts hearings which offered different views on standards. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg cited the Board of Education v. Rowley (1982) in which the Court held that public schools were \\"not required by law to provide sign language interpreters to deaf students who are otherwise receiving an equal and adequate education.\\" The lawyer for the parents, Jeffrey L. Fisher, claimed that schools should provide \\"substantially equal educational opportunities\\" and in most cases, the costs involve \\"things like providing Braille textbooks, providing an iPad, providing some specialized instruction by a staff member who's already on staff...[T]here are going to be some extreme cases....[IDEA] does not permit cost to trump what the act otherwise requires. Schools should provide \\"a level of educational services designed to allow the child to progress from grade to grade in the general curriculum.\\" See also * List of United States Supreme Court cases * Lists of United States Supreme Court cases by volume * List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Roberts Court References External links * United States Supreme Court cases United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court United States disability case law 2017 in United States case law Public education in the United States Education in Douglas County, Colorado ","title":"Endrew F. v.

The Lady Garden Foundation (previously the Gynaecological Cancer Fund) was formed in 2014 in the United Kingdom. It is a national women's health charity which aims to raise awareness and funds for research into, and treatment of, gynaecological cancers. The foundation was started by a group of high-profile women, all of whom had been affected by gynaecological cancer in some capacity. Among these women are Jenny Halpern Prince, Tamara Beckwith Veroni, Chloe Delevingne, Astrid Harbord, Kate Percival, Josephine Daniel, Mika Simmons and Bridget Barker. It notably launched the Lady Garden Campaign on social media during Gynaecological Cancer Awareness Month in September 2015. Amber Le Bon, Jazzy De Lisser and Anais Gallagher were the faces of the campaign, with many other celebrities endorsing the charity and its Lady Garden Campaign. In 2016, Topshop partnered with the Lady Garden Foundation to sell merchandise to promote the charity and its campaigns. Most notably Cara Delevingne was the face of this campaign. In 2017, the Lady Garden Foundation partnered with Selfridge's to sell t-shirts designed by Simeon Farrar in collaboration with Naomi Campbell, the Delevingne sisters, Suki Waterhouse and Charlotte Tilbury. Background The Lady Garden Foundation (previously the Gynaecological Cancer Fund) was launched in 2014 in order to raise funds and awareness of a number of gynaecological cancers. Many of the cancers, such as cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, womb (uterial) cancer, vaginal cancer and vulval cancer, have high death rates in developed countries, due to a lack of understanding and treatments. The charity has also created a number of fashionable items, such as hoodies, which have appeared in Hello! and Vanity Fair. Dr. Susana Banerjee at The Royal Marsden Hospital is one of the main beneficiaries of the funds raised by the charity. Her treatment is aimed at targeted treatment for women with gynaecological cancers. The original mission of the charity was to raise ¬£750,000 for Dr Banerjee over three years. This was achieved in early 2018 and the foundation now funds various research projects at The Royal Marsden. Shortly after its establishment, the Lady Garden Foundation held a number of notable fundraising events to raise money for the cause. The events began in 2015, when they hosted a lunch for gynaecological cancer charities at Fortnum & Mason in London. In April 2016, the campaign held its first Lady Garden 5k, which took place in Battersea Park, London. Since 2015 onwards, various fashion icons and companies have designed accessories and clothing to promote the Fund and its campaigns. It notably signed an agreement with the retailer Topshop to sell Lady Garden hoodies during Gynaecological Cancer Awareness Month. In early 2017, Marloe London also designed a scarf for the Gynaecological Cancer Fund. The charity then partnered with Selfridge's in 2017, and more recently, Stripe & Stare in November 2018. Lady Garden Campaign The Lady Garden Campaign was started by the charity as a social media campaign to raise awareness for numerous cancers. It also wanted to promote screening and also funding for the treatment of gynaecological cancers. Since 2015, the campaign has coordinated its promotional efforts around Gynaecological Cancer Awareness Month, which takes place in Britain every September. The social media campaign was started after research suggested that over a third of women were too embarrassed to go to the doctor with gynaecological concerns in the United Kingdom. The campaign was launched in 2015, to raise awareness and funds for the treatment of gynaecological cancer. It was launched in conjunction with Gynaecological Cancer Awareness Month in September. As soon as the social media campaign was launched, it saw huge celebrity endorsements online, from the likes of Ellie Goulding, Margot Robbie, Alexa Chung and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley on social media. The media suggested that the campaign went viral in the summer of 2015, reaching more than 40 million people on social media within 24 hours. After the campaign's launch in 2015, the Lady Garden Foundation carried out research to measure the impact of the cancer awareness campaign. They discovered that 81 percent of women exposed to the campaign were more aware of gynaecological health, while 59 percent were more aware of the symptoms of gynaecological cancers.

Public‚Äìprivate partnerships are commonly known for being used for infrastructure projects related to healthcare, transportation, the environment, justice & correction, recreation & culture, and education. The history of P3 projects in Canada can be understood in two waves: the first wave (1990‚Äì2000) and the second wave (2000‚Äìpresent). Since its Canadian origins, over 220 projects have been facilitated. The first and most commonly known examples of P3 projects are Highway 407 in Ontario, The Royal Ottawa Hospital, and the Confederation Bridge linking New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. The original rationale of P3s was to provide cities with top quality infrastructure without creating more direct public sector debt; they allowed for governments to make off-balance-sheet investments in infrastructure. Advocates argue that P3s make use of the expertise and innovation of the private sector and the incentive of capital market to enhance public projects. They argue P3s provide better value for money than traditional methods of procurement because they transfer a project's risk from the public to the private sector. Indeed, under P3s, financial responsibility for projects can either be shared, or put upon the private sector. PPP Canada is a crown corporation developed by the government, with the duty of contracting out several services to the private sector, as well as provide funding on both federal and provincial levels. P3s in Canada have received notable criticism from scholars, stakeholders, and the media. Complaints revolved around the issues of accountability, higher costs, loss of democratic control over public services and the user fee rates of some projects. Discrepancies between steering and rowing, level of public interest, labour relations, autonomy and accountability, and savings and performance are often topics of P3 debates. Critics question how some the conflicting values and operations of the independent public and private sector effect the ability to achieve desired goals efficiently. The most common debate is how the goal of economic gain in public sector values interacts with the public sector value of public good. Evidence in favor of P3s and against P3s are available.  Definition  There is no consensus about how to define a PPP.Marta Marsilio, M., Cappellaro, G and Cuccurullo, C. (2011), The Intellectual Structure Of Research Into PPPs, Public Management Review, Vol 13 (6), pp.763‚Äì782 The term can cover hundreds of different types of long-term contracts with a wide range of risk allocations, funding arrangements, and transparency requirements. The Canadian Council for Public-Private Partnerships, a longstanding promoter for P3s in Canada, defines them as \\"a cooperative venture between the public and private sectors, built on the expertise of each partner, that best meets clearly defined public needs through the appropriate allocation of resources, risks, and rewards\\". According to Simon Fraser University professor Aidan R. Vining, \\"a P3 typically involves a private entity financing, constructing, or managing a project in return for a promised stream of payments directly from government or indirectly from users over the projected life of the project or some other specified period of time\\". York University scholar Daniel Cohn defines P3s as \\"instruments for meeting the obligations of the state that are transformed so as to involve private property ownership as a key element in the operation of that instrument.\\" The Ontario Hospital Association describes P3s as \\"a relationship structured between a government entity and a private entity whereby the private entity assumes a defined level of responsibility for the provision and/or operation of a facility or service which has previously been the sole responsibility of government\\". =Privatization?= There is a semantic debate pertaining to whether P3s constitute privatization or not. Some argue that it isn't \\"privatization\\" because the government retains ownership of the facility and remains responsible for public service delivery. Others argue that they exist on a continuum of privatization; P3s being a more limited form of privatization than the outright sale of public assets, but more extensive than simply contracting-out government services. Supporters of P3s, such as former finance minister Jim Flaherty, generally take the position that P3s do not constitute privatization, while P3 opponents argue that they are. The Canadian Union of Public Employees, a major institutional opponent of P3s, describes them as \\"privatization by stealth\\".  History  Starting in the 1990s, there has been over two hundred and twenty P3 projects that have been initiated in Canada. The provinces that started and have used P3s the most include Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta, and Quebec. = First Wave = The P3 projects can be categorized by breaking them up into sections; wave one and wave two of P3s. The first wave of P3s in Canada were initiated and launched between the 1990s and early 2000s. The most notable projects from this time include the Highway 407 in the Greater Toronto Area, the Royal Ottawa Hospital in Ontario, the Brampton Civic Hospital in Ontario, and the Confederation Bridge linking Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick. The development of a significant number of schools in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick were also under the P3 BOOT model. At the end of the first wave, a lot of the new P3 projects included water treatment plants and municipal sport complexes across Canada. The outcomes of first wave as a whole did not meet the public interest and was scrutinized by several groups including scholars, stakeholders, the media, and auditors. Several complaints revolved around topics such as complex concessions, lack of transparency and accountability, and high private cost of capital. = Second Wave = The Second wave of P3s can be categorized between the early 2000s till present day. The heavy scrutiny of the first wave of P3s lead to shaping this wave with a higher importance on meeting expectations and making P3s more politically acceptable with main stakeholder groups (especially the public). The main argument used in the second phase to promote P3s in Canada is that they provide better value for money that a traditional government procurement project. In 2002, British Columbia created the ‚ÄúCapital Asset Management‚Äù policy, with a framework that was adopted by other provincial governments, and spread across the country. The framework can be simply be stated as \\"P3 first\\" policies where the government should always consider using P3s for infrastructure projects when the cost reaches a specific threshold. It also states that a special PPP agencies should be created to advocate as well as deliver PPP projects in Canada. The provincial governments lead the P3 initiative in the second wave, using it to initiate projects such as healthcare facilities, justice facilities, roads, and bridges. In 2009, Stephen Harper initiated the commitment of the federal government to P3 infrastructure by creating a crown corporation (PPP Canada Inc.). PPP Canada wishes to invest in public infrastructure though P3s to contribute to long-term economic benefits, and maximum value to appeal to public interest. This corporation also has a ‚ÄúP3 Canada fund‚Äù where provinces, territories, and municipalities can apply for funding from the federal government. Since then, P3 projects have been more commonly used in areas such as Local road Infrastructure, public transit infrastructure and wastewater infrastructure. P3s have also been recently used in projects such as Brownfield Redevelopment Infrastructure, Core National Highway system infrastructure, Green Energy Infrastructure, regional and local airport infrastructure, water infrastructure, and solid waste management infrastructure. In 2014, the Government of Alberta cancelled plans to construct an additional 19 P3 schools, after discorevering they would cost $14 million more than regular schools. = Trudeau Era = Justin Trudeau is in favor of Public-private partnerships. However, during his premiership, the federal government removed the P3 screen as a condition for federal funding for infrastructure project in order speed up funding approvals for .strategic and trade-enabling\\" projects. This does not mean that infrastructure projects cannot be funded by P3s; it only means that projects don't have to consider the P3 route. In 2017, the government of Canada created the Canada Infrastructure Bank, a federal Crown Corporation tasked with financially supporting revenue-generating infrastructure projects that are in the public interest through public-private partnerships. In 2018, the government of Canada dissolved PPP Canada. Minister of Infrastructure and Communities Amarjeet Sohi justified this decision by claiming that it had achieved its mandate of making P3s common practice across Canada, and was no longer needed.  Types  There are several subcategories that P3s can be grouped into. The forms of P3s in Canada include: build‚Äìoperate‚Äìtransfer (BOOT), company-owned- government-operated (COGO), and government-owned-company-operated (GOCO). = Common public-private partnership models = While in practice there are many types or models of PPPs, the following is a non-exhaustive list of some of the most common designs in Canada: * Operation & Maintenance Contract (O & M): A private economic agent, under a government contract, operates a publicly-owned asset for a specific period of time. Formal, ownership of the asset remains with the public entity. In terms of private-sector risk and involvement, this model is on the lower end of the spectrum for both involvement and risk.The Canadian Council for Public-Private Partnerships, \\"Definitions & Models\\", https://www.pppcouncil.ca/web/P3_Knowledge_Centre/About_P3s/Definitions_Models.aspx * Build-Finance Model: The private actor builds the asset and finances the cost during the construction period, afterwards the responsibility is handed over to the public entity. In terms of private-sector risk and involvement, this model is again on the lower end of the spectrum for both measures. * Design-Build-Finance-Maintain Model: \\"The private sector designs, builds and finances an asset and provides hard facility management (hard fm) or maintenance services under a long-term agreement.\\" This model is in the middle of the spectrum for private sector risk and involvement. * Design-Build- Finance-Maintain-Operate (DBFMO): In this model, the private partner is responsible for the entire project ranging from design to construction, operation and maintenance of the infrastructure, including fundraising.The European Court of Auditors (2018), \\"Special Report: Public Private Partnerships in the EU: Widespread shortcomings and limited benefits\\", https://www.eca.europa.eu/Lists/ECADocuments/SR18_09/SR_PPP_EN.pdf This model is in the higher end for private sector risk and involvement. * Concession: \\"A private sector concessionaire undertakes investments and operates the facility for a fixed period of time after which the ownership reverts back to the public sector.\\" In terms of private sector risk and involvement, this model is very high risk and high involvement.  Major P3 projects  = Ontario Highway 407 = Highway 407 shield in Oshawa The Ontario Highway 407 is a tolled 400-series highway that spans the entire Greater Toronto Area (GTA) in Ontario. When the Ontario government started planning the project, their normal process for highway construction was not possible given the financial constraints of the recession of the early 1990s. The Peterson government sought out public-private partnerships. Two firms bid on the project, with the Canadian Highways International Corporation being selected as the operator of the highway. Financing for the highway was to be paid by user tolls lasting 35 years, after which it would return to the provincial system as a toll-free 400-series highway. The Highways was then privatized by Premier Mike Harris in the year leading up to the 1999 provincial elections. The highway was leased to a conglomerate of private companies called 407 International Inc., which was initially owned by the Spanish multinational Cintra Infraestructuras (43.23%), as well as various subsidiaries of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (40%) and the Montreal-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin (16.77%). The deal included a 99-year lease agreement with unlimited control over the highway and its tolls, dependent on traffic volume; however, the government maintains the right to build a transport system within the highway right-of-way. It is today described as a \\"value generating monster\\" and \\"cash cow\\" for SNC-Lavalin, and one of the \\"worst financial missteps\\" from any government in Ontario's history. Although the original plan was for the tolls to end after the construction cost was paid off, probably after about 35 years; there is no indication that the private owners will eliminate the tolls. Although Premier Mike Harris promised that tolls would not rise by more than 30 percent, they have risen by over 200 percent by 2015, from about 10 cents to over 30 cents per kilometre.Another criticism is that, a part of the contractual agreement with the government, the MTO is required to deny licence plate validation stickers to drivers who have an outstanding 407 ETR bill over 125 days past due.The Highway 407 Act, Section 22 In 2002, just three years after the original sale for C$3.1 billion, Macquarie Infrastructure Group, an Australian investment firm, estimated that the highway was worth four times the original price. By 2019, the estimated value had risen to C$30 billion. Both the length of the lease, and the fact that the road is controlled by private corporations, mean that decisions about the road and the tolls are less accountable to the public. The Harris government failed to put any restrictions on toll increases (as long as the road attracted a certain volume of cars). As a result, commuters in the densely-populated Toronto area will have no protection against ever-rising tolls on this key highway during the entire 99-year span of the lease. The public has accused the 407 ETR of predatory billing practices, including false billing and continued plate denial after bankruptcy. In 2016, after a 4-year legal battle, consumers won an $8 million class action lawsuit. = Schools = In the 1990s, the cash- strapped governments of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick decided to use P3s to finance the construction of new much-needed schools for the province, including 39 in Nova Scotia. These governments were ideologically inclined to support expanding the private sector. P3s also allowed them to pay for these schools \\"off-balance-sheet\\", as the private sector would initially finance the project while he public sector would pay for it every year through the operation phase. This allowed these governments to avoid counting these projects immediately in their public debts and made them look more fiscally responsible. However, Auditor General reports from the end of the decade revealed that these funding arrangements made the projects more expensive overall, and barred future governments of using such accounting fallacies to fund infrastructure projects. On top of being more expensive for taxpayers, P3 school projects had significant negative consequences. Contractors cutting corners lead to leaky roofs and unusable sports fields. Community needs were not incorporated into school designs, and community groups were charged exorbitant fees to rent the facilities after hours. In Halifax, P3 school facilities were 10x the rate of public school facilities. School grass and walls were designated as private assets, and artworks could not be hanged on school walls without the approval of the owners. The owners would also demand a share of the proceeds from fundraising events on school property. Similar issues were found in Alberta P3 schools build in the 2000s, forcing the government to cancel the development of an additional 19 P3 schools in 2014. = Brampton Civic Hospital and Ottawa Royal Hospital = Royal Ottawa Hospital The Royal Ottawa Hospital (re-opened 2006) and the Brampton Civic Hospital (opened 2007) are some of Canada's first public hospitals to be designed, built, financed, and maintained under a private-public partnership. The were built by a joint venture of Carillion and EllisDon.New hospital one step closer to opening Brampton Guardian, 3 July 2007 The Brampton Civic Hospital is one of Canada's first public hospitals to be designed, built, financed, and maintained under a private-public partnership. The Government of Ontario decided to built them and to fund them through P3s in November 2001. These projects were \\"highly politicized, offered poor value for money, and came in much later and at a higher price than originally promised\\". Public service unions and public healthcare advocates contested these projects from the start, their fight culminating in a 2003 judgement that saw the courts decide to uphold the government's decision to fund these projects by a P3. This was followed by another 4-year legal to force the government to publish financial details of these P3 projects. The Supreme court ordered their release, but they came out heavily redacted.  P3 debate  PPPs have been highly controversial as funding tools, largely over concerns that public return on investment is lower than returns for the private funder. The lack of a shared understanding of what a PPP is and the secrecy surrounding their financial details makes the process of evaluating whether PPPs have been successful complex.Hodge, G.A. and Greve, C. (2016), On Public-Private Partnership Performance: A Contemporary Review, Public Works Management & Policy, pp. 1‚Äì24 The rationales that are provided to promote P3s have changed over the years, leading some to ask if P3s are ‚ÄúA policy in search of a rationale?‚Äù. P3 advocates come from an ideological background which holds that private sector firms working in market conditions are more efficient, innovative and better at allocating resources than government. Under this paradigm, P3s are a way to reduce the role of the state in infrastructure projects. The first wave of P3s was implemented in multiple sectors across different provinces with little federal coordination. The rationales used for each project, sectors and regions varies, but there has been four main arguments used to promote them. = Finding funds = First of all, there is the argument that P3s bring new money for infrastructure. By granting a concession to the private investor in an infrastructure project, they bring the funding required to complete the project in the first place, and get a return on investment when the structure is operational. These returns on investments can either come from user fees or government payments. Toll roads and bridges had been uncommon in Canada until the advent of P3s. Critics of P3s have also pointed out that, for projects where user fees cannot be charged, P3s do not alleviate financial pressures on governments. = Off- balance sheet accounting = A second rationale is that P3s enable off balance sheet accounting of infrastructure. They allow governments to continue investing in infrastructure without adding to the public dept. This practice has been seriously criticized by auditor generals as an accounting fallacy, as the costs of the projects must still be paid in full by the government, but with deferred payments. These schemes can misallocate the risk between partners or increase projects costs for governments in the long run. In the second wave, P3s were all crafted on-balance-sheet. = Decentralization = A third argument is that P3s restructure the provision of public service. They decentralize infrastructure planning away from elected officials and toward independent agencies and consultants. This has been touted as a negative by critics, who point out that overreliance on these consultants leads to a privatization of public policy development. P3 advocates, however, see the introduction of market forces in infrastructure planning in a positive light, which bring about more innovation and better risk management. Critics disagree that these goals are achieved, as there is little competition in the P3 marketplace. = Value for money = The final and nowadays most common rationale for P3s is that they provide better value for money than a public delivery method. \\"Value for money\\" does not mean that the project is of better quality or lower costs. According to its advocates, drivers of Value for money in P3s are \\"stimulating innovation during the project planning process, encouraging lifecycle asset management, and transferring construction and operations risk to the private sector\\". Of these, the transfer of risk is the most important driver of value-for-money in P3s. However, not all the risk of the project is transferred to the private sector; only the ones they can muster, as outlined in the contract. Auditor Generals of Quebec, Ontario and New Brunswick have publicly questioned P3 rationales based on a transfer of risk, the latter stating he was \\"unable to develop any substantive evidence supporting risk transfer decisions\\". Furthermore, many PPP concessions proved to be unstable and required to be renegotiated that favour the contractor.  Criticism  The main criticisms are associated with the associated costs of P3s. Indeed, there are systemic factors that increase the cost of P3s as opposed to a public option. These are the private sector's higher cost of capital, higher P3 transactions fees associated with longer and more complex contract negotiations, and the private sector's required return on investment, usually paid by the government. Researchers at the University of Toronto studied twenty-eight P3 projects developed in Ontario from 2002 to 2012, and found that \\"the base cost of delivering each project is invariably lower (on average 16% less) when delivered through a traditional procurement rather than a PPP\\". Another prominent criticism is the loss of accountability and transparency associated with P3s. P3s in Canada offer service delivery from an ‚Äúarm‚Äôs length‚Äù of the government for the more flexibility in different aspects of the service delivery process. The public sector has mechanisms to keep governmental actors accountable, but if something were to go wrong in a P3 project, accountability is blurred with actors between private and public entities. Most financial details of P3 projects are confidential and thus unavailable to the public. Some argue that the public interest can be hindered when the private sector is involved because of its profit driven goals. If the profit motive is not balanced with the public interest, too much emphasis is put on user responsiveness, and efforts are targeting the bottom line. Although these goals can benefit society, the government's effort to further public interest may not be achieved efficiently. Labour relations with regards to nature of the workforce and service delivery of P3s also have potential issues. Using the P3 model usually replaces long-term workers with contract workers. Using a temporary workforce can result in very little loyalty to the employer and reduce the number of public sector workers needed. Public sector unions such as the Canadian Union of Public Employees and some center-left political parties such as the NDP criticize that P3s negatively effects wages and conditions for public servants. They also criticize that the private sector side of P3s usually involves the participation of Multinational companies which can take away from the local contractors available.  P3 Units  To respond to critics of the over political and lack of expertise in negation of the public sector between P3 agreements, six of the ten provinces created PPP Units: government agencies or crown corporations responsible for promoting and facilitating P3s in their territory. These agencies are staffed with professionals specialized in areas such as law, consultancy, business management, accountancy and finance. The creation of PPP Canada, the federal government's P3 unit, furthers this rationale. PPP Canada explicitly outlines when P3s are the \\"right alternative\\" for certain projects. This crown corporation‚Äôs arguments for recommending P3s were that its benefits are greater than its costs through calculations of risk, expectation, and value for money analysis. PPP units in Canada have been criticized for being structured with a bias in favor of PPP, especially if Promoting PPPs as part of their mandate. As such, some of them have developed assessment methodologies that were biased in favor of P3s over a public delivery model. Quebec's PPP unit was dissolved in 2009 following an auditor general's report detailing how its assessment methodology was biased toward P3s. Partnerships BC operates more like a business than a government agency. As per example, they refer to other government agencies and ministries as its clients despite being a crown corporation and under the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance. Canada's P3 units are: * Partnerships BC (Province of British Columbia) (2002-present) * Agence des partenariats public-priv√© du Qu√©bec (Province of Quebec) (2004-2009) * Infrastructure Ontario (Provice of Ontario) (2005-Present) * PPP Canada (Federal) (2009-2018) * Saskbuilds (Provice of Saskatchewan) (2012-Present) A few other provinces have teams within their ministry responsible for public infrastructure dedicated to a similar role as these P3 units. PPP Canada's mandate was essentially transferred to the Canada Infrastructure Bank when it was created in 2017.  Private Partners  There are three kinds of public sector partners in Canadian P3s, building and engineering firms, maintenance service firms, and financiers. For the majority of P3 projects, EllisDon and/or SNC-Lavalin represent the building and engineering private partner firms. Operation and maintenance partners for P3 hospitals were most often the multinational corporations of Sodexo and Carillion. Local companies are rarely involved as partners in P3 projects. Financier Partners secure funding for P3s by offering loans to construction companies; they are creditors to the project. ¬´ Financiers can include wealthy individuals interested in infrasture, but they are most often insitutional investors like pension funds, life insurance companies, sovereign wealth and superannuation funds, and banks. ¬ª Public infrastructure is a relatively low- risk, high-reward investment, and as such P3 financing attract a lot of pensions funds, such as the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS) and the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan. OMERS came to own 65% stake in the Private partner responsible for Confederation Bridge. Wall Street firms and Banks around the world are investing in P3 projects in Canada, with Wall street being more interested in P3s since the 2008 financial crisis. The Dutch state-owned banked ABN Amro has financed many P3 projects in Canada. Canadian council for public-private partnerships The Canadian council for public-private partnerships is a pan-Canadian organization founded in 1993 to promote public-private partnerships. the organization self-describes as a member-driven organization, but its board contains representation from companies who directly benefit from their implementation, such as PricewaterhouseCoopers, Macquarie Group, Fengate, OMERS and EllisDon.  Political, economic, and societal influence  Usually Canadian political parties that support neo-liberalism as well as more of a decentralized government favor P3 initiatives as a service delivery. Political ideology is one of the main reasons this alternative service delivery was created. Some research has been done on how the increase use of P3s in Canada effects public policy. A common public policy concern is environmental legislation. There is research supporting that traditionally the private sector has always put profit over environmental factors, so the introduction of P3s may lead to less concern for environmentally friendly projects. Environmental initiative projects are sometimes not as profitable. There is also supporting evidence that shows climate action plans are not constrained by P3 initiatives because of the capacity of public sector leadership to engage in contractual agreements outlining environmental policy priorities. Despite the Financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08, which resulted in a decline of P3s worldwide, P3s have continued to be promoted and expanded in Canada, making it an exception. Other policies relating to the political economy restrict some of the freedom that may be necessary to improve on the social benefits of the P3 model. Consumers are paying for these projects either through taxes or through user fees. P3s continue to be a subject of controversy and debate in Canadian politics. There has been pressure in the past put on governments by users to ‚Äúbuy out‚Äù the P3 operators, while at the same time, non-user taxpayers have paid no attention to P3 predicaments. The P3 model is intertwined with issues surrounding politics, privatization, financial, and social welfare issues. 2013 Regina Referendum on Wastewater Plant Funding Sign at the entrance of the Regina Wastewater Treatment Plant A city-wide referendum on a new waste water treatment facility was held in Regina, Saskatchewan on September 25th 2013. The issue of the referendum was whether the facility would be financed through a design-bid-build (DBB) approach or through a Public-private partnership (P3). The \\"Yes\\" side was directed by the citizens' group Regina Water Watch, while the \\"No\\" campaign was ran by the City of Regina and was led by Regina Mayor Michael Fougere. The \\"Yes\\" campaign received assistance from the Canadian Union of Public Employees. They published the report \\"Flushing money away: Why the Privatization of Wastewater Treatment Plant is a bad idea\\", which estimates that a P3 funding scheme would cost the city $61 million more than a DBB. The \\"No\\" side received assistance from the Regina Chamber of Commerce and federal finance minister Jim Flaherty, who expressed support for the goal of the campaign in an op-ed entitled \\"Why I‚Äôm giving Regina $58.5 million\\", in reference to his government's promise of funding part of the costs of the plant if the P3 option was selected. The result was 57% against the DBB approach, and the treatment plant ended up being financed by a P3.

Blum's version of coin flipping answers the following cryptographic problem: :Alice and Bob are recently divorced, living in two separate cities, and want to decide who gets to keep the car. To decide, Alice wants to flip a coin over the telephone. However, Bob is concerned that if he were to tell Alice heads, she would flip the coin and automatically tell him that he lost. Thus, the problem with Alice and Bob is that they do not trust each other; the only resource they have is the telephone communication channel, and there is not a third party available to read the coin. Therefore, Alice and Bob must be either truthful and agree on a value or be convinced that the other is cheating. In 1984, quantum cryptography emerged from a paper written by Charles H. Bennett and Giles Brassard. In this paper, the two introduced the idea of using quantum mechanics to enhance previous cryptographic protocols such as coin flipping. Since then, many researchers have applied quantum mechanics to cryptography as they have proven theoretically to be more secure than classical cryptography, however, demonstrating these protocols in practical systems is difficult to accomplish. As published in 2014, a group of scientists at the Laboratory for Communication and Processing of Information (LTCI) in Paris have implemented quantum coin flipping protocols experimentally. The researchers have reported that the protocol performs better than a classical system over a suitable distance for a metropolitan area optical network. Coin flipping protocol Quantum coin flipping is when random qubits are generated between two players that do not trust each other because both of them want to win the coin toss, which could lead them to cheat in a variety of ways. The essence of coin flipping occurs when the two players issue a sequence of instructions over a communication channel that then eventually results in an output. A basic quantum coin flipping protocol involves two people: Alice and Bob.Anna Pappa et al., \\"Experimental Plug and Play Quantum Coin Flipping\\", Nature Communications, April 24, 2014 # Alice sends Bob a set number of Œö photon pulses in the quantum states \\\\phi_{\\\\alpha_ic_i}\\\\rangle. Each of these photon pulses is independently prepared following a random choice by Alice of basis Œ±i and bit ci where i = 1, 2, 3...Œö. # Bob then measures the pulses from Alice by identifying a random basis Œ≤i. Bob records these photons and then reports back the first successfully measured photon j to Alice along with a random bit b. # Alice reveals the basis and bit that she used at the basis Bob gave her. If the two bases and bits match, then both parties are truthful and can exchange information. If the bit reported by Bob is different than that of Alice's, one is not being truthful. Alice decides her random basis and sequence of qubits. She then sends the qubits as photons to Bob via the quantum channel. Bob detects these qubits and records his results in a table. Based on the table, Bob makes his guess to Alice on what basis she used. A more general explanation of the above protocol is as follows:Charles H. Bennett and Giles Brassard, \\"Quantum cryptography: Public key distribution and coin tossing\\", Theoretical Computer Science, December 4, 2014 # Alice first chooses a random basis (such as diagonally) and a sequence of random qubits. Alice then encodes her chosen qubits as a sequence of photons following the chosen basis. She then sends these qubits as a train of polarized photons to Bob through the communication channel. # Bob chooses a sequence of reading bases randomly for each individual photon. He then reads the photons and records the results in two tables. One table is of the rectilinear (horizontal or vertical) received photons and one of the diagonally received photons. Bob may have holes in his tables due to losses in his detectors or in the transmission channels. Based on this table, Bob makes a guess as to which basis Alice used and announces his guess to Alice. If he guessed correctly, he wins and if not, he loses. # Alice reports whether he won or not by announcing what basis she used to Bob. Alice then confirms the information by sending Bob her entire original qubit sequence that she used in step 1. # Bob compares Alice's sequence with his tables to confirm that no cheating occurred on Alice's part. The tables should correspond to Alice's basis and there should be no correlation with the other table. = Assumptions = There are a few assumptions that must be made for this protocol to work properly. The first is that Alice can create each state independent of Bob, and with an equal probability. Second, for the first bit that Bob successfully measures, his basis and bit are both random and completely independent of Alice. The last assumption, is that when Bob measures a state, he has a uniform probability to measure each state, and no state is easier to be detected than others. This last assumption is especially important because if Alice were aware of Bob's inability to measure certain states, she could use that to her advantage. =Cheating= The key issue with coin flipping is that it occurs between two distrustful parties. These two parties are communicating through the communication channel some distance from each other and they have to agree on a winner or loser with each having a 50 percent chance of winning. However, since they are distrustful of one another, cheating is likely to occur. Cheating can occur in a number of ways such as claiming they lost some of the message when they do not like the result or increasing the average number of photons contained in each of the pulses. For Bob to cheat, he would have to be able to guess Alice's basis with a probability greater than ¬Ω. In order to accomplish this, Bob would have to be able to determine a train of photons randomly polarized in one basis from a train of photons polarized in another basis. Alice, on the other hand, could cheat in a couple of different ways, but she has to be careful because Bob could easily detect it. When Bob sends a correct guess to Alice, she could convince Bob that her photons are actually polarized the opposite of Bob's correct guess. Alice could also send Bob a different original sequence than she actually used in order to beat Bob. =Detecting a third-party= Single photons are used to pass the information from one player to the other (qubits). In this protocol, the information is encoded in the single photons with polarization directions of 0, 45, 90, and 135 degrees, non-orthogonal quantum states. When a third party attempts to read or gain information on the transmission, they alter the photon's polarization in a random way that is likely detected by the two players because it does not match the pattern exchanged between the two legitimate users. Implementation =Experimental= As mentioned in the history section, scientists at the LTCI in Paris have experimentally carried out a quantum coin flipping protocol. Previous protocols called for a single photon source or an entangled source to be secure. However, these sources are why it is difficult for quantum coin flipping to be implemented. Instead, the researchers at LTCI used the effects of quantum superposition rather than a single photon source, which they claim makes implementation easier with the standard photon sources available. The researchers used the Clavis2 platform developed by IdQuantique for their protocol, but needed to modify the Clavis2 system in order for it to work for the coin flipping protocol. The experimental setup they used with the Clavis2 system, involves a two-way approach. Light pulsed at 1550 nanometres is sent from Bob to Alice. Alice then uses a phase modulator to encrypt the information. After encryption, she then uses a Faraday mirror to reflect and attenuate the pulses at her chosen level and sends them back to Bob. Using two high quality single photon detectors, Bob chooses a measurement basis in his phase modulator to detect the pulses from Alice. They replaced the detectors on Bob's side because of the low detection efficiencies of the previous detectors. When they replaced the detectors, they were able to show a quantum advantage on a channel for over . A couple of other challenges the group faced was reprogramming the system because photon source attenuation was high and performing system analyses to identify losses and errors in system components. With these corrections, the scientists were capable of implementing a coin flipping protocol by introducing a small honest abort probability, the probability that two honest participants cannot obtain a coin flip at the end of the protocol, but at a short communication distance.  Classical Analogy  = Classical Coin Flip = In 2012, a pair of physicists in the US claimed that all classical probabilities can be collapsed into quantum probabilities. They concluded that fluid interactions on a microscopic scale can amplify minute quantum fluctuations, which can then propagate to macroscopic scales.Albrecht, Andreas, and Daniel Phillips. ‚ÄúOrigin of Probabilities and Their Application to the Multiverse.‚Äù Physical Review D, vol. 90, no. 12, 2014, doi:10.1103/physrevd.90.123514. In essence, something that seems probabilistically simple (e.g. a coin toss) actually relies on a cascading series of processes with a nearly exponentially growing level of uncertainty. So any time someone flips a coin they are, in some capacity, performing a Schr√∂dinger's cat experiment where the coin can be considered simultaneously both heads and tails.

It would have imposed a two-year moratorium on development projects seeking variances from some aspects of the city's zoning code, made changes to the environmental impact statement requirements in the code, and required the city to update its comprehensive plan during the moratorium. The measure failed, with over two-thirds of those who voted on it voting against it. Proponents said it was necessary to curb high-density development that would have adversely affected the city's suburban character and favored gentrification at the expense of affordable housing. They also charged that city government had been corrupted, citing recent disclosures of campaign contributions to mayor Eric Garcetti and other officials from developers with large projects awaiting city approval that those contributors had attempted to conceal. Opponents, who included many advocacy groups for the homeless as well as the city's business community, building trades unions and developers, said that while the measure addressed some real problems, it went too far and would have not only prevented the construction of new affordable housing but made the city's overall quality of life worse by aggravating an existing housing shortage. They questioned whether the money spent by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) to get the initiative on the ballot was really related to the foundation's mission, and suggested that it was really motivated by AHF director Michael Weinstein's desire to block a development that would have dominated the view from his office window. Backers had originally intended for the initiative to be on the ballot in November 2016, but later decided to postpone it to March, when the city's mayor and some councilmembers were up for re-election, a move opponents said was really meant to put the measure in front of an electorate believed more likely to support it. Since those races were not vigorously contested, Measure S received the greatest attention from the media and voters. Both sides accused the other of deception. Proponents filed a suit alleging that opponents overstated the claimed negative impact of the measure in material submitted for the city's voters' guide, while opponents highlighted false claims of support attributed to Garcetti and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. The sheriff's department also attempted to block a mailer in support of Measure S designed to look like an eviction notice after many recipients mistook it for a real one. A fundamental question underlying Measure S was not just its provisions, but the direction the city itself would take. Supporters invoked its late 20th-century image as a highly suburbanized city of detached single-family homes whose occupants primarily used their cars to get around; opponents looked toward a future as a more densely developed city where residents of the densely populated areas relied as much on buses and Metro Rail. Its failure, coupled with voters' approval of a half-cent sales tax increase the previous fall to fund expansions to regional mass transit systems, was seen as a turning point in the city's history. Background Measure S is the most recent contest in a long-running struggle over the character of Los Angeles as a city. =Historically suburban character of Los Angeles and zoning controversies= \\"Los Angeles has been a place of multiple centers: religious and secular, indigenous and colonial, European and mestizo, and familiar and alien,\\" public television station KCET said in a 2011 account of the city's development since the early 19th century. Unlike other American cities, which grew outward from a historical core and only later acquired suburbs, Los Angeles had started as a series of suburbs, with small communities such as Pasadena, Whittier and Long Beach starting up in the late 19th century. Recounting how the efforts of developers like Henry E. Huntington and Harry Chandler and the water supply system developed by William Mulholland shaped the city, the Los Angeles Times later said \\"Builders, more than planners, facilitated the city's growth spurts, driven by one singular vision: Los Angeles would be a city of small houses on small lots.\\" This pattern of development continued as the city's population grew explosively in the early 20th century, fed by rail access and the promise of a relaxed, almost utopian lifestyle amid a warm, gentle climate and natural setting, along with an early adaptation to widespread automobile use. High- rise development remained largely confined to downtown, with newly settled areas retaining the small-scale suburban feel that had distinguished the city's earlier days, resulting in \\"an ethnically diverse and complex metropolis in which no single economic or cultural center dominates a region that is neither conventionally suburban in character nor fully urban.\\" The city first established a zoning code in 1921. By the end of the decade complaints that political corruption was leading to spot zoning, or single- property changes to use, for commercial establishments, undermining the purpose of the zoning code, were already abundant; they continued even as the real estate market slowed in the Great Depression. After the war, with federal housing subsidies driving construction, zoning was often changed when actual uses differed; most of the farms of the San Fernando Valley disappeared by the 1960s to make way for residential development. Neighborhood homeowners' associations gained political power through opposing spot zoning; by the end of the decade, public outrage over a developer's indictment for bribing officials to get a favorable zoning change led to amendments to the city charter forbidding spot zoning. alt=A small area of skyscrapers amid a larger, flatter yet extensively developed area In the late 1970s, following the enactment of Proposition 13, which capped property tax assessments until the property changed owners, Los Angeles residents began advocating for slow growth and neighborhood preservation. A new General Plan for the city lowered density limits from a floor area ratio of 10:1, a level comparable to the New York City borough of Manhattan, in accordance with older plans for a city of 10 million, to 4.5:1, with most high-rise development confined to certain areas within the city. However, the city government, dominated by pro-growth interests, resisted implementing the necessary zoning changes. Despite the state legislature passing a 1978 law ordering the city to bring its zoning into compliance with the new General Plan by 1982, two years after that deadline barely one-quarter of the necessary changes had been made. alt=A street with modern glass-faced skyscrapers along its far side, many with logos of banks With the city's zoning code still largely reflecting older higher- density aspirations, projects were approved that residents assumed were not supposed to be built in the places they were. \\"Although property values continued to soar,\\" wrote historian Mike Davis in City of Quartz, his 1990 social history of the city, \\"neighborhoods were Manhattanized beyond recognition.\\" Skyscrapers were built in North Hollywood and Universal City, while Ventura Boulevard in Encino became home to the high-rise American offices of many Japanese banks. In 1986, the signatures of 100,000 voters put Proposition U, essentially cutting density limits everywhere in the city in half, and dividing it into 35 distinct neighborhoods, on the ballot. It passed later that year with 70% of the vote. Afterwards, it was later estimated that the city's zoning could allow for at most a population of 4.3 million. Implementation of the General Plan was soon sidetracked; after the 1992 riots, city governments prioritized public safety over all their other responsibilities. Over the next decades, however, preferences in buildings and the city's needs changed, but the General Plan did not, despite a schedule that called for it to be updated every ten years. City council increasingly dealt with this by spot zoning, usually granting exceptions to height, density, or even land use restrictions. The provisions of Proposition U, originally intended to slow commercial development, eventually began to restrict residential construction as well. The city's housing stock grew at less than half the rate of other American metropolitan areas between 1980 and 2010. In 2005 city council eliminated the decennial requirement for updating the General Plan in favor of a \\"New Community Plan\\", but budgetary limitations brought on by the Great Recession shortly afterwards meant that by 2015, only two of the city's ten regional plans had been updated. In the late 2000s, mayor Antonio Villaraigosa called for a future Los Angeles of \\"elegant density\\", focusing on transit-oriented development. The implementation of this vision was challenged when Hollywood residents blocked an update to that community's Specific Plan that would have allowed for higher density and taller buildings, arguing that tourists came to the area to see the Walk of Fame, not skyscrapers, and that a recent decline in the neighborhood's population was at odds with predictions of future growth. City officials insisted that census projections that almost 50,000 more people would be living in Hollywood by 2030 justified the plan. Eric Garcetti, the city councilman for the area, said that the proposed plan accommodated growth instead of creating it. By 2015, the city's population was approaching 4 million, nearly the limit allowed by the post-Proposition U zoning. With 80% of the city's residential land zoned for single-family homes, compared to only a quarter of New York or San Francisco, both more densely populated than Los Angeles, the homeowners' associations in more affluent communities used that political power to file lawsuits under the California Environmental Quality Act against the approval of larger new developments in their neighborhoods. A later study found that many of the projects so challenged were urban infill, multi-family residential developments of the kind considered to reduce urban sprawl. =2015 developments= In 2015, Miami-based Crescent Heights was seeking permission from the city to build the Palladium Residences, 731 luxury condominium units in two 30-story towers on the lot of the recently restored Hollywood Palladium theater. Michael Weinstein, head of the AHF, the world's largest private organization devoted to treating AIDS, had frequently opposed the project at community meetings. He complained the buildings were too high and would impair the view of the Hollywood Hills from his office on the 21st floor of the Sunset Media Center on Sunset Boulevard. After a private meeting with Crescent's local representative in July of that year failed to resolve the issues, Weinstein threatened not only to file a suit against the city to block the project but sponsor, through the AHF, an initiative to change the city's zoning code in ways that would prevent the construction of projects like his. Later that year, Weinstein asked the board of the AHF, which had approved the organization's sponsorship of previous initiatives like Measure B and Proposition 60, requiring the use of condoms during sex scenes by actors in pornographic films, to support an initiative aimed at reforming the zoning code to prevent further large developments from skirting the intent of the city's zoning. \\"There was general consensus\\", said chair Cynthia Davis. \\"We agreed with what he shared with us.\\" =2016 campaign to place initiative on ballot= By March, the AHF had recruited journalist Jill Stewart to leave her post as managing editor of LA Weekly and serve as campaign manager for what was named the Neighborhood Integrity Initiative. It formed the Coalition to Preserve Los Angeles (CPLA) to support it. While the original plan had been to have it on the ballot in that November's general election, in the middle of the month, the CPLA announced in a news conference on the steps of City Hall that they were instead planning to have it on the March 2017 ballot, at the same time as the city's next elections for mayor and city council. Weinstein said that the change in timetable reflected an \\"overcrowded\\" fall ballot, with that year's presidential election, races for Congress and the state legislature, as well as 20 other initiatives and propositions before voters. \\"The Neighborhood Integrity Initiative is a city issue, better suited for a city election, which we will have in March 2017.\\" With city officials on the ballot as well, it was suggested that the initiative would force candidates for those seats to take positions on the issues it raised. Opponents suggested the change was meant to ensure an older, whiter and smaller electorate than that which votes in presidential election years, one likely to be more responsive to the arguments for Measure S, would consider it. In May 2016 a poll found that 7% more potential voters were opposed to the measure than in support of it. However, 19% remained uncommitted. This was potentially enough to swing the vote in supporters favor, especially since turnout in Los Angeles's March elections is historically around 10% of the city's electorate (in March 2016, only 8.6% of voters participated). The initiative would need over 61,000 signatures by early September to qualify for the ballot. By that time the CPLA had collected 104,000. Before city council voted on whether to adopt the measure or put it on the ballot, the two options given under the city charter, the CPLA met with Eric Garcetti, now mayor, to ask if he or council were prepared to institute measures on their own to control development. He offered only to provide more public notice of otherwise closed meetings between city officials, developers and lobbyists, a reform the CPLA considered inadequate, so the initiative was placed on the March ballot. Opponents organized as well. Before the initiative was placed on the ballot, the Coalition to Protect L.A. Neighborhoods & Jobs (CPLANJ) was formed to work against it. In addition to business groups the group's members included Laborers' Union Local 300 and nonprofit organizations that advocated for affordable housing and the interests of the poor. \\"People who do not agree on other issues are coming together to put a stop to this,\\" said a spokesman. Most of the $800,000 the coalition had raised in the first half of 2015 came from four developers‚ÄîCrescent Heights, whose Palladium project Weinstein had launched the initiative in response to, was the largest single donor through its wholly owned limited liability corporation for that project; other major donors of note included Lowe Enterprises and developer and local philanthropist Eli Broad. The debate around the initiative was seen not just as one about its provisions, or even the city's zoning, but of contrasting visions of the city. LA Weekly described it as: Initiative The initiative proposed the following actions: *A two-year moratorium on any new project that would require a variance from maximum floor area ratio, density, height or land use restrictions already in effect for that zoning district under the city's General Plan that would result in a more intense use than that currently permitted. Exceptions would be granted for a project that was intended to be entirely affordable housing, in which vested building rights already existed, where the existing structures were found to be structurally unsound, or had been damaged by disaster such as fire or earthquake. *Prohibit amendments to the General Plan unless they applied to an entire neighborhood defined in the plan, a named neighborhood or council area, or a development covering more than , and require that city planners demonstrate that the amendment was not passed solely to facilitate any single project or concurrently submitted group of projects. *Require the city to update the General Plan completely every five years, starting upon passage of the initiative. All public hearings about the Specific Plans for any of the areas defined as neighborhoods in the General Plan would be required to be held in that neighborhood on evenings and weekends to ensure full community participation. *Require that any environmental impact statement be prepared by the city planning department or a consultant it has approved for the job rather than the developer or his or her agents. *Prohibit the city from granting any variance to parking requirements allowing less than two-thirds the required number of spaces, including remote off-site parking. Debate Both supporters and opponents agreed that Los Angeles had been undergoing a severe housing crisis since the end of the Great Recession. While the city's population had grown, surpassing four million late in 2016 by official estimates, and its economy had added, and would continue to add, a commensurate number of jobs, a study by Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies concluded that the city had 382,000 units less than what it needed to accommodate very low-income renters. And while rents in Los Angeles were lower than those in New York City and San Francisco, they were less affordable, since about half of Angelenos rented compared to only a third of all Americans and those Angelenos made less money than most other American renters. As a result, a 2014 study by the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs had found that Los Angeles had the least affordable rental housing in the country, with the average tenant spending almost half their income on rent. The problem was further exacerbated, the UCLA study had found, by a significant portion of Los Angeles renters being of considerable means themselves compared to other markets, preferring to rent in the wake of the collapse of the late 2000s real estate bubble for the stability and flexibility it gave them, driving up rents in the process. =Nature and cause of housing shortage= Supporters argued that the problem was not a housing shortage so much as an oversupply of housing for the higher end of the market, housing that often remained vacant for lack of interest or, the CPLA suggested, because they were used as investment properties. It cited a 2015 report from the city's housing department to Garcetti, warning that a large majority of Los Angeles's new housing over the preceding decade was for households earning $105,000 a year or more, far more than needed for that end of the market, yet despite that there was still a 12% vacancy rate. This, the coalition claimed, was due to the spot zoning developers were too easily able to obtain since, it said, \\"zoning is now meaningless in L.A.\\" AHF founder Michael Weinstein defended his organization's financial support for the measure by noting that the foundation's biggest responsibility after taking care of patients was finding them places to live. \\"L.A. is in the grip of a social justice crisis over whom our city really serves,\\" he wrote in a Times op-ed. \\"As we work to house patients in L.A., City Hall focuses on approving $3,500 apartments that sit empty.\\" In response to supporters' claims that the real cause of the housing shortage was an abundance of luxury housing, opponents said that regardless of the market segment it was intended for, any new housing would eventually drive down the price of all housing. It was also noted that overall vacancy rates were at historic lows, based on census data from the last decade, compared to 2010. The CPLA countered by citing a report by the chief economist for the popular real-estate website Zillow that this purported \\"trickle-down\\" effect was not, in fact, occurring, not in Los Angeles or any other American city it studied. In fact, it claimed, median rents for the lowest third of houses and apartments were rising at much greater rates than the overall rental market, particularly in California. Possible effect on evictions of rent-controlled tenants Proponents claimed that 22,000 tenants had been evicted from rent controlled housing since 2000 in order to build luxury housing, and that without Measure S that amount would increase. Since California's Ellis Act, under which landlords can evict tenants if they are no longer offering the units for rent, was state law beyond the scope of city ballot initiatives, Measure S could not address them directly. Supporters claimed instead that its provisions would drive down the number of evictions by making it harder to build the kind of housing for which tenants were evicted. However, the Times found that many of the developments for which rent-controlled tenants had been evicted had not needed the spot zoning the measure intended to stop in order to be built; one such project had been one from which an Echo Park woman featured in one of the pro-S campaign advertisements was evicted. Fewer than 10% of all the evictions of rent- controlled tenants between 2011‚Äì2015 had been for projects that would have been affected by the proposed moratorium, the paper found. Miki Jackson, a spokeswoman for the supporters said that they were concerned about the \\"enormous ripple effect\\" spot zoned projects have, since they lead to gentrification and more Ellis Act evictions. She acknowledged, however, that the 22,000 evictions were the total Ellis Act evictions since 2000, not just those triggered by spot zoning. Opponents argued that preventing spot zoning temporarily would actually increase Ellis Act evictions during that time. Most spot zoned projects were proposed for sites on which no housing had previously existed, they noted. If developers could not build on those, they would turn instead to remodeling and rebuilding housing in older neighborhoods, with more rent controlled tenants subject to Ellis Act eviction. \\"[It] will leave in place the options that removed the most housing,\\" said Josh Kamensky, a spokesman for the CPLANJ. =Alleged corrupt influence on planning process= As proof that the city government had been corrupted to the point of needing the drastic steps the initiative would take, supporters began touting a lengthy October 2016 Los Angeles Times article. It described Sea Breeze, a Torrance-area apartment project, that was approved for construction despite its proximity to several industrial sites that could adversely affect the quality of life for residents. The newspaper found that large campaign contributions to mayor Eric Garcetti and key city council members including Janice Hahn, later elected to the U.S. House, came from individuals of modest means who worked for companies connected to the project's developer, although those contributors did not recall writing checks for amounts they admitted were equal to what they earned in weeks or even months (many of which also appeared to be written by the same person regardless of whose account they were drawn on). In some cases the purported contributors were not even registered to vote. The city's planning commission had twice unanimously rejected Sea Breeze, only to be overruled by city council. To facilitate one of those votes, Garcetti had invoked a rarely used mayoral power to temporarily reduce the number of votes necessary for passage. Opponents pointed out that for all the CPLA's complaints about corruption, the measure had no provisions addressed to limiting campaign contributions from developers. In January 2017, several city council members introduced legislation that would, in fact, have banned campaign contributions from developers with projects seeking city approval, although whether it would have passed, much less survived a court challenge, was questionable. While Measure S supporters approved of the effort, many thought it made their points about how necessary the initiative was. \\"It's an admission of guilt\\", said Sherman Oaks Homeowners Association (SOHA) president Richard Close, a supporter. =Possible effects of moratorium= The practical effect of the moratorium was another point of disagreement between the two sides. Supporters repeatedly stated that only 5% of development in the city would be halted by it, and that it would only last two years. Opponents responded that both claims were misleading. The 5% figure was based, they said, on an apparent analysis of all permits; however, they implied, most of the construction that would be allowed was improvements to existing buildings or very small-scale housing, and the 5% of blocked projects included most of the larger multi-unit proposals seeking approval. And due to the initiative's requirement that the city update its entire zoning, a process which could take longer than two years, opponents estimated it could be as long as ten years before developers felt comfortable building again. Opponents also disputed supporters' claims that Measure S would not affect any plans for affordable housing. Instead, they claimed, 90% of those projects would not be able to built since they would require the sort of variances the initiative would forbid for projects on those scales. One cartographer identified city-owned parking lots on which 724 units could be built, but only if the General Plan, which currently allowed only industrial use on the property, were amended, something the measure would forbid even for projects of entirely affordable housing. They also dismissed the exemption for such projects, saying that was \\"yet another example of 60 year old solutions to today's problems\\", in the CPLANJ's words. Richard Platkin, a former city planner who strongly supported Measure S, wrote that these arguments were specious. \\"For nearly an entire year\\", he wrote in a January 2017 City Watch LA column, \\"I have repeatedly asked ... readers to identify any affordable housing projects that required a General Plan Amendment or even a zone change to begin construction. So far, I have only been told about one case in all of Los Angeles.\\" He said the city's own reports confirmed this, and that the 2% of new housing that was meant for lower-income renters and buyers came about not because of any municipal action but through state laws allowing higher densities for affordable housing. Platkin further noted that the city owned 9,000 parcels on which such housing could be built, only a few of which had been so developed. \\"Now, suddenly, this long-ignored affordable housing option has been taken out of mothballs\\", he said, suggesting it was in direct response to the threat posed to developers' alleged control over City Hall by Measure S. =Role of transit-oriented development= Opponents criticized the provision forbidding the city from granting reductions of more than one-third the required parking spaces, since they said it went against the city's goals of encouraging transit-oriented development along subway lines and other major transportation corridors. The CPLA said these large parking variances did not accomplish that goal, \\"instead send[ing] drivers seeking parking spilling into overwhelmed neighborhoods.\\" It claimed some residents of these developments were walking five blocks to and from their homes to parking spaces on a daily basis. However, the CPLA had also contributed $10,000 to a campaign against November's Measure M, a county-level initiative which increased the sales tax a half-percent to pay for light rail extensions. Stewart explained that they saw transit as a \\"development arm\\". The Real Deal, another real-estate website, suggested that indicated the coalition was as opposed to transit as it was to traffic congestion, which it frequently cited as an argument for Measure S, an argument that seemed contradictory. In an earlier interview with The Planning Report, Stewart had expressed skepticism about the role of transit in reshaping Angelenos' lives. \\"People who can afford to own cars continue to drive their cars\\", she said. \\"No amount of discussion will get people to give up that freedom.\\" If the city truly wanted to reduce congestion, she suggested, it should offer tax breaks to people who work from their homes. Times architecture critic Christopher Hawthorne also noted that when Hollywood had updated its Community Plan in 2012 to allow for more transit-friendly development, three community groups, including Fix the City, a descendant of Not Yet New York, which had been a key force behind the similar Proposition U in 1986, successfully sued to block it. He said this pointed to \\"the basic hypocrisy that the authors of Measure S and other slow- growth advocates can't argue away ... Many say they're in favor of updating the community plans but fought to block one that didn't match their vision of low-rise, essentially suburban Los Angeles.\\" \\"Some clever-by-half advocates of sustainability imagine that every large and tall apartment building is automatically transit-oriented,\\" Platkin responded to those arguments. Those that had been built near Los Angeles's subway stations, he said, were so far only transit-adjacent, since their residents still used their cars to get around (AHF head Weinstein similarly argued that \\"People who pay $3,800 [a month] for an apartment are not the ones who ride the subway.\\") Only when such development was built for lower-income tenants and residents who depended on transit to get to work, Platkin wrote, could it truly be described as transit- oriented. He allowed that Los Angeles's relationship with mass transit could indeed be reconfigured to be more like that of New York or San Francisco, but it would require improvements to the streets making them more amenable to bicyclists and pedestrians, not just high-density development near transit stops. =Vision of Los Angeles's future: Blade Runner vs. Her= Underlying the Measure S debate were contrasting visions of the city and what direction it would take in the future. \\"Longtime residents of Los Angeles have in their collective imagination an image of what the city should look like and how they should live in it,\\" D. J. Waldie, a Lakewood native and author of Holy Land, a well-regarded memoir of his youth in the planned suburb, told the Times' Thomas Curwen. \\"[I]t's that image that is being interfered with as the city becomes more dense. What kind of city will they see in five, 10 or 15 years?\\" Stewart rejected any idea that the city should move in a higher-density direction. She characterized urban planners who advocated that as \\"stuck in a different world\\" and their ideal of urban living as \\"everyone needs to move close together and cram their children into places where there is nowhere to play. The theory that people enjoy living around the noise and congestion is wrong, and we need to respond to how people really live.\\" Platkin told Curwen that the real struggle, in his opinion, was not over the density of development but the role of the public in shaping it. Nonetheless, he used a cinematic reference point invoked by other proponents of Measure S. \\"If you have a city whose land-use policies are determined by the roller coaster of real estate speculation, you will have a city that looks like Blade Runner\\", referring to the seminal 1982 science fiction film set in a 2019 Los Angeles of endless skyscrapers. Another vocal Measure S proponent, Kenneth Alpern, mocked opponents as \\"[those] who believe that megadevelopment and a Blade Runner scenario of a sterile, overcrowded Los Angeles is WONDERFUL.\\" Curwen, however, contrasted that vision, frequently described as dystopian, with the 2030 Los Angeles envisioned in Spike Jonze's 2014 Best Picture-nominated Her, a vision also evoked by Curbed after Measure S's defeat. It, too, is a city of dense high-rises, realized on screen by digitally merging less recognizable elements of the thus-developed Shanghai cityscape. But its residents seem content with living that way, a lifestyle that depends far more on public transportation than it does today. \\"The future imagined by one generation is not necessarily the future wanted by another,\\" he wrote. \\"the debate over density is challenging popular presumptions of the single-family home. Like the car, it has become a symbol of urban unsustainability.\\" Curwen talked to two experts who had contrasting views. Joel Kotkin, a Valley Village resident and professor at Chapman University known for his beliefs that recent proclamations of urban comeback are illusory since Americans prefer a suburban lifestyle, told him that while he did not envision downtown becoming much bigger a part of the city than it was in Indianapolis or Dallas, current development trends threatened to overwhelm the suburban aspects of Los Angeles that had made it so attractive for most of the 20th century. But Zev Yaroslavsky, who as a councilman in the mid-1980s had led the fight for Proposition U, which preserved the city's low-density character, did not see Los Angeles as having to choose. \\"The suburbs aren't going anywhere,\\" he told Curwen. \\"I look at the changes ahead of us as additive. You now have a more urban dimension to the city of L.A.\\" =Role of AHF in sponsoring initiative= Opponents questioned what an initiative focusing on municipal zoning had to do with the AHF's primary mission of offering treatment for AIDS patients through the pharmacies and clinics it operated. Its previous sponsorship of the successful 2012 Measure B, requiring all actors in pornographic films produced in Los Angeles County, to wear condoms during sex scenes, and Proposition 60, the unsuccessful effort to extend that prohibition to the state level after adult-film production companies left the county to avoid complying with Measure B, alienated some members of the city's LGBT community and was seen as overreach, but one still compatible with its mission. \\"Why the AIDS Healthcare Foundation is spending its time and money fighting battles over land-use and transportation policy is of course [an] ... excellent question\\", wrote Times architecture critic Christopher Hawthorne. The paper also devoted an editorial to it. \\"How is this social justice? How is this helping AIDS patients?\\" the newspaper asked. It suggested the foundation's real motivation was to block the Palladium Towers development that its head, Michael Weinstein, had complained ruined the view of the Hollywood Hills from his office. The Times noted that as of a week before the election the AHF had spent $4.6 million on the initiative, accounting for almost all the CPLA's financial support. Dana Cuff, an urban design professor at UCLA's Luskin School, told LGBT magazine The Advocate that at best, AHF's use of the money for the initiative was \\"not understandable\\". Later she said it was \\"actually a misuse of their funds\\". A former AHF volunteer turned critic told the Times it a \\"blatant abuse of the[ir] resources\\". During the campaign, the Los Angeles LGBT Center held a news conference not only opposing Measure S but criticizing AHF for having sponsored it. City Controller Ron Galperin said the foundation was \\"squandering millions of dollars\\" on the initiative and urged it to focus on its core mission of treating AIDS patients. Lorri Jean, director of the LGBT Center, showed the reporters demolition work that was ongoing for an affordable housing project of nearly 300 units across the street from the center's offices. The project, she said, required a zoning change from light industrial use and thus would have been impossible to build under the strictures of Measure S. Weinstein defended the AHF's sponsorship of the initiative by reiterating that housing patients was the organization's largest priority after caring for them, and he felt the recent upsurge in luxury developments was making that harder by driving up rents. He told The Advocate that the AHF, despite its involvement in advocacy and initiatives, was still spending 96% of its billion-dollar budget on care. \\"We're not diverting money from patient care, but we feel that we have a responsibility to the community in which we're headquartered.\\" Former LA Weekly managing editor Jill Stewart, hired by the AHF as Measure S's campaign manager, was also criticized for her role since she herself lives not in the city but the affluent suburb of Calabasas, on the southwest corner of the Valley. \\"It's not my place to critique the merits of the place you choose to live,\\" tech executive Stephen Corwin wrote in an open letter to Stewart in Medium, \\"but there's a painful irony in what you're trying to accomplish from there. How do you morally justify trying to preserve the integrity of a city you don't consider to be worthy of living in?\\" Positions Besides the CPLA and CPLANJ, many local organizations devoted to the relevant issues took positions on Measure S. Some prominent individuals, mostly local elected officials and celebrities, did as well. However, many of those who did said it was hard to take sides since the measure polarized voters. \\"It has turned into a real civil war issue,\\" said Joe Bray-Ali, a bicycle activist running against incumbent city councilman Gil Cedillo, who opposed the initiative. \\"It's been hard to have a factual argument. It's just a bizarre tangle of rhetoric and emotion.\\" \\"I completely understand the sentiment behind it,\\" said Mitchell Schwartz, the most visible of the candidates running against Garcetti, who opposed Measure S. However, when asked by LA Weekly, he said he was unsure about it. Similarly, councilman Paul Koretz, one of the few incumbents facing a serious challenger, Jesse Creed, felt \\"it might light a real fire under the mayor and council's collective sense of urgency to update the community plans\\" but demurred when asked to take a position on the initiative, expressing concern that it could not withstand a legal challenge. Creed, who had made an issue of Koretz's support for a project by developer Rick Caruso which had also been the subject of a Times article about its possible connection to Caruso's political generosity, told the newspaper he had not yet decided where to stand on it. =Support= right Well represented among Measure S's official endorsers were many of the homeowners' associations, and some of the neighborhood councils, which had exerted such control over city planning in the late 20th century. The groups that served Bel Air, Elysian Valley, Encino, Hollywood Hills West, Westlake South and Westwood backed the measure. Officials from some other prominent homeowners' associations, such as Richard Close of Sherman Oaks and Jeff Lynn of Van Nuys, lent their names. Close, a land-use lawyer, called Measure S \\"the Proposition 13 of this generation ... We need to stop pay-to-play development\\". At the time he was leading opposition to a proposed redevelopment of a closed Sunkist plant in Sherman Oaks, which he said epitomized what the new initiative was intended to stop. Noting that propositions 13 and U, both of which he had played a leading role in, built crucial early support in the San Fernando Valley, he said, that area's support would be essential to Measure S's passage. \\"Political action starts in the Valley. It aims to change this city.\\" Close believed Measure S would pass overwhelmingly, since voters were even angrier about the underlying issues than they had been during the campaign for Proposition U. Some local environmental organizations supported Measure S. Among them were the Los Angeles and San Fernando Valley chapters of the Audubon Society and the Federation of Hillside and Canyon Associations. The Ballona Wetlands Institute also supported the initiative. Its executive director personally endorsed it, as did a number of local environmental lawyers. Richard Riordan, who as the city's mayor during the 1990s had pushed for the creation of the neighborhood councils which critics blamed for further limiting the city's growth, was the most prominent of the former elected officials to endorse Measure S. \\"Do we want to continue allowing rule-breaking developers to do as they please? I don't think so\\", he wrote in a Times op-ed. \\"Los Angeles is better than this.\\" Other onetime elected officials who supported the initiative included former congresswoman Diane Watson, former state senate majority leader Gloria Romero and former city councilman Dennis Zine. As often is the case with political issues in Los Angeles, some well-known actors joined their names to the cause. The CPLA in August 2016 announced that Kirsten Dunst, Joaquin Phoenix, Chris Pine and Chloe Sevigny were supporters. Leonardo DiCaprio and Garrett Hedlund were also mentioned, but the coalition later removed their names after their publicists said they had not, in fact, formally announced their support. =Opposition= 300px The Los Angeles political and business establishment uniformly opposed Measure S. At City Hall, Mayor Eric Garcetti and City Controller Ron Galperin were joined by 10 of the city's 14 incumbent councilmembers in urging voters to reject the measure. Four county supervisors‚ÄîJanice Hahn, Sheila Kuehl, Mark Ridley-Thomas and Hilda Solis‚Äîalso expressed opposition. Governor Jerry Brown led state officials, including state senator Ricardo Lara and several of the assemblymembers from Los Angeles, in coming out against Measure S. They were also joined by U.S. Representatives Tony C√°rdenas and Brad Sherman. To dramatize why they were opposed, Garcetti and other officials, along with representatives of opposed groups, held a rally at the 100-unit Casa Heiwa affordable housing development in Little Tokyo, a project that had required a zoning change and General Plan amendment when built in 1996. Thus, they argued, it would have been prevented by Measure S. Both the county's Democratic and Republican parties formally opposed Measure S. Democratic organizations representing the San Fernando Valley and Westside also joined them. The county Green Party also came against Measure S, calling it \\"a blunt instrument that would prevent desperately needed affordable housing from being built in the near term, while guaranteeing nothing about the future ecological orientation and affordability of new development.\\" Business groups, including many local Chambers of Commerce, landlords and realtors' groups, campaigned against the initiative. A broad coalition of labor unions, including the county building trades council and individual construction union locals, along with public employees such as the city's police and fire unions, were also opposed. The American Civil Liberties Union also expressed its opposition. Environmental activist groups, chief among them the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Los Angeles League of Conservation Voters, expressed opposition as well. Many organizations that advocated for the homeless and affordable housing joined them. Father Greg Boyle, founder of job-training nonprofit Homeboy Industries, who had supported Measure S while supporters were still gathering signatures for it, withdrew his support several days later, saying he had only given it after two friends recommended he do so and, after reading the measure, was convinced it would not ease the city's housing crisis. alt=A view of a single- story brown brick building from a parking lot in front, with palm trees on either side of the frame. In the center is a red brick entrance pavilion with \\"Panorama Mall\\" written on it in stylized metal letters None of the city's homeowners' associations opposed Measure S, but neighborhood councils in Central Hollywood, Olympic Park, Palms, Panorama City and Richard Close's home neighborhood of Sherman Oaks did. \\"It's a tale of two Valleys,\\" said Councilwoman Nury Martinez, challenging Close's narrative. She pointed to the redevelopment of a former Montgomery Ward and the expansion of a shopping mall near her home in Panorama City, both \\"desperately needed and desired\\", as the sort of development that the initiative would imperil, since they depended on parking variances. \\"It literally took 20 years to get developers interested in these areas,\\" she said. \\"Measure S punishes communities like this one.\\" The Los Angeles Times strongly opposed Measure S, even before it had qualified for the ballot. In April 2016 it ran an op-ed by Conor Friedersdorf, a staff writer for The Atlantic and city resident. Likening the proposed moratorium to the Mexican border fence proposed by Donald Trump, then seeking the Republican presidential nomination, he said the initiative would \\"wall off this city from newcomers on behalf of homeowners who don't want more traffic on 'their' streets.\\" A month before the election, the paper ran an editorial urging Angelenos to vote no on S, calling it \\"a childish middle finger to City Hall.\\" The city's other daily newspaper, the Los Angeles Daily News, also recommended voters reject it, saying that the legitimate issues it raised did not require a moratorium to solve. Campaign alt=A woman in a black dress and sandals leaning against a building corner holding up part of a cardboard box with \\"Not Dirty, Not on Drugs, But still Homeless ... Anything helps!\\" written on it As soon as council placed the initiative on the ballot, supporters and opponents staked out their positions. Stewart said that it would allow 95% of development proposed at that time to proceed \\"while the greediest 5 percent of developers are put on a timeout while we force the City Council to come up with a real plan for Los Angeles\\". Speaking against the measure, Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce chief executive officer Gary Toebben told the Los Angeles Business Journal that the measure \\"goes way too far\\", which would become opponents' main argument against it, to the point of becoming the URL of their website. \\"[It] means moving hundreds of thousands of Angelenos one step closer to homelessness,\\" he said, alluding to a recent increase in the city's homeless population over the last several years despite slow population growth and general economic prosperity. The CPLA, attributing that increase to what it said were thousands of evictions of rent-stabilized tenants by developers looking to build the high-density luxury housing Measure S was meant to curtail, endorsed Measure HHH, a bond issue on the upcoming ballot that would raise $1.2 billion and commit it to buying property on which facilities for the homeless would be built. =Comparisons to Trump campaign and presidency= Both sides on Measure S were primarily composed of liberals and progressives, often in ethnic or social groups that identified politically with the Democratic Party, which overwhelmingly dominates politics in Los Angeles. As such, supporters and opponents of the initiative compared the other side to recently elected Republican president Donald Trump in their rhetoric, often suggesting that \\"billionaires\\" supported the other side. The CPLA observed that the city's top developers had contributed to Trump's campaign, although none of them had supported the CPLANJ financially, whereas Crescent Heights, the lead contributor to that organization, had not given any money to Trump. In response, the CPLANJ reminded voters that prominent S supporter Richard Riordan, the city's last Republican mayor, had also endorsed Trump (although only after his nomination‚ÄîRiordan had previously called Trump \\"crazy\\"). Richard Close, the influential SOHA head and a strong supporter of Measure S, believed Trump's victory augured for the success of the initiative, although he, too, had not voted for the president. \\"It tells me that the public is frustrated, mad, and believes that any change is better than the status quo. That\\"s the perfect ingredient for ... the enactment of the Neighborhood Integrity Initiative in March,\\" he told Los Angeles magazine at the beginning of 2017. Several opponents of Measure S not only compared supporters' rhetoric to Trump, but followed Conor Friedersdorf's lead in likening the initiative itself to the policies Trump had promised when campaigning. The Times itself called proponents' arguments \\"positively Trumpian\\" in an editorial, an argument similar to one made in an open letter to Yes on S campaign manager Jill Stewart by tech executive Stephen Corwin. In a follow-up post, Corwin reacted to one of the pro-S mailers by comparing Measure S to Brexit, the 2016 referendum in which British voters decided their country should leave the European Union, and Stewart herself to Brexit advocate Nigel Farage, since, he argued, she made similar promises on behalf of the measure that, like Farage, she and supporters would have to renege on after it passed. Abundant Housing LA likened the Yes on S arguments to the \\"alternative facts\\" claimed by Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway in response to unfavorable news coverage of the administration. =Billboards= The CPLA tried to reach voters primarily through outdoor advertising, a strategy that the AHF had used to pass Measure B, requiring the use of condoms during penetrative sex scenes in adult films made in Los Angeles County, in 2012, and again for the previous fall's unsuccessful Proposition 60, which would have extended Measure B statewide, and Proposition 61 attempting to limit the price the state paid for prescription drugs. Many of the billboards AHF had used for those campaigns as well as public service announcements warning gay men against the prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases were, during the last months of 2017, converted to \\"Yes on S\\" messages. Ultimately 120 billboards, many in the city's affluent Westside, promoted Measure S, an amount opponents said was far in excess of any other recent political campaign. The owners of the iconic \\"Welcome to Silver Lake\\" sign at Sunset Junction also repainted it with a pro-Measure S message. They had been fighting a proposed nearby development, which would not have needed a zoning change and thus would not have been put on hold by the moratorium. Some opponents of the initiative who lived in the area resented the appropriation of a local landmark, but most felt it was the owners' right to do as they pleased with the sign. A member of the local neighborhood council, however, complained that the owners spelled Silver Lake as one word in contravention of a requirement that the space be used. =Conflicts with Measure JJJ= In November city voters considered Measure JJJ, addressing some of the same issues as Measure S. It required that 20% of developments requiring zoning variances be set aside for affordable housing, that local labor be used on them, and incentivized developers for building near the city's subway lines. The city's business community, particularly developers, were as opposed to it as they were to Measure S. However, so was the CPLA. In a news release strongly opposing JJJ, it claimed that initiative had been \\"cooked up\\" by the interests opposing Measure S in an effort to split its support and keep it from the ballot. Measure S proponents said that they considered JJJ likely to fall short of its goals, pointing to what they considered broadly worded loopholes in JJJ. \\"Ultimately there's a way out, every single time, for developers,\\" Stewart told the Times. The Los Angeles Tenants' Union (LATU), a group representing renters and their rights throughout the city, publicly opposed Measure JJJ and supported Measure S. \\"We've been overrun, and nobody has had the strength or the ability to get political control over this bad land use and extreme overdevelopment,\\" said one LATU member in a CPLA news release announcing the endorsement. Both groups argued that JJJ would encourage the demolition of older, more affordable housing in favor of luxury condominiums. \\"People's dreams are dashed to make way for City Hall's horribly conceived urban cleansing,\\" said Stewart. She praised the LATU for its refusal to take money from the city or developers, in contrast to other housing rights groups she did not name. Local building trades union leaders who had been among the primary backers of Measure JJJ expressed concern that Measure S, if passed, would largely negate it through its moratorium. Lawyers also said that despite standard \\"poison pill\\" language in both initiatives giving precedence to any other initiative receiving more votes should there be a conflict between any aspect of either initiative, that question was not likely be resolved without litigation should both of them pass. Measure JJJ ultimately passed with the support of 64% of the voters. =Voter guide lawsuit= In late December a citizen backed by the CPLA brought suit against the CPLANJ over a statement it submitted for inclusion in the guidebook sent out to voters. It routinely includes short arguments for and against the ballot measure, often prepared by advocacy groups. The suit argued that the adverse economic impacts of the measure claimed by a study paid for the CPLANJ yet represented by it in its documents as independent were based on a ten-year period instead of the two years the moratorium was intended to last. Shortly after the new year, the suit was settled when CPLANJ agreed to drop the claim that the study was independent and scale back some of its other claims based on a two-year time period. Both sides claimed victory. The CPLANJ said that by agreeing to the new wording the CPLA was agreeing to the claims that it would cost the city 24,000 jobs, while Stewart claimed that CPLANJ was tacitly admitting its arguments could not hold up in court. =Deceptive mailers= alt=A white man with brown hair, combed back, and a trim mustache and beard wearing a dark jacket and tie stands before a lectern speaking in front of a blue background In October 2016 CPLA formally retracted a claim that actor Leonardo DiCaprio supported Measure S, after environmentalists criticized him for a stance in favor of lower-density housing at odds with his general support for environmental causes. Stewart, who took responsibility for the mistake, said she had spoken with the actor's publicists two months earlier and \\"I thought we had received final word\\" at that time. One of those publicists said DiCaprio took no position on Measure S. The real estate website Curbed Los Angeles, which had broken the story, learned from DiCaprio that all he had done for CPLA was to sign a petition to save an unidentified historic building. Curbed attempted to learn whether he had actually signed the petition to get the initiative on the ballot, but was told by the city clerk's office that those signatures are not public record. The website said this raised the possibility that some of those signatures could have been obtained under a pretense (as tech executive Stephen Corwin claimed he had witnessed), or that DiCaprio had signed on to support the measure without fully understanding what it entailed. In February, the CPLA sent out a mailer to voters that had on one side a picture of a smiling Garcetti, his signature and the quote \\"I Agree\\". The other showed a letter written by him on city letterhead, with \\"I agree\\" following many pro-Measure S talking points. It was headed \\"Mayor Garcetti finds a lot to like about Measure S\\". The mailer implied that Garcetti supported Measure S, which in fact he strongly opposed. He called it a \\"dirty trick\\". A CPLA spokesperson said in response that \\"[t]his was just a friendly reminder on what these City Hall insiders promised and what they've yet to deliver to the voters of Los Angeles.\\" A week before the vote, an editorial in the Los Angeles Times criticized the CPLA for its misrepresentative mailers. It also noted that many of the mailers had included quotations from other Times editorials in support of the measure. However, the editorial noted, as with the Garcetti mailer those mailers had not stated that the newspaper had consistently opposed the measure. The claims of support by opponents was not the only aspect of the CPLA mailers that led to accusations of deception. One mailer depicted a neighborhood of affordable housing that, the CPLA claimed, could have been built under Measure S. However, a Curbed reporter found that it was actually located in Torrance, outside Los Angeles's municipal boundaries. =Eviction- notice mailer= In late February the CPLA sent out another controversial mailer. This one appeared to be an eviction notice, using the same format as real ones, although there was small print identifying it as a paid political advertisement and the line with the purported case number was filled in with \\"This could be you or a loved one!\\" Tenants' organizations received calls from worried members who thought they were real, leading the head of one such group to call the CPLA \\"outrageous and irresponsible\\". The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, whose name was on the mailer, wrote to CPLA demanding they cease and desist from using their name, or at least follow up and tell recipients the mailer was not an actual eviction notice. \\"We appreciate the county of Los Angeles giving the Yes on S campaign some last-minute critical media attention, on our key issue: that developers of luxury towers evict poor and working-class Angelenos every day,\\" Stewart responded. A leader of one tenant group, the Eviction Defense Network, agreed, calling the tactic \\"forceful\\". Stewart further speculated that the sheriff might have been acting at the behest of opponents of Measure S, since they had used the same political consulting firm. Later the CPLA refused to retract the mailer, calling it protected political speech, and expressing doubt that anyone could seriously have assumed it was an actual eviction notice. Vote Since the mayoral race, as well as most of the council contests, was not seriously contested, Measure S was the most closely followed vote on the night of March 7, due to the amount spent by both sides on advertising and messaging. Early returns after the polls closed showed a huge advantage for \\"No\\" votes. With less than 5% of the precincts reporting, almost 60% of voters had registered their opposition. \\"We don't like the looks of the early returns\\", Stewart told the Times. She nevertheless held out hope that something \\"amazing\\" could turn things around. Shortly after midnight, with more than half the vote in, the opposition margin had increased further. Losing by a 2‚Äì1 ratio, the CPLA conceded defeat. When all votes had been counted, more than 70% of Angelenos had rejected Measure S. LA Weekly noted that was a wider margin of defeat than Measure N, an initiative to restrict the city's ability to tax and regulate cannabis sales, whose supporters had never campaigned for it and indeed abandoned it weeks before the election. Turnout was 20% of the electorate, low but still almost twice as high as in the mayoral election. The votes against Measure S came from all over the city. A post-election analysis by the Times, with an accompanying showed only isolated areas of support, with no neighborhood supporting the initiative outright. Many of these precincts were small, some with fewer than 10 votes cast, leading the newspaper not to publish totals or margins for privacy reasons. These areas were small portions of downtown, Echo Park, Fairfax, Koreatown, Valley Glen and the large southern area of Westchester mostly given over to Los Angeles International Airport. For precincts where there had been enough to display results, in those scattered areas where Measure S won its margin of victory was narrow, around 51‚Äì52%, often a difference of less than ten actual votes. Other than a few blocks of Silver Lake, and part of Watts, most of these areas were in the Valley: portions of Chatsworth, Granada Hills, North Hills, Northridge, Shadow Hills and Sun Valley. Measure S did best in the southwestern corner of Boyle Heights, with 55% of the vote, and collected 8 out of 12 total votes in part of San Pedro. In the majority of Los Angeles, where votes against Measure S prevailed, the margin was much higher. Many of these areas were on the Westside, where the billboards promoting the initiative had been most concentrated. Some precincts there recorded margins far above the city average against S, in the 70‚Äì80% range; in one between National Boulevard and the Santa Monica Freeway at the south boundary of Castle Heights, the margin of defeat was 87%. Opposition was strongest in Westwood: 89% of the precinct that includes the UCLA campus voted no, and 92% of an off-campus area to the northwest voted against Measure S. =Reaction= Opponents expressed relief. \\"Defeating Measure S has spared our city from a future that would've meant fewer jobs, fewer funds for critical public services, fewer new homes for those who desperately need them, and even less affordable rents,\\" according to Rusty Hicks of the county Federation of Labor. \\"[P]eople understood the devastating impact [it] would have on our community if it passed,\\" said Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce president Gary Toebben. Weinstein, whose AHF had sponsored the measure, remained upbeat. \\"This campaign will go down in the record books as one of the most successful campaigns that did not actually win the vote,\\" he said. Despite losing the vote, he observed, City Council had begun taking some actions supporters wanted. \\"We are going to hold City Hall's feet to the fire on these issues ... Los Angeles will be a better place to live as a result of the Yes on S campaign.\\" Ileana Wachtel, a CPLA spokeswoman, attributed the initiative's loss to the city establishment's opposition. \\"It's tough to fight the status quo and it's tough to fight really wealthy developers.\\" \\"I think it's great for the city,\\" said the freshly re- elected Mayor Garcetti, as he was walking through Larchmont Village the next morning, when asked about the failure of Measure S. \\"We're not going to lose momentum on building housing, and I think that doesn't come at the expense of our neighborhoods.\\" Developers, however, said the fact that the initiative had gotten on the ballot in the first place showed them that there was a strong enough belief that they had captured the city's planning process, and as a result they were not planning any large projects until the city had made progress updating its zoning as the measure's proponents had intended. \\"Many expected [Measure S] to lose,\\" LA Weekly wrote, \\"but few imagined it would lose by so much.\\" SOHA president Richard Close, who had two months earlier expressed confidence that it would triumph, admitted the wide margin of defeat came as a surprise to him. \\"I think the takeaway is that the homeowners in Los Angeles no longer have the political clout they once had.\\" Opponents readily agreed. \\"Voters didn't reject pay-to-play,\\" said Stuart Waldman, president of the Valley Industry & Commerce Association, another business group that had worked against the initiative. \\"[They] rejected NIMBYism\\", referring to the common acronym for \\"not in my backyard\\", used pejoratively for opponents of development such as the supporters of Measure S. \\"They are sick of angry, wealthy homeowners who don't want people moving into their neighborhood, driving into their neighborhood, or parking in their neighborhood\\", which he said described the members of Close's organization. =Analysis= Searching for an explanation of Measure S's spectacular failure, LA Weekly first noted that unlike the similar growth-slowing Proposition U in 1986, which had been sponsored by councilmen Zev Yaroslavsky and Marvin Braude after their colleagues refused to block large-scale development in their districts, no sitting elected official had supported Measure S. And its major proponent, AHF head Weinstein, was a polarizing figure. \\"He's not somebody that could get tens of thousands of people to charge after him,\\" explained Raphael Sonenshein, a public-affairs professor at California State University, Los Angeles. Sonenshein also wondered if the election of Trump and the associated populism underlying it had actually worked against Measure S, rather than in its favor as Close believed it would. While he agreed that those feelings had been present in the wake of the presidential election, since Trump's inauguration the growing opposition to his presidency in the city and nationwide provided a more attractive outlet for that anger. \\"It's kind of hard to have a rebellion in those conditions,\\" Sonenshein said. \\"There's already a rebellion going on.\\" Martin Cooper, a public relations executive and historian of the Valley who had supported Measure S, said it failed because opponents got their message across about what the city stood to lose more effectively than supporters were able to explain how it would work. \\"The reasons it lost were two reasons the opposition explained well: money and jobs\\", he told the Daily News. \\"It was not a coincidence that Mayor Garcetti's victory party was held at a union hall.\\" Aftermath More than the fact of Measure S's defeat, the scale of it convinced many observers that it marked a significant turning point in the history of the city. \\"[It] represents a significant break with 50 years of resistance to growth in Los Angeles,\\" Waldie told LA Weekly, which itself called the vote \\"a confirmation that the city wants to become more urbanized, more dense, less reliant on the automobile, more inclusive and, perhaps, a more unified city.\\" Times architecture critic Christopher noted that Measure S was opposed by roughly the same percentage of voters who had supported Measure M the previous fall, which led him to call the vote \\"a very strong mandate for a new and more urban L.A.\\", which he called the Third L.A., emerging as the Second L.A. championed by supporters of the failed initiative continued to break down amid the new realities of the 21st century. \\"Los Angeles is starting to feel like a great world city,\\" David C. Martin, architect of the Wilshire Grand Center, now the city's tallest building, had said before the vote. William Fulton, author of The Reluctant Metropolis, an acclaimed history of the city, said the title of his book no longer applied. \\"Los Angeles really has undergone an unbelievable shift,\\" he said, \\"between older homeowners, who don't see why growth is good for them, and younger folks, who can't afford $800,000 for a starter home.\\" While Curbed pointed out that voters may have rejected Measure S for a variety of reasons, it did indeed constitute a mandate for the city's future when taken together with Measure M. However, it said that mandate was more focused on access to mass transit and walkability than density. \\"Measure S was the last, gasping attempt at trying to convince us that LA will never give up its cars,\\" the site wrote. Curbed nevertheless cautioned that the defeat of Measure S was \\"not a starter pistol to commence building the supertall LA of Her.\\" Activists on both sides of the debate agreed. \\"Defeating Measure S doesn't solve anything,\\" said Damien Newton, the founder of Streetsblog LA. \\"[We can't say] the status quo is fine.\\" In a CityWatch LA essay two days after the election, Jill Stewart wrote that \\"while our reforms failed, Measure S won the argument.\\" She pointed to the thousands of Angelenos who voted for it, and said the campaign believed it was a much closer race before opponents began spending and Governor Brown came out against it. The real issue, she said, always had been the level of public participation in city government. \\"This is far more fundamental. It's about who decides how and where LA's infrastructure, housing, parks and services are planned and intertwined, as required, to best serve residents.\\" See also *History of Los Angeles *Timeline of Los Angeles *Urban planning in the United States Notes References External links *Coalition to Preserve Los Angeles website * Elections in Los Angeles California ballot propositions Urban planning in the United States Environment of Los Angeles 2017 California elections 2017 in the environment 2017 in Los Angeles March 2017 events in the United States Los Angeles Measure S ","title":"2017 Los Angeles Measure S"},{"id":"53585954","text":"Serena Williams was the defending champion, but lost in the second round to Sun Tiantian.

It is part of the Amazon biome. The ecoregion contains the city of Bel√©m, capital of the state of Par√°. It is the most developed part of the Amazon region, and is one of the most severely degraded natural habitats of the region. Location The Tocantins-Araguaia- Maranh√£o Moist Forests ecoregion is the most eastern of the Amazon region. It covers the east of the state of Par√° and the north of Maranh√£o. The main cities are Bel√©m, Paragominas and Bragan√ßa. Its western border is the Tocantins River, a tributary of the Amazon River. It is bordered by the mouth of the Amazon to the northwest and the Atlantic Ocean to the northeast. The southern border is defined by the Mearim River. To the east it is bounded by the Pindar√© River and the Ba√≠a de S√£o Marcos. The Maraj√≥ v√°rzea at the mouth of the Amazon lies to the north. There is a belt of Amazon-Orinoco-Southern Caribbean mangroves along the Atlantic coast to the northeast. To the southeast the ecoregion adjoins the Maranh√£o Baba√ßu forests. In the south it meets the cerrado ecoregion and elements of the Mato Grosso seasonal forests. To the west it adjoins the Xingu-Tocantins-Araguaia moist forests on the other side of the Tocantins River. Physical Most of the region is an alluvial plain formed by the Amazon river. The Serra do Tiracambu and Serra do Gurupi in the southwest are low hills less than high. The Gurup√≠, Capim, and the whitewater Guam√° rivers flow into the mouth of the Amazon and are affected by the daily tides, which force water from the Amazon upstream. The Mearim and Pindar√© empty into the Atlantic Ocean. Soils are mainly low in nutrients and consist of deeply weathered clay. Ecology The ecoregion is in the Neotropical realm and the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome. =Climate= The K√∂ppen climate classification is \\"Am\\": equatorial, monsoonal. Temperatures are fairly steady throughout the year, slightly cooler in August and slightly warmer in April. Average temperatures range from to with a mean temperature of . The ecoregion experiences a dry season for five months of each year, with monthly rainfall of less than . This is most marked in the northwest of Maranh√£o. Rainfall is lowest in September, with less than , and greatest in March, with over . During the wet season the streams and rivers expand and flood the low lying regions. Annual rainfall is about in the north, and in the drier south where the moist forest merges into cerrado shrubland. Mahogany Swietenia macrophylla =Flora= The ecoregion may be a diversification center for many taxa of trees, and in the past the west of the region may have been a refugium. There is a wide variety of species in the dense evergreen rainforest due to the many rivers and to the transitional nature of the flora between the Amazon basin and the drier southern vegetation. The ecoregion contains flooded forests and terra firme forests. The flooded forests are either igap√≥, flooded daily by clear blackwater rivers, or v√°rzea, flooded daily by whitewater rivers that take their color from suspended soil and organic matter. The igap√≥ forests are adapted to acidic white sand soils that are poor in nutrients. The trees are lower and less diverse than in the terra firme forests. Common species in the igap√≥ and v√°rzea include Caraipa grandiflora, Virola surinamensis, Euterpe oleraceae, Ficus pulchella, Mauritia martiana, Symphonia globulifera, and members of the Tovomita and Clusia genera. The most common families in the terra firme forests are Lecythidaceae, Chrysobalanaceae, Burseraceae, Fabaceae, Lauraceae and Sapotaceae. Tree species include Lecythis odora, Lecythis turbinata, Cenostigma tocantina, Bombax tocantinum, and Bauhinia bombaciflora, a large liana. The legume Vouacapoua americana is the most important timber tree, growing only in the east of the Amazon region. Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) is uncommon in the region and there are few orchids. The threatened mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla) may be found along the upper Capim and Guam√° rivers. Other rare or threatened trees include Pilocarpus microphyllus and Dicypellium caryophyllatum. =Fauna= 149 species of mammals have been recorded, of which over 80 are bats. Mammals include red-handed howler (Alouatta belzebul), red-handed tamarin (Saguinus midas), brown-throated sloth (Bradypus variegatus), Linnaeus's two-toed sloth (Choloepus didactylus) and nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus). Endangered mammals include white-cheeked spider monkey (Ateles marginatus), black bearded saki (Chiropotes satanas) and giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis). There are more than 76 species of snakes. The rivers have many fish and aquatic reptiles. Endangered reptiles include green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) and Maranh√£o slider (Trachemys adiutrix). Yellow-rumped cacique (Cacicus cela) in the Parque Ambiental Adhemar Monteiro in Paragominas 517 species of birds have been recorded, including two species of heron that are uncommon in other parts of the Amazon region, tricolored heron (Egretta tricolor) and yellow-crowned night heron (Nyctanassa violacea). Other birds include toucans (genus Ramphastos), red-throated piping guan (Pipile cujubi), white-crested guan (Penelope pileata), parrots, parakeets and many migrant birds from the Nearctic realm. Endangered birds include green- thighed parrot (Pionites leucogaster), red-necked aracari (Pteroglossus bitorquatus) and yellow-bellied seedeater (Sporophila nigricollis). Status The Tapaj√≥s-Xingu, Xingu-Tocantins-Araguaia and Tocantins/Pindare moist forests ecoregions on the eastern edge of the Amazon basin have all been badly affected by human settlement and deforestation. The Xingu-Tocantins-Araguaia ecoregion is one of the most developed in the Amazon region, with most of the habitat threatened by cities and highways. There are large industrial and agricultural developments along the roads and colonization along the rivers. The Tucuru√≠ Dam on the Tocantins below Marab√° flooded of low-lying forest. Over a third of the forests have been cleared, often leaving degraded land. The result is a patchwork of forest remnants, secondary forests, fields, pastures and urban sprawl. Fires are often used to clear land, threatening the remaining forest ecosystems with their many rare species. Seedlings of rainforest trees cannot grow in the dry and eroded pastures, so forest regeneration is difficult. During the period from 2004 to 2011 the ecoregion experienced an annual rate of habitat loss of 0.51%. Global warming will force tropical species to migrate uphill to find areas with suitable temperature and rainfall. Low, flat and deforested ecoregions such as the Tocantins/Pindare moist forests are extremely vulnerable. There are a number of small protected areas. The Caxiuan√£ National Forest covers and offers a degree of protection.

Early life and education  Brenda Sue Feigen was born in 1944 in Falls Church, Virginia to Arthur Paul Feigen, a lawyer, and Shirley Kadison, a housewife. Feigen graduated from high school in 1962 and graduated from Vassar College in the spring of 1966 cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa with a degree in math. She turned down an offer from a fully funded joint J.D./M.B.A. program at Columbia University, and chose instead to attend Harvard Law School. At Harvard, Feigen was one of only 32 women in her law school class of 565 students. Harvard proved to be a hostile place for the few women who attended. Feigen recounted that her property-law professor, A. James Casner‚Äîlater the inspiration for the professor in the movie The Paper Chase‚Äîdesignated only one day a year to call on women in the class, which he dubbed \\"Ladies' Day.\\" In 1968, Feigen married Marc Fasteau, a Harvard Law classmate, in the Harvard Club of New York. She took the name Brenda Feigen Fasteau, and Marc later changed his to Marc Feigen Fasteau. Just before walking down the aisle, Feigen spotted a \\"NO LADIES ALLOWED\\" sign on the Harvard Club of New York library wall. Feigen and her husband were appalled. They appealed to the Harvard Club of New York to allow women among its members, but the board voted to reject the proposal. The newlyweds soon launched a class action lawsuit against the Harvard Club for discriminating on the basis of sex. After five years of legal work, in the last conference before the trial was set to begin, a federal judge ordered the club to take one final vote. The next day, on January 11, 1973, the Club voted 2,097 to 695 to admit female members. Publicly, the Club's outgoing president, Albert H. Gordon, maintained that the vote was unconnected with the discrimination suit filed earlier in the year. Nevertheless, the decision marked a win for Feigen, who would come back together with her fellow plaintiffs in 2008 to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the success.  Feminist activism and legal career  = Legislative activism = In 1970, Feigen was elected National Legislative Vice President for the National Organization for Women (NOW). Though the organization had a 6-month membership eligibility requirement for elected positions, the requirement was waived for Feigen. During Feigen's tenure as national vice president, Democratic senator from Indiana Birch Bayh, chair of the US Senate Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments, asked Feigen to coordinate the Senate testimony for the Equal Rights Amendment. Feigen coordinated the testimony of fellow NOW leaders and fellow activist Gloria Steinem, and testified herself on May 5, 1970. In March 1972, the law passed in the Senate, though it was ultimately not ratified by the requisite number of state legislatures. After the congressional hearings concluded, Feigen returned to New York and was hired as a litigation associate at the law firm Rosenman, Colin, Jaye, Petschek, Freund, and Emil. Feigen continued to serve as the national spokesperson for NOW, regularly appearing on Good Morning America. Later in 1970, Steinem called Feigen to accompany her at Vassar's commencement,Feigen, Brenda. Not One of the Boys. Alfred A. Knopf, 2000, p. 36-38 where Steinem had been asked to speak in her first major public address. The speech was titled \\"Living the Revolution\\", and in it Steinem advocated for a rejection of women's second-class status in society. = The Alliance = In 1972, Feigen left private practice, and she, Steinem, and Catherine Samuels founded The Women's Action Alliance. The mission of the Alliance was to provide resources to women, women's centers, and women's groups to combat and overcome sexism and sex discrimination.Sophia Smith Collection: Agents of Social Change On Line Exhibit, Smith College Letters poured in to the WAA to find \\"feminist psychologists, women lawyers, or doctors, or simply to learn how to bring the women's movement to their hometowns.\\" Steinem's idea for a newsletter for the Alliance eventually turned into Ms. Magazine. The initial meeting to discuss the idea with female journalists was held in Feigen's New York home. However, Feigen focused on the nonprofit, while Steinem took over the outreach through Ms. Magazine. = ACLU: Women's Rights Project = In 1972, Feigen joined Ruth Bader Ginsburg in co-directing the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)'s newly formed Women's Rights Project (WRP). Feigen's legal expertise and experience as the legislative vice president of NOW made her a prime candidate for the job, but she remained unsure as to whether or not she wanted to leave her position at Ms. Magazine. Eventually, with approval from Ms. Magazine co-founder Gloria Steinem, Feigen assumed her position at the ACLU. During her time at WRP, Brenda contributed to the establishment of heightened scrutiny for sex classifications under the Equal Protection Act. An interview with Feigen about this work is featured in the 2018 documentary RBG. = Fasteau and Feigen = In 1974, Feigen left the ACLU to take part in a law partnership with her husband, Marc Feigen Fasteau. The Partnership was a law firm called Fasteau and Feigen, located on Madison Avenue in New York City. Brenda and Marc planned to take on issues of gender, such as defending fathers who sought custody in divorces. Their notable cases include Ackerman v. Board of Education in 1974, where the Feigen Fasteaus defended Gary Ackerman, a father who sought paternity leave in New York City. Brenda was a partner at Fasteau and Feigen from 1974 to 1980.  Political career  In 1978, Feigen ran for the Democratic nomination in the 26th District of the New York State Senate. Feigen ran against former superintendent of banks William Woodward III. Brenda took a leave of absence from Fasteau and Feigen in order to run her political campaign. She eventually lost the race by a slim margin of 3%. Woodward spent $600,000 on his campaign, and Feigen spent $38,000.  Film career  = William Morris Agency = In 1982, Feigen began working as a business affairs attorney at the William Morris Agency in New York. She eventually became a motion picture agent, a position which initiated her further involvement with the film industry. Some of her clients included producers, writers and talent, such as Jane Alexander, Karen Allen, Loretta Swit, and Mike Farrell. = Productions = In 1989, one of Feigen's writer clients introduced her to Chuck Pfarrer, an active Navy SEAL. Once Pfarrer retired, he expanded on his part-time interest in screenwriting and wrote a full screenplay for the film, Navy SEALS, which Feigen would produce. The team hired Richard Marquand as the director, and prepared for production. In 1987, however, Marquand's death halted all production. Lewis Teague was hired as Marquand's replacement, and by September 1989 filming commenced in Spain and Norfolk, Virginia. The film, which follows an elite Navy SEALS unit on a search and destroy mission, was made without any active Navy support because of \\"the top-secret nature of the SEAL's activities.\\" The film was released in 1990 and was Feigen's first production. Feigen also produced the TV show Comedy Lab in 1998 and the film The State of Eugenics in 2016. Feigen gives frequent lectures on various motion picture and entertainment law topics. These include the role of the producer in motion pictures and TV, the roles of agents and attorneys, the content of different entertainment-related contracts, the deals for TV and motion picture writers, and contracts for authors and publishers.  Feigen Law Group  Feigen founded the Feigen Law Group in 2001.Feigen Law Group The firm is based in Los Angeles and its practice areas include business transactions, employment contracts, anti-discrimination law, constitutional law, family law, environmental law, and an investigative division. Feigen also represents companies that need her services concerning mergers and acquisitions with and of other entertainment companies. Feigen is on the Executive Committee of the Beverly Hills Bar Association's Business Law Section.  Published works  = Memoir = In 2000, Feigen published her memoir, Not One of the Boys: Living Life as a Feminist, depicting the sexism she experienced throughout her life and legal career. = Articles = * Books Becoming Movies, ABA Entertainment Forum (2003) * \\"Not On My Watch: Hollywood vs. the Future\\" by Peter Dekom and Peter Sealey, reviewed by Brenda Feigen, ABA Publication, Entertainment and Sports Lawyer Vol. 21, No. 4 (2004) * Same Sex Marriage: An Issue of Constitutional Rights Not Moral Opinions, Vol. 27: Harvard Women's Law Journal (2004) * Why \\"Milk\\" Matters: Proposition (8) Continues (2008) * Proposition 8 Battle Just the Beginning for Gay Marriage Rights, wowOwow (2008) * Who Is (Not) Passing the Buck On Gay Rights?, wowOwow (2009) * Second-Class All the Way: Notes from a worn-down but still hopeful civil rights lawyer, wowOwow (2010) * DOMA is Unconstitutional: An Authoritative Opinion, wowOwow (2010) * Lesbians and Gays Finally Have the Right to Marry: Faith in Reason Returns, wowOwow (2010) * Don‚Äôt Ask; Don‚Äôt Tell (\\"DADT\\")‚ÄîAn Update (2012) * Here's to the 9th Circuit, wowOwow (2012) * The Supremes and Same-Sex Marriage: Day 1 (2013) * Prop 8 and DOMA (2013) * The Supremes and Same-Sex Marriage: Day 2 (2013) * Inside the Supreme Court's First Day of Marriage Equality Hearings (2013) * Marriage Equality Cases (2015)  Personal life  Feigen married Marc Fasteau in 1968.

Though unarmed, he stopped a knife-wielding terrorist from entering the Palace of Westminster during the 2017 Westminster attack; he died from wounds he received in this attack. He had worked for the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) for 16 years, and had joined the MPS's Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Group in April 2016. Police career Palmer had served in the British Army as a Bombardier with the Royal Regiment of Artillery until August 2001 when he was discharged. In November 2001, Palmer joined the Metropolitan Police as a police constable (PC). From 2002 to 2009, he served in the London Borough of Bromley. He then joined the Territorial Support Group, a grouping that specialises in public order and operates across Greater London. In 2015, he was nominated as \\"best thief taker\\" at the Commissioner's Excellence Awards in recognition of making 150 arrests in twelve months. In April 2016, he joined the MPS's Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Group. =Westminster attack= On 22 March 2017, Palmer was in New Palace Yard guarding the Palace of Westminster. At approximately 14:40, he was approached by Khalid Masood, who was armed with two knives. Though unarmed, Palmer confronted Masood in an attempt to stop him. Masood fatally injured Palmer during this encounter. By confronting Masood, Palmer delayed him long enough for an armed police officer to arrive and shoot Masood dead. Funeral Palmer was granted the rare honour of lying in rest in the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft, Palace of Westminster; other recipients of this honour include: the former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 2013 and the former Postmaster General Tony Benn in 2014. On 9 April 2017, his coffin was received into the chapel with a guard of honour of police officers. A private service was then held for his family. Officers kept vigil next to the coffin overnight. The following day, on 10 April, Palmer's coffin travelled in procession to Southwark Cathedral, escorted by motorcycle outriders from the Special Escort Group of the Metropolitan Police. The route was long and avoided Westminster Bridge where the terrorist attack had begun. Instead, the procession crossed the Thames over Lambeth Bridge, during which a ten-second horn salute was given by boats on the river. Tens of thousands of people lined the streets, including 5,000 police officers. The procession was fronted by a colour party carrying the Metropolitan Police Service Standard, who were followed by five mounted police officers. Then came the funeral conductor and chaplains (including Rose Hudson-Wilkin, Chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons) who were walking in front of the hearse. The hearse carried Palmer's coffin which was draped in the police flag, and there were \\"red and white floral tributes atop the hearse\\"; these \\"spelled out 'No 1 Daddy', 'husband', 'son', 'brother', 'uncle' and 'Keith'\\". Making up the rear were cars carrying his family, and four more mounted officers. Palmer was given a full police funeral at Southwark Cathedral. It was attended by his family and friends, and a number of dignitaries including Cressida Dick, the newly appointed Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. Dick read the poem Funeral Blues by W. H. Auden at the service which was her first public engagement since taking up the post. The address was given by Andrew Nunn, the Dean of Southwark. Personal life Palmer was married to his wife, Michelle. They have a daughter, who was aged five at the time of Palmer's death. Palmer was a supporter of Charlton Athletic F.C. and held a season ticket. The club honoured him by replacing his regular seat at The Valley stadium with \\"a white chair bearing his warrant number 'P204752'\\". Honours In the 2017 Birthday Honours, Palmer was awarded the George Medal (GM) \\"for confronting an armed terrorist to protect others and Parliament\\". In recognition of his sacrifice, the Metropolitan Police Service retired his shoulder number (4157U) and stated that it would \\"not be reissued to any other officer\\". His name has been added to the United Kingdom's Police Roll of Honour by the Police Roll of Honour Trust. He was awarded the outstanding bravery of the year award at the 2018 Met Excellence Awards.

Set in Germany, it tells the story of a childless couple where the wife (Romy Schneider) steals back a little boy she gave away in her teens and the husband (Michel Piccoli) gradually persuades her that the childless couple who lovingly raised the child have the better claim. Plot Werner and Julia, a childless middle-class couple in Berlin, face a crisis. Unable to conceive, Julia wants to reclaim a child she gave away at birth when she was single in her teens. The little boy is now six and lives happily in Essen with a childless working-class couple, a Polish immigrant called Radek and his wife. Despite Werner's efforts to dissuade her, she starts stalking the child. As there was no formal adoption, she feels she has a legal as well as a moral right to the boy and one day at the swimming pool she abducts him. Tracing his beloved little boy to Berlin, Radek bursts into the flat and seizes him back. Werner gets Radek arrested at the railway station and regains possession of the lad. It rapidly becomes apparent that not only is Julia's mental balance precarious but she lacks parenting skills. Radek, inconsolable at his loss, climbs a factory chimney and says he will throw himself off if the child is not returned. The media take up the case, with most of the country on the side of the honest couple who raised the boy and against the selfish mother. Shortly before Radek's deadline, Werner persuades Julia to give the boy back, but it is doubtful what kind of marriage is left for the pair.
