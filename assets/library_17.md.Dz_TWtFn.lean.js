It was discovered on 8 September 1991, by Belgian astronomer Eric Elst at Haute-Provence Observatory, St. Michael, in southeast France. The asteroid was named after actor Sean Connery.  Orbit and classification  Seanconnery is a non-family asteroid from the main belt's background population. It orbits the Sun in the inner asteroid belt at a distance of 1.8–3.1 AU once every 3 years and 9 months (1,382 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.28 and an inclination of 6° with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid's observation arc begins 20 years prior to its official discovery observation, with its identification made during the first Palomar–Leiden Trojan survey in 1971.  Physical characteristics  = Rotation period = In August 2006, a rotational lightcurve of Seanconnery was obtained from photometric observations made at the Hunters Hill Observatory () in Ngunnawal, Australia. The lightcurve gave a well-defined rotation period of hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.18 in magnitude (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's space- based Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Seanconnery has an outstandingly high albedo of 0.90 and a diameter of 1.8 kilometers. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and calculates a diameter 3.6 kilometers, as the lower the albedo (reflectivity), the larger an asteroid's diameter for a certain absolute magnitude (brightness).  Naming  This minor planet was named for celebrated Scottish actor and Academy Award winner Sean Connery (born 1930), famous for portraying the character James Bond – after which the minor planet 9007 James Bond is named, starring in seven Bond films between 1962 and 1983. With this minor planet, he is especially honored by the discoverer for his performance as the Franciscan friar William of Baskerville in The Name of the Rose. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 9 March 2001 .

Identical in dimensions and specifications to her sister ship , Campania was the largest and fastest passenger liner afloat when she entered service in 1893. She crossed the Atlantic in less than six days, and on her second voyage in 1893, she won the prestigious Blue Riband, previously held by the Inman Liner . The following year, Lucania won the Blue Riband and kept the title until 1898 - Campania being the marginally slower of the two sisters. Power plant and construction One of Campanias triple expansion engines. Campania and Lucania were partly financed by the Admiralty. The deal was that Cunard would receive money from the Government in return for constructing vessels to admiralty specifications and also on condition that the vessels go on the naval reserve list to serve as armed merchant cruisers when required by the government. The contracts were awarded to the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, which at the time was one of Britain’s biggest producers of warships. Plans were soon drawn up for a large, twin-screw steamer powered by triple expansion engines, and construction began in 1891, just 43 days after Cunards' order. Campania and Lucania had the largest triple expansion engines ever fitted to a Cunard ship, also the largest in the world at the time, and rank amongst the largest of the type ever constructed. The engines were 47 feet in height, reaching from the double-bottom floor of the engine room almost to the top of the superstructure - over five decks. Each engine had five cylinders: two high pressure cylinders, each measuring in diameter; one intermediate pressure cylinder measuring in diameter; and two low pressure cylinders, each measuring in diameter. They operated with a stroke of . Steam was raised from twelve double-end Scotch boilers, each measuring in diameter and having eight furnaces. There was also one single-ended boiler for auxiliary machinery and one smaller donkey boiler. Boiler pressure was , enabling the engines to produce , which translated to an average speed of , and a record speed of 23½ knots. Normal operating speed for the engines was about 79 rpm. Each engine was located in a separate watertight engine compartment. In the case of a hull breach in that area, only one engine room would then be flooded, and the ship would still have use of the adjacent engine. In addition to this, Campania had 16 transverse water-tight compartments with water-tight doors that could be manually closed on command from the telegraph on the bridge. She could remain afloat with any two compartments flooded. During Campania's first trips across the Atlantic, hull vibration was noted to be a problem and sea-spray had been a nuisance to passengers in heavy seas. This led to design modifications being made to Lucania, which was still under construction. The modifications to Lucania proved to be successful, so Cunard decided to make similar modifications to Campania. Campania was returned to the builder's yard and her aft section was strengthened to reduce the vibration. Also, her promenade deck was extended over the forward and aft well-decks. The sides of the well-decks were fully enclosed by plating which extended some way along the lower promenade. While the aft well deck was left open from above, the forward well deck and gangway over it were dispensed with completely. The new forward design would be echoed 14 years later in the design of the Lusitania and Mauretania. Passenger accommodation Handbook issued to passengers on Campania thumb In their day, Campania and her sister offered the most luxurious first-class passenger accommodation available. According to maritime historian Basil Greenhill, in his book Merchant Steamships, the interiors of Campania and Lucania represented Victorian opulence at its peak — an expression of a highly confident and prosperous age that would never be quite repeated on any other ship. Greenhill remarked that later vessels' interiors degenerated into \\"grandiose vulgarity, the classical syntax debased to mere jargon\\". All the first-class public rooms, and the en-suite staterooms of the upper deck, were generally heavily paneled in oak, satinwood or mahogany; and thickly carpeted. Velvet curtains hung aside the windows and portholes, while the furniture was richly upholstered in matching design. The predominant style was Art Nouveau, although other styles were also in use, such as \\"French Renaissance\\" which was applied to the forward first-class entrance hall, whilst the 1st class smoking room was in \\"Elizabethan style\\", comprising heavy oak panels surrounding the first open fireplace ever to be used aboard a passenger liner. Perhaps the finest room in the vessels was the first class dining saloon, over 10' (3.05 m) high and measuring 98' (30 m) long by 63' (19.2 m) wide. Over the central part of this room was a well that rose through three decks to a skylight. It was done in a style described as \\"modified Italian style\\", with the a coffered ceiling in white and gold, supported by ionic pillars. The paneled walls were done in Spanish mahogany, inlaid with ivory and richly carved with pilasters and decorations. Wireless history In 1901, her sister Lucania became the first Cunard liner to be fitted with a Marconi wireless system, followed a few months later by Campania. Shortly after these installations, the two ships made history by exchanging the first wireless-transmitted ice bulletin. Campania earned one more distinction in the history of wireless communication in 1905, when she became the first liner to have permanent radio connection to coastal stations around the world. From that time on, a ship crossing the Atlantic would never be isolated from the rest of the world in the same way again. Final days Campania at the Cunard Pier in New York. Campania and Lucania served as Cunard's major passenger liners for 14 years, during which time they were superseded in both speed and size by a succession of four-funnelled German liners, starting with the in 1897, which sparked off a battle between nations to create the largest most powerful liners such as the Kaiser and Olympic-class ocean liners. The German competition necessitated the construction of replacements for the two Cunarders, which came to fruition in 1907 with the appearance of the and . With the appearance of a third Cunard giant in 1914, , Campania was no longer required. Her last planned voyage for Cunard was her 250th, and commenced on 25 April 1914. On her return to Liverpool, she was chartered to the Anchor Line to do voyages from Glasgow to New York. However, the First World War broke out and Aquitania, having completed only three voyages, was immediately commandeered by the Navy and converted into a fully armed merchant cruiser. Campania was therefore recalled to take her place but unfortunately, she was too old and managed only three voyages before being sold for scrap. Her last voyage as a passenger liner was on 26 September 1914. However, Campania was to have a last-minute reprieve.  HMS Campania  HMS Campania The sinking of Campania While Campania awaited demolition, the Admiralty stepped in at the last minute and bought her with a view of converting her to an armed merchant cruiser that could carry seaplanes. The original idea was to use float-planes which would be lowered into and retrieved from the water by a crane. The conversion was carried out at the Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead. Her interior was completely gutted, and room made inside to store up to 14 aircraft. She was also equipped with eight 4.7\\" (120-mm) guns. The conversion was completed in 1915, and trials took place under Captain Oliver Schwann of the Royal Navy, with Charles H. Lightoller (formerly second officer of ) as the first officer. Two weeks later she joined the fleet at Scapa Flow as , and subsequently began manoeuvres in the North Sea. Her job was to send aeroplanes ahead to scout for the German fleet. After a short period, it was decided to add flight deck at the front of the ship, to enable aircraft to take off directly from the ship without being lowered into the water. Trials following this conversion indicated that the deck was too short, so it was extended to . The alterations required the removal of the forward part of the superstructure, and the first funnel (which was replaced by two narrower funnels on each side). The aft deck was cleared and the aft mast removed, so that she could also serve as an Observation Balloon Ship. Campania now bore little resemblance to her original configuration. HMS Campania served with the Admiralty right up until 5 November 1918--just six days before the armistice was signed, when she was involved in an accident in the Firth of Forth during high winds. Campania dragged her anchor in a sudden squall, and at 03:45 struck the bow of the battleship and then dragged along the side of the battle cruiser . She began to sink stern first. A few hours later an explosion-- presumed to be a boiler--sent her to the bottom. Because of the shallowness of the water, she was considered a danger to shipping and large charges were placed on the decks to demolish her. By 1921 the wreck had been reduced to a safe clearance depth. Further to this destruction it is reported that salvage of valuable metals took place on the wreck, possibly during the late 1940s and the 1960s. Despite this damage, the wreck site today is classified as being of historical importance, being designated under the Protection of Wrecks Act in 2000. This designation was revoked in 2013 when the site was re-designated as a Historic Marine Protected Area under the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010.

This term is typically used when referring to the skills necessary to secure peer-reviewed research funding, but it can also apply more broadly to overall field of fundraising from private foundations, community foundations, corporate foundations, governments, and other grant-makers. The types of grants secured through effective grantsmanship include: * Charitable grants, which generally provide money and/or in-kind resources in support of projects that benefit the public. * Research grants, which typically fund specific types of studies and research conducted by individuals, public agencies, schools, non-profit organizations, and corporations. * Artistic grants, or fellowships, which typically fund a specific artistic production or a particular artist/group. These grants are not the same as scholarships or grants to students. These grants typically require a complex and all- encompassing application to the specific grant-maker in order for a recipient to be considered for a grant. The person who writes the grant application or proposal is called the grant writer. Developing a project Writing a successful grant proposal is a long process that begins with an idea. This idea should be one that will add to the understanding and knowledge of science, medicine, social issues, or other areas that will benefit the common good of society. The writer must spend time considering and conceptualizing how he or she will complete the desired project or program. To help the writer visualize the big picture, drawing a plan or flow chart can be helpful.Tanner, Jim. \\"Steps to Effective Grant Writing.\\" 1995. http://www.kbsolutions.com. Accessed March 30, 2011. After an idea is conceived, it is time to begin the process of creating the grant proposal. “Successful proposal writing involves the coordination of several activities including planning, searching for data and resources, writing and packaging a proposal, submitting the proposal to a funder, and follow-up.”Grant Proposal Writing Tips Mission and goals “Funders don’t give you money because an organization needs it; they give money because the organization can help them carry out their mission.\\"Markin, Karen M. “Words Worth Their Weight in Cash.” April 8, 2005. http://chronicle.com/article/Words-Worth-Their-Weight-in/44895/. Accessed February 24, 2011. A project wishing to receive funding must have goals and objectives that align with the funding source. Immediately after an idea is conceptualized, it is important to clarify the purpose of the project by writing a concise mission statement.\\"Grant Proposal Writing Tips.\\" http://www.cpb.org/grants/grantwriting.html.

A theoretical project contributes to basic knowledge and helps refine current theories in a particular area or proposes a new theory. A methodological project involves the use of new and innovative methods or improvement of existing methods. A project with an applied significance provides answers to real-world problems. Projects that provide society with something useful and valuable have social significance.Casad, Bettina J. “Writing Grant Proposals.

Searching for grants When the idea has been developed into a proposal with goals and objectives, the writer must find the right grant. Resources to assist in finding grants are abundant. In some cases, online searches may help. Individuals and organizations in the United States may be able to apply for federal grants. In the U.S., a person seeking grant funding can also contact the Foundation Center Cooperating Collection which maintains a core collection of print and electronic directories of national grant funders.Minnesota Council on Foundations. \\"Common Types of Grants.\\" http://www.mcf.org/mcf/grant/basics.html.

Depending on the type of project there may be several possible sources for grants, and different funding agencies have different requirements and expectations.Stone, David A. “How Your Grant Proposal Compares.” http://chronicle.com/article/How- Your-Grant-Proposal/47471. July 29, 2009. Accessed February 5, 2011. Program officer In some countries, grant funding agencies may have a program officer who helps organizations and individuals applying for a grant, and who can provide information regarding deadlines, budgetary requirements, and preferences.Markin, Karen M. “The Buck Starts Here.” February 21, 2005. http://chronicle.com/article/The-Buck-Starts-Here/45108/. Accessed February 24, 2011. The officer may be able to offer suggestions, criticism, and advice, or technical assistance including draft reviews. Successful grant proposals Approved proposals are public documents which may be used as indicators of what the funding agency in question is looking for in a grant application. Some major agencies list recent grant recipients and titles of proposals online. In the United States, a grant writer may request copies from the funding agency using the Freedom of Information Act. Collaboration Many grant writers find that collaborating with other professionals when working on a grant proposal can be advantageous because it combines ideas, resources, and abilities.Edwards, Katie M. and Danielle R. Probst. \\"Show Me the Money.\\" Oct 2008. http://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/getArticle.cfm?id=2416. Accessed February 5, 2011. In order for collaboration to be a help rather than a hindrance to the process, it is important to be certain that the people working together have the same work habits to develop clarity and focus and identify gaps in thinking and planning.Kraicer, Jacob. “The Art of Grantsmanship.” May 5, 1997. http://www.hfsp.org/how/ArtOfGrants.html. Accessed February 5, 2011. Qualified experts and interested individuals familiar with the organization and its projects will add quality to the committee, but the grant writer is the key person in the group. The writer will lead, inspire and coordinate the activities and responsibilities of the committee members. Parts of the proposal There are several components included in all grant proposals. An abstract, narrative, literature review and/or data, and methodology are included in all proposals. Some grant funders require more information in a proposal. Many funding agencies now require that applicants include an evaluation plan that shows how the grant recipient will determine if the project is successful or not. Additional information that might be required is data analysis, time tables, letters of support, or plans for dissemination. = Title page = The title page creates the first impression for reviewers. Some funding may have specific requirements for a title page. Typically the title page will include the project title, the institution's name and the date. = Abstract = The abstract is the most read section of the proposal.\\"Writing a Successful Proposal.\\" December 17, 2003. http://www.rit.edu/research/srs/proposalprep/write_proposal.html. Accessed February 4, 2011.

Accessed February 4, 2011. It should serve as an accurate description of the proposal when it stands alone. = Narrative = The narrative is a longer and more detailed explanation of the project.University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Kimberly Abels. “Grant Proposals (or Give me the money!).” http://www.unc.edu/depts/wcweb/handouts/grant_proposals.html. Accessed January 26, 2011. It contains the statement of need and documents the credibility of the applicant's ability to successfully undertake the project and reach the anticipated goals. = Literature review = In the literature review section, the writer will show that he or she has done the necessary research to show that the proposed work will fit into what has already been done in the field. The literature review will show through data that he or she has gathered that the grant will address theoretical, research-based or social issues. This section should include critical evaluation of the literature, show more than one side, and indicate how his or her project is relevant to future research. = Research data = Depending on the type of proposal being submitted, research data that has already been conducted can help prove the relevance and need for new research. Historical data, statistical analysis, graphs and figures, and long term projections can aid in justifying the agency's funding of the project.\\"Nonprofit grant writing mistakes and grant writing tips.\\" 2011. http://www.grants.com. Accessed March 30, 2011.“5 Pitfalls of Grant Writing.” 2011. http://www.grants.com. Accessed March 30, 2011. = Methodology = The methodology is the plan that will be used to accomplish the aims of the project. In this section the writer will explain the specific processes and activities that will be used to conduct research or address social issues. Descriptive, historical, and some theoretical projects greatly depend on methodology just as experimental studies do. In this section, the writer will also describe the sample of participants for the project and tell how he or she will gain access to these participants. He will explain the procedures and processes from the participants’ perspective. If there are multiple groups of participants in a research project, the writer will discuss how cross contamination will be prevented. Potential difficulties and limitations of the proposed procedure should also be discussed. The method of data analysis is identified in this section. The writer will show a clear plan of the way the collected data will be analyzed so that a reviewer will have an accurate picture of the entire project. This section is where the writer will prove to the reviewers that the methods being used are the most appropriate for the project and why other methods were not chosen. = Program evaluation = In some types of applications, a program evaluation may be required. This is different from data analysis in the methodology section. This form of analysis evaluates the stated plan of action, the indicators, and specific measurements for assessing the project's progress toward achievement of the anticipated goals. The evaluation plan should include a formative evaluation to inform the effectiveness of various activities of the project and a summative evaluation to assess the impact and significance of the project on the target audience. The evaluation plan will address the success of the results that can be attributed to the project. = Dissemination of information = The dissemination of information is the way in which the organization plans to share the information gained or successful results of the project with the academic, scientific and social worlds. Dissemination is an extension beyond the scientific exercise which makes an impact on the world. A well-positioned proposal can show how the project can be integrated with service and teaching in course-based and field-based studies. The plan should reflect that the dissemination efforts will be tailored to a target audience and help develop an ongoing, productive relationship with groups dealing with the very problems that the proposed study or project will explore. Proposals that move the latest findings out of the experimental setting into the classroom, home, or community are more likely to be awarded funding than those that will take longer to show desired results. Some suggested mechanisms for dissemination are websites, publications, presentations at conferences, training and education, and/or public outreach through museums or libraries. = Budget = The budget is usually considered last after the merits of the proposal have been decided. This does not mean that it is less important than the other parts of the proposal. The budget spells out project costs and shows in a spreadsheet or a table detailed line items. The most important parts of the project will be allocated the most money.Henson, Kenneth T. \\"Debunking Some Myths About Grant Writing.\\" June 26, 2003. http://chronicle.com/article/Debunking-Some-Myths-About/45256. Accessed February 24, 2011. A project budget may include costs for personnel, equipment, rental of office or laboratory space, and research or conference trips. = Appendices = An appendix includes supplementary data or information to give more in-depth analysis or clarification. Some items included in an appendix are time tables, work plans, schedules, activities, methodologies, legal paperwork, and letters of support or endorsements from the community. Suggestions for specific types of proposals If the proposal is experimental and focuses on new research, it probably consists of a complex series of experiments. After explaining each experiment, restate the point of completing this activity and how it relates to the main purpose of the study. At the end of the methodology section, it is important for the writer to summarize how all of the experiments converge to reach the expected outcome of the project. In a sociolinguistic or theoretical project, the reviewers should be given information about the people who will be interviewed. It is important that they understand how the elicitation procedures will be adequate to obtain the varied population of participants needed for the study. The grant writer needs to explain why the population or database is the right one to work with and how it is capable of providing the kinds of data needed to address the issues of the project. The grant writer should provide samples of data already obtained if possible. Research that will be based on field work will need to be explained carefully for the reviewers to have a clear picture the work that will be completed. They should know that the participants conducting the field work are aware of the conditions they will be working in and are prepared to cope with the elements of the environment. If the project is exploratory or descriptive work, the grant writer should explain the intrinsic value of doing this kind of research and the theoretical relevance. For a proposal aimed at creating a descriptive grammar or dictionary, the grant writer should explain why this document would be significant to the field being studied, the method of organization to be used, the potential users, and how the new book will be better than existing ones. Steps after funding decisions are made After the grant proposal is submitted, the decision making process may take several months. The only thing that is certain is that there are only two end results—funding or rejection. It has been suggested that, particularly for \\"high risk\\" or \\"innovative\\" research programmes, the likelihood of rejection can partially depend on seasonal variation in the evaluators' perception of risk. Regardless of the outcome, there are steps that remain in the grant writing process. = Receiving the grant = As soon as a grant writer is aware that the project has been funded, he or she needs to write a letter of appreciation acknowledging the award. The simplest way that organizations and grant writers are notified that they have received the grant funding is by receiving a cover letter and check by mail. However, many funding agencies require much more. Some agencies require that a contract is agreed upon and returned with the appropriate signatures before the organization can be awarded the grant money. A major part of most of these contracts is a stipulation that a pre-determined number of reports are submitted to the funding agency. If a contract is required, the grant writer should read it carefully and make notes of any requirements or reports that are required. If reports are requested, make sure that they are submitted on time. If a problem arises and the report will be late, the grant writer should be sure to send a written notification and call to make the funder aware of this. If there is an opportunity for a grant to be renewed, the organization should immediately begin collecting artifacts that show the quality of work being completed and achieved during each step of the project. Another important factor after receiving funding is to remain flexible. Funders might ask for adjustments in methods, evaluation or budget. The organization must be willing to alter or modify activities, evaluation or time lines when asked to by the funding agency. Being flexible and willing to work cooperatively with the funding agency are key components in developing positive relationship with the grant funder. This could put the organization and the grant writer in a favorable position for future opportunities between the grant recipient and the funding agency. = Rejection = Rejection is never easy to accept, but it is a reality that only a few of the grant proposals will be funded each cycle. If the grant writer does not hear about the outcome of the grant reviews, it may be necessary to contact the funding agency. Not all agencies notify applicants who were not awarded a grant. Follow-up is important, and a positive phone call is an appropriate way of making contact. When talking to the program officer, the grant writer must avoid feeling angry or combative. The decisions made by the review board were not personal; they were based on how well the goals and expected outcomes of each proposal aligned with the mission of the funding agency. The writer should try to make the call positive and try to determine whether it would be advantageous to reapply in the future. The next step in the follow-up process is to request copies of the reviewers' comments. These are not sent automatically. It is essential for the grant writer to know why the project was rejected. After reading the comments, the writer may realize that the rejection had very little to do with quality of the proposal. The funding agency may have been flooded with applications; and, although they liked the proposal and saw the significance and relevance, they simply ran out of money. Another cause of rejection could be a small point of confusion that the grant writer can easily resolve and resubmit the proposal in the next cycle. These are the best circumstances in which to accept rejection, but most often the rejection is more difficult to overcome because it is due to a lack of merit or the quality of the grant application. It may be hard for the grant writer to read negative comments about a proposal that he or she spent so much time and energy to develop and compose. For some writers it may take a cooling off period before he or she is ready to read the negative comments, and this is an appropriate, positive way to handle the rejection. As tempting as it may be for the grant writer to dismiss the comments of the reviewers, it is in the best interest of the organization to address the suggestions and criticism made about the proposal. The grant writer needs to read and evaluate the reviewers' comments as objectively as possible. After considering the comments about the proposal, he or she should reconsider the alignment of the project goals and the funding agency's mission. If the writer recognizes an incongruity of the goals, his or her time will be better spent finding a new grant to apply for. However, if the grant writer still feels that the goals correspond, he or she needs to determine why the proposal did not work, make necessary changes, resubmit the proposal at the next cycle. The grant writer must understand that rejection does not mean that a proposal should be abandoned. It can be revived and revised and resubmitted. Many grant proposal applications are only successful on the second or third submission. The only time a grant writer can be certain that the grant will not receive funding is when the proposal is not submitted. If the grant writer feels that it is worthwhile to resubmit the proposal in the future, he or she must determine the components of the grant application that need improvement. One way to determine these areas is to have a colleague who is not involved with the project evaluate the reviewers' comments and assess their validity. His or her assessment of the criticisms will assist in developing the proposal in the future. Looking at the criticism through someone else's eyes will help the grant writer become more objective. The grant writer needs to determine the areas of the proposal are weak, confusing, or unsupported. Does the narrative fail to establish the alignment of the goals of the proposal and the funding agency? Does the literature review not show how the project is relevant to the field of study? Does the methodology need to be redesigned? Is the evaluation plan inadequate to determine if the expected goals were met? Is the budget unrealistic? It is imperative that the grant writer meticulously examine the proposal and identify the areas that need to be improved, modified, or eliminated. This will allow him or her to create a document that better communicates the merits of the proposal and how it can contribute to the funding agency's mission.

Moritz Thausing (3 June 1838 - 11 August 1884) was an Austrian art historian, and counts among the founders of the Vienna School of Art History.  Life  The son of a palace official in Schloß Tschischkowitz (modern Čížkovice, near Litoměřice in the Kingdom of Bohemia), Thausing began his academic career as a student of German literature and history. He studied first in Prague, and in 1858 went to Vienna, where he studied at the Österreichische Institut für Geschichtsforschung (Austrian Institute for Historical Research). There he came into contact with Rudolf Eitelberger, who since 1852 had held the first chair in art history at the University of Vienna. Under his influence Thausing began to study the history of art. In 1862 he received an appointment as a library assistant at the Akademie der bildenden Künste, where he also gave general lectures on world and cultural history. In 1864 Eitelberger secured a position for him with the print collection of the Albertina, which he would direct beginning in 1868, although he received the formal title of Director only in 1876. In 1871 Thausing was an active participant in the so-called \\"Holbein convention\\" in Dresden, at which a number of prominent art historians convened to determine which of two versions of Hans Holbein the Younger's Meyer Madonna was the original work. In 1873, once again due to the advocacy of Eitelberger, Thausing was appointed as a professor extraordinarius for art history at the University, and became ordinarius in 1879. A progressive mental illness overshadowed his final years. His health declined dramatically after he became interim director of the newly founded Istituto Austriaco di studi storici in Rome. Following a temporary commitment to a mental hospital, he died during a vacation in his homeland through drowning (probably intentional) in the Elbe near Litoměřice.  Legacy  In methodological hindsight, Thausing played a decisive role in the development of art history as an autonomous discipline. Although his mentor, Eitelberger, had already sought to lend historica research and the aesthetic appreciation of art equal weight, Thausing sought the complete separation of art history from aesthetics. The task of the art historian was, for him, solely the establishment of facts regarding any given work, and not aesthetic judgment. In this regard he was profoundly influenced by the so-called \\"experimental method\\" of the Italian scientist and connoisseur Giovanni Morelli, whom he honored as his \\"fratello in Raffaele\\" (\\"brother in Raphael\\"). Morelli had developed a meticulous procedure, through which he claimed to be able to determine the painter of a work through analysis of physiognomic details. Although this procedure was somewhat inaccessible, it represented a first step toward the comparative stylistic analyses that would serve as a foundation for modern art history. The transition from Morellian connoisseurship to stylistic analysis was conclusively effected by Thausing's students, and in particular by Alois Riegl and Franz Wickhoff, the most important representatives of the Vienna School of art history.

(PB) (HB) IRA career Bell was involved with the Irish Republican Army during the 1956–1962 campaign, but left over the decision to call a cease-fire. He rejoined the republican movement in 1970, and become the commander of the Kashmir Road-based B Company of the Provisional IRA Belfast Brigade. During Gerry Adams' initial career in the republican movement he took much of his direction from Brendan Hughes and Bell. At this time Adams was Bell's adjutant in the Second Battalion of the Belfast Brigade. Hughes was the commander of the D Coy. Adams looked to Bell for political strategy and to Hughes for the opinion of the \\"rank and file\\" volunteers.Ed Moloney, A Secret History of the IRA, p. 114, 2002. (PB); (HB) In 1972, Bell, now Belfast Brigade adjutant, along with Seamus Twomey, Martin McGuinness, and Gerry Adams were flown to London by the Royal Air Force for secret ceasefire talks with British government ministers. Adams and Bell were sceptical about the proposed cease-fire and did not trust the British government. The truce soon broke down, followed by twenty deaths over three days..http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/proni/1972/proni_CAB-9-G-27-6-3_1972-07-10.pdf Escape from Long Kesh In February 1974, Bell was arrested on information provided by one of the \\"Disappeared\\" (informer) Eamon Molloy. He was placed in Cage 11 at Long Kesh along with Hughes and Adams. Fellow internees had nicknamed it the 'General's Cage' because of the number of senior republicans held there.Jim Gibney, Long Kesh revisited An Phoblacht 16 August 2001 On 15 April 1974, Bell escaped when he swapped places with a visitor and walked out of the prison. He was recaptured two weeks later at a flat in the affluent Malone Road area of south Belfast after Molloy had informed the security services of his whereabouts. Chief of Staff In 1982, Martin McGuinness quit as Chief of Staff and Bell took over his position. Bell was arrested, on evidence provided by another supergrass, Robert \\"Beedo\\" Lean, in 1983. In line with IRA rules, contained within the Green Book, Bell lost his position as Chief of Staff, which was then taken by Kevin McKenna from the Tyrone Brigade. Upon release Bell, and fellow prisoner Edward Carmichael, stated that they had both been offered immunity if they would incriminate Sinn Féin elected representatives Danny Morrison, Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness. Carmichael had been offered £300,000 and Bell stated that he was told he could \\"name my own figure\\".IRIS Magazine, November 1983 Libyan connection On release from prison in 1983, Bell was reappointed to the Army Council but did not regain his position as Chief of Staff. Much of his influence had been eroded. Bell was the IRA's representative to Libya during the late 1970s and the early 1980s. Libya and the IRA had a common enemy, the British government. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was heavily criticised in Libya for allowing US planes to take off from British air bases for raids on Libya in which more than seventy people were killed.Ed Moloney, A Secret History of the IRA, pp 14–15, 2002. (PB) (HB) In late 1984 and early 1985 the Libyan Intelligence Service moved to put in place a supply of arms to the IRA in order that they could more effectively fight the British Army, and Bell and Joe Cahill were instrumental in putting in place the Libyan arms smuggling plan. Court martial In 1984, Bell openly opposed Adams' proposal to increase spending on election campaigns instead of the war against Britain. Bell was a hard-line militarist who opposed the use of funds by Sinn Féin and resented moves to end abstentionism. Bell emerged as the head of a group, which included senior figures like Danny McCann. In June 1985, Bell was dismissed from the IRA.David Sharrock, Hard-liners left 'crying into their beer The Daily Telegraph 24 October 2001Brendan O'Brien, The Long War: The IRA & Sinn Féin, p.133, 1999. (PB) 2014 arrest and charge Bell was arrested by the Police Service of Northern Ireland on 18 March 2014 for questioning in relation to the abduction and murder of Jean McConville in 1972. Bell, aged 77, has been charged with aiding and abetting murder and membership of the IRA. He appeared in court on 22 March 2014 and was initially refused bail, though it was granted on 26 March. On 7 July 2016 it was announced that Bell would stand trail for McConville's murder. His lawyers had argued for the charges to be dropped, claiming a lack of evidence to support a trial. The charges arise from the Boston College tapes that led the US Justice Department, acting on behalf of the UK Government, to issue a subpoena to Boston College for the tapes and transcripts of the Belfast Project. His trial has been postponed due to the claim by Bell's legal team that he suffers from dementia and would not be able to fully participate in the trial. In a ruling of the Belfast Crown Court in October 2019 Bell was cleared of involvement in the murder of Jean McConville. The Boston tapes were deemed unreliable and could not be presented as evidence in the trial.

Metopon is sometimes used in medicine, although longer acting than hydromorphone, Metopon is less potent and its oral bioavailability is fairly low. Generally, Metopon has few advantages to distinguish it from other, more commonly used opioid analgesics, although it does have a slightly lower tendency to produce nausea and respiratory depression compared to morphine. In Canada, as of 1948, the hydrochloride of metopon (free base conversion ratio 0.891, molecular weight 335.8) was available only for oral administration for malignant pain and for maintenance of those habituated to morphine; the only dosage form available was singly scored 8 mg tablets. It was manufactured by Parke, Davis, & Co., and was only for sale to doctors and hospitals. Parke, Davis & Co. did not sell metopon to pharmacies. It is unknown whether metopon tablets are still manufactured and sold in Canada. Metopon tablets, ampoules, and suppositories are available in Switzerland, Austria, Germany, and other countries in Continental Europe and the drug is used in Patient Controlled Analgesia pumps for severe chronic pain in particular. Metopon is listed under Schedule II of the US Controlled Substances Act 1970, meaning it has an accepted medical use, but at this time it is not produced commercially and is seen only in laboratory research. It did see some use in medicine — oncology in particular — in the US in the 1950s. Currently metopon, which has a DEA ACSCN of 9260, does not have an annual manufacturing quota listed in the Federal Register and the bulk of the research on the drug at this time is taking place in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria.

Hideyoshi's half-brother Hashiba Hidenaga led 90,000 men, landing near Takajō (Taka Castle). Within the previous several years, the Shimazu clan of Satsuma province had spread across the island, seizing the Ōtomo clan capital of Funai (Funai Castle). In doing so, they had become a significant power in the region, and threatened Hideyoshi's supremacy over Japan. Hidenaga's forces pursued the Shimazu beyond Takajō, and began to besiege the fortress. Shimazu Iehisa then turned his force of 20,000 around, clashing with a detachment of 15,000 Toyotomi warriors. Three thousand Shimazu warriors dismantled the fortifications of the besiegers, and distracted them long enough to effect a cavalry attack. However, they then found themselves flanked by 1500 Toyotomi warriors, who made every effort to give the appearance of a larger force in the Shimazu's rear, cutting off their escape. Fighting their way through the Toyotomi forces, the Shimazu effected a retreat, leaving Takajō and the surrounding area to Hidenaga.

Bestival 2006 was the third annual Bestival organised by the Rob da Bank's Sunday Best label. It was held at Robin Hill Country Park on the Isle of Wight from 8 to 10 September. Around 17,000 people attended the three-day event. The Bestival is often referred to as a \\"mini-Glastonbury\\" with regards to the excellent atmosphere the festival generates. Bestival 2006 had a distinct sense of environmental and social consciousness. Indeed, the Bestival is one of the most ethically aware of the UK popular music festivals. This is reflected in the eclectic crowd it attracts and the vast array of fancy dress displayed at the 2006 event, including a Jimi Hendrix complete with guitar and amplifier, as well as a Viking Longboat with crew. Bestival 2006 won Best Medium to Large Festival at the UK Festival Awards. There were fourteen musical venues at the Bestival 2006. These were - Main Stage, The Big Top, The New Bollywood Bar, The Blue Pavilion, Southern Comfort Fat Tuesday, Rock 'n' Roll Tent, Come Dancing, Hidden Disco, Bandstand, Sense 3D Area, Xbox Lost and Sound, The Guardian Lounge, Loose Tea Tent, Studio 3. An album was released containing various Bestival tracks since its inauguration in 2004. The Bestival Bugle was a 2006 single sheet newsreel distributed every day throughout the festival, containing Bestival information, tips and comic features. Bestival Radio (87.7 FM) was also established in order to give Bestival goers a live tab on action of the event. 2006 Festival Triumphantly dubbed by organisers Sunday Best as, 'the festival of the year (because Glastonbury was not on this year)', this is a typical quote which encapsulates the ambition and humour that both organisers and festival goers give to the annual Bestival. However the claim had a greater foundation than most would imagine as a crowd of 15,000 were treated to a 3-day frenzy of Boutique festival madness which has quite rightly been dubbed the mini- Glastonbury. Some of the most notable performances were produced by the Scissor Sisters, The Stranglers, Gogol Bordello, FAT Samba and Youngblood Brass Band. The Scissor Sisters widely recognised as the best act of the weekend were inspirational using dry ice, strobe lighting, paper streamers and shooting various stage items onto the crowd to impress the crowd into submission. Witty conversation, Fantastic showmanship and a euphoric audience reception were some of the ingredients of the dish of the day. The Stranglers drew upon their back catalogue and a large audience all singing to the tunes of Golden Brown and Peaches amongst others. Fat Samba drew on a large, excited crowd as they lead the fancy dress parade, tight drumming and eccentric costumes helped to win over the crowd. Gogol Bordello were an unknown quantity initially but after their set it became clear they were an eccentric, innovative and colossal quantity of music talent, lead singer Eugene Hutz was particularly entertaining, reminiscent of Freddie Mercury on stage. Youngblood Brass Band dazed the crowd with their no nonsense, get on stage and perform attitude. The unusual miz of trombones, trumpets, drummers, a tuba player and a rapper/snare drummer, the band performed an energetic set got the crowd jumping and dancing.  Clown controversy  The stilted clowns who appeared towards the end of Scissor Sisters' set Following on from 2005's dressing attempt, the organisers of the festival decided to make this year's theme the circus and to have everyone dressed as clowns. On 8 July 2006, it was announced that this had been scrapped as festival-goers asked for refunds as they were scared of clowns. The Scissor Sisters opened their set dressed in clown costumes, singer Ana Matronic joking \\"Sorry guys, we didn't get the memo.\\"  Line Up  = Main Stage = Friday * Gogol Bordello * Mystery Jets * Mark Ronson * The Fall * Cagedbaby * The Sunshine Underground * Barry Peters Halifax Hospital Radio * James Yorkston and The Athletes Saturday * Pet Shop Boys * Guillemots * Rachid Tara Ban with Brian Eno * Kid Creole & The Coconuts * The Cuban Brothers * Lily Allen * Man-Machine * Kanda Bongo Man * John Martyn * Kitty Daisy & Lewis * King Creosote Sunday * Scissor Sisters * Amadou & Mariam * Devendra Banhart * Hot Chip * The Stranglers * The Young Knives * Tunng * The Hat * The Aliens * Jegsy Dodd = Other Stages = Friday * Get Cape.

Convention chair Kyle had a messenger tell the \\"Balcony Insurgents\\" that Kyle had said they could not sit there. Since almost every fan who wrote about the convention reported the incident, \\"Dave Kyle Says You Can't Sit Here\\" became a fannish catchphrase. (\\"Balcony Insurgents\\") 14th World Science Fiction Convention, 1956. The primary bid for the 15th World Science Fiction Convention was for London. This would be the first Worldcon outside North America, and there was a small but vocal jingoistic faction of Americans who argued for retaining the Worldcon in North America, claiming \\"If we let them have it they'll never give it back\\". Their campaign against the London proposal was opposed by other Americans, most audibly Anthony Boucher, and the London bid won by an ample margin, to loud cheers. There were reportedly petty efforts even after the vote was over to sabotage the London bid, but they failed to hinder it.

Her obituary notice states she was 85 at her death. – 17 August 2015) was a British social worker, company secretary and Conservative Party politician. She served ten years as Member of the European Parliament for North Wales, and made several attempts to obtain election to the House of Commons. She was sometimes nicknamed the \\"Celtic Iron Lady\\".Maev Kennedy, \\"Diary\\", The Guardian, 11 May 1993. Education Brookes was educated at Lowther College in Abergele'Brookes, Beata Ann' in Who's Who 2012 (London, A. & C. Black) and went on to the University of Wales, Bangor. She obtained a scholarship from the State Department to study politics in the US. She began to work as company secretary and director of a North Wales firm. Political activity Her early interest in politics took her into the Conservative Party and she was elected to the executive of the National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations. She was also elected as a Conservative to Rhyl Urban District Council, and in the 1955 general election she fought Widnes which was a marginal Labour-held seat. She lost by only 1,449 votes. She later worked for Denbighshire County Council as a social worker, and as a farmer. In 1961 she was Conservative candidate in the Warrington by-election, a safe Labour seat. At the 1964 general election she fought in Manchester Exchange. She was appointed by the Conservative government to the Welsh Hospital Board in 1963, where she remained for eleven years. Although she had married Anthony Arnold, in May 1963 they were divorced and she announced that she wished to remain known as Miss Beata Brookes. Local posts From 1973 Brookes was a member of Clwyd Area Health Authority, where she served on the Family Practitioner Committee, and was also co-opted onto Clwyd County Council Social Services Committee. She was a member of the Council for Professions Supplementary to Medicine and had several voluntary sector posts in North Wales relating to the disabled and mentally handicapped. European Parliament At the 1979 European Parliament election, Brookes was elected as Conservative MEP for North Wales. She was a strong supporter of British membership of the European Communities and in 1981 at the Conservative Party conference moved a motion condemning the then Labour policy of leaving it; she argued that such a policy would leave Britain weak, friendless, isolated and bankrupt. She pointed to statistics about the economy and trade with Europe to claim that one job in three depended on Britain staying in. Selection dispute Brookes made a determined effort to be selected for the boundary changed constituency of Clwyd North West at the 1983 general election, over the claims of the sitting MPs for West Flintshire (Sir Anthony Meyer) and Denbigh (Geraint Morgan). The selection contest attracted national attention and Conservative Central Office decided to stay out of the dispute. On 6 March, Brookes won the selection vote in the Clwyd North West Conservative Executive, with Meyer describing the meeting as having been fixed and Morgan saying that speaking at the meeting was \\"like speaking to a nobbled jury\\". Conservative Party chairman Cecil Parkinson then intervened, arising out of a newspaper report that Brookes claimed Central Office put her forward for the nomination (Meyer was a leading \\"wet\\" who was not popular with the Conservative leadership). When the Executive of Clwyd North West Conservative Association placed only Brookes' name before the general membership for adoption, Meyer won a High Court judgment that his name should also be offered. When the full membership met on 9 May 1983, Meyer was narrowly adopted. Further political life Brookes remained in the European Parliament. She protested in December 1983 over a BBC interview with the Welsh republican John Jenkins, who had been jailed for a bombing campaign at the time of the investiture of Charles, Prince of Wales. In the European Parliament she was a member of the Education and Agricultural Committees. She was defeated by the Labour Party candidate at the 1989 European Parliament elections. She remained involved in Welsh Conservative politics and in 1993 was chair of the Welsh Conservative Party, and proclaimed her support for John Major at a time when he was under fire from within the party. She was appointed Chair of the Welsh Consumer Council, but her re- appointment in 1994 went ahead despite criticism from the National Consumer Council that despite her ability, a non-political choice would be more appropriate.Chris Blackhurst, \\"Memo fuels concern at Tory link to public life\\", The Independent, 2 May 1994. She was awarded the CBE in 1996. On 3 May 2013 she joined UKIP. Car boot sales Although retired, she was still considered newsworthy in 2003 when she won permission to hold more \\"car boot sales\\" on her land at Rhuddlan on 14 Saturdays in a year. She had in 2000 obtained permission to hold sales on 28 Sundays in a year, and also offered the land for use for fireworks displays and the National Eisteddfod of Wales.Derek Bellis, \\"Ex-Euro MP wins boot sale battle: Council must pay thousands in appeal costs\\", Daily Post, 27 November 2003.

The game was released exclusively on the PlayStation Portable. Gameplay Identical to other Dynasty Warriors games, the game characters and models are all from Dynasty Warriors 5, but it includes new features and some from Dynasty Warriors (PSP), including multiplayer fight up to 4 players and the ability to trade officers wirelessly with other players. In addition, Vol. 2 fixes the HUD problem found in the original Dynasty Warriors PSP title. Like the previous Dynasty Warriors PSP title, the game features unique characters from the Samurai Warriors series as special bodyguards. In this game, the characters and their models are taken from Samurai Warriors 2. Unlike the Dynasty Warriors series' console iterations, the map is divided into a grid system. Each grid contains enemy troops that will retreat if their morale bar hits 0. Sometimes it is necessary to defeat the enemy officers before the enemy retreats. Each stage usually has two winning conditions, each of which will lead to another possible battle stage. In this way, the story can be quite different each time you play. The player will earn extra officers after each map is completed. More officers can be gained by either completing a certain character's Musou mode, obtaining 100% in a stage or clearing an entire faction's stages 100%. As the player unlocks more and more officers, the player has a very wide range of characters to choose from as subordinates, with both many advantages and costs. The player can only have between 1 and 4 officers in battle at the same time, depending on the rank of the officers. The player earns more officer command points after each level up. Some officers only cost 1 command point, but some of the more famous officers cost above the 20 command point mark. Some officers also have special skills you can use by choosing the officer with the D-Pad and then pressing Right on the D-Pad. Most effects are similar to the old 'spoils of war' in previous games, such as replenishing the Musou bar or attack up for 30 seconds. The special abilities can be used every time a star is present on the character's name. The star will then turn into a red circle, which is gradually filled with white, until it becomes a star again. Stages Each kingdom (Wei, Wu, Shu, and Other) has its own unique stage map. The path each player takes through the levels depends on conditions met in each level: the levels have either one or two conditions, of which one must be met for victory. The player begins with a limited number of levels; additional levels will be unlocked during gameplay. All levels have a hidden treasure trove (a couple have two) and/or a \\"village mission\\" that the player may conquer during gameplay. Doing so, along with meeting the condition(s) for victory, will unlock the additional levels.Chen Jia Tong. \\"Treasure Troves Location.\\" Neoseeker.com. Treasure Trove areas require that you to defeat a strong \\"Bonus\\" enemy officer, many of the \\"Bonus\\" officers are from the Samurai Warriors series. If you defeat them quickly they will join you. Village Missions on the other hand involve defeating a certain number of bandits or defending villagers or mayors in a minute. Sometimes the mission can be to defeat the bandit leader. If the mission fails, the village is lost, and the player cannot complete that mission again without reverting to an older save, or playing the map again. Reception The game received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of two eights, one seven, and one eight, for a total of 31 out of 40.

The Twinings Museum is a small museum adjacent to the Twinings shop at 216, Strand, in London.About Twinings Shop & Museum, Visit London.Twinings Museum, LondonNet. Thomas Twining moved with his family from Gloucester to London in 1684, when he was nine years old. After serving an apprenticeship as a weaver in the City of London, Twining worked for the East India Company merchant Thomas D'Aeth, and became a tea merchant. Twining purchased Tom's Coffee Shop, in Devereux Court, off the Strand, in 1706. He subsequently used the premises to sell tea to customers, in addition to the more common coffee, and to sell dry tea to both customers and other nearby coffee shops, such as the Grecian Coffee House - now the site of The Devereux public house - and George's Coffee House across Devereux Court. Tea was then an expensive luxury product. Twining's business was quickly successful, which enabled Twining to expand into adjacent premises on the Strand. By 1717, Twining was trading at 216 Strand, at the sign of the Golden Lyon, where the business remains. The classical door case is surmounted by a pediment with a statue of a golden lion, and two figures of Chinese men who signify the origin of the beverage. The Twining business expanded in 1825 to include a bank that financed tea trading, which operated at 215 Strand from 1835 until it merged with Lloyds Bank in 1892. The tea business became known as \\"R. Twining\\" after Robert Twining became its director in 1771. Twinings received a Royal Warrant from Queen Victoria in 1837. The Royal Warrant is displayed at the museum. The museum also displays vintage tea caddies, examples of Twinings packaging, and other tea memorabilia and ephemera. The museum explains the history of the Twinings family. The Twinings tea business is now owned by Associated British Foods.

Paulraj (born 14 April 1944) is an Indian-American electrical engineer, academic and retired naval officer. He is a Professor Emeritus in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. Early life  Paulraj was born in Pollachi near Coimbatore, British India in 1944, one of six children of Sinappan Arogyaswami and his wife Rose. He joined the Indian Navy at age 15 through the National Defense Academy, Khadakvasla and served the Indian Navy for 26 years. Paulraj received a B.E. in electrical engineering from the Naval College of Engineering, Lonavala, India, and a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India  Career in India  Paulraj’s contributions in India came whilst serving in the Indian Navy. In 1972, he developed an improved trans- receiver-display for a British origin Sonar 170B. The technology was widely deployed in the Indian fleet. During 1977- 83, Paulraj led the development of a large surface ship sonar APSOH. This sonar became the fleet sonar for the Indian Navy and its variants are still widely deployed. APSOH was a landmark achievement in Indian Electronics. Later, Paulraj founded three national level research centers in India: the Center for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Defense R&D; Organization, the Central Research Laboratories, Bharat Electronics, and the Center for Development of Advanced Computing, Dept. of Electronics (as co-founder). These labs are now a part of India’s vast R&D; infrastructure. He attained the rank of Commodore. In the 1980s, Arogyaswami was \\"laughed out of the Service\\" after he suggested MIMO or \\"multiple input, multiple output\\". The same technology made billions outside India.  Career in USA  Paulraj joined Stanford University in 1991. His invention (1992) for exploiting multiple antenna at both ends of a wireless link (MIMO) lies at the heart of the current high speed WiFi and 4G mobile phones, and has revolutionized high speed wireless services for billions of people. MIMO boosts data rate by creating parallel data streams, multiplying throughput by the number of antennas used. Paul’s contributions went beyond MIMO’s invention - his large research program at Stanford and two pioneering start-up companies: Iospan Wireless for MIMO-OFDMA core technology (acquired by Intel), and Beceem Communications for WiMAX chips (acquired by Broadcom), have helped create an wireless technology eco-system now shipping billions of MIMO wireless devices annually. More recently he founded Rasa Networks (acquired by Aruba /HPE) for using AI tools in WiFi network analytics. He is on the advisory board of Cohere Technologies Inc. Paulraj has two textbooks on MIMO. He is a co-inventor in over 80 patents.

It derives its name from Nicolaas Kruik (1678–1754), a Dutch land-surveyor and one of many promoters of a plan to pump the Haarlemmermeer (Haarlem lake) dry. Like many well-educated men of his time, he latinized his name to Nicolaus Samuel Cruquius. During his lifetime the issue of the Haarlem Lake and how to pump it dry was international news, as the following excerpt from the Virginia Gazette on 31 May 1751 illustrates: :\\"By a private letter from Rotterdam, we are told, that the Dutch Engineers, in their Plan for draining the lake of Haerlem, proposed to employ 150 mills for three Years, and had computed the Expence at a Million and Half of Florins, but that a German, who had been long employed in the Mines of Hungary and Hartz, had proposed to drain it with 50 machines, in 15 months, at a far less Expence; and that he has been ordered to erect one of those Machines, which, if it shall be found to execute what he has asserted, his Proposal will be immediately accepted.\\" Even 50 machines proved too expensive, so it was not until successful experiments with steam pumping stations, such as at nearby Groenendaal park in 1781, that serious plans resulted in three steam-driven pumping stations, including the one at Cruquius. As a tribute to former planners, the pumping stations of the Haarlemmermeer were named after them. The one at the mouth of the Spaarne river, near Heemstede, was called Cruquius. To service the mill, the workers who lived there founded the town of the same name. The dike was built in the 1840s, the pump started work in 1850 and in the three years that had been predicted a century before, the Haarlem lake was pumped dry. The pumping station Cruquius continued to work on and off until 1933, when it was made into a museum. The foreman's house was made into a café which it still is today. Heritage site The pump house at Cruquius is a Netherlands 'Rijksmonument' for the historical engine. It has also been declared an Anchor Point of ERIH, The European Route of Industrial Heritage. It is thought to be the largest steam engine - and certainly the largest beam engine - ever built. The engine was built by Harvey & Co, of Hayle, Cornwall. The diameter of the piston is . Outside, the ringvaart canal's system of sluices, mills, and bridges, are all part of the Stelling van Amsterdam, the main dike of which runs just north of Cruquius, through Vijfhuizen. Fort Vijfhuizen is used for art exhibitions and is a short walk north of the museum along the ringvaart. What is less known is that there is also a fort Cruquius, just south of the museum, that also has World Heritage status because of its link to the Stelling van Amsterdam. The Cruquius Pumping Station was named a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1991.

She was the daughter of Simon Luttrell, later first Earl of Carhampton, and his wife, Judith Maria Lawes.The Peerage- Lady Anne Luttrell Her father was a Member of the House of Commons before being created Baron Irnham in 1768, Viscount Carhampton in 1781 and Earl of Carhampton in 1785. Marriages Anne was first married to a commoner, Christopher Horton (sometimes spelled Houghton) of Catton Hall, on 4 August 1765.The Gentleman's Magazine, vol. 35, August 1765. p. 395. She later married Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn, the sixth child of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, and a younger brother of George III. Their marriage took place at Hertford Street in Mayfair, London on 2 October 1771. George III did not approve of the marriage as Anne was a commoner and previously married. He later had the Royal Marriages Act 1772 passed to prevent any descendant of George II marrying without the consent of the sovereign, a law which remained in effect until passage of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, which, in addition to several other modifications, limited the requirement to obtain royal consent to only the first six persons in line to the throne (rather than all descendants). The Cumberlands moved to York House, renamed Cumberland House, on Pall Mall and lived there until the Duke's death in 1790. In 1800, the widowed Duchess surrendered it to the banks who held mortgages on it.

That her eyes were remarkably expressive is confirmed by the several portraits of Anne by Thomas Gainsborough, one of which is in the Hugh Lane collection.

At the age of 16 years Chan quit his regular school and became a full-time teaching assistant to Gan Dak Hoi at the Hong Kong school. Chan Sau Chung also learned Da Sheng Pi Gua from Gan Dak Hoi, who in turn had learned it from its founder Kau Sei (Kou Si) 寇四. Having learned the entire Pi Gua system, Gan Dak Hoi then taught his young protege all five styles of Da Sheng Kung Fu. As Chan's knowledge and expertise in Da Sheng Pi Gua grew Gan Dak Hoi would take him into the mountains outside of Hong Kong for special training in Da Sheng kung fu. This included walking tightropes, scrambling up ropes, rolling around on rocky ground and walking around in a slightly bow legged monkey styled squat until his legs burned. However, not all training included physical exercise as once or twice each week Chan would go to the Kam Shan Country Park (金山郊野公園) just outside Hong Kong to watch the monkeys play, fight, frolic and generally be themselves. He gradually incorporated their gestures, eye movements, facial expressions and their short sharp burst of speed in his kung fu routines. Opening of first school Chan Sau Chung and three of his batch mates Lam Sy Fun, Hiu Hoi and Chow Sing Fun were selected by Gan Dak Hoi and authorised to teach Da Sheng Pi Gua. In 1954, at the age of 22, Chan Sau Chung opened his first school in Hong Kong. It had only eleven students nonetheless, Chan Sau Chung was determined to continue teaching kung fu, things remained very slow and low-keyed until the late sixties when monkey kung fu burst onto the international scene. Trainer of champions In 1969, Chan's student Chan Goon Tai won five straight matches to claim the middleweight title in the Southeast Asia Open Martial Arts Tournament. For the next three years Chan sent a fighter who won his weight class. After having trained four South-east Asian champions, Chan Sau Chung retired. Over the years Chan Sau Chung has trained many students. Hong Kong Kung Fu Association Chan Sau Chung established the Hong Kong Kung Fu Association Ltd. in 1977 to better organise the kungfu community in Hong Kong. He was elected as the Chairman in 1978. Under his supervision, the Association gave many charity shows and all receipts from sales tickets were donated to charity institutions. The most significant one was the \\"Saving Child Sponsoring Schooling\\" campaign organized by the Hong Kong Wah Kiu Yat Poa. The Malaysian Government sent a Senior Governor to Hong Kong to invite him to give performance charity shows in Malaysia in 1978. He led a group over 30 people and gave shows in 5 cities in Malaysia. Chan is also the chairman and consultant of the other major kungfu associations in Hong Kong, and he is the Permanent Honorary President & Vice Chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese Martial Arts Association. Da Sheng Pi Gua International Kung Fu Federation Chan Sau Chung formally launched the Da Sheng Pi Gua International Kung Fu Federation in Hong Kong on December 7, 2000. It sought to lend organisation and structure on a worldwide basis, to the teaching of genuine Da Sheng Pi Gua Kung Fu together with this, the official Federation website was also launched. The Federation's website offered site visitors a view into the origin, development and evolution of Da Sheng Pi Gua Kung Fu as well the option to learn Da Sheng Pi Gua Kung Fu by taking video courses. These courses were offered at four levels as follows: * Beginner * Intermediate * Advanced and * Masters. Each level had its own costs and students would be provided with video taped lessons containing the curriculum for that level which included stances, strikes and various forms and were allowed to train at their own pace and at the point where they felt comfortable they were required to make video recording of themselves doing the forms and send these to the Federation for grading and assessment. At the Beginners level the stances and strikes were very basic and the forms were really an introduction to Pi Gua Kung Fu. As each student progressed, the material provided got more advanced and there was a gradual introduction to Da Sheng Kung Fu. It was mandatory that each student go through the natural progression of successfully completing each level, be assessed and if successful, permission would be granted to advance to the next higher level. No skipping of levels was allowed whatsoever. It was at the Advanced level that the student began learning advanced Monkey Forms. The length of time required to complete each level depended on the each student, whether they were practising kung fu prior to commencing the program, how often they trained and how committed they were to the program. The Beginners level was expected to take anywhere from six to eighteen months, Intermediate was expected to last between twelve and thirty months, Advanced was expected to last between eighteen and forty months while at the Masters level the student would be required to train in Vancouver under direct supervision from Master Chan Kai Leung and Grandmaster Chan Sau Chung. The Master's level period of training could take upward of five years prior to successful completion. It is important to again note that no skipping of levels was allowed so no student could enter the program at the Master's level. Bear in mind also that there are five variations taught by the Federation (lost monkey, stone monkey, wooden monkey, tall monkey and the drunken monkey) and that there are upwards of one hundred and twenty-six weapon and empty hand forms. At various levels, approved students were permitted to participate in tournaments as members of the Da Sheng Pi Gua International Kung Fu Federation. Upon successful completion of the Master's level training, students would be graded and where appropriate certified by Grandmaster Chan Sau Chung to open their own Da Sheng Pi Gua Kung Fu schools. Together with the video taped lessons, Intermediate level students were initially provided with a book written jointly by Chan Sau Chung and his son Chan Kai Leung, entitled \\"Essence Of The Monkey\\". This book gave very detailed insights into the development of Da Sheng Pi Gua Kung Fu and provided information obtained directly from Gan Dak Hoi himself etc. It also provided information on ALL students who were trained by Gan Dak Hoi and which ones were certified to teach Da Sheng Pi Gua Kung Fu. The Federation continues to update this family tree with the modern day students who have mastered all five variations but only those from the lineage previously certified by Gan Dak Hoi. For reasons related to the preservation of information, the Federation came to the conclusion that it had to take down the website and make the \\"Essence Of The Monkey\\" book available to its Advanced and Masters students only.

Taxonomy and systematics Alternate names for the red-lored whistler include the buff- breasted whistler and red-throated whistler. Description The red-lored whistler is similar, in many respects, to Gilbert's whistler, to which it is closely related, and from which it must be distinguished: the range of the red-lored whistler falls entirely within that of the Gilbert's whistler. The two species share the same habitat, behaviour and even many calls. John Gould, who described both species, was not familiar with the Gilbert's whistler: this is surprising, as the path that he travelled took him through areas where the Gilbert's whistler is not uncommon. It is possible that, in the absence of specimens, even Gould confused the two species. Distribution and habitat The red-lored whistler is generally restricted to the “Big Desert” or “Ninety- mile Desert” country of south-eastern South Australia and western Victoria, but which is now regularly observed north of the River Murray (at Gluepot Reserve, South Australia) and at Round Hill Nature Reserve in outback New South Wales, and has been recorded from Pinkawillinnie Conservation Park (near Kimba, Eyre Peninsula), and in the vicinity of Adelaide, from where the type specimen was allegedly collected. In every case, the habitat is mallee woodland. The species has long been regarded as sedentary, but one, probably two records from near Adelaide (from where it is unlikely to be overlooked, and very distant from the remainder of its known range) suggest that movements do occur. Behaviour and ecology The presence of the red-lored whistler is most often revealed by its calls, which are sweet and varied, but may not always be strong. While it is often seen perched in trees and shrubs, it feeds, for the most part, on the ground, and may be quite difficult to find. Individuals will respond to “pishing”, and will approach a “pisher”. =Threats= The red-lored whistler is at some risk, as its range is limited and its habitat subject to summer bushfires. Status Red-lored whistlers are listed as vulnerable on the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and large parts of its range are protected, as National Parks and other reserves. However, their conservation status also varies from state to state within Australia. For example: * The red-lored whistler is listed as threatened on the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act (1988).Department of Sustainability and Environment, Victoria Under this Act, an Action Statement for the recovery and future management of this species has not yet been prepared.Department of Sustainability and Environment, Victoria * On the 2007 advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna in Victoria, the red-lored whistler is listed as endangered.

Propeller drive before track drive Homebuilt snowplane from the 1930s pre-dating the Kristi concept snowplane illustrating traditional rigid skis 1963 Polaris snowplane, like other non-Kristi designs, did not use the \\"Christie\\" ski action, this results in the rear skis skidding across the snow surface through turns According to the introduction, contained in the operators manual: \\"The development of the Kristi snow vehicles began in early 1947 in the form of a very unusual snow plane. This propeller driven vehicle utilized a control by which the operator could tilt the machine from side to side, in effect raising one ski and lowering the other to negotiate up to 45-degree side slopes and permit high-speed turns without skidding. This tilting and edging of skis after the manner of a skier was called \\"Ski- Action\\". Since it could do a \\"Christie\\" up or down hill, the trade name \\"Kristi\\" was adopted.\\" The Kristi snowplane featured a revolutionary change in ski handling concepts. As stated in the manual, the design was inspired by snow skiers who angled their skis to effect a turn (this angling of skis is called a Christie) and it allows for both higher speed turns and greater control. The theoretical advantage of the Kristi system in a snowplane would make for safer and faster turns on frozen lakes. The photos of snowplanes clearly show stationary mounted rear skis and a turning front ski, the Kristi design improved on this design by allowing the skis to carve their edges into the snow as traditional snowplanes's rear skis will skid laterally during a turn. The major advancement of the Kristi tilt ski system apparently made no impact on the commercial or amateur snowplane industry as it did not appear to be used in practical application. Perhaps because of the mechanical complexity of the original design, no snowplanes are known to exist that employ the \\"Christi Ski Action\\" concept. Kristi's track driven vehicles Kristi adjustable track conceptKristi was technically interesting, but the company failed to produce quantities of snowcats to compete with other North American or European snowcat manufacturers. According to the July 1964 issue of Volkswagen Foreign Car Guide magazine, author Alan Arnold indicated the Kristi had a unique ability to raise or lower its tracks individually which had the effect of raising one side of the vehicle to keep the vehicle level while crossing side slopes. Further, the front or rear of both tracks could be raised or lowered so the snowcat's cabin could remain level while climbing or descending slopes.Kristi adjustable suspension & drive system Patent #2,967,578 U.S. patent office granted 1-10-1961 Kristi was commercially built in Colorado. The original Kristi company offered 3 basic models. The models were the KT2, KT3 and KT4. Total production of all the units combined, over the entire 12 year life of the original company's lifespan was lower than 1 year of production of commercially viable snowcats from Tucker Sno-Cat, Bombardier or Thiokol all of which were produced in North America during the same time period. The company changed ownership and moved to Washington and continued production. Production was always on a small scale, and the products were innovative. The most refined of the Kristi snowcats was the KT7, which was last produced and the least successful commercially with only 4 units built and 3 of them were prototypes that failed. The KT7 was designed and produced after the sale of the company and after it moved to Washington. It is possible that additional KT2, KT3 and KT4 units were manufactured by the new owners in Washington state but it is unlikely since the designs had not been substantially upgraded by the time the new owners purchased the company. A slightly smaller version of the KT3 was called the KT2. Both the KT2 and KT3 were powered by Volkswagen air-cooled 4-cylinder engines, it is reported that a small percentage may have been powered by Porsche engines. The KT2 and KT3 shared mechanicals and even shared the same operators manual. The VW engine developed 32 horsepower. An early KT3, still in commercial use to access mountaintop antenna arrays in need of repair KT3 on a rare Kristi tilt trailerKristi also built custom tilt bed trailers used for hauling the KT3 which used the same tires and wheels on the trailer as on the KT3. Various different sales brochures make different claims about the transmissions used in the Kristi KT3. It is therefore possible to find a KT3 with either 8 or 9 forward gears, and either 4 or 3 reverse gears. The units with 8 forward/4 reverse had a High-Low range ratio of 7:1. All used joystick controls in a V shaped arrangement that were centered under tachometer. Specifications from the sales brochure for the Kristi KT3 stated that it was 11' long, 7'4\\" wide and had a height of 5'9\\" with an empty weight of 2095 pounds. The KT3 was configured for 5 passengers and imparted 0.46 PSI of pressure onto the snow. It had a maximum cargo/passenger capacity of 1,500 pounds and a towing capacity of 2000 pounds. With a fuel capacity of 20 gallons of gasoline, it claims 15 to 18 hours of operating time and a top speed of 20 mph. The KT3 sales brochure claimed the ability to climb a 100% grade with full load when not on the snow. It claimed the ability to climb a 70% grade in snow conditions with a full load and in soft snow it claims the ability to traverse a side slope with a 60% grade. The Kristi action adjustable track suspension will hold the cabin level on slopes with up to a 25% grade. KT3 pictured with Mt. Bradley in the background A larger Kristi snowcat was produced and designated the KT4 and the KT4a. The KT4 had a fully enclosed fiberglass body while the KT4a was an open version and \\"a\\" designated that it was an amphibious unit capable of floating and crossing streams or ponds. Fred W. Crimson's book, U.S. Military Tracked Vehicles () referred to the Kristi KT4a's protopype as the \\"Water Walker\\" due to its amphibious capabilities. The KT4 and KT4a units are very rare and less than 5 are known to exist of a total production that was probably under 20. The KT4 was powered by a Chevrolet Corvair 6-cylinder gasoline engine. A prototype model built on a modified Chevrolet 1/2 ton pick-up truck frame was built and designated the KWT. This unit still exists and is in storage. The KWT, according to the prototype's announcement pre-sales brochure, was built for ranchers and farmers as a heavy duty all terrain vehicle capable of hauling and towing loads into remote snowbound locations. It also was designed to be capable to be driven on the road with the tracks removed. The KWT never reached the production. The engine specified was to be a 250-cubic-inch, or optionally a 292-cubic-inch, 6-cylinder gasoline powered, Chevrolet engine. A brochure announces it would use conventional steering when driven as a wheeled vehicle but does not indicate how it would steer as a tracked vehicle. This prototype vehicle still exists and is currently unused and in storage and owned by a private antique vehicle collector. Yetti Edition Kristi KT7 after 1+ year restoration Washington, new owners and the KT7 Kristi eventually changed ownership and they moved to Washington. A Kristi-Washington KT3 brochure shows the later model KT3s were equipped with a 53 hp VW engine, or alternately with a Porche (sic) engine. The brochure offers both new and remanufactured KT3 models for sale from the Washington facility. It lists the top speeds of the KT3 at 20 mph when powered by the VW engine, and 25 mph when powered by the Porche (sic) engine. Kristi of Washington developed a new model called the KT7 snowcat, of which only 4 were built and only 1 was successful #002. The KT7 used a Ford Anglia gasoline engine controlled by governor over hydrostatic Vickers drive with body tilt. The industrial engine has a 104 cu.in V-4 configuration generating 80 hp. While never produced, the brochure also offered a V-6, 171 cu.in. engine as an option. The engine was mounted in the middle of the snowcat with the driver and front passenger forward, and the rear passengers aft, facing the rear. There were access doors on either end of the KT7 and the rear and the front look nearly identical save for the headlamps. An early original brochure announcing the KT7 actually shows its designation as a KT3a and calls it an \\"improved KT3\\" but the production brochure has it designated as the KT7. The KT7 was tested by the FAA for use in Alaska but failed to achieve a 20 mph speed requirement; the sales brochure claims a 15 to 25 mph speed \\"depending on transmission/engine options.\\" It is believed that this failure doomed the KT7, and ultimately lead to the demise of the company in the early 1970s. Photos of the only known restored (by Allen Huston) KT7 Yetti are posted on this page, this unit is the last KT7 produced and is serial #002 owned and preserved by Marco Johnson Bellingham Wa , it is also the only unit that was modestly successful. According to an original sales brochure, specifications for the KT7 indicate it was 12'1\\" long, was 8'2\\" wide to the outside of the tracks, and had a body width of 4'1\\" and a height of 5'6\\" tall with the body in the lowered position and 6'4\\" tall with the body in the raised position. Ground clearance in the raised position is 16\\" and the weight is 3225# with a rated load of 1800#. Climbing performance is \\"Up to 100% depending on the terrain surface conditions.\\" Competitors Kristi lost out competitively to the Tucker Sno-Cat Corporation, which was also American based and in production during the same period. Tucker Sno-Cat is currently one of the most successful snowcat manufacturers in the world today Tucker website and still producing machines. Thiokol was another American made contemporary of Kristi that focused on small snowcats, notably the Imp, Super Imp and Spryte models. Like the Kristi KT4a amphibious model, Thiokol manufactured an amphibious version of the Spryte, called the Swamp Spryte. Thiokol sold its snowcat division in 1978 to automaker John DeLorean who renamed the company LMC Logan Machine Company and produced snowcats under the DMC brand name for approximately two years prior to switching the name to LMC. LMC remained in business until 2000, but changed ownership in 1988. Other notable snowcats of the same era were the Aktiv Snow Trac, which, like the Kristi KT2 and KT3 were powered by Volkswagen and Porsche engines. The Snow Trac was successfully used in explorations in the Antarctic and the Arctic and attained production numbers of 2000 units and only ceased production in 1981 when Volkswagen discontinued the European production of the engines used to power the machines. Bombardier, of Canada, was also successful and is still in business today making aircraft, rail vehicles, snowmobiles, ATVs and watercraft. Early drawing showing tilting concept on a snowplane prior to the switch to snowcat construction While Kristi was commercially unsuccessful, it did outlive and out produce other companies that developed \\"snowplanes\\" largely because early in the life of the company they switched production from snowplanes to snowcats. The original Kristi snowplanes Kristi Snowplane design Patent #2,700,427 U.S. patent office granted 1-25-1955 were very similar to the earlier Russian Aerosani snowplanes which were developed as early as World War I. The Kristi design was more advanced than the Aerosani, and utilized adjustable ski action to perform higher speed turns and received a patent for its design in 1955. Other competitors in the Snowplane market that failed to transition into tracked vehicle makers when the market changed included the Lorch Snowplane, the Steadman Snowplane, the Fudge Snowplane, the Lansing Snowplane in addition to many smaller manufacturers and homebuilders. Snowplanes are well suited to travel on frozen lakes and snowcovered fields or roads but are not suitable for use in mountains or on rough ground. This limit probably led to their general demise as tracked vehicles are suitable for both types of terrain and may explain why Kristi remained in business for a longer period of time.

This film is considered as the first mature film in Malayalam due to the professional approach it had in direction, script, performances and music. Ramu Kariat's co-director of the film P. Bhaskaran and cameraman A. Vincent went on to have illustrious careers themselves. After Neelakkuyil, he directed Minnaminungu (1957), another noted film. His next film was the film version of veteran playwright Thoppil Bhasi's play Mudiyanaya Puthran (1961). After directing Moodupadam (1963), he went on to direct Chemmeen (1965). Chemmeen is considered as the turning point in Malayalam cinema. The film, an adaptation of Thakazhi Sivashankara Pillai's novel in the same name was the first Malayalam film to win the National Film Award for Best Feature Film. The tragic love story starred Madhu, Sathyan and Sheela. In 1975 he was a member of the jury at the 9th Moscow International Film Festival. He directed fifteen films during his career. He was elected as Member of Legislative Assembly from Nattika in 1965 as a left independent but could not serve in the Legislative Assembly because no one could form the Assembly since there was no majority for any party.

Biography Kear began his career as a drummer with various bands in the late-1970s and early-1980s, including a stint with the Small Faces and the Amazing Bavarian Stompers with whom he performed on an edition of the children's television series Tiswas in 1981. In the late 1980s, he turned to solo stand-up comedy as the surreally manic 'Charlie Chuck' and, in 1990, he was talent-spotted by the comedian Malcolm Hardee who arranged for him to appear on Jools Holland's The Happening, a Sky TV series produced by Noel Gay Television. He later appeared on the Sky TV talent show Sky Star Search where he was spotted by disc jockey James Whale, who booked him on several editions of his late night series The James Whale Radio Show (a radio show that was simultaneously broadcast on television by Yorkshire Television on the ITV Network). In 1993-1995, he was a cast member of the BBC Two TV series The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer. He appeared performing his Charlie Chuck character act, but was always referred to on-screen as 'Uncle Peter'. His long-running Charlie Chuck stage act often involved the destruction of a drum kit and was peppered by references to fantasy characters including One Eyed Dog, Cakey Pig and a Donkey. The words \\"Donkey!\\" and \\"Woof! Bark! Donkey!\\" shouted out more-or-less at random had been part of his Charlie Chuck act and became his 'Uncle Peter' catchphrases on the Reeves & Mortimer TV shows. As a result of these TV appearances, Paul McCartney became a fan and invited Chuck to perform at one of his birthday parties. In 2001, he appeared as his Charlie Chuck character in a series of TV adverts for Cadbury's Double Decker chocolate bars, with music by Lester Barnes. In 2002 he appeared at the Edinburgh Fringe in a comedy show Charlie Chuck is Scrooge,Reviewed in The Scotsman, 14 August 2002 very remotely based on the Charles Dickens character and, that same year, his company Charlie Chuck Productions also staged Scots comic Ian Watt's one-man Fringe show John Laurie, Frazer & I, which he directed as David Kear. In 2004, he guest-starred in the Edinburgh Fringe show Nudge. In 2006, he appeared as one of the acts in a 5-hour-long memorial tribute show at London's Hackney Empire theatre in memory of his mentor the late Malcolm Hardee.

War years and imprisonment Mohamed Khider was one of the original leaders of the Front de Libération nationale (FLN), having been previously active in its nationalist predecessors, the Étoile Nord-Africaine and Parti du Peuple Algerien (PPA) of Messali Hadj. From 1946 to 1951 he was a member of the French National Assembly as a representative of the Movement for the Triumph of Democratic Liberties (MTLD). He played an important role during the first years of the Algerian War of Independence (1954–62), mainly in representing the FLN externally. In 1956, he was part of a group of FLN politicians (Khider, Ahmad Ben Bella, Hocine Aït Ahmed, Mohamed Boudiaf and Rabah Bitat) captured by France in an airplane hijacking. Two years later, while incarcerated in France, he was an elected member of the GPRA exile government, holding the symbolical post of Minister of State. He was released as Algeria became independent in 1962. Backing and opposing Ben Bella After returning to Algeria, Khider joined Ahmed Ben Bella and the FLN army's chief of staff, Col. Houari Boumédiène, in forming a Political Bureau of the FLN to replace the GPRA, over which they had no control. Boumédiène's army, built up outside the war zone in Morocco and Tunisia, quashed resistance among GPRA loyalists and guerrilla units inside Algeria, as it moved in from its border area bases. Khider then took on the role as Secretary-General of the post-war Party of FLN, with control over finances, but quickly fell out with President Ben Bella. Among the causes were political differences, personal rivalries, and opposition to Ben Bella's increasingly autocratic rule. Ben Bella refused Khider's requests to allow the FLN into the decision-making process, and replaced him as Secretary-General. Exile and death In 1963, Khider went into exile in Switzerland, bringing $12 million (or $14 million) of party funds with him, saying they would be used to finance a political opposition to continue the \\"genuine\\" nationalist tradition of the FLN. In 1967, he was assassinated in Madrid, Spain. Most observers blamed his death on Col. Boumédiène, who had toppled Ben Bella two years earlier, and to whom Khider had declared his continued opposition. He was posthumously rehabilitated by Boumédiène's successor, Chadli Bendjedid, in 1984.

It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Voždovac and should not be confused with the neighborhood of Rakovica in the municipality of the same name. Location Selo Rakovica is located in the central part of the municipality, in the valley of the creeks of Rakovički potok and Milošev potok, some 15 kilometers south-east of downtown Belgrade. Once a small village distant from downtown, Selo Rakovica today grew into one continuous built-up area with the rest of the city, bordering the neighborhoods of Jajinci on the north and Beli Potok on the south. Characteristics At the time, Selo Rakovica got the official prefix selo (Serbian for \\"village\\") to make a distinction from the much larger, industrial suburb of Rakovica. However, in the 1970s, Selo Rakovica was also annexed to the Belgrade City proper (uža teritorija grada) but the style Selo remained in an unofficial use. It is completely residential area with a population of 2,661 in 2002. The settlement spreads from the central street, the Boulevard of Liebration, which starts in central Belgrade (the Slavija square).

The service was available free across the United Kingdom offering multi-media educational resources. Jam was the BBC's provision for the Digital Curriculum, an initiative launched by the British Government to provide computer-based learning in UK schools, and had a budget of £150 million. The service was shut down due to a legal challenge concerning fair trading by the BBC. Content The content of the service was connected with the National Curriculum for schools in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. It covered school subjects such as maths, science, literacy, geography, business studies and languages, and was designed to provide free, independent computer-based learning for school children. The service was required to support users with disability by incorporating accessibility features such as audible text, subtitles on videos etc. There were also subjects which were translated into Welsh, Scottish Gaelic and Irish. History =Prior to launch= BBC Jam was commissioned in 2003 by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, and designed:- * to stimulate, support and reflect the diversity of the UK * to innovate continually and to promote technological and pedagogical experimentation * to be distinctive from, and complementary to, services provided by the commercial sector In consultation with BECTA, the Government's educational technology department, the service was allowed to cover no more than 50% of the learning outcomes that are amendable to ICT. =Closure= The service was suspended on 20 March 2007 at the request of the BBC Trust, in response to complaints made to the European Commission by a number of commercial producers of interactive educational products who felt that the BBC was exceeding its public service remit by offering free content to schools which could be provided commercially. This resulted in departmental restructuring and a number of job losses in the BBC. The Trust requested that the BBC management prepare a fresh proposal, including how the BBC should deliver its Charter obligation — promoting formal education and learning, whilst meeting the online needs of school age children. The new proposal was subjected to a full Public Value Test by the Trust and a market impact assessment by Ofcom, the United Kingdom's telecoms regulator. In February 2008 it was announced that the BBC's digital curriculum project would finally be closed.

He spent much of his childhood with his grandparents in Murat-le-Quaire from which he got his pseudonym. Biography Jean-Louis Bergheaud was born in La Bourboule, France to a father who was a carpenter and a non-professional musician. Further to his parents' divorce, he spent his whole youth in the isolated farm of his grandparents in Murat-le-Quaire, a village overviewing the thermal city of La Bourboule. From his earliest days, solitary and introverted, Jean-Louis Murat showed he was gifted for music and for many instruments, which will lead him to the local wind section at the age of 7 with his father, then to the conservatory brass class where he will improve his talent for singing too. At the same time at 15, his English teacher let him discover Soul and Jazz music and he met several Blues artists as John Lee Hooker, T-Bone Walker or Memphis Slim. Thanks to his English teacher, he continued studying against his father's advice. Keen on poetry as well as romantic and upheaval literature amongst others, Oscar Wilde, André Gide, D.H Lawrence or Vladimir Nabokov, he was the first one of his family to pass the Baccalauréat . Married at the age of 17, he joined the University of Clermont-Ferrand for a short period of time; he had a son and divorced when he was 19 and left in order to travel and lived by doing odd jobs in France and Europe all by himself, in the style of Jack Kerouac. He held a couple of positions between Paris and several French tourist spots; he was ski instructor in Avoriaz or a beach attendant in Saint- Tropez, and he finally went back to his village in 1977 at the age of 23 and devoted himself to music, that has never left so far.  Difficult beginnings  With some Clermontois' friends from Clermont-Ferrand, he created a rock band called \\"Clara\\" with him as lead singer and songwriter. He also played saxophone and guitar in the band. William Sheller noticed them and invited them to do a couple of his opening acts and then employed them as musicians for a while. The band split and thanks to William Sheller, Jean-Louis Berghaud at the age of 27, in 1981 (under the name of Murat) he recorded a 45 rpm record including 3 songs, called Suicidez-vous, Le Peuple est mort with Pathé Marconi EMI, with Jean-Baptiste Mondino's photo as cover of the sleeve; critiques were positive but the sales did not take off. The French radio station Europe 1 censored the song since a girl was said to commit suicide because of it. A mini eponymous album followed in 1982 including 6 songs, under the name of Murat and an album in 1984 called Passions Pivées garnered very low sales (2,000 copies), and after a tour with Charlélie Couture, his record label withdrew the contract. At the time he was around thirty.  Growing success  In 1985, Jean-Louis Murat did some recording with CBS but none of the discs came out, then the year after, he jumped on the opportunity to record at Virgin Records and in 1988, the 45 rpm record Si je devais manquer de toi came out. This one met with some success, allowing the singer to start being recognized at last. His success was confirmed the sales of his new album which came out in 1989, called Cheyenne Autumn. It was recorded in London and included other singles which were also successful (L'Ange Déchu; Te Garder Près de Moi). This beginning of fame brought him to be noticed by the movie industry, so Jean-Louis Murat appeared in 1990 as an actor in a film by Jacques Doillon who offered him a role in La vengeance d’une femme with Isabelle Huppert and Béatrice Dalle. But what made him definitely known in the eyes of a wider public is the single \\"Regrets\\" (in duet with Mylène Farmer) in 1991 (No. 3 in Top 50 and more than 300,000 copies sold), while he was turning 40. At that same time, his new studio album came out, Le Manteau de Pluie. His titles Col de la Croix-Morand and Sentiment Nouveau met with a great success; Sentiment nouveau entered the top 50 position in the early 1992's. Since then, his albums have regularly been into the French Top 20. Deeply attached to the Auvergne where he lives, countryside and nature give him a very personal poetic inspiration. Very prolific, guitar player and singer with a typical tone, Jean-Louis Murat writes, produces and publishes more than one album a year including Venus in 1993, Dolorès in 1996, most of his albums are followed by long tours characterized by an interesting musical work, none of the tours looks like the previous one, those give birth to live album as Murat Live in 1995, Live in Dolores in 1966 or Muragostang in 2000. He likes to being surrounded with his family and relatives in order to be helped when he creates and when he moves around. As for movies side, he was on the bill of a film in 1996, Mademoiselle personne, especially with Elodie Bouchez and Romain Duris ; he is actually behind this full-length feature film (nevertheless whose broadcasting will be limited) presented as a musical movie (produced by Pascal Bailly), whose soundtrack he composed. In March 2013 his album Toboggan came out and in October 2014, the follow-up album called Babel came out, recorded with Delano Orchestra band. Personal life Interested in Buddhism, Murat got involved in the Tibetan cause.

Biography =Early comics involvement= Landau was significantly involved in comics fandom from at least 1968.Dez Skinn's overview of comic fanzines. He was co-editor of the fanzine Comic Media, ran comic marts and imported American comics into the UK. In the mid-70s, he ran a shop selling imported US comics in London's Notting Hill. =2000 AD= In the mid-1970s, after finishing a post-graduate course at film school, Landau got his break when he went to the offices of science-fiction comic 2000 AD to interview then-editor Pat Mills for Comic Media News (a spin off from Comic Media).Thrill Power Overload, page 34 Mills was planning on resigning once the comic had become established, and following the interview, had decided that Landau would make a suitable chief sub-editor, saying: > Nick was clearly an exceptional person and I knew he would be of great > value, but [IPC publisher John] Sanders rightly regarded most comic fans > with deep suspicion, irrelevant to a mainstream undertaking. I agreed with > feeling and still do. Nick was the exception to an otherwise golden > rule.Thrill Power Overload, page 35 Landau didn't get that job due to his lack of experience, but he was soon given the same position at IPC Magazines' Action. When Mills stepped down after sixteen issues, replaced by Kelvin Gosnell, Landau was brought in as Gosnell's chief sub-editor.Thrill Power Overload, page 36 Gosnell was overwhelmed by the amount of work needed to launch Starlord, and Landau took up the slack.\\"A brief history of Starlord\\" from \\"Watch the stars!\\" website As Gosnell describes it, \\"As soon as Starlord came on the scene, I lost it. I had to have someone running 2000 AD and that was Nick Landau. He was halfway between editor and chief sub\\"Thrill Power Overload page 41 and Roy Preston was made a sub-editor to take up the slack and help Landau.Thrill Power Overload page 42 With the focus on the launch of Starlord (issue No. 1 was cover dated 13 May 1978), Landau, Preston and art editor Kevin O'Neill had more creative freedom. As Mills says, \\"Some of the best decisions on 2000 AD's future were made while they were running the show. They were responsible for \\"The Cursed Earth\\", credit cards and encouraged talented artists like Garry Leach and Brian Bolland.\\"Thrill Power Overload page 44 Gosnell disagrees, stating that \\"[t]his wonderful gush of creative freedom they felt when I started on Starlord nearly got 2000 AD taken off the market.\\"Thrill Power Overload page 45. They ran into legal problems over fill-in stories for \\"The Cursed Earth\\" (which satirised the big food companies, including figures like Ronald McDonald and the Jolly Green Giant)Thrill Power Overload page 46-47 but the main problems came over Inferno, the sequel to Harlem Heroes. Concerns were raised over the violence in the story, but the sequence of events is unclear, as David Bishop writes in Thrill Power Overload, \\"[t]rying to determine exactly what happened next is problematic, due to conflicting memories and the passage of time.\\"Thrill Power Overload page 50 The outcome was that, with issue No. 86 (cover-dated 14 October 1978), when Starlord was merged into 2000 AD, Landau was moved into the same role at Battle, swapping places with Steve MacManus.Thrill Power Overload, page 51 Landau soon resigned from Battle and moved full-time back into the world of commerce. =Forbidden Planet and Titan Entertainment Group= Landau first saw the opportunity to distribute American comics in the UK in the 1970s, when only a small range of US comic books were available in British news agents. In the late 70s he established Titan Distributors, which was a wholesaler for comics, science fiction and other genre materials, with partners Mike Lake and Mike Luckman. In 1978, the three also opened the first Forbidden Planet shop in Denmark Street, London (also known as 'Tin Pan Alley'). They then set up the publishing company Titan Books, which in 1981 produced its first title, collected reprints of Brian Bolland's Judge Dredd stories from 2000 A.D. This was one of the earliest high quality, book format publications of comic material in the UK (the term graphic novel was not in widespread use at that time), and Titan Books followed the first title with numerous other 2000 A.D. reprints. Subsequently the publishing company expanded operations and now publishes both new and licensed graphic novels and film and TV tie-ins. In 1992 Landau parted company with Lake (Luckman had departed earlier to run a Forbidden Planet store in New York). Lake later sold Titan Distributors to the US comics distributor Diamond Comic Distributors\\"NewsWatch: Diamond Acquires Titan Distributors,\\" The Comics Journal #154 (Nov. 1992), p. 14. and then established his own Forbidden Planet line of stores, Forbidden Planet International, mainly in northern England and Scotland. Landau set up the group company Titan Entertainment Group (TEG) in 1993.Company information on Titan Entertainment Group The group now includes Forbidden Planet, Titan Books, Titan Magazines, publishers of Star Trek Magazine, the Wallace and Gromit comic, UK editions of Simpsons Comics, and many other titles; and Titan Merchandise, producers of high-quality licensed merchandise for global properties, including Marvel Comics, Doctor Who, Kick- Ass, The Avengers, Breaking Bad, The Beatles, and more. TEG no longer distributes comics. Although TEG has made some attempts to establish Forbidden Planet abroad, there are no longer any TEG-owned FP stores outside the UK. Landau now runs TEG with current business partner and wife Vivian Cheung.

During a professional career which spanned 25 years he played mostly for Twente, appearing in 555 Eredivisie games and winning four major titles.Een leven lang FC Twente voor Sander Boschker (Sander Boschker, a lifetime with Twente); FC Twente, 4 September 2012 Boschker was part of the Dutch squad at the 2010 World Cup. Club career Born in Lichtenvoorde, Oost Gelre, Gelderland, Boschker made his professional debuts with FC Twente in the 1989–90 season, appearing in one game with the first team. After an irregular beginning he firmly established himself in the side's starting XI, going on to play in more than 400 official matches for the Eredivisie club. Aged almost 33 Boschker moved to AFC Ajax, but had to settle with battling for being backup with the Amsterdam club, unable to dislodge youth product Maarten Stekelenburg. The following summer he returned to Twente, adding next to 200 more official appearances (in the 2008–09 campaign, he only missed five league contests for an eventual runner- up finish), and playing into his 40s. In 2009–10, Boschker played in all 34 games as Twente won the first league title in the club's history – he only conceded 23 goals, second-best in the competition. Since 2010, though, he acted as understudy to Nikolay Mihaylov, and spent most of the following year rehabbing after two calf injuries. On 25 June 2012, Boschker extended his link for another year. He retired at the end of the 2013–14 season.

Nicolaas Samuelszoon Kruik (; 2 December 1678, West-Vlieland – 5 February 1754, Spaarndam), also known as Klaas Kruik and Nicolaes Krukius, was a Dutch land surveyor, cartographer, astronomer and weatherman. He is commemorated by the Museum De Cruquius. He was a perfectionist who liked to measure things and he calculated temperature measurements in Fahrenheit from 1706 to 1734. His historical calculations are still used today by the KNMI, the Dutch meteorological institute. He not only measured weather changes in wind speed, rainfall, air pressure, temperature, and humidity, but also measured sea level. His method of visualising planes of water level to illustrate contours of depth (isobaths) in his map of the Merwede (1728) was the first of its kind. He was an advocate of pumping out the Haarlemmermeer (Haarlem lake), which was done a century after his death. Biography Rijnlandshuis, the Gemeenlandshuis where Cruquius lived and worked in Spaarndam He became a surveyor at the age of 19 and began to draw maps, a lucrative job in his day. Though born in Vlieland, he moved to Delft a few years after he was born and it is there in 1705 that he started his first weather observations. In 1717 at the age of 39, though firmly established as a respected surveyor, he moved to the family farm in Rijnsburg outside Leiden and chose to study in Leiden under Herman Boerhaave, at that time the most famous scientist in the Netherlands. He signed himself in as \\"Krukius, medical student, born in Delft\\". Thanks to Boerhaave, Kruik became a member of the Royal Society of London. The secretary of the Royal Society at that time, James Jurin, started the first European network of meteorological weather stations, and the Dutch members played a large part. Kruik was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1724. In 1721 and 1723 Luigi Ferdinando Marsigli travelled to Holland and he and Boerhaave stimulated Kruik to keep systematic observations in the belief that climate changes had an effect on public health. Kruik started to travel the various beaches and rivers in the Netherlands and study the waterlevels while continuing his mapmaking work. On these trips he was sometimes accompanied by Boerhaave and Marsigli. While studying the Merwede, he began to form plans to help keep the lower areas of the Netherlands dry. It was at this time that Kruik changed his name to the Latin Cruquius after his first publications of maps and measurements. In 1725 he wrote a famous letter to Willem 's Gravesande, a Dutch professor of physics and astronomy at Leiden, proposing an empirical deductive research method to solve the water problems of the Netherlands. This letter started the chain of events in working that eventually led to a plan presented to the United Provinces to create a water defence plan in 1727. It was this unified water plan that in turn led to the creation of Haarlemmermeer bij pumping the Haarlem lake dry more than a century later. Diagram showing the distance of the planets to the earth in 1732, also showing a complete lunar eclipse and a partial solar eclipse in that year In 1733 he became a member of the 'Hoogheemraadschap Rijnland', the Dutch Waterboard Agency, and worked as a Waterboard inspector in Spaarndam. It was here that he met Jan Noppen (1706–1734), the Halfweg inspector, who started the earliest continuous weatherstation in Zwanenburg with measurements 3 times daily of temperature, air pressure, humidity, and rainfall. An eccentric man, Kruik wrote music, and had an obsessive need to measure things. This need included measuring his own weight and amount of urine daily. According to contemporary accounts, only Boerhaave could successfully work with him.

Gordon was portrayed by American actress Jennifer Love Hewitt. Character background Melinda Gordon (Jennifer Love Hewitt) has the ability to see and communicate with ghosts. She moved to Grandview after she married Jim Clancy, a paramedic who knows of her ability. Jim and Melinda have a son Aiden (first appearance season 5). Melinda had always been able to speak with the dead, or \\"earthbound spirits\\" as her grandmother called them (with whom she shared this ability, along with her mother Beth, her great grandmother Julia, and great-great grandmother Tessa). Apart from her husband Jim, Melinda shared her secret with quirky Professor Rick Payne, an expert in occult beliefs and history who thrives on helping her gain insights into the more baffling paranormal phenomena she encounters. Other individuals who are aware of her gift include Andrea Marino (her best friend and business partner; killed in the first season's finale), Delia Banks (Melinda's best friend) and her son, Ned Banks, RU psychology professor Eli James, and her son Aiden, as well as all the relatives or friends of ghosts she has helped. Abilities Melinda is at least a sixth-generation medium on her mother's side; her great-great-great- grandmother, Tessa, her grandmother, and her mother are also ghost whisperers. It is also later revealed that her biological father had the same ability, although it is unknown how common it was in his family and the ability was only mentioned once. *Mediumship: Melinda is able to perceive and communicate with the spirits of those who are dead; using her gift to see earthbound spirits, Melinda tries to help them to cross over, either by speaking to loved ones or by doing things for them which they died before they could do/finish. Melinda can also perceive the spirits of those who are having an out-of-body experience because they are near-death or comatose. Though Melinda can see spirits, they can sometimes \\"leave\\" her line of sight. She explains that spirits can only choose to manifest, and that she cannot force them to show themselves to her. *Spiritual Empathy: According to her grandmother, Melinda will be able to feel the emotions of spirits. Initially, Melinda had a hard time telling the living from the dead, but with practice grew adept at telling them apart. *Visions: As a result of her abilities, Melinda often receives visions of things concerning the ghost(s) she is trying to help. For example, in the first-season finale, Melinda kept receiving messages from ghosts on a plane that hasn't crashed yet. In another episode, her powers transported her from Grandview to a rain forest. In the second-season finale, she sees people staring at her, looks out her window and sees that her house is under a large body of water and that a boat is sinking, is transported to a tunnel, and sees a large bridge in the sky with cars falling everywhere around her. According to Professor Rick Payne in the season 2 episode The Ghost Within, Melinda displayed psychometry — when touching certain objects, she sometimes gets visions or flashes from the past. In the third episode of the fourth season, Melinda was able to project her consciousness inside a virtual reality to embody a game avatar so as to communicate with a ghost who haunted that online chat game; though a different effect than usual, Melinda herself described this as being similar to when she receives visions. *Psychic Link: In Season 5, Melinda is revealed to be connected to her son, Aiden Lucas, who the Watchers revealed is an empath. With this, Melinda is able to receive visions from him. Appearances =Season 1= Melinda and Jim move to the small town of Grandview where Melinda opens a small antique shop, named \\"The Same As It Never Was ANTIQUES\\". She becomes friends with Andrea Marino, who comes to share management responsibilities of the store. Eventually, Melinda gains enough trust in Andrea to tell her about her ability. In Episode 5 of Season 1, \\"The Lost Boys\\", Melinda helps three young boys to cross over into the light from an orphanage, where the young boys die. One boy, Vic, tells Melinda before they crossed over, that he will tell everyone on the other side that Mel is his mom, making Vic her unofficial adoptive son. In the later part of the season, Melinda begins encountering a malevolent spirit (Romano) that wears a black hat while trying to \\"cross over\\" earthbound spirits. In the season finale, a plane crashes in Grandview. Romano uses the massive death count to his advantage, \\"keeping\\" the souls that Melinda is unable to cross over, one of whom was Andrea, who died in the crash. =Season 2= After losing her friend and business partner to the plane crash, Melinda succeeds against the dark spirit in helping Andrea and many of the other ghosts from the crash cross over. Melinda meets several new people in Season 2, including an occult professor, Rick Payne, who often helps her with troublesome ghosts without realizing it, until she tells him about her gift.Cat's Claw episode , season 2, episode 11. Retrieved on 2009-06-08. She also meets widow Delia Banks and her son Ned. Melinda invites Delia to take the place of Andrea as her business partner, and confides in Ned about her gift. While trying to cross over Delia's husband, in the episode \\"Delia's First Ghost\\", Melinda reveals to Delia her gift. Delia, a skeptic in anything beyond the normal things she can see, slowly begins to believe Melinda. Throughout the season, events occur showing that the \\"veil\\" between the living and the dead is thinning. With the introduction of a second ghost whisperer, Gabriel Lawrence, it is learned through the earthbound spirit of Payne's wife that dark forces \\"are trying to make the dead stronger than the living.\\" In the season finale, dark spirits try to kill four special children (each child was the sole survivor of a terrible disaster or accident). Melinda attempts to save them and succeeds, but loses her own life in the process, culminating in the fulfillment of a prophecy that would lead to the \\"death of a loved one\\" – Melinda. Only then did Melinda realize that it was her that the dark side wanted to kill, and not the children. In the limbo between life and death, Melinda sees a shadow of her father who says she has a brother. Meanwhile, the four special children help revive her (as noted under \\"Abilities\\"). She is stunned when she returns to consciousness, stating \\"I think I have a brother\\". She looks around and, from a distance, Gabriel is looking at her very crossly. =Season 3= Melinda searches continually for her father, believing him to have died, and for her brother, whom by now she suspects is Gabriel. She speaks with her mother, who does not give her much information other than that she never had another child apart from Melinda, and that Melinda and Jim have to leave Grandview because of all the evil spirits. If not, something very bad may happen. Melinda also learns that Beth once lived in Grandview. In the fifth episode, \\"Weight of What Was\\", Gabriel arrives at her home, saying that he is her half-brother and that he is also looking for their father. He has been staying in a hotel under the name Gabriel Gordon. He hands Melinda a package that leads her to an underground church, as well as to her ancestor and great-great grandmother, Tessa Lucas, also a ghost whisperer. Tom Gordon appears before Melinda and reveals a little bit about her past. Melinda and Jim later have a discussion about having children; Melinda agrees to have one. Melinda is haunted by a ghost who is known as the Masked Man at first. Towards the end of the season, Tom Gordon shows up in Grandview, alive and well. When things begin to get more dangerous and suspicious, Melinda asks her mother to be honest with her and tell her everything. Her mother reveals that her birth father is really a man named Paul Eastman, the same \\"Masked Man\\" who has been haunting Melinda. Tom later shows up and takes Melinda to their old home where she once lived as a child, and tries to jog her memory, to see what she remembers of the night Paul Eastman came to her house. Only then does Melinda realize that Paul was murdered by Tom. Once Tom realizes that Melinda remembers that, he tries to choke her to death. Paul arrives just in time and takes control of Tom's body, causing Tom to topple over the stairs and fall onto the floor below, killing him instantly. Tom's spirit appears and vanishes in front of Melinda. Melinda, Beth and Paul reconcile and Paul goes into the light. After all these years of thinking that the man who she thought was her father (Tom) had abandoned her, Melinda is now glad to know that her real father (Paul) would never have abandoned her, and, had he not been dead, he would have been there by her side. At the end of the season, what seems to be a happy moment is spoiled when Payne makes a shocking observation. He turns to Melinda and points out the fact that there are six people lined up (Delia, Beth Gordon, Ned, Jim, Melinda, and Payne himself), yet there are only five visible shadows. =Season 4= In this season, Melinda and Jim talk about having children. Melinda meets Eli James, who has a ghost haunting him – one of his patients. In a fire, Eli and the patient, named Fiona (who died in the incident) suffered a near-death experience, and when he was revived, he discovered that he can hear the dead. They help Fiona cross over. By the end of the premiere, they develop a good partnership. Professor Payne goes on a long trip. In \\"Big Chills\\", Melinda helps a ghost that has to have the truth come out about an accidental death on a boat. In the next episode, she finds a dead man who is trapped in an online chat game. She realizes that the man is actually the teenager's father, and is trying to protect her from an online predator. Melinda and Jim go on a trip to find another ghost (or many on the boat), but the main reason is to talk to the boat owner's son, who is planning to tear down the boat and rebuild it. Many spirits are worried that their home would be ruined, so they were bothering Melinda to help them. One girl needed help to talk to the owner of the boat about the accidental death, when she waited for him in the same room where she met him many years before. Melinda meets a teenage ghost who dies on the tennis court from a blood clot in her lung. Melinda watches the dead teenager follow her friend's family home. The two families soon find out that the hospital made a mistake and they switched the girls at birth. In the end Melinda and Jim think she is pregnant, but are disappointed when they discover that she has had a miscarriage. Melinda and Jim go to the woods and stay in a cabin for Jim's friend's wedding. The spirit wants the bride to play a game which will let her know the truth about her fiance. She discovers that the ghost (Owen) used to know the bride when they were young. When she finds out the truth, she calls off the wedding. Later Jim goes back to clean up and finds the groom still in the cabin, with a gun. Melinda finds out and calls a detective. When Melinda and the detective get there they see two shadows through the door windows—one man with the gun and one man without. The detective pulls out the gun and shoots, but appears to hit Jim, who falls in front of the window. He is rushed to the hospital, and Melinda waits by his bedside. Eventually, she sees Jim kneeling in front of her. Happy to see that he's awake, Melinda approaches him, only for Jim to reveal that he had an embolism. The nurses rush to save him, but are unsuccessful, and Jim crosses over after telling Melinda to remember how he looks at the moment. In the next episode Jim keeps saying throughout that he will not cross over, no matter how hard Melinda tries. There is a teenage ghost who keeps saying she's sorry and that it's all her fault that Jim is dead. It turns out that the teenager was anorexic and that made her heart stop. Her stepfather was very depressed, and he went back to work before he was ready to. Later it is found out that the girl's stepfather is the detective who shot Jim. Melinda says to Jim \\"You have to do the right thing.\\" He replies \\"I know.\\" and possesses the body of a dead man, Sam, to live again in episode 4.07 \\"Threshold\\". Melinda happily says to Jim \\"You're back\\" to which Jim/Sam replies \\"Do I know you?\\" Melinda begins dating Jim/Sam when Sam's ex-girlfriend Nikki leaves Grandview. Melinda revealed her gift to Jim/Sam and his response was unexpected. Melinda told Jim/Sam he is really Jim and Jim/Sam tells Melinda that he thinks she needs help. Melinda finally gives up and painfully tells him to leave, thinking that no matter how hard she tries, Jim will never be back. But later, Melinda gets trapped in an underground chamber that was rapidly filling up with water and Jim/Sam comes to her rescue. When he was swimming towards her, he suddenly gets flashes of his life as Jim, memories of his life and of the times with Melinda. Melinda saves Jim/Sam from drowning and is surprised when he asks her why she is calling him Sam and that she should just call him Jim. Melinda realizes that Jim is definitely back and reconciles with him. Soon after, she learns she is eight weeks pregnant with Jim's baby. Melinda began to have nightmares and visions that her baby is in danger. She was sure by the things she was being told the baby was a girl after Melinda runs into the faceless child again, who puts her hand on Melinda's tummy and says, \\"You can't save her. You can't.\\" and Carl telling Melinda that her future is in Melinda's hands. Jim reveals to Melinda that he had seen her chart accidentally and knew it was a boy. He knew they agreed not to find out, but he told her to ease her mind, so she'd see her visions and dreams were wrong and her was actually about Zoe, who was Eli's ex-girlfriend and killed accidentally when she fell down the steps, startled by a thief (who is actually being controlled by the Watcher Carl) in her house. They were trying to hide an ancient tome written in multiple languages called The Book of Changes, in Zoe's house (Zoe was unknowingly the destined caretaker). Eli then became the caretaker of the book, and was warned by one of the Watchers (Carl) that people were after the book, he must safeguard it and was also warned he must not show it to Melinda. Melinda, however, couldn't get the idea something was wrong out of her mind and convinced Eli to show her the book. The book had their names in it, followed by odd dates. The dates were revered; Melinda realized they were dates of death. Andrea was there, as was Jim, Sam, Zoe and even Eli from his near death experience. She was also listed as September 25 meaning Melinda will give birth to her son on that day. Later Melinda confronts Carl in the tunnels and wants to know if her son is in danger. Carl tells Melinda that white light spirits are watching over her, but the balance can shift and her son is the key. Carl advises her to teach her son about the other side, not shield him from it, because her son will be able to do much, much more than she can. Jim and Melinda marry again at the same place they met – in front of witnesses, Eli James (best man) and Delia Banks (matron of honor), and a full gathering of spirits. =Season 5= Melinda starts off the season with Jim, and Melinda being close to giving birth to their child, who is later born and given Jim's father's name, Aiden, and Sam's last name Lucas, in honor of Sam, who unknowingly gave Jim the chance to raise his and Melinda's son. Carl, the watcher, continues to watch over Jim, Melinda, and Aiden as the season goes on. At one point, the ghost of Julia, the little girl who sent out the Sally Stitch emails in Episode 5 is revealed to be attached to Aiden and shows Aiden the shadows and we get to see the Shinies for the first time. Aiden saves Julia from the shadows with his flashlight, which Aiden named Flash. During the ordeal, Aiden was missing according to Jim and Melinda, showing at the beginning of the episode 9, that Aiden was gone. Thanks to Carl, the Shinies, Jim, Detective Blair, Eli, Delia, Ned, and Melinda, they find Aiden and help Julia cross over. As the season continues from Episode 9, Melina starts to slowly be possessed by the shadows. Carl, deemed untrustworthy by Melinda because of a possessed session that Eli was under in the middle of the night, convinces Aiden that the shinies have to turn night into day in order to save Melinda. Aiden gathers the shinies in town square and the light forces the shadows to retreat, and they disappear. They all rush to the store and find Melinda, and she hugs Aiden. The scene changes to Jim and Melinda's house and the last lines of the season are Jim and Melinda telling Aiden to just be himself and not to deny his gift, even if it doesn't feel like a gift at some points in his future. The last exchange between Melinda and Aiden are these. \\"I meant what I said you know,\\" Melinda says, referring to Aiden saving her from the shadows, \\"You were my hero tonight.\\" Aiden replies, \\"Just like you are mom. Every day.\\" Analysis Melinda Gordon is often compared to Allison DuBois in the TV series Medium, but Gordon is not explicitly described as a medium. Karin Beeler calls her a \\"younger, postfeminist heroine than the women in Medium and Afterlife, sporting low-cut outfits that have often been identified with the body-conscious television characters of the third wave or postfeminist generation (e.g. Buffy, the witch sisters in Charmed, Tru Davies in Tru Calling).\\" References Fantasy television characters Female characters in television Fictional shopkeepers Fictional characters from New York (state) Television characters introduced in 2005 Fictional paranormal investigators Fictional spiritual mediums Ghost Whisperer ","title":"Melinda Gordon"},{"id":"9711876","text":"The Saints were an English instrumental band, that worked for the record producer, Joe Meek.

Taxonomy  The Cape and Drakensberg Rockjumpers were split into separate species in the 1980s. The Latin epithet \\"Frenatus\\" refers to the \\"bridled\\" or black-and-white head pattern. When the Drakensberg Rockjumper was split it was given the Latin \\"aurantius\\" meaning orange. Some authorities (notably Dickinson and Christidis) treat the two Rockjumpers as a single species, Chaetops frenatus, with two subspecies. However, for most field guides and birders, and according to the International Ornithologists' Union and The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, they are two species.  Climate Sensitivity  Cape Rockjumpers exist only in Alpine Fynbos, a specialized habitat of 90 000 ha from Cape Town to Port Elizabeth in South Africa. These birds are alpine habitat specialists, and so used to a very specific range of temperatures. Cape Rockjumper numbers are declining in warmer parts of their habitat, and birds were found to have low heat tolerance compared to other birds of the Fynbos.Milne, R., Cunningham, S. J., Lee, A. T., & Smit, B. (2015). The role of thermal physiology in recent declines of birds in a biodiversity hotspot. Conservation Physiology, 3(1), cov048. Juvenile Cape Rockjumpers are more sensitive to the heat than adults, and perhaps cannot drink enough water to make up for the water they lose in trying to stay cool when it's hot. Oswald, KN, ATK Lee, and B Smit (2018). Comparison of physiological responses to high temperatures in juvenile and adult Cape Rockjumpers (Chaetops frenatus). Ostrich. 89(4): 377-382. Birds also struggle to continue foraging when it is hot, and produce smaller offspring at higher temperatures. Behavior and Ecology =Diet= Birds forage on rocky slopes and scree. Insects are the major part of the diet, although small vertebrates are reported to be taken by Cape Rockjumpers. A range of insects are taken, including caterpillars, moths, grasshoppers, beetles and flies. In addition to insects other prey include lizards and geckos, amphibians, scorpions, annelid worms and spiders. Their wings are proportionately small and they do not fly very often, although they will often take long gliding \\"flights\\" across valleys or downslope. They spend most of their lives running and jumping among rocks and grasses while hunting arthropods, small lizards, and amphibians. =Breeding= Family group territories near Cape Town vary in size from , but are larger out east.Oswald, KN, B Smit, ATK Lee, and SJ Cunningham (2019). Behaviour of an alpine-endemic bird is described mainly by interactions between microsite and air temperature. An Behav. 157: 177-187 Typically these grounds consist of a breeding pair and one or two additional individuals, usually offspring from the preceding breeding season. These helpers participate in territorial defence and alarm calling, and in the feeding of nestlings and fledglings of the breeding pair. Both sexes help with nest building and incubation. While an initial study from 2002 found Cape Rockjumpers attempt only one nest per season,Richard T. Holmes, Bernhard D. Frauenknecht, Morné A. Du Plessis Breeding system of the Cape Rockjumper, a South African fynbos endemic, The Condor Volume 104, February 2002 a more recent study found they will attempt up to 5 nests per season if initial nests fail, and even re-nesting when they have had a successful nest.Oswald, KN, B Smit, ATK Lee, CL Peng, C Brock, SJ Cunningham. Under review. Reduced body condition for older nestlings is associated with higher temperatures in a range-restricted alpine bird. An. Beh. Nests are built on the ground under rocky overhangs, and lined with either fur from red rock hare or old and fluffy protea seed pods. In general, nests are built under rocks on the downward facing slope to provide protection in inclement weather. As ground nesters, Rockjumpers face large amounts of predation. Cape Rockjumper nest predation comes predominantly from the Boomslang, with this predation increasing at higher temperatures. They also experience predation from Cape Grey Mongoose, Honey Badger, Common Egg-eater, and African vlei rat.Oswald, KN, EF Diener, JP Diener, SJ Cunningham, B Smit, and ATK Lee (2020). Increasing temperatures increase the risk of reproductive failure in an alpine ground-nesting bird, the Cape Rockjumper Chaetops frenatus. Ibis. 10.1111/ibi.1284 While parents can deter Mongoose by harassing them, this is generally not successful to deter snakes. Although not recorded, it is also likely they experience predation from Chacma Baboon, Black-backed Jackal, White-necked Raven, and other snakes in the area (such as Cape Cobra or Puff Adder). Nest success for Cape Rockjumpers is higher in territories that had more recent fire (within 3-5 years), possibly as there were fewer predators present. Illustration from the 1838 description. =Habitat= Cape Rockjumpers inhabit only mountain Fynbos, specifically that dominated by low scrubby restio vegetation. They prefer steep slopes with plenty of large boulders from which they can perch to keep an eye out for predators. While there is an established population at sea level at Rooi-Els (~ 80 km east of Cape Town), this area nevertheless is made up of mountain Fynbos habitat. Appearance This Rockjumper is 23–25 cm long with a long black tail and strong legs. The male has a dark grey and black head with a thin white supercilium and a broad white moustache (malar stripe). The back and wings are dark grey, and the underparts and rump are rufous red. The female and juvenile have a paler grey head, upperparts and wings, a duller head pattern, an orange rump, and buff underparts. The call varies from 1-4 piercing whistles to a series of trills. Adults have bright red eyes, while juveniles have black eyes until mature. The closely related Drakensberg Rockjumper, Chaetops aurantius, does not overlap in range. The male of that species has orange underparts, and the female and young are paler below than the Cape Rockjumper.

The Oujda Group, 1958  History  The Oujda group was formed around Col. Houari Boumédiène, posted in the Moroccan town of Oujda. He would later become chief of staff in the Armée de Libération Nationale (ALN), which was the armed wing of the Front de Libération Nationale (FLN), the main nationalist organization fighting French colonial control over Algeria. As chief of staff, Boumédiène entered into conflict with the FLN's government-in-exile, the GPRA, which towards the end of the war attempted to dismiss him. He then supported an alliance of FLN politicians against the GPRA's provisional post-independence government, and marched the ALN towards Algiers to occupy it. Ahmed Ben Bella became president, and Boumédiène minister of defense. In this role Boumédiène continued to exercise a powerful influence over the regime, through the Algerian army. To secure his grip over the army, he began promoting and supporting his old friends and colleagues of the Oujda years. These men and their entourage became known as the Oujda group, forming a powerful pro-Boumédiène faction within the political and military ranks of the one-party state, but in their turn dependent on him for their positions. After rising tension between the two men and their supporters, Ben Bella in 1965 confronted Boumédiène by attempting to dismiss his close associate, foreign minister Abdelaziz Bouteflika, and by announcing that he soon would be reassigning responsibilities within the army. Boumédiène reacted by staging a military coup d'état, in which Ben Bella was \\"disappeared\\" (years later, he was released after having been held isolated in house arrest), and taking personal control over the country by means of a military junta. His associates from Oujda now became the pillar of his regime, but as Boumédiène tightened his grip on power, most of the clan's members were gradually purged. Still, a more generally defined \\"old guard\\", including some of the Oujda men, would continue to exercise influence after Boumédiène's death in 1978, over his successor Chadli Bendjedid. Bendjedid consciously strove to marginalise these men, and to replace them with his own loyalists. This policy became informally known as de-Boumédiènisation. The early 1980s therefore marked the end of whatever remained of the Oujda clan as a (somewhat) cohesive faction within Algerian politics, even if FLN \\"conservatives\\" favoring Boumédiène-style policies continued to challenge Chadli from within until they were finally purged following the October Riots in 1988. In 1999, an old Oujda clan stalwart, the former foreign minister Abdelaziz Bouteflika (who, coincidentally, was born in Oujda), made an unexpected comeback, winning the Algerian presidential elections. He had been convicted for corruption in 1981, soon after Chadli's takeover, in what was viewed as one of the most important steps of de-Boumédiènisation, and in 1983 he had gone into exile. Bouteflika was reelected for a second term in 2004, and then, for a third term, in 2009 and a fourth term in 2014.

It aired on Channel 4 in Britain in December 2006. The documentary focuses on criticising atheism for its perceived similarities to religion, as well as arrogance and intolerance. The programme includes interviews with a number of prominent scientists, including atheists Richard Dawkins and Peter Atkins and Anglican priest John Polkinghorne. It also includes an interview with Ellen Johnson, the president of American Atheists. Overview Liddle begins the documentary by attempting to survey common criticisms of religion, and particularly antireligious arguments based on the prevalence of religious violence. He argues that the \\"very stupid human craving for certainty and justification\\", not religion, is to blame for this violence, and that atheism is becoming just as dogmatic as religion.Daily Mail, 18 December. In order to support his thesis, Liddle presents numerous examples of actions and words by atheists which he argues are direct parallels of religious attitudes. He characterizes Atkins and Dawkins as \\"fundamentalist atheists\\" and \\"evangelists\\". In response to atheistic appeals to science as a superior method for understanding the world than religion, Liddle argues that science itself is akin to religion: \\"the problem for atheists is that science may not be as far away from religion as you might imagine\\". He describes Fermilab, a U.S. Department of Energy National Laboratory focused on particle physics, as a \\"temple to science\\", and characterises Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species as a \\"sacred text\\" for atheists.Johns, Ian (2006). Atheism gets a kick in the fundamentals. The Times. Retrieved 3 November 2017. Liddle focuses on objections to evolution halfway through the documentary, on the premise that \\"Darwinism is atheism's trump card\\". He characterises the creation–evolution controversy as being between scientists \\"who see no room for religion in the world\\" and ones \\"who can accommodate both a scientific and religious worldview\\". Liddle interviews the intelligent design supporter Steve Fuller, a philosopher, who argues that evolution is the only \\"scientifically credible basis\\" for atheism, and anthropologist Jeffrey H. Schwartz, who argues that evolutionary theory cannot account for novelties. He comes to the conclusion that the modern synthetic theory of evolution will be superseded in a future paradigm shift, undermining the arguments of atheists like Dawkins.Liddle, Rod (December 6, 2006). A man who believes in Darwin as fervently as he hates God. The Spectator. Retrieved 3 November 2017. Liddle also criticizes models of sociocultural evolution such as memetics and interviews skeptics of memetics such as Alister McGrath. In the last quarter of the documentary, Liddle argues against a perceived overreliance on \\"cold logic\\" and the amoral scientific method. He focuses primarily on the track record of secular ethics, citing the role of the Jacobins and Cult of Reason in the Reign of Terror in Revolutionary France, as well as the religious persecution under Soviet state atheism.Chater, David (2006). Viewing guide: The Trouble with Atheism. The Times. He also criticizes evolutionary theory, as well as scientism, for Francis Galton's philosophy of eugenics and its influence on Nazi Germany's racial policies, speaking of a \\"direct line between Darwin, Galton, and Hitler\\". Further, Liddle criticizes the ethics of Dawkins and atheist philosopher Peter Singer as \\"tentative\\" and \\"wishy-washy\\".The Sunday Times, 17 December. Ultimately, Liddle argues that \\"which option you take, then, God or no God, is a matter of choosing something for which there is no scientific proof either way\\". He argues that adhering to both religious supernaturalism and scientific naturalism is not contradictory, but a \\"balance\\" of the \\"very essence of what it is to be human\\". Based on arguments for God such as the fine-tuned universe argument, and on a lack of a conclusive understanding of pre-Big Bang physics, Liddle states that \\"the true scientific position, of course, is that there may be a God, and there may not be a God\\". Liddle identifies this position as agnostic, which he distinguishes from the \\"zealous\\" atheism he is critical of. Reviews While The Guardian called the programme \\"fascinating\\", but criticised it by saying \\"Secular societies, of course, can be very brutal, but they weren't actually killing in the name of their non-belief, were they?\\",Sam Wollaston, \\"Last night's TV,\\" The Guardian, 16 December 2006. Retrieved 3 November 2017. the Daily Express criticised Liddle, saying he was arguing \\"the most blindingly obvious things anyone could possibly say\\".Daily Express, 19 December 2006. The Times objected to the brevity of his arguments, stating that, while some opponents of religion made a poor impression, \\"a more sustained debate would have made this a more rigorously argumentative programme\\".The Times, 19 December 2006.

The helical design is most similar to the Gorlov helical turbine. Both are an evolution of the Darrieus wind turbine. It had won several awards including the \\"Sustainable Innovation Award\\" in 2006 but did not perform. The turbine consists of three vertical airfoil blades, each having a helical twist of 120 degrees. This feature spreads the torque evenly over the entire revolution, thus preventing the destructive pulsations of the straight-bladed giromill (Darrieus turbine). The wind pushes each blade around on both the windward and leeward sides of the turbine. The qr5 turbine, rated for 6 kW, measures 3.0m in diameter by 5m high. Poor performance of a QR5 installed at Welsh government offices in Aberystwyth has been blamed on poor siting. The turbine's overall cost was given as £48,000 and in 2012 it generated an average of 33 kWh per month, a value of £5.28 per month. Quiet Revolution Limited entered liquidation in April 2014. VWT Power Limited (trading as Quiet Revolution) acquired the IP and assets later that year to support the fleet of legacy Qr5 turbines and with the intention of developing a new generation of products. It became apparent quite early on that many of the early iterations of their Qr5 design had been superseded by huge step changes in their knowledge and progression of the original design. Many of the flaws of the early design were being eradicated by the later iterations however there some fundamental inherent design faults which would take a complete halt and re think. This had been started by QR Limited before going into administration and the basis of the new Qr6 was born however since then this new design has undergone significant design modifications resulting in the new Qr6 being launched today. The blades have a 60% greater swept area, are stiffer and the trailing edge is more precise, reducing drag. The rotating mass of the turbine is now almost completely manufactured from composite materials significantly improving the power to weight ratio. Furthermore the control equipment is more intelligent, accurate and efficient, resulting in less down time caused by noise on the line and vibration issues being misinterpreted. The new software and algorithms have dramatically changed the turbine, enabling an impressive increase in energy generation and reliability.

He was also the first soldier from Idaho to be awarded the Medal of Honor. Neibaur was an automatic rifleman who served in France during World War I. On October 16, 1918, while in battle at Côté de Chatillion, while trying to eliminate a machine gun nest, Neibaur became surrounded by 15 German soldiers. With a pistol, Neibaur killed four, and captured eleven. He received six medals for his bravery and \\"heroic exploits\\", as well as a purple heart. Afflicted by the Great Depression, Neibaur had little money and couldn't feed his family. Neibaur eventually sent his medals to Congress stating, \\"I cannot eat them.\\" Neibaur died three years later of tuberculosis. Thomas C. Neibaur Veteran Park was dedicated in Sugar City, Idaho with a monument commemorating Neibaur. His war medals reside with the Idaho State Historical Society. Family and early life Thomas Neibaur had a very strong family heritage and connection in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) beginning with his great-grandfather, Alexander Neibaur (1808–1883). Alexander was from Alsace-Lorraine, a graduate of medical and dental university training in Berlin, and was fluent in several languages. Thomas' grandfather, Joseph Neibaur, settled in Paris, Idaho in the 1880s. Thomas' parents were James C. Neibaur (1862–1938) and Elizabeth Croft Neibaur (1863–1938). The ninth of ten children, Thomas was born in Sharon, Idaho. When he was eleven years old, the family moved to Teton, near Sugar City, Idaho. Thomas and his father worked in the large sugar beet factory built in 1903, the namesake of Sugar City. In August 1907, Neibaur was baptized into the LDS Church. Though his parents and family remained faithful members of the LDS Church, Neibaur drifted from active participation. He always considered himself a believer in God, though he maintained he was not religious. Even though he was not an active member of the LDS Church, he maintained connections to it because of his family. Military service Neibaur enlisted into the Idaho National Guard on March 30, 1917, a week before the United States declaration of war against Germany on April 6, 1917. The Army inducted him into federal service on April 8. He then served in the Rocky Mountain northwest, guarding tunnels and railroad bridges until October 1917 when he and his 2nd Idaho Infantry Regiment was ordered to Camp Mills, Long Island. There he became an automatic rifleman in newly organized 41st Division of western states guardsman. Later moving to Camp Merritt, New Jersey the 41st Division deployed to France where it became a replacement division for the other units of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF). Neibaur and thousands of other western guardsmen were transferred to other divisions already in France, he being assigned to M Company, 167th Infantry Regiment of the 42nd Division. This division was nicknamed the \\"Rainbow\\" division from a comment that Maj. Douglas MacArthur said while serving on the army staff that it had soldiers from many states like a \\"rainbow\\" across the land from end to end. The 167th was a regiment of the Alabama National Guard, but as all units its 4,000 men were from the regular army, national guard and draftees. The regiment has its origin from the 4th Alabama with lineage and honors from when it was a regiment in the Confederate States army. Campaigns and battles Private Neibaur served as an automatic rifleman using the French manufactured Chauchat 8mm automatic rifle using a \\"banana clip\\" of 20 rounds. In February he went into the lines on the Lunéville sector, and then later in March at the Barracat sector. He did not see any real combat except for artillery fire until March 1918, once the German \\"Ludendorff Offensive\\" commenced on March 21, 1918. He served on the Somme River where the 42nd Division was part of the French 7th Army. In June, more American divisions entered the front lines and Neibaur fought in several campaigns, the Aisne, the Aisen-Marne, and the Champagne-Marne through August 1918. As with any infantry regiment, brigade or division, the units rotated and relieved one another on a routine basis. During this time, Neibaur was wounded or incapacitated temporarily by German mustard gas. In August, Brig. Gen. Douglas MacArthur assumed command of the 84th Infantry Brigade which consisted of Neibaur's 167th Infantry Regiment and the Iowa National Guard 168th Infantry Regiment. In early September General John Pershing, commander of the AEF, received permission to \\"reduce\\" the salient that had developed for several years at Saint-Mihiel, southeast of Verdun. Beginning on September 12, 1918, the American 1st Army under Pershing commenced an offensive, the first independent American offensive in its own sector of the Western Front. Within days, the crumbling German army was thrown back and the salient was reduced causing a \\"straightening\\" of the front line. On September 26, the Americans launched their second offensive between the Argonne Forest on the left and Meuse River on the right. By October 14, the 42nd Division was stalled along the strongly defended Kreimehilde \\"stellung\\" (German for position or line). Unlike the Saint-Mihiel, the Germans conducted an aggressive and spirited defense. The two main terrain features holding up the Rainbow division's advance were hills: Hill 288 and the Còte de Châtillon. The 167th, specifically the Neibaur's 3rd Battalion, received the order on the 15th to attack and capture Còte de Châtillon. On October 16, 1918, the American attacks captured Còte de Châtillon, though there remained several pockets of German units and many isolated machine gun positions. Neibaur along with two other soldiers, an observer and a loader, volunteered to flank and remove a network of machine guns just over a hundred yards from \\"M\\" Company and 3rd Battalion's hastily occupied positions. Crawling up a draw between two spurs, Neibaur's automatic rifle team encountered a wire obstacle and was then fired upon. Neibaur's two team members were killed and he received three wounds in the right thigh. Passing through the wire entanglements he positioned his automatic rifle behind a dirt berm. Some Germans observed his movement and approximately 50 or so attacked him. He opened fire with his Chauchat automatic rifle, killing or wounding most of them until his gun jammed, firing some 50 rounds or two and a half clips. Discarding his automatic rifle, he tried to crawl or run downhill some 100 yards to friendly lines and was wounded a fourth time in the hip and fell unconscious. Awaking, he found himself captured by some fifteen or so Germans who had survived the counterattack against him. The Germans had to take cover due to the supporting fire from Neibaur's \\"M\\" Company. Neibaur then realized that the Germans had dropped on the ground near him his semi-automatic pistol, the Colt made M1911. He crawled to it and as he did so, some of the Germans charged him with bayonets, four of whom he killed immediately with his pistol and then within minutes, though wounded four times, he captured eleven Germans and led them to the American lines below. Later life Private Thomas Neibaur spent several months in field hospitals recovering from his wounds. His last wound by a German machine gun bullet remained in his hip the rest of his life. He was the first native-born Idaho resident to be awarded a Medal of Honor, as well as the first member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to be awarded a Medal of Honor. Neibaur also represented the first private in the U.S. Army to receive the Medal of Honor. On February 9, 1919 at the AEF headquarters at Chaumont, France, Gen. John Pershing presented the Medal of Honor to him, along with a dozen other officers and soldiers. Private Neibaur arrived home at Sugar City, Idaho on May 27, 1919 and was welcomed by a throng of some 10,000 people, celebrating a state-wide holiday proclaimed the governor who was in attendance as \\"Neibaur Day.\\" He married Sarah \\"Lois\\" Shepard in November 1919, she being six years older than he was and having a son from a previous marriage. Together they had nine children. In 1928, Neibaur had an accident at the sugar beet factory where his arm was severely mangled in a cutting machine. Workers had to disassemble the machine to free his arm. The Neibaurs had three sons who died from accidents: one (18 months old) drowned in an abandoned cesspool; another (two years) was killed by an automobile; and one (six years) died from burns and infection from a wood- burning stove. By 1939, in the last dire years of the Depression, Neibaur was destitute. He received a small pension from his Medal of Honor, and was a clerk for Works Progress Administration (WPA). He was unable to feed and care for his family on his low income. US Senator William Borah of Idaho attempted to pass a law in the US Congress promoting Neibaur to the rank of major in the regular army, and then placing him on the retired list. This failed. Discouraged by his misfortune, Neibaur mailed his Medal of Honor and other decorations to Congress in Washington stating that \\"I cannot eat them.\\" Local newspapers covered the story.Time Magazine reference of Thomas' death and returning Medal of Honor Three days later he secured a position as a night security officer at the state capitol in Boise. His wife Lois died in 1940, at the age of forty-eight from complications of rheumatic fever from her childhood. Neibaur married Lillian Golden in 1941, and a short time later he entered a veterans' hospital in Walla Walla, Washington for tuberculosis and died there on December 23, 1942, at the age of forty-four.

Inspired by a true story, it is about a young prostitute who participated in a documentary about her efforts to abandon the streets, only to commit suicide hours before the movie was to be broadcast. Like Yosha's previous two films, Dead End Street represented Israel at Cannes. Bruce Springsteen contributed three songs to the soundtrack. Plot Alice, a young street walker, receives an opportunity of a lifetime when a television crew casts her to star in a documentary about prostitution in Tel-Aviv. Alice, a 17-year-old girl from the gutters of the city, is exposed for the first time to the glitzy world of make believe. For her personal safety and the crew's convenience, Alice is invited, during the shoot, to stay in the home of Yoram, the director and Mary, his producer- girlfriend. Alice's presence exceeds all expectations as she lays out her gloomy life story in front of the cameras. When Mary notices that Yoram gets more than just professionally involved with Alice, she wraps the production as quickly as possible. Alice doesn't want to go back to the streets, but she doesn't belong in the ‘decent’ world either. Alice finds herself in a dead end.

She has won international acclaim, and is considered one of the leading Handel sopranos of her time. Life She was born in Nelson, British Columbia, Canada. She spent her early years in the settlement of Argenta, from which she later took her professional name (to avoid being mistaken for another Canadian soprano, Nancy Hermiston.) At the age of 11 she started formal voice lessons with Dr. Amy Ferguson of Nelson, and sang with one of the school choirs at L.V. Rogers High School in Nelson. By that time, she was frequently making trips to Vancouver, British Columbia, so she could hear musical events and have additional singing lessons. After graduation from high school in 1975, she was a student of Jacob Hamm in Vancouver and of Martin Chambers at the University of Western Ontario, graduating in 1980. The same year she won 1st prize in the Sophie Carmen Eckhardt-Gramatté Competition. After further training with Jacqueline Richard in Düsseldorf from 1980 to 1981, and with Gérard Souzay, in 1982 she settled in London, England and completed her studies with Vera Rozsa, and Sir Peter Pears. In 1990, she won Canada's Virginia Parker Prize.Canada Council. The Virginia Parker Prize Cumulative list of Winners n Career Her professional operatic debut was in two roles in Rameau's Hippolyte et Aricie at the 1983 Aix-en-Provence Festival. In 1990 she received the Virginia P. Moore Prize, an annual award from the Canada Council for development of the career of a young Canadian classical musician. Argenta performs with period instrument ensembles. These have included the Academy of Ancient Music and The English Concert, La Petite Bande, and such prominent conductors as Trevor Pinnock, Christopher Hogwood, John Eliot Gardiner, Roger Norrington and Sigiswald Kuijken. She is particularly noted for her performances of the vocal music of the two leading figures in English music during the Baroque era: George Frideric Handel and Henry Purcell. When she returned to the Aix-en-Provence Festival in 1990, it was to sing in the latter's The Fairy Queen. She has performed most of the major Handel operas and oratorios. She also sings all the large-scale Bach choral/vocal works (Mass in B minor, the Passions, the Christmas Oratorio, and several of the cantatas). In the classical era she is noted for performances of Haydn masses (some of which she has recorded with Pinnock and Richard Hickox), Haydn's Creation, the role of Zerlina in Don Giovanni and Despina in Così fan tutte. However, she sings music of all eras. She has recorded Schubert for the Virgin Classics label, and has sung in performances of music by Mahler and Schoenberg. She currently lives in Victoria, British Columbia, after having England as her home for much of her career. Argenta teaches at the Victoria Conservatory of Music and regularly performs in Victoria with the Victoria Baroque Players, in the Early Music Society of the Islands series, in her own oratorio workshop concerts and other venues.

For years upon end, Zheng Lun would train his legendary black crow troops and attain perfection with his evil taming bars.

Or I will present you with my head before all these generals.\\" So saying, Zheng Lun would mount his golden-eyed beast, grab hold of his two bars, and set forth with his great army of three thousand black crow troops. In appearance before Chong Heihu, it could easily be seen that Zheng Lun's hair was like that of golden needles and his face was like that of a purple plum. Immediately, Zheng Lun's great taming bars would parry off against Chong's duel golden axes and thus a great battle ensued between the two renowned warriors. Soon enough, Zheng would recognize the large red gourd atop Chong's back and instantly realize that it is his source for his magic. Thus, Zheng Lun would shoot two large jets from both of his nostrils to suck up Chong's spirit and soul. Once this process was completed, Zheng Lun returned to Ji province with the unconscious Chong as prisoner. Following this point, Zheng Lun would not appear again for quite some time.

This taxon is closely related to the allopatric Cape rockjumper Chaetops frenatus; the two species of Chaetops are the only living members of the Chaetopidae (rockjumper family). A female with a caterpillar An immature Drakensberg rockjumper A copy of the original description by Layard. This rockjumper is 23–25 cm long with a long black tail and strong legs. The male has a dark grey head with a thin white supercilium and a broad white moustache. The back and wings are dark grey. The underparts are orange and the rump is rufous red. The female and juvenile have a paler grey head, upperparts and wings, a duller head pattern, an orange rump, and buff underparts. The call is a loud wheeoo. The Cape rockjumper male has rufous red underparts, and the female and young are darker buff below than in C. aurantius. This is a ground-nesting species which forages on rocky slopes and scree. It frequently perches on rocks. Breeding is often cooperative; one or two additional individuals, usually a pair's offspring of the preceding breeding season, may assist the parents in territorial defence and alarm calling, and in the feeding of nestlings and fledglings. Taxonomy Chaetops aurantius was described in 1867 by Edgar Leopold Layard in his book The birds of South Africa. He placed the genus Chaetops in the thrush family. However, DNA studies have shown that the rockjumpers are not closely related to the thrushes – they are possibly basal passerida, and appear to be related to the rail-babbler and the rockfowl. Some authorities (notably Dickinson and Christidis) treat the two rockjumpers as a single species, Chaetops frenatus, with two subspecies.

She leads international polar scientific programs and has been committed to installing a major astronomical observatory at the heart of Antarctica.  Education and early life  Chadid was born October 11, 1969 in Casablanca to a humble Moroccan family. Her father and mother were a blacksmith and a housewife respectively. She was one of seven children. At 12 years old, she discovered her love of astronomy from a Johannes Kepler book gifted to her by her brother. In 1992, Chadid graduated from the University of Hassan II Casablanca with a master's degree in Physics and Mathematics. In 1993, she graduated from the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis with a Master of Advanced Studies and three years later earned her PhD in Astronomy and Space from the Paul Sabatier University from her research detecting hypersonic shock waves in pulsating stars and explaining their origin. She also obtained the highest university qualification degree Habilitation HDR, a second PhD, at the University of Nice Sophia-Antipolis. Chadid completed several executive education programs at John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University as well.  Career  Merieme Chadid joined the Centre national de la recherche scientifique and then the European Southern Observatory soon after earning her PhD. She worked on the installation of The Very Large Telescope, the largest telescope in the world at the time, in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile. She has worked as an astronomer in the French public university system, and she is a steering committee member of the International Astronomical Union. Merieme Chadid became the first Moroccan as well as the first female French astronomer to reach the heart of Antarctica, and the first to plant an Arab flag (the Moroccan flag) in Antarctica in 2005 when she achieved her first polar expedition to set up a new observatory. Of her many achievements, her most treasured accomplishment has been her work under extreme conditions in the heart of Antarctica, one of the highest, coldest, most deserted and inaccessible places in the world. She is considered the world's first astronomer to be committed to installing the large astronomical observatory in Antarctica, where she has carried out pioneering work. In interviews, she has compared the installation of the observatory to a space mission, an area characterized by only a thin layer of turbulence, making it easier to observe faraway objects than observatories in other parts of the world. As night continues for several months of the year, researchers at the Antarctica stations have the advantage of being able to study the stars 24/7. Merieme Chadid promotes education by giving lectures, attending conferences, supervising students, and her documentary on astronomy, Tarik Annujah, has played on the Al Jazeera Children's Channel. Her most published research aims to understand and decipher early star formation and the stellar evolution and pulsation towards of understanding of the Universe. She was listed by Forbes Magazine as one of the thirty most interesting and fascinating workers in the world.  Personal life  Merieme Chadid has been married to Jean Vernin, Director of Research of Centre National de Recherche Scientifique, since 31 March 2001 and has two children, Leyla Vernin and Felix Tycho Vernin.

Biography Brittain was born at Ranmoor, Sheffield, and was the son of W. H. Brittain. Following education at Repton School, Rossall School and Worcester College, Oxford (where he achieved third class honours in jurisprudence), he entered training in business at Sheffield. In 1897 he was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple, but did not practice. Journalism Instead he developed an interest in journalism. He became an assistant to Sir William Ingram, managing director of the Illustrated London News. He subsequently worked for Sir Arthur Pearson, founder of the Daily Express. Brittain worked on the staff of The Standard and Evening Standard, two of Pearson's papers. Links with United States Brittain tried to foster closer Anglo-American relations. To this end he founded the Pilgrims Society in 1902. For 17 years, first as honorary secretary and then as chairman, steered the Society through its early life. He resigned the chairmanship in 1918, because of his parliamentary duties, and became its senior vice-president, and the only Pilgrim Emeritus. He was also a member of the original Committee of Sulgrave Manor Board, which was set up in 1914 to commemorate 100 years of peace between Great Britain and the United States. In addition to The Pilgrims, Brittain had many close associations with the United States. He was an honorary life member of the American Club, and the Society of Americans in London. The United States entered the First World War on the side of the Allies in 1917. American officers started to come to London, and Brittain took on the task of organising an Officers' Club. King George V, when accompanied by Queen Mary, inspecting the club, expressed surprise that the chairs were so much more sumptuous than he could get for Buckingham Palace. In May 1918 Brittain conducted a U.S. delegation, including a number of labour leaders, to the battlefields of France. The tour included personal visits to senior commanders including General Pershing, the American Commander-in-Chief in France, who paid Brittain high praise for his part in organising the American Officers' Club in London. On 25 January 1972 he was the guest of honour at a dinner to celebrate the 70th Anniversary of the Pilgrims Society at which were read a message from Queen Elizabeth II and a personal letter to Brittain from the United States President, Richard Milhous Nixon. Commonwealth Press Union In 1909 he organised the First Imperial Press Conference. After the conference, he founded the Empire Press Union (later the Commonwealth Press Union) and lived to see his concept grow into an organisation which included in its membership over 1,500 newspapers and news agencies throughout the Commonwealth. Brittain was an honorary life member of the CPU, attended many of its Quinquennial Conferences, regularly attended all its Council Meetings and Conferences, and in 1959 personally inaugurated its 50th (Golden Jubilee) Annual Conference. Harry Brittain was also an Honorary Member of the Foreign Press Association, the Association of American Correspondents in London and the Institute of Journalists. For many years, until the Anschluss, he was the only foreign Director of the Neue Freie Presse of Vienna. Politics Along with Pearson, Brittain formed the Tariff Reform League. This led him into Conservative politics. At the 1918 general election he received the \\"coupon\\" as the Coalition Conservative candidate for the newly created seat of Acton, Middlesex. He won the seat and held it until 1929, when an increase in the industrial working population of the constituency and a swing against the incumbent Conservative government saw him defeated by James Shillaker of the Labour Party. He is best remembered for steering the Protection of Birds Act 1925 (sometimes called the \\"Brittain Act\\") through parliament. He was created KBE in 1918 for services in the First World War, and a CMG in 1924. He was also honoured by several continental countries for his international services. He visited 90 countries, crossed the Atlantic by sea more than 70 times and had been entertained in all 50 states of the USA.

Created a Dame Commander of the DBE in 1929, Lady Brittain was a harpist, made member of the Celtic Congress (1933) and a Bard of the Gorsedd of Cornwall (Gorseth Kernow), using the name Colom Wyn or White Dove. She died in 1943. After being a widower for 18 years, in 1961 Sir Harry married, secondly, Muriel Leslie Dixon, daughter of the late H. Leslie Dixon. He died, aged 100 years, in Westminster, London. Sir Harry Brittain wrote three books of reminiscences. He was the author of many publications including From Verdun to the Somme, which went through five editions in six days.

It argues that while he submitted to Yahweh's omnipotence, Job nevertheless proved to be more moral and conscious than God, who tormented him without justification under the influence of Satan. This scandal made it necessary for God to become united with man. Satan was banished from heaven and God incarnated as purely good, through a virgin birth, into the sinless redeemer Jesus Christ. Eventually, however, God will incarnate his evil side as well. For this to happen, the Holy Ghost left by Christ on earth has to enter \\"empirical\\", sinful human beings in whom the divine can be realized completely. Jung turns to the Book of Ezekiel, the Book of Enoch, and especially the Book of Revelation to consider how this may unfold. He suggests that the modern era, in which humanity wields immense technological power, will be crucial to this second divine birth. Consequently, he interprets the 1950 papal dogma of the Assumption of Mary as easing the transition towards completeness by re- emphasizing the feminine aspect of God. The book was first published in English in 1954. It has received both criticism and admiration from commentators; author Joyce Carol Oates and theologian John Shelby Spong highlighted it as a major work. Summary Jung considers the Book of Job a landmark development in the \\"divine drama,\\" for the first time contemplating criticism of God (Gotteskritik). Jung described Answer to Job as \\"pure poison,\\" referring to the controversial nature of the book.Storr, A. 1973. Jung. Fontana Modern Masters Series. He did, however, feel an urge to write the book. The basic thesis of the book is that, as well as having a good side, God also has a fourth side—the evil face of God. This view is inevitably controversial, but Jung claimed it is backed up by references to the Hebrew Bible. Jung saw this evil side of God as the missing fourth element of the Trinity, which he believed should be supplanted by a Quaternity. However, he also discusses in the book whether the true missing fourth element is the feminine side of God. Indeed, he saw the dogmatic definition of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary by Pope Pius XII in 1950 as being the most significant religious event since the Reformation. Another theme in the book is the inversion of the biblical assertion that God sent his son Christ to die for the sins of humanity. Jung maintains that upon realizing his mistreatment of Job, God sends his son to humankind to be sacrificed in repentance for God's sins. Jung sees this as a sign of God's ongoing psychological development. Reception Author Joyce Carol Oates, in her review \\"Legendary Jung\\" (from her collections of essays The Profane Art), considers Answer to Job to be Jung's most important work. The Episcopal Bishop and humanist Christian author John Shelby Spong, in his book Re-Claiming the Bible for a Non-Religious World (2011), also considers Answer to Job to be Jung's \\"most profound work.\\"Spong, John Shelby. 2011. Re-Claiming the Bible for a Non-Religious World. p. 164. Jungian scholar Murray Stein claims Jung viewed the Book of Job as an example of a Scriptural religious experience: : \\"In Jung’s interpretation, Job is completely innocent. He is a scrupulously pious man who follows all the religious conventions, and for most of his life, he is blessed with good fortune. This is the expected outcome for a just man in a rationally ordered universe. But then God allows Satan to work on him, bringing misfortune and misery. Being overwhelmed with questions and images of divine majesty and power, Job is then silenced. He realizes his inferior position vis-a-vis the Almighty. But he also retains his personal integrity, and this so impresses God that He is forced to take stock of Himself. Perhaps He is not so righteous after all! [ As Marc Fonda observes, God’s omniscience precludes self- awareness. Being omniscient, God has no concentrated self to speak of. Being a part of everything, God has no opportunity to distinguish self from non-self. However, as God knows the thoughts of humans, through the thoughts of his creation he can experience what self-awareness is. ] And out of this astonishing self-reflection, induced in God by Job’s stubborn righteousness, He, the Almighty, is pushed into a process of transformation that leads eventually to His incarnation as Jesus. God develops empathy and love through his confrontation with Job, and out of it a new relationship between God and humankind is born.\\"  Editions  *Rascher (1953, 1961, 1967) *Walter Verlag (1985) *Dtv Verlagsgesellschaft (1990) ; (2001) *Translation: Hull, R.

It is a satire exposing imperialism as revealed in the Boxer Uprising and its aftermath, the Boer War, and the Philippine–American War expressing his anti-Imperialist views. It mentions the historical figures Emilio Aguinaldo, William McKinley, Joseph Chamberlain, William Scott Ament and others, and fueled the Twain–Ament indemnities controversy. Background Mark Twain was 'an outspoken critic of American involvement in the Philippines and China',Maverick Marvin Harris, \\"China\\", 142, in The Mark Twain Encyclopedia. and \\"one of the mammoth figures in anti-imperialism, and certainly the foremost anti-imperialist literary figure\\", having become in January 1901 a vice president of the Anti- Imperialist League of New York.Everett H.

James Smylie explains the controversy: \\"Twain went after the respected Congregationalist minister, Reverend William Scott Ament, director of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. Ament joined other powers in seeking indemnities from the Chinese after the Boxer Rebellion against western exploitation in 1900. Twain, perhaps unfairly, was shocked that Ament would use such blood money for the \\"propagation of the Gospel\\" and to promote the \\"blessings of civilization\\" to brothers and sisters who \\"sit in darkness.\\" He declared to missionaries: Come home and Christianize Christians in the states!\\"Smylie, page 10. According to Twain biographer Albert Bigelow Paine, \\"Twain, of course, was fiercely stirred. The missionary idea had seldom appealed to him, and coupled with this business of bloodshed, it was less attractive than usual.

However, Yunzhongzi would take the newborn in as his own disciple; for he was destined to assist in the creation of the new Zhou Dynasty. Seven years later, at a time in which Ji Chang was fleeing for his life from the capital after finally being freed, Leizhenzi, now seven, was sitting with his master, Yunzhongzi, atop Mount South End. Once Leizhenzi was told to assist his father, but first grab a hold of his weapon - which was by the cliff's edge - Leizhenzi looked everywhere in wonder. Soon enough, Leizhenzi found two large apricots at the edge of the cliff and ate them both with due haste. Immediately following this, two large wings suddenly sprouted from Leizhenzi's back and his face became like that of a monster's. Once Leizhenzi returned to his father, he received a golden rod as his weapon and was instructed to finally assist his father. Thus, once Leizhenzi met his father atop a mountain slope, he first dealt with General Lei and Yin by creating a rockslide with his golden rod. While hanging onto Leizhenzi's back, Leizhenzi then transported his father through the five mountain passes. With these words, Leizhenzi departed from his father: \\"My father, you are now safe. Now I must say good-bye and return to Mount South End. Please take care of yourself. I will see you again someday.\\" References * Investiture of the Gods Chapter 21 - 22 See also * God of thunder * Leigong Investiture of the Gods characters ","title":"Leizhenzi"},{"id":"9712416","text":"Events during the year 1926 in Northern Ireland.

Murder in the Midlands: Larry Gene Bell and the 28 Days of Terror That Shook South Carolina. The History Press. . - October 4, 1996) was an American double murderer in Lexington County, South Carolina, who was electrocuted for the murders of Sharon Faye \\"Shari\\" Smith and Debra May Helmick. Bell forced Smith to write a \\"Last Will and Testament\\" before he murdered her and taunted her family by telephone. Background Larry Gene Bell was born in Ralph, Alabama and had three sisters and one brother. The family reportedly moved frequently, with Bell attending Eau Claire High School in Columbia, South Carolina from 1965-67. The Bells moved to Mississippi, where Larry Gene Bell graduated high school and trained as an electrician. He returned to Columbia, married, and had one son. Bell joined the Marines in 1970 but was discharged the same year due to a knee injury suffered when he accidentally shot himself when cleaning a gun. The following year, he worked as a correctional officer at the Department of Corrections in Columbia for one month. Bell and his family moved to Rock Hill, South Carolina in 1972 and the couple divorced in 1976. Victims Bell kidnapped 17-year-old Sharon Faye \\"Shari\\" Smith at gunpoint from the end of her driveway on Platt Springs Road in Lexington County, South Carolina, on May 31, 1985. Her car was found abandoned at the curb near the mailbox. Over the next few days, Bell called the Smith family regularly from a payphone to tell them Shari was fine and to taunt them. In fact, Shari was likely killed within 12 hours of her abduction. Her body was found in Saluda County, South Carolina, after Bell called the Smith family and gave them directions to her remains. Bell then kidnapped 9-year-old Debra May Helmick near Old Percival Road in Richland County, South Carolina, killed her, and again called the Smith family to tell them where he had left her body. Bell was also a suspect in two other disappearances: the 1984 disappearance of Sandee Elaine Cornett, who was the girlfriend of one of Bell's coworkers; and that of Denise Newsom Porch, who was last seen in July 1975 and lived in an apartment complex close to where Bell had lived. Both young women vanished in Charlotte, North Carolina, and remain classified as missing. Arrest and trial During the largest manhunt in South Carolina history, Bell made eight telephone calls to the Smith family, often speaking with Shari's sister, Dawn. Bell eventually gave exact directions to the locations of both of the bodies and described to the family how he had killed Smith. On June 27, Bell was arrested after forensics was able to find indentations of an incomplete phone number on the stationery of the letter that was sent to Smith's family. Filling in the missing digits led the FBI to a couple who hired Bell for some work and also had him house sit for them while they were away. Further incriminating evidence was found in a search of Bell's apartment. During his six-hour testimony at his trial, Bell continuously blurted out bizarre comments and carried on nonstop theatrics, rambling continuously and refusing to answer questions. He later made statements indicating that he may have been attempting to fake mental illness in order to receive a more lenient sentence. He claimed to be Jesus Christ until his death. Execution Bell chose to die by the electric chair instead of lethal injection. Bell was the last death row inmate in South Carolina executed by electrocution (in 1996) until James Neil Tucker was executed in 2004 for the double murders of Rosa Lee Dolly Oakley and Shannon Lynn Mello.

Unusual among gulls, it breeds inland in the extremely dry Atacama Desert in northern Chile, although it is present as a non-breeding bird along much of the Pacific coast of South America. Description The sexes are similar in grey gulls. Adults grow to a length of about and weigh some . The head is white in summer but brownish-grey in winter. The body and wings are grey with the dorsal surface rather darker than the ventral region. The flight feathers are black and the inner primaries and the secondaries have white tips, visible in flight. The tail has a band of black with a white trailing edge. The legs and beak are black and the iris is brown.Josep del Hoyo, Andrew Elliott, Jordi Sargatal (Eds.): Handbook of the Birds of the World. Volume 3: Hoatzin to Auks. Lynx Edicions 1996, , p. 602 The call is similar to that of the laughing gull (Leucophaeus atricilla). Distribution The grey gull breeds inland in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile. Its non-breeding range includes Costa Rica, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Chile, and it has been recorded in the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. It is a vagrant to Panama. Behaviour =Breeding= For many years, it was a mystery as to where this bird breeds because no coastal colonies had been identified. However, in 1945, it was discovered that it bred in the Atacama Desert in the interior of Chile. This hot and arid environment has few predators and may be relatively safe for the breeding gulls. The site chosen for the nest, a scrape in the sand and often near rocks, is a waterless region some from the coast. Once the eggs hatch, the parents take it in turn to make the round trip to the sea to bring food and water to their offspring. The humidity, wind speed, air and surface temperatures vary widely on a daily basis and the gull has to use various thermo-regulatory mechanisms when nesting to maintain its body temperature and that of its eggs and chicks within acceptable limits. In the hottest part of the day the parent bird stands over its nest to prevent the eggs or chicks overheating. Its chief predator is the turkey vulture (Cathartes aura) and when threatened, the incubating parent sometimes leaves the nest temporarily, and when this happens the eggs need to have impervious shells in order to avoid losing too much water through evaporation. In fact, the evaporative loss from the eggs is found to be about one third of that which occurs in Heermann's gull (Larus heermanni), another desert nesting species. =Feeding= The typical habitat of the grey gull is sandy beaches and mudflats along the western coasts of South America where it probes with its beak in the sediment for invertebrate prey, particularly mole crabs. It also eats fish and ragworms, scavenges for offal and sometimes follows fishing boats. Status The grey gull has a restricted inland breeding range and a limited wintering range along the coasts of Ecuador, Peru and Chile. The population trend is believed to be downwards. However, the total number of birds is sufficiently large to justify listing the grey gull as being of \\"least concern\\" rather than including it in a more threatened category.

It is to the south of Leatherhead and north of Dorking at the foot of Box Hill on the River Mole. The hotel has been owned by Moorfield Group (a UK private equity firm) since 2007 and is operated by Accor Hotels under their mid-market Mercure brand.  History  The Hotel was founded in 1254 as the 'Fox and Hounds', and parts of the present buildings date back to the 16th century. The land on which the hotel stands was a detached part of the medieval Manor of Thorncroft (in Leatherhead) and was held in the mid- thirteenth century by Walter de Merton, the founder of Merton College, Oxford University. The main building, adjoining Old London Road, dates from the early nineteenth century. In 1882 the hotel became the 'Hare & Hounds', and was commonly known as the Burford Bridge. In 1905, Surrey Public Trust purchased it from Sir Trevor Lawrence, and it changed permanently to the Burford Bridge Hotel,Nathaniel Newnham-Davis's Gourmet's Guide to London (1914) later merging with Trusthouses in 1948. A 16th century mediaeval tithe barn from the nearby village of Abinger Hammer was re-erected adjoining the hotel in 1934 and now forms the core of the banqueting suite. The barn is alleged to include beams from ships of the Spanish Armada. An outdoor swimming pool was added in the same decade and the changing rooms have been restored to their original 1930s appearance. The Garden Bedrooms were built in 1973 and adjoin the main hotel. The hotel was flooded on 24 December 2013 when the River Mole burst its banks after heavy rainfall. Nine members of staff and 27 guests were evacuated by boat. The hotel was reopened on 1 September 2014 following renovation. =Notable Guests= After leaving London, John Keats took a room overlooking the gardens, and completed his epic poem Endymion there in 1819. (Keats is said to have been recommended the hotel by the essayist and literary critic William Hazlitt.) Robert Louis Stevenson was a guest in March 1878, during which time he wrote two short stories: Story of the Young Man with the Cream Tarts and Story of the Physician and the Saratoga Trunk. Other prominent visitors included Queen Victoria, Jane Austen, William Wordsworth and Sheridan. It was here too that Lord Nelson spent secret hours with his love Emma Hamilton, before going to vanquish Napoleon's fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar. The American businessman, Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt, visited the hotel frequently in the 1890s, stopping to take lunch and to collect telegrams. He and a number of other millionaires, including James Hazen Hyde, practised the old English coaching techniques of the early 19th century for sport. Vanderbilt would frequently drive the coach, perfectly apparelled as a coachman or groom. His party would take a one-day, two-day, or longer trip along chosen routes through several counties, going to prearranged inns and hotels along the routes, of which the Burford Bridge was one.

Active since the 1980s with his first album Mountains (1987), he belongs to the scene of Californian pioneers of electronic music. His style encloses the principal traits characterizing the evolution from Terry Riley's and Morton Subotnick's minimalism to the form of electronic new-age suite. Works Thom Brennan's music is realized almost exclusively with synthesizers, with rare use of samples and without any acoustic instrument.http://www.ambientvisions.com/thombrennansilver.htm His production consist mostly of beatless soundscapes; however, in a few works which he himself calls rhythmic journeys,http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/tbrennan Brennan employs percussive sounds and, more frequently, rhythmic synth patterns or timbral movements. His first work, Mountains, was recorded on a 2 track stereo cassette deck in 1987; it was inspired by memories of Thom Brennan's childhood on an island in the East China Sea.http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p37588 This album was one of the most ambitious works of the so-called Los Angeles school; Steve Roach helped with the production.http://www.pugachov.ru/eem/bjfram.html His compositions are largely inspired by nature,http://www.electronicmusicmall.com/Html/interviews2.htm#brennan especially by American Southwest landscapes and by Pacific Northwest forests. All this results in a neo-classical ambient impressionism distinguished by a strong visual approach, as shown in albums like Mist and others he has recorded, starting from 2001, after a move to Seattle. In addition to his solo productions, Brennan appeared in collaboration with other well-known ambient composers such as Steve Roach and Kevin Braheny on Western Spaces (1987) and Vidna Obmana on Amplexus: Collected Works from the 1995 Ltd Series (1997).

After the Second World War, IRI played a pivotal role in the Italian economic miracle of the 1950s and 1960s. It was dissolved in 2002. History In 1930 the Great Depression affected the Italian financial sector, seriously disrupting credit lines and making it difficult for companies to obtain loans. The Fascist regime led by Benito Mussolini, fearing a credit crunch with subsequent mass dismissals and a wave of social unrest, started to take over the banks' stakes in large industrial companies (such as steel, weapons and chemicals). At the same time, Mussolini tried to inject capital into failing businesses (Though restructured later). Although initially conceived as a temporary measure, IRI continued to operate throughout the period of the Fascist regime and well beyond. Although IRI was not intended to carry out real nationalizations, it became the de facto owner and operator of a large number of major banks and companies. By January 1934, the IRI reported that it controlled “48.5 percent of the share capital of Italy,” and a few months later acquired the capital of the banks themselves, prompting Mussolini to declare on May 26, 1934 to Italy's Chamber of Deputies that “Three-fourths of Italian economy, industrial and agricultural, is in the hands of the State.”Gianni Toniolo, editor, The Oxford Handbook of the Italian Economy Since Unification, Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 59 The IRI heavily succeeded in its goals as it saved failing banks and companies by restructuring and refinancing the companies and banks. By 1939 the IRI and other government agencies “controlled over four-fifths of Italy’s shipping and shipbuilding, three-quarters of its pig iron production and almost half that of steel.”Martin Blinkhorn, Mussolini and Fascist Italy, 2nd edition, New York: NY, Routledge, 1994, pp. 34-35 Political Historian Martin Blinkhorn noted that “This level of state intervention greatly surpassed that in Nazi Germany, giving Italy a public sector second only to that of Stalin’s Russia.”Martin Blinkhorn, Mussolini and Fascist Italy, 2nd edition, New York: NY, Routledge, 1994, p.35 After the war After the war, the survival of the Institute was uncertain, as it had been created more as a temporary solution than to meet long-tem goals. But it proved difficult for the state to make the large investments needed for private companies that would only yield returns in the long term. So IRI retained the structure it had under fascism. Only after 1950 was IRI's function better defined: a new thrust was instigated by Oscar Sinigaglia, who, planning to increase the production capacity of the Italian steel industry, formed an alliance with private industry. This gave IRI the new role of developing the industrial infrastructure of the country, not by means of individual investments, but by an unwritten division of labour. Examples were the development of the steel industry and the telephone network and the construction of the Autostrada del Sole, which began in 1956. \\"The IRI formula\\" The Italian economy grew rapidly in the 1960s, the IRI was one of the protagonists of the \\"Italian economic miracle\\". Other European countries, particularly the British Labour government, saw the \\"IRI formula\\" as a positive example of state intervention in the economy, better than the simple \\"nationalization\\" because it allowed for cooperation between public and private capital. Many companies had both kinds of capital. Many in the IRI group remained publicly traded, and corporate bonds issued by the Institute to fund their companies were heavily subscribed. At the head of IRI were leading members of the Christian Democracy party, such as Giuseppe Petrilli, president of the Institute from 1960 to 1979. In his writings, Petrilli developed a theory that emphasized the positive effects of the \\"IRI formula\\". Across IRI, companies were used for social purposes, and the state had to bear the costs and inefficiencies generated by their investments. IRI did not always follow normal commercial practices, but invested in the interests of the community, even uneconomically and to the extent of generating \\"improper charges\\". Critical of these welfare-oriented practices was the second President of the Italian Republic, the Liberal Luigi Einaudi, who said: \\"A public company, if not based on economic criteria, tends to a hospice type of charity.\\" Since the objectives of the state were to develop the southern economy and to maintain full employment, the IRI had to concentrate its investments in the south and to develop jobs in their companies. Petrilli's position reflected those, already widespread in Christian Democracy, that sought a \\"third way\\" between liberalism and communism; IRI's mixed system of state-owned enterprises seemed to achieve this hybrid between the two polarised systems. Investments and rescues IRI invested very large amounts in southern Italy, such as in the construction of Italsider in Taranto and Alfasud Pomigliano d'Arco and Pratola Serra in Irpinia. Others were planned but never carried out, such as the steelworks of Gioia Tauro. To avoid serious employment crises, the IRI was often called in to help private companies in trouble: examples are the bailouts of Motta and Shipbuilding Rinaldo Piaggio and the acquisition of food companies by Montedison. This gave rise to more activities and dependents for the Institute. Governance For most of its history the IRI was an ente pubblico economico, which reported formally to the Ministry of State Holdings. At its head were a board of directors and an advisory board, consisting of a Chairman and members appointed by the ruling political parties. The president of IRI was always appointed by the Christian Democrats, the vice-presidency was often provided by the Republican Party, for example Bruno Visentini for more than twenty years and then Pietro Armani, to counterbalance the weight of the Catholics with those of big business and the laity, represented by the Republicans. The appointment of the heads of banking, financial and other major companies was decided by the presidential committee, but especially during the tenure of Petrilli, the powers were concentrated in the hands of the president and a few people close to him. After the transformation of IRI into a limited company in 1992, the board was reduced to only three members, and the influence of Christian Democrat and other parties, in a period when many of their members were involved in the Tangentopoli investigation, was greatly reduced. In the year of privatization, the management of IRI was centralized in the hands of the Treasury. The IRI name remained in journalistic language as a byword for those who assign public investments to companies without strong business criteria. Government agencies such as the Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (a bank) and Sviluppo Italia have been dubbed \\"new IRI\\", with some negative connotations, to indicate that their purposes and policies tend to patronage, according to critics, rather than economic criteria. In 1980, IRI was a group of about 1,000 companies with more than 500,000 employees. For many years, it was the largest industrial company outside the United States. In 1992 it ended the year with revenues of 75,912 trillion lire, but with losses of 5,182 billion. In 1993 it was the world's seventh-largest company by revenue, with 67.5 billion dollars in sales. Privatisation After World War II, IRI became one of the largest state conglomerates in the world, owning many diverse businesses such as the autostrada system, the flag carrier Alitalia and many banks, steel, food, chemicals and telecom companies. It was divested and privatized during the 1980s and 1990s and eventually dissolved in 2002. The Andreatta-Van Miert agreement marked a significant acceleration of privatization, which started in 1992. Despite some opinions to the contrary, the Treasury chose not to privatize the IRI, but to sell off its operating companies; this policy was inaugurated under the first government of Giuliano Amato and was never called into question by later governments. In 1997 it reached the levels of indebtedness secured by the Andreatta-Van Miert agreement, but divestitures continued and the institute had lost any function but to sell its assets and to move towards settlement.

Moravian Serbia is named after Morava, the main river of the region. Independent principality in the region of Morava was established in 1371, and attained its largest extent in 1379 through the military and political activities of its first ruler, prince Lazar Hrebeljanović. In 1402 it was raised to the Serbian Despotate, which would exist until 1459 (de jure until the 1560s). The adjective Moravian does not imply that the state (Moravian Serbia) is affiliated in any way with the region of Moravia in the present-day Czech Republic. The term Moravian Serbia refers to the fact that the state comprised the basins of the Great Morava, West Morava, and South Morava rivers in present-day central Serbia. History Lazar Hrebeljanović was born in around 1329 in the fortress of Prilepac, near the town of Novo Brdo in the region of Kosovo, Kingdom of Serbia. Lazar was a courtier at the court of Serbian Tsar Stefan Uroš Dušan, and at the court of Dušan's successor, Tsar Stefan Uroš V (r. 1356–1371).Mihaljčić 2001, pp. 15–28 Uroš's reign was characterized by the weakening of the central authority and the gradual disintegration of the Serbian Empire. Powerful Serbian nobles became practically independent in the regions they controlled.Mihaljčić 2001, pp. 29–52 Lazar left the court Tsar Uroš in 1363 or 1365, and became a regional lord. He held the title of prince since at least 1371. His territory initially developed in the shadow of stronger regional lords. The strongest were the Mrnjavčević brothers, Vukašin and Jovan Uglješa. They were defeated and killed by the Ottoman Turks in the Battle of Mariča in 1371, after which Lazar took a part of their territory. Lazar and Tvrtko I, the Ban of Bosnia, jointly defeated in 1373 another strong noble, Nikola Altomanović. Most of Altomanović's territory was acquired by Lazar. About that time, Lazar accepted the suzerainty of King Louis I of Hungary,Mihaljčić 2001, pp. 53–77 who granted him the region of Mačva, or at least a part of it. With all these territorial gains, Lazar emerged as the most powerful Serbian lord. The state he then created is known in historiography as Moravian Serbia.Mihaljčić 2001, pp. 116–32 Moravian Serbia attained its full extent in 1379, when Lazar took Braničevo and Kučevo, ousting the Hungarian vassal Radič Branković Rastislalić from these regions.Mihaljčić 2001, pp. 78–115 Lazar's state was larger than the domains of the other lords on the territory of the former Serbian Empire. It also had a better organized government and army. The state comprised the basins of the Great Morava, West Morava, and South Morava Rivers, extending from the source of South Morava northward to the Danube and Sava Rivers. Its north-western border ran along the Drina River. Besides the capital Kruševac, the state included important towns of Niš and Užice, as well as Novo Brdo and Rudnik, two richest mining centres of medieval Serbia. Of all the Serbian lands, Lazar's state lay furthest from Ottoman centres, and was least exposed to the ravages of Turkish raiding parties. This circumstance attracted immigrants from Turkish-threatened areas, who built new villages and hamlets in previously poorly inhabited and uncultivated areas of Moravian Serbia. There were also spiritual persons among the immigrants, which stimulated the revival of old ecclesiastical centres and the foundation of new ones in Lazar's state. A Turkish raiding party, passing unobstructed through territories of Ottoman vassals, broke into Moravian Serbia in 1381. It was routed by Lazar's nobles Crep Vukoslavić and Vitomir in the Battle of Dubravica, fought near the town of Paraćin. In 1386, the Ottoman Sultan Murad I himself led much larger forces that took Niš from Lazar. It is unclear whether the encounter between the armies of Lazar and Murad at Pločnik, a site southwest of Niš, happened shortly before or after the capture of Niš. Lazar rebuffed Murad at Pločnik. After the death of King Louis in 1382, a civil war broke out in the Kingdom of Hungary. Lazar briefly participated in the war as one of the opponents of Prince Sigismund of Luxemburg, and he sent some troops to fight in the regions of Belgrade and Syrmia. These fights ended with no territorial gains for Lazar, who made peace with Sigismund in 1387. In the Battle of Kosovo fought on 15 June 1389, Lazar led the army which confronted a massive invading army of the Ottoman Empire commanded by Sultan Murad I. Both Prince Lazar and Sultan Murad lost their lives in the battle. Although the battle was tactically a draw, the mutual heavy losses were devastating only for the Serbs. Lazar was succeeded by his eldest son Stefan Lazarević. As he was still a minor, Moravian Serbia was administered by Lazar's widow, Milica. She was attacked from north, five months after the battle, by troops of the Hungarian King Sigismund. When Turkish forces, moving toward Hungary, reached the borders of Moravian Serbia in the summer of 1390, Milica accepted Ottoman suzerainty. Stefan Lazarević participated as an Ottoman vassal in the Battle of Karanovasa in 1394, the Battle of Rovine in 1395, the Battle of Nicopolis in 1396, and in the Battle of Angora in 1402. After Angora, he visited Constantinople, the capital city of the Byzantine Empire, where he was given the title of Despot, and since then his state became known as the Serbian Despotate in 1402.

It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Voždovac. It is also the name of a park- forest within the neighbourhood.  Location  Šumice is located in the south-eastern section of the hill of Pašino Brdo and in the northern section largely overlaps with the neighborhood of the same name. On the south it is bounded by the Ustanička street and on the east by the Vojislava Ilića street, both streets separating it from the neighborhood of Konjarnik. On the west, the park itself borders the neighborhood of Dušanovac.  Neighborhood  The neighborhood was constructed in the late 1960s and early 1970s. A modern settlement, with many green areas, can roughly be divided in two parts: southern, with residential building, and northern with smaller, family houses and villas which were quite popular among Belgrade's celebrities in the 1980s. The population in 2011 was 6,348. The main features in the neighborhood are: * \\"Sport Center Šumice\\", built in 1974, used by the futsal club KMF Konjarnik and the basketball and volleyball teams and for other events (karate and judo championships, etc.). Previously, it was the \\"House of the Pioneers of Voždovac\\" (Dom Pionira Voždovac), including a cinema within the complex, which is located in the south-east corner of the park. * New business center of \\"KoŠum\\" named after Šumice, but technically belonging to the neighborhood of Konjarnik. * Hotel Srbija. * Health center \\"Šumice\\". * Belgrade's VIII Gymnasium (ex XI) (in the northern corner of the park).  Park  = History = Šumice originated in the 1950s. It was an effort to create the forested belt around the Belgrade (for example, Banjica Forest was created as a part of the same project). = Wildlife = The park is inhabited by hedgehogs and bats, but the main attraction in the park are the squirrels which often leave the park and climb on the trees in people's yards. Woodpeckers and blue tits, living in the park in the 1980s, are not seen anymore. By 2017 hedgehogs and squirrels also disappeared from the forest. = Characteristics = The park consists of two parts, separated by the Vojvode Toze street into western (larger) and eastern sections. In the 1990s, in the general air of lawlessness, attempts were made to build concrete objects (shops, kiosks, etc.) in the park itself, but eventually they were removed. In spring 2007, the park was reconstructed. Maps, new wooden gazebos, benches, trash cans and children playgrounds were placed, while a new trim trail through the park was arranged. The park covers an area of and has almost of paths. and has over 2,900 individual trees. They mostly include ash, black locust, oak and maple. After several consecutive dry years, almost 200 maple trees withered by 2013 and were replaced with the over 300 seedlings. Another reconstruction began in September 2019. New objects include 25 rest pavilions, both open and covered, chess tables, new drainage system and lights. Though the deadline was 31 December 2019, the works continued well into 2020. Works included construction of the children's playground and exercise attraction \\"Drveni grad\\" (\\"Woodville\\"). = 2012 incident = On 20 May 2012, group of 20 people hastily entered the forest's section between the Sport Center and the Ustanička street, armed with chainsaws and started to cut the trees. Citizens from the buildings across the Ustanička immediately alerted the authorities, even physically confronted the perpetrators and filmed them with phones. After cutting seven maple trees, which were over 40 years old, the felons ran away as the inspectors, police and later even the mayor of Belgrade Dragan Đilas arrived at the spot. It turned out that it was a private job of the Sport Center's manager who wanted to illegally clear the land so he could build a balloon sports hall.

Although similar to LASIK laser surgery, the intrastromal procedure is novel in that it uses a single femtosecond laser referenced to the corneal surface to cleave a thin lenticule from the corneal stroma for manual extraction. It has been described as a painless procedure. For candidates to qualify for this treatment, they have their corneal stroma thickness checked to make sure that post operative thickness won't be too thin. The lenticule to be extracted is accurately cut to the correction prescription required by the patient using a photodisruption laser-tissue interaction. The method of extraction can be via a LASIK-type flap, but more recently a flapless technique makes a small tunnel incision in the corneal periphery. Currently in the US the procedure is only approved for nearsightedness. After the femtosecond laser has separated the lenticule, a blunt spatula is inserted through the incision between the lenticule and the stroma and carefully rotated to ensure that the lenticule is completely detached prior to removal by forceps. The procedure has been described as safe and predictable in treating myopia and astigmatism. Some theoretical advantages are that the technique is minimally invasive compared with other flap based treatments and no collateral damage occurs to surrounding tissue due to the high speed of the femtosecond laser. There are limited studies on corneal wound healing and inflammatory response after this treatment has been carried out. There is a suggestion that the expression of fibronectin which is associated with wound healing is less in this method compared with femtosecond-LASIK. Because SMILE treatment is relatively new compared with other laser correction treatments, result studies are limited, but postoperative five year (SMILE) outcomes indicate that the results have been stable after 5 years of follow-up. In some cases post operative tear secretion and dry eye syndrome have been observed along with similar post operative complications seen in LASIK surgery. As lenticule extraction techniques evolve, there is a possibility that extracted lenticules can be cryogenically preserved either for future donation, or re-implantation. Proof of concept has been carried out on primates where lenticules were extracted from monkeys and allogenically transplanted into other monkeys with positive results. Contoura Vision was compared against Small Incision Lenticule Extraction (SMILE) to check the effectiveness by Kanellopoulos AJ and the results were published in the Journal of Refractive Surgery in 2017. At 3 months, 86.4% of the Contoura Vision group and 68.2% of the SMILE group had UDVA of 20/20 (P < .002) and 59.1% and 31.8%, respectively, had UDVA of 20/16 (P < .002). Spherical equivalent refraction (±0.50 D) was 95.5% for the Contoura Vision group and 77.3% for the SMILE group (P < .002). Residual refraction cylinder (≤ 0.25 D) was 81.8% for the Contoura Vision group and 50% for the SMILE group (P < .001). Contrast sensitivity (6 cycles/degree) was 7.2 ± 1.01 in the Contoura Vision group and 6.20 ± 1.52 in the SMILE group. Objective Scatter Index measurements at 3 months were 1.35 in the Contoura Vision group and 1.42 in the SMILE group. The author concluded that Contoura Vision was found to be superior compared to SMILE for all the visual performance parameters that were studied, irrespective the parameters were subjective and objective.

Early life and education Richardson was born in Jamestown Township, Michigan and attended the common schools. He engaged in agricultural and mercantile pursuits and was elected township clerk eight years in succession. He was a member of the Michigan House of Representatives from Ottawa County 2nd district, from 1885 to 1887 and 1891 to 1892, and served as speaker of the house in the two years. He moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan in 1893. Controversy in election to the House of Representatives In 1892, as the candidate for the Democratic Party, Richardson won a close election for U.S. Representative from Michigan's 5th congressional district. Richardson won the November 8, 1892, general election by a plurality of 10 votes and received a certificate of election from the board of state canvassers. The defeated candidate, incumbent Republican Charles E. Belknap, requested a recount in Ionia County, alleging irregularities. The Michigan Supreme Court ordered a recount on February 3, 1893, which subsequently resulted in a plurality of 19 votes for Belknap. The new board of state canvassers then issued a certificate of election to Belknap. The contest was brought to the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives on August 8, 1893. Following debate on the validity of the contestants’ credentials, the House voted to seat Richardson, referring the matter to the House Committee on Elections. Following further examination, the committee issued a report upholding Richardson’s claim to the seat. Richardson served in the 53rd Congress from March 4, 1893 to March 3, 1895. He declined to be a candidate for re-nomination in 1894. Career after politics Richardson then began operating a dairy farm in Grand Rapids. He was an unsuccessful Democratic candidate for the Michigan Senate 16th District in 1896, and was secretary of Michigan Union Silver Party in 1899. He moved to Kennewick, Washington in 1904 and engaged in agricultural pursuits and in the transfer, livery, and fuel business his company named Kennewick Transfer & Storage was located at 112 W Kennewick Ave. He was twice elected mayor of Kennewick and also served as chairman of the school board. He moved to Ellensburg, Washington and in 1916 engaged in agricultural pursuits. Retirement and death George F. Richardson retired to private life in 1919 and made his home in Bellevue, Washington where he died. He is interred in the Odd Fellows Cemetery, Ellensburg.

Formal statement The theorem states that a topological space X is metrizable if and only if it is regular and T0 and has a σ-discrete basis. A family of sets is called σ-discrete when it is a union of countably many discrete collections, where a family \\\\mathcal{F} of subsets of a space X is called discrete, when every point of X has a neighborhood that intersects at most one member of \\\\mathcal{F}. History The theorem was proven by Bing in 1951 and was an independent discovery with the Nagata–Smirnov metrization theorem that was proved independently by both Nagata (1950) and Smirnov (1951). Both theorems are often merged in the Bing-Nagata-Smirnov metrization theorem. It is a common tool to prove other metrization theorems, e.g. the Moore metrization theorem – a collectionwise normal, Moore space is metrizable – is a direct consequence. Comparison with other metrization theorems Unlike the Urysohn's metrization theorem which provides a sufficient condition for metrization, this theorem provides both a necessary and sufficient condition for a topological space to be metrizable.

Originally built as the private residence for Jean-Baptiste Loisel Le Gaucher, it is currently owned by Globebrow Ltd and is a multi-activity centre for British children at KS2, 3 and 4. Château The château is an example of 18th-century architecture. At the back of the château, much of the original brickwork remains intact and the stonemason's insignia can be seen on the south side of the château. The exterior of the château has been listed as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture since 1969. The back patio, roof, tree-lined driveway and mural paintings are also protected under the same listed status.French Ministry of Culture: Château du Broutel History Château du Broutel dates back to 1714 and is situated in approximately . It was built by Jean-Baptiste Loisel Le Gaucher, one of the senior cavalry officers for Louis XIV. The land on which the Château was built was in the Loisel Le Gaucher family before the building was constructed. It is believed that the Château sustained damage during the French Revolution. This damage was repaired in the first decades of the 19th Century. On the back of the Château, one can see the date 1824 in iron numbers. This is the year in which Jean-Baptiste's son, Jean-Nicolas Loisel Le Gaucher, died. The main Château building is built from stone, brick and slate. The original materials were taken from the Citadel of Rue after it was destroyed in 1668. The paintings and murals which decorate most of the rooms are painted in the style of Horace Vernet, a French artist whose renown came from painting military battles. Throughout the building, there are many large paintings which have been listed by the French government as official historical monument since 1969. Also listed is the roof and exterior of the Château as well as the tree-lined driveway and the Louis XV bedroom. In 1901, the Château was sold by Monsieur Charles du Broutel to the Le Marquis de Longvillers (the cousin of Jean-Baptiste Loisel le Gaucheur du Broutel) whose house had been destroyed in a fire. Monsieur Charles du Broutel was the only direct bloodline member of the Broutel family to survive the fire. His reasons for selling the Château were personal. He claimed that he was unable to bear the memories that the Château held of his deceased relatives. The Longvillers family resorted many of the paintings in the Château. In the 1980s, the Château was again sold to be the private country residence of Lionel Leroy, who was the former managing director and son of the founder of the French DIY chain Leroy Merlin. It was Monsieur Leroy who restored the Château to its original glory by carrying out some vital repair work. Monsieur Leroy also converted the main Château building from private use to a hotel during the 1990s and began renovations to the impressive 18th-century stable block, now named 'Ecurie'. The Château was sold to a British company, Globebrow Ltd at the end of the 20th century. Further renovations to the stable block and other outbuildings have been completed more recently. =World War I= The department in which the Château is situated, the Somme, was also the location of some of the most brutal battles of the First World War. Albert (one of the key locations in the Battle of the Somme is located less than 100 km from the Château. For the first month of the War in France, Rue was unaffected by the fighting but by the end of August, the German advance was posing more if a threat. By the end of August the Germans had reached Amiens and shells could be heard exploding to the north of Rue. On 2 October 1914, the first British troops (under the command of General Horrace Smith-Dorrien) arrived in Rue. There were around 1000 British troops to begin with, including the London Scottish Regiment. The first troops in Rue moved through very quickly, usually staying for only a day or so. Those that did stay in the town were stationed in a temporary military camp which had been set up on the Château driveway- Le Camp du Marais. By 1915, troop movements had intensified significantly. At times, more than 200 trains per day passed through, most of them taking troops towards the north. With the movement of troops came reports from the Western Front. In December 1915, the town learnt of the death of Gaston Caudron. In 1916, Rue was subject to some ariel bombardments although the damage that they inflicted was limited in comparison to the attacks that would come in 1918. The military presence in the town came as a blessing and a curse. The security which the allied troops was valued but there was not enough food and supplies to support the civilians as well as the military. This situation was at its worst in 1917. On 24 November 1916, around 1000 Marine infantry soldiers arrived in Rue. They had been ordered on a months rest and recovery by King George V to reward their efforts in the Battle of the Somme. Their General stayed in the new Broutel Château in the centre of Rue (Le Château de Rue). Winter 1918 saw another intensification in the fighting but there were new targets for the German offensive: Paris and Amiens. This brought the fighting closer to Rue. The town was victim to numerous ariel bombardments. The damage included the railway line, a key link between Paris and Calais. To combat the effects of the bombing, Chinese workers near Noyelles-sur-Mer built a secondary railway line. As the war drew to a close, the majority of the troops who passed through Rue were either resting, recovering or returning home. There were an estimated 15.000 soldiers and they stayed in the Camp du Marais. Notably, the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division visited, having fought in Egypt and Palestine. =World War II= Italian (green) occupation zones of France: the zone occupée, the zone libre, the zone interdite, the Military Administration in Belgium and Northern France, and annexed Alsace-Lorraine. In response to Germany's re-armament programme, the French had begun moving troops towards the North and East. During late 1938 and 1939, Rue was home to numerous French troops including the 45th and 51st French Infantry as well as elements of the 124th. On 10 May 1940, over the wireless, it was announced that German troops had made it into France. Immediately, the 45th and 124th regiments headed towards the north-east of France. Within 10 days, the German pincer movement, combined with the ill-prepared French resistance and British Expeditionary Force, trapped the Allied troops in Northern France. The arrival of German tanks in Amiens marked the point where the Allied forces were no longer to sustain an effective counter-offensive. It was the entrapment of the allied troop that led to Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of British and French troops from Dunkirk. As the Germans advanced along the Somme throughout May and June 1940, more and more tanks, cannons and munitions passed through Rue. One resident of Rue remembered how the sky towards Abbeville being red. The town was literally burning. Seeing Stukas or Messerschmitts (German fighter aeroplanes) in the skies over Rue was a common sight. By 22 May 1940, the German control of Northern France was becoming more visible. Barbed wire was appearing along roads around Rue and military outposts had been established. In Rue, the German Commander implemented military rule. Identity cards were distributed and a curfew was set at 2100h. Identity cards (called Ausweis) had to be collected Montreuil. These gave permission to be in what was called the ‘Red Zone’ - the area between the northern coast of France and the Somme. In June 1940, inhabitants of Rue were instructed to paint over any windows on the roofs of factories so that they could not be seen from the air. The Château du Broutel was occupied by the Nazis. Officers stayed in the bedrooms while the non-commissioned officers slept in the corridors and the landing. The Longvilliers family, who owned the Château during the war, were forced to live in one bedroom. La Marquise de Longvilliers, the wife of the Château's proprietor (Le Marquis de Longvillers) during the war had a reputation for standing up to the German occupiers. When the German troops arrived at Château du Broutel, they hammered nails into the walls to create their own cloakroom. Mme. Longvillers was more than displeased. She was a German speaker who was a stronger supporter of Charles De Gaulle's (French General and War hero) resistance army. She found the German General in the region and demanded that the nails be removed. The General proceeded to order the removal of the nails from the wall.Gavoty, A; cit. Mme Gavoty, née Marie- Beatrice d'Hautefeuille, (2015), Personal Correspondence, translated During the summer of 1940, the German high command was putting Operation Sea Lion, the plan to invade Great Britain, into action. Ariel battles were fought over the Channel as the Luftwaffe fought for superiority in the air. Boulogne, Calais and many other areas along the north-east coast were subject to heavy bombardments. Huge artillery cannons, including the 420mm Big Bertha were used along the north coast before being moved to Sevastopol, where the German army required them in their struggle to hold the Eastern Front (the war against Russia). Throughout the summer, heavy artillery and munitions passed through Rue. By summer 1941, the number of German troops in Rue was noticeably less. May had been moved eastwards and those that remained were older and were more focused on rest and recovery. The British had started inflicting damage onto German equipment. According to residents, the train that had brought German soldiers to Rue been peppered with bullets by the RAF and looked like a ‘sieve’. The same account also tells of a tragedy inflicted on the British in Canteraine, just outside Rue. A German anti-aircraft gun which was located in a quarry called the ‘Limestone Oven’ managed to shoot down a British bomber. The crew fell from the plane. They managed to pull their parachutes and landed in a group of ponds to the north of Rue. However, they were badly wounded. They had been shot multiple times and became tangled in their parachute cords which eventually caused them to drown. During the winter months of late 1941 and early 1942, German soldiers began returning to Rue from the Eastern Front. Their mood was noticeably different. Frozen and exhausted, it was clear that the tides of the war had changed. The morning of 6 June 1944 was distinctly different to any other. The German soldiers in Rue were visibly nervous. Word was everywhere: ‘The Tommies had landed in Normandy’. On the morning of 4 September 1944, Polish troops, along with British and Canadian forces, liberated Rue. The Americans continued past Rue to liberate Bernay, Vron and Montreuil. Current use The Château is used as a residential multi-activity centre for British children at KS2, 3 and 4. It is also known as Château Aventure. Activities which are available at the Château include, Canoeing, Kayaking, Rock Climbing, Abseiling, Shooting, Archery and Low Ropes. The Château continues as a 3-Star hotel for two weeks per year.

His contribution to Italian football through laying the foundations of player training and coaching popularized the sport in the nation, and he was widely considered the model for professional managers in Italy. Born in the small village of Hazel Grove in Stockport, Garbutt featured for Reading, Woolwich Arsenal, and Blackburn Rovers, but featured irregularly for each side, suffering persistent injuries. This forced Garbutt to retire in 1912, aged 29. He then relocated to Italy to seek employment as a dockworker in Genoa, but was soon appointed as the head coach for the local team. Following his arrival, Garbutt restructured training regimes, introduced tactics, and conducted Italy's first ever paid player transfers. This allowed him to transition the side from a semi-professional outfit into a dominant team, and Garbutt captured three Italian league championships during his fifteen-year reign at Genoa. Garbutt would depart to join newly formed Roma in 1927, where he secured a Coppa CONI title, and then moved further south to coach Napoli in 1929. His tenure at both sides saw them finish in their highest ever positions in the league, which prompted interest from foreign clubs, and Garbutt departed Italy for Spain to coach Athletic Bilbao, where he won a La Liga title in 1936. He returned later that year for a brief reign at Milan, and was soon re-appointed at Genoa. However, Garbutt was exiled from the nation under the fascist policy of Benito Mussolini, and he was forced to return to England in 1940. After the end of World War II, Garbutt returned to Genoa for a third time in 1946, prior to retiring in 1948. Although his achievements are not widely known in his home country, Garbutt was instrumental in making Italian football popular, and is credited for laying the groundwork for the nation to secure victory during the 1934 and 1938 FIFA World Cups. Biography Garbutt was born, the son of a carpenter in a small village near Stockport. His family was large, sharing his home with his parents, grandmother, six older sisters and a younger brother. Joining the army at a young age, the young William Garbutt first played football there for the Royal Artillery. After returning from duties, he began his club football playing career with Reading during the 1903 season and played for them in the Southern League, before leaving in December 1905. The young winger moved to join Woolwich Arsenal for two seasons, and made his debut in a First Division match away to Preston North End on 23 December 1905, which finished 2–2. He made 80 appearances for the London club in three years, including 52 in the League, despite injuries ruling him out of much of the 1906–07 season. He was part of the Arsenal side that reached two FA Cup semi-finals in successive seasons; however he was eventually displaced by Jackie Mordue and after spending much of 1907–08 in the reserves he left for Blackburn Rovers in May 1908. He spent four seasons playing for Blackburn, making 82 league appearances and reaching another FA Cup semi-final; he also won a cap playing for the Football League XI. He may have returned to Woolwich Arsenal briefly for a second spell in 1911–12, but this is not recorded in official club histories and he definitely did not play a senior-level match during this time. His playing career having been blighted by injuries, he retired from playing in 1912, aged 29. = Genoa: Impact on Italian football = He moved to Genoa, Italy (which is described as the most English town in Italy), to work on the docks after retiring from playing football, to support his family. He was appointed as the new head coach of Genoa CFC on 30 July 1912, with no previous experience and only aged 29. It is not clear how he came to be their manager, some reports say he was recommended by Vittorio Pozzo; who would go on to coach Italy to two World Cups. Others state it was Genoa's youth coach, an Irishman named Thomas Coggins, who pushed for Garbutt's appointment. Garbutt restructured the training regimes, putting a heavy emphasis on players physical fitness and tactics. This was not the only part of managing in Italy that Garbutt set the proto-type for; he conducted Italy's first ever paid player transfers, where he signed two players from Andrea Doria and one from A.C. Milan. As well as making Genoa the first Italian football club to play outside of Italy; thanks to his connections back home in England he was able to take Genoa to play his old club Reading. From when Garbutt first took over in 1912, until 1927 when he left the club, Genoa were victorious in the Italian Football Championship three different times; 1915, 1923 and 1924. The latter of which to this day, is the last time Genoa won the Serie A championship. =Post-Genoa adventures= On 22 July 1927 a new club was founded from the merger of numerous clubs in Italy's capital of Rome, the new club in question was A.S. Roma and Garbutt was brought in as their first ever manager. He stayed there for only two years but captured a tournament named Coppa CONI with them, as well as helping them reach third in group A of the Italian Football Championship. Garbutt moved on next to Naples, taking over from Giovanni Terrile at S.S.C. Napoli. It was a legendary time for the club with stars such as Attila Sallustro and Antonio Vojak. This groundbreaking time for Napoli saw new club records set for the time, with them finishing third in both 1932–33 and 1933–34 seasons of Serie A. Napoli would not achieve this again until the 1960s. In search of a new adventure, Garbutt moved to Spain in 1935. He took up the position as manager of Athletic Bilbao, leading them to the Spanish Championship which they won over Real Madrid by two points. He returned to Italy in 1937, taking over very briefly at A.C. Milan. =Later years= William Garbutt soon moved back to the club where he was held in such high regard; Genoa. Since Garbutt had left in the 1920s, Genoa had gone into a slump even being relegated at one point. But with Garbutt back at the helm he coached the club back up to 3rd in his first season back. His return would be short lived however, as a British citizen he was exiled under Benito Mussolini's fascists and returned home to England. After the end of World War II, Garbutt returned to Genoa for a third time and then returned home. By the time Garbutt died in 1964, he was an anonymous octogenarian living in reduced circumstances in Leamington Spa. Yet every newspaper in Italy carried a lavish obituary. He was deeply mourned, in Pozzo's words as 'the most important man in the history of Italian football'.

Since 2002, Kipelov leads his own metal band, Kipelov. Early life Kipelov was born in 1958 in Kapotnya, Moscow, Soviet Union. During his childhood, he studied at a music school as an accordionist. His first step in music was singing in the amateur band Krestyanskie Deti (\\"Farmer Children\\"), which played at parties and weddings. After military service in 1978–1980 Kipelov joined the folk ensemble Shestero Molodykh (\\"Six Young Men\\"), where he met an befriended Nikolay Rastorguev. In September 1980, Kipelov and Rastorguev continued their career in Leysa, Pyesnya (\\"Go on, Song\\"). In 1985, the band was officially disbanded due to failing to complete the planned program. Kipelov joined Poyushchie Serdtsa (\\"Singing Hearts\\"), produced by Victor Vekshtein. When Holstinin and Granovsky, members of Poyushchie Serdtsa, decided to start their heavy metal project, Kipelov was invited to be its vocalist. Career =Aria= Kipelov was among the founding members of Aria, alongside Vladimir Holstinin and Alik Granovsky, although he initially played a less active role in songwriting and the development of the band's style than the other two. For the first four albums, he only composed three songs (two of them slow ballads). Nevertheless, Kipelov's voice was one of the major reasons of band's success. After the breakup in 1987, Kipelov and Holstinin were the only two members who remained with their producer Vekshtein. Sergey Mavrin, Kipelov's friend, was invited into the new lineup to play guitar and Vitaly Dubinin joined on bass. During the Germany tour 1994, Kipelov's relations with Holstinin and Dubinin became tense. He ceased appearing at Aria's studio and was fired from the band. Then Mavrin refused to play without Kipelov and left the band, too. After participating in a few of Master's concerts, Kipelov tried to form a band of his own, but later returned to Aria following the threat from Moroz Records to sue the band for breach of contract. Sergey Mavrin offered Kipelov to record together a combined album, which might include their songs, refused by Aria or not fit for its style. In 1997 they released the LP entitled Kipelov and Mavrin - Smutnoye Vremia (Time of Troubles), which included ten tracks. This album helped Mavrin to launch his project 'Mavrik' with vocalist Artur Berkut next year. In 2002, after the successful release of 'Himera' followed by sold- out tours and headlining the NASHEstvie festival, Kipelov refused to start recording the new album, already written by Dubinin and Holstinin. He stated his wish to start a solo career. He was supported by two of his Aria bandmates Sergey Terentyev and Alexander Maniakin, as well as by the band's manager Rina Lee, opposing the band's leaders Vitaly Dubinin and Vladimir Holstinin, and the producer Yuri Sokolov. This disagreement broke Aria apart after 'Judgement Day', August 31, 2002. =Kipelov (band)= Kipelov performing with Tarja Turunen (ex-Nightwish) in 2011 On September 1, 2002, the day after Kipelov left Aria, Kipelov, Terentyev, Mavrin and Maniakin launched a new band named Kipelov (named at Terentyev's suggestion as the bandmembers couldn't come up with any better name). In 2003, they released the live album Put Naverh (Way to the Top), recorded in Saint Petersburg. It contained Aria's songs by Kipelov, Terentyev and Mavrin. The ballad \\"Ya Svoboden\\" (I am Free) became a top hit in the Russian rock charts. The \\"golden\\" voice of Kipelov enticed many Aria fans to his new project. Terentyev, and later Mavrin, left Kipelov in the next two years, explaining that the band was too slow in releasing the new album. From 2002 to 2005, the only new release was the EP Babylon. To record his new album, Kipelov invited Victor Smolski. Kipelov's first LP, 'Reki Vremen' (Rivers of Time), came out in 2005.  Personal life Kipelov is married to Galina Kipelova. They have two children: Joan (b. 1980, a music conductor), and Alexander (b. 1989, a student of the Cello at Gnesin School). He also has two grandchildren: Anastasia Vladimirovna Komarova (b. 2001) and Sonia Vladimirovna Komarova (b. 2009).

Prior to the Act, bishops of the Church of England sat in the House of Lords, where they comprised 22 out of a total membership of 60-70 peers. This allowed them to block legislation proposed by the Commons, which was increasingly dominated by Puritans. \\"Puritan\\" was a term for anyone who wanted to reform, or 'purify', the Church of England, and contained many different sects, including Presbyterians, and Congregationalists. Despite differences in doctrine, they opposed bishops, on both religious and political grounds. Support was limited even among moderates like Viscount Falkland, who wrote; \\"Those that hated the bishops, hated them more than the Devil; they who loved them, did not love them so well as their dinner.\\" In 1649, the House of Lords was abolished by the Protectorate; it was restored in 1660, but bishops were not readmitted until the 1661 Clergy Act. Background Archbishop Laud, whose reforms led to increasing opposition to the role of bishops In 1642, the vast majority of Englishmen were 'Royalist', in the sense of a shared belief that a 'well-ordered' monarchy was divinely mandated. They disagreed on what 'well-ordered' meant, and who held ultimate authority in clerical affairs. Royalists generally supported a Church of England governed by bishops, appointed by, and answerable to, the king; Parliamentarians, many of whom were Puritans, believed he was answerable to the leaders or Elders of the church, appointed by their congregations. \\"Puritan\\" was a term for anyone who wanted to reform, or 'purify', the Church of England, and contained many different sects. Presbyterians were the most prominent in Parliament, and included leaders like John Pym and John Hampden, but there were many others, such as Congregationalists. Close links between religion and politics added further complexity; one reason for opposition to bishops was their presence in the House of Lords, where they often blocked Parliamentary legislation. Passage of the Act In 1629, Charles I dissolved Parliament, initiating the period known as Personal Rule. His use of arbitrary taxes, such as Ship money, was resented, not just because of the way they were levied, but how they were spent. Reforms to the Church of England under Archbishop Laud were viewed as covertly favouring Roman Catholic doctrines, and opposed by many of its clergy. In 1984, historian Patrick Collinson, described Laud as \\"the greatest calamity ever visited upon the English Church\\". Attempts to impose similar reforms on the Church of Scotland, or kirk, led to the 1639 and 1640 Bishops' Wars. Charles refused to call Parliament, crippling his army due to lack of funds; defeat resulted in a Covenanter government, which expelled bishops from the kirk. Shortly after the Long Parliament assembled in November 1640, it was presented with the Root and Branch petition; signed by 15,000 Londoners, this demanded the removal of bishops from the Church of England, evidence of popular opposition to Episcopacy. At this stage, it was not adopted by the Commons, although Laud was impeached, and held in the Tower of London. In the first few months of 1641, the Commons passed a series of constitutional measures; the Triennial Acts, abolition of the Star Chamber, and an end to levying taxes without Parliament's consent. Once again, the bishops ensured all three were rejected by the Lords. The Commons responded in June with the Bishops Exclusion Bill, removing them from the Lords, which was rejected once again. The outbreak of the Irish Rebellion in October 1641 raised the political temperature; during December, there were widespread riots in Westminster, led by the London apprentices, which resulted in a number of deaths. Suggestions Pym and other Parliamentary leaders helped organise these have not been proved, but one result was to prevent bishops attending the Lords. On 30 December, John Williams, Archbishop of York, signed a complaint along with eleven other bishops, disputing the legality of any laws passed by the Lords during their exclusion. This was viewed by the Commons as inviting Charles to dissolve Parliament, and all twelve were arrested on charges of treason. When Charles left London in January, he was accompanied by many Royalist MPs, and members of the Lords; this gave his opponents majorities in both houses, and the bill became law in February 1642. Effect of Act The Act prevented those in holy orders from exercising any temporal jurisdiction or authority after the 5 February 1641 O.S.; this extended to taking a seat in Parliament or the Privy Council. Any acts carried out with such authority after that date by a member of the clergy were to be considered void.Text of the Act at British History Online In 1649, the House of Lords was abolished by the Protectorate, then restored when Charles II returned in 1660; bishops were not readmitted until the 1661 Clergy Act.

SS Bjoren is a wood-fuelled steamboat that travels the route between Byglandsfjord-Bygland and Bygland-Ose on the lake Byglandsfjorden in the municipality of Bygland in the Setesdal valley. She runs on Sundays in July. Using wood as fuel is a natural choice as there was, and still is, good local access to it. Using wood to fuel the steam engine contributes to make Bjoren a unique part of Norway's cultural heritage and a floating technical museum. History SS Bjoren The steamer Bjoren was built at Akers Mekaniske Verksted in 1866. She was long and had a engine. In 1897, the boat was extended by and in 1914 she was further extended by . She had a new boiler installed and new engine that produced . Today the boat is long and weighs . She is certified for up to a maximum of 55 passengers. In the early years Bjoren was in regular use at a place called Kilefjorden, a part of the river Otra. When the Setesdal Line, a narrow gauge railroad, was opened to Byglandsfjord Station in 1896 and as a direct cause of this she was moved to her present location in Byglandsfjord, about north in the valley Setesdal where she was in service until 1957. In the 1920s, buses took most of the traffic in the valley and eventually, when a new road was built in the 1950s, the traffic reasons for the steamer was gone. The boat was put in storage, deterioration started and eventually she sank. Bjorens next life In the 1970s, a group of local enthusiasts decided to make an attempt to preserve the boat. As the boat was counted as part of Norwegian history, the government saw its interests and they helped with the funding. The boat was restored at Drammen Shiprepairs A/S and in 1994 was once again ready to be used. Today, Bjoren is owned and run by the company Bjoren AS. In addition, the local group called Bjorens venner (Friends of Bjoren) put a lot of effort into preserving the technical values of the boat. Bjoren is still receiving government funding and, as the world's only existing wood-fuelled steamboat still in service, she is a unique attraction to both tourists and others.SS Bjoren, official website SS Bjoren www.visitnorway.com References Steamships of Norway Ferries of Norway Setesdal Bygland 1866 ships Ships built in Oslo ","title":"SS Bjoren"},{"id":"9712824","text":"Corvette captain is a rank in many navies which theoretically corresponds to command of a corvette (small warship).

It is approximately 4 miles from Nottingham city centre. The estate was built in the 1970s on the grounds of Top Valley farm, Forest farm and Home farm. For the most part construction progressed from west to east with the first houses appearing before the end of 1972.http://www.picturethepast.org.uk/frontend.php?keywords=Ref_No_increment;EQUALS;NTGM005552&pos;=3&action;=zoom&id;=56999 The Top Valley farmhouse was knocked down in 1973 and replaced with Knights Close whilst the Forest farmhouse had stood at the south-west corner of what is now Brisbane Drive. In late 1982 a Tesco supermarket was opened on the former site of the railway wagon works south of Top Valley Way, the railway line itself having closed in the mid-1960s and now a tree-lined footpath on the western boundary of the estate. The original supermarket building was demolished and replaced with a larger construction circa 2005/06. Another notable change occurred during the 2010s in the Bakewell Drive area with several dwellings demolished and replaced with modern housing. In early 2018 the former children's home at Ranskill Gardens was demolished (having closed in the late 2000s). Eight new 'ecohomes' are being built on the site by Positive Homes - all to 'A' rated Energy Performance Certificate Standards, making them among the most energy efficient homes in the UK. This is set to be followed in 2019 by a large ecohome development on the former Eastglade Primary School site by Nottingham City Homes.

Both wards are represented by three Labour Party councillors with Bulwell Forest (covering the parts of Top Valley to the west of Old Farm Road) represented by Councillors Cheryl Barnard, Eunice Campbell and Nick McDonald, and Bestwood (covering the parts of Top Valley to the east of Old Farm Road) are represented by Councillors Brian Grocock, David Smith and Georgia Power. The area lies in the Nottingham North constituency and has been represented by Labour Party MP Alex Norris since 2017. In the 2017 general election he retained the seat with a majority of 11,160 votes after the Former MP Graham Allen stood down.

It is between the stations of Tuomarila and Kauklahti, about from the Helsinki Central railway station. Before October 25, 2015, Espoo was the station in Espoo city that also served long-distance trains, but since then Leppävaara railway station has had that role in Espoo. The old Espoo station was built in 1903 according to plans by the architect Bruno Granholm. The station was expanded in 1909. The station building has many ornamental details. The station acted as the Espoo station building from 1903 to 1981, and the post office was also moved to the station as soon as it was finished, when the offices of the stationmaster and post officer were combined. The Espoo station is on the bridge over the tracks, and the post office is to the south of the tracks.

The tunnel through the city rock wasn't there originally; instead the tracks went past the rock on the north side at Läntinen jokitie. Also the cut face on the east side of the rock was made later. A road, Vanha ratavalli, goes along the old route of the tracks. At both places, traces of the tracks' old route could be seen in the ground as late as winter 2004. Platforms Platform one serves trains towards Kirkkonummi. On the other side of the platform is also a bus stop and a taxi station. The middle platform is divided into platforms two and three. Platform two serves trains from Kirkkonummi to Helsinki. Platforms three and four used to serve E trains to Helsinki but are currently unused after E trains' terminus was moved further to Kauklahti. On the other side of platform four is the Espoo market square and a turning point for buses going northwards, and also the Espoontori shopping centre. An extension of the Leppävaara city railway has been proposed to reach the Espoo station to be able to increase local train traffic on the rantarata (Helsinki-Turku) tracks between Helsinki and Espoo.

The club were one of the founder members of the Scottish Football League in 1890, and played at Springvale Park during their time in the league. History Cowlairs F.C. were formed in 1876 by craftsmen from the Hyde Park and Cowlairs railway works in Springburn, an area that was growing rapidly due to its importance to Glasgow's railway industry. In its early years, the club was a member of the Glasgow FAChapter XXV—Glasgow Association, History of the Queen's Park Football Club 1867 - 1917 (via Electric Scotland) and was looked on as a junior club, at a time when \\"junior\\" clubs were simply smaller and of limited standing in the game, and prior to the establishment of a separate Junior grade of competition. The club entered the Scottish Cup for the first time in 1880–81, reaching the fourth round. By the latter part of the decade, Cowlairs' reputation was growing. In 1886–87 they entered the English FA Cup (which was open to Scottish clubs at this time), ironically losing out to fellow Glaswegians Rangers in their only match. The club had players of sufficient standing in this period to have two of their number gain international recognition for Scotland: Tom McInnes, capped once in 1889, and John McPherson, who won two of his nine caps while at Cowlairs, in 1889 and 1890. Cowlairs was one of the clubs which together formed the Scottish League, but finished bottom of the table at the end of its first season, not helped by having four points deducted for fielding ineligible players. With the club also facing accusations of professionalism (which had yet to be legalised in Scottish football) following an inspection of clubs' books by the League, it was unsurprising that Cowlairs was unsuccessful in its re-election vote, losing out to Leith Athletic. Despite not being in any league competition the following season, the club enjoyed its longest Scottish Cup run, losing to Celtic in the quarter-finals. Prior to the 1892–93 season, Cowlairs joined the Scottish Alliance, finishing as champions. Although they club failed to be elected back to the top flight of the Scottish League at the season's end, it was instead chosen to join the new Division Two for the 1893–94 season. Cowlairs were joined by relegated clubs Clyde and Abercorn, Scottish Alliance League clubs Thistle, Greenock Morton, Motherwell, Northern, Partick Thistle and Port Glasgow Athletic, as well as Hibernian. Cowlairs lost 1–0 in the final of the 1894 Glasgow Cup to Rangers. Cowlairs' return to League football started well, securing runners-up spot that season to Hibernian; however, the club were not promoted to Division One, missing out following a ballot to third-placed Clyde. They continued to be beset by financial and administrative problems, and after finishing bottom of Division Two in 1895–96, the club were again voted out of the league. They subsequently left Springvale Park and returned to Gourlay Park. The club closed down in 1896. Petershill Juniors were formed in summer 1897, just after Northern folded and a year after Cowlairs; due to the circumstances they could be seen as a successor representing the Springburn area, albeit their club history does not mention either club, only linking their formation to the demise of St Mungo's Juniors in the area. Colours Cowlairs utilised a wide variety of colour schemes in its short existence, including: * 1876 Light blue shirts, white shorts. * 1876–1880 White shirts, white shorts, black socks. * 1880–1886 Royal blue shirts, white shorts, red socks. * 1886–1887 Chocolate and light blue halved shirts, white shorts, chocolate socks with light blue trim. * 1888–1892 White shirts, dark blue shorts, dark blue socks. * 1892 Red shirts, white shorts. * 1893–1895 Red shirts, navy blue shorts, navy blue socks.

Biography Beginning in 1888, in addition to a career as a lawyer, he served as editor for the periodical The Artist and Journal of Home Culture, which became something of an official periodical for the movement. In it, he praised such artists as Henry Scott Tuke (to whom he dedicated a homo-erotic sonnet entitled \\"Sonnet on a picture by Tuke\\") and Henry Oliver Walker. He also befriended such similar-minded contemporaries as Frederick William Rolfe, Lord Alfred Douglas and John Addington Symonds.Aldrich, Robert and Garry Wotherspoon (eds.): Who's Who in Contemporary Gay and Lesbian History: From World War II to the Present Day, page 236. Routledge, 2001 The homosexual and pederastic aspects of The Artist and Journal of Home Culture declined after the replacement of Kains Jackson as an editor in 1894. The final issue edited by Kains Jackson included his essay, the New Chivalry, an argument for the moral and societal benefits of pederasty and erotic male friendship on the grounds of both Platonism and Social Darwinism.Frantzen, Allen J.: Bloody Good: chivalry, sacrifice, and the Great War, page 145. University of Chicago Press, 2003 According to Kains Jackson, the New Chivalry would promote \\"the youthful masculine ideal\\" over the Old Chivalry's emphasis on the feminine. Jackson's volumes of poetry include Finibus Cantat Amor (1922) and Lysis (1924). Kains Jackson was a member of the Order of Chaeronea, a secret society for homosexuals founded in 1897 by George Ives, which was named after the location of the battle where the Sacred Band of Thebes was finally annihilated in 338 BC.The Knitting Circle: George Ives. Other members included Samuel Elsworth Cottam, Montague Summers, and John Gambril Nicholson. Jackson discovered the poetry of Edward Cracroft Lefroy. He published two small books of poetry, both concerning his romance with his cousin Cecil Castle who died in 1922. A third unpublished collection of 85 poems, titled Alba Ligustra, dating from 1925-28, was sold by an American book dealer in 2017. Many of the poems concerned Kains-Jackson's memories of Castle, and other poems and notes referred to Henry Scott Tuke. References Aldrich, Robert and Garry Wotherspoon (eds.).

Structure Several domains of PCAF can act independently or in unison to enable its functions. PCAF has separate acetyltransferase and E3 ubiquitin ligase domains as well as a bromodomain for interaction with other proteins. PCAF also possesses sites for its own acetylation and ubiquitination.  Function  CBP and p300 are large nuclear proteins that bind to many sequence-specific factors involved in cell growth and/or differentiation, including c-jun and the adenoviral oncoprotein E1A. The protein encoded by the PCAF gene associates with p300/CBP. It has in vitro and in vivo binding activity with CBP and p300, and competes with E1A for binding sites in p300/CBP. It has histone acetyl transferase activity with core histones and nucleosome core particles, indicating that this protein plays a direct role in transcriptional regulation. Regulation The acetyltransferase activity and cellular location of PCAF are regulated through acetylation of PCAF itself. PCAF may be autoacetylated (acetylated by itself) or by p300. Acetylation leads to migration to the nucleus and enhances its acetyltransferase activity. PCAF interacts with and is deacetylated by HDAC3, leading to a reduction in PCAF acetyltransferase activity and cytoplasmic localisation. Protein interactions PCAF forms complexes with numerous proteins that guide its activity. For example PCAF is recruited by ATF to acetylate histones and promote transcription of ATF4 target genes. Targets There are various protein targets of PCAF's acetyltransferase activity including transcription factors such as Fli1, p53 and numerous histone residues. Hdm2, itself a ubiquitin ligase that targets p53, has also been demonstrated to be a target of the ubiquitin-ligase activity of PCAF.  Interactions  PCAF has been shown to interact with: * BRCA2, * CTNNB1, * CREBBP, * EVI1, * HNF1A, * IRF1, * IRF2, * KLF13, * Mdm2 * Myc, * NCOA1, * POLR2A, * RBPJ, * TCF3, * TRRAP, and * TWIST1.

The story was serialized in six issues of The Saturday Evening Post (June 15–July 20, 1935) under the title The Frightened Men. The novel was published in 1935 by Farrar & Rinehart, Inc. The League of Frightened Men is a Haycraft Queen Cornerstone, one of the most influential works of mystery fiction listed by crime fiction historian Howard Haycraft and Ellery Queen. Plot introduction When two men die under mysterious circumstances and a third disappears after appealing to Wolfe for protection, suspicion falls on Paul Chapin, a controversial author and friend of the three men who was severely injured many years ago at their hands as a result of a hazing prank. The remainder of the men involved, united together as a \\"League of Atonement\\", are in fear for their lives against Chapin's vengeance, but when a third man dies Wolfe determines that he may not be the only threat they face. Plot summary After reading a controversial new novel by an author called Paul Chapin, Nero Wolfe reveals to Archie Goodwin that he has been approached by Andrew Hibbard, a psychologist fearing for his life. Hibbard had received threatening poems from an individual he refused to name, but after reading a phrase in Chapin's book that also appeared in the poems, Wolfe has deduced that the man Hibbard feared is Chapin. Wolfe orders Archie to contact Hibbard to offer Wolfe’s services, but when Archie does so he learns that Hibbard has disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Hibbard is a member of “the League of Atonement”, a group of college friends who once played a prank on Chapin that, to their lingering shame and remorse, left him permanently crippled. In addition to Hibbard's disappearance, two other members of the group have also died under mysterious circumstances, and both Hibbard’s niece Evelyn and the police suspect that Chapin has murdered them. Wolfe acquires a list of the other men in the League and summons them to his office, where he proposes to both determine the truth behind the deaths of their mutual friends and remove the threat that they believe Chapin poses. The meeting is interrupted by Chapin himself, who claims innocence in the affair but refuses to provide evidence when Wolfe challenges him to do so. This prompts the League to agree to Wolfe’s terms. Wolfe has Archie arrange for Chapin to be tailed as closely as possible, a search for Hibbard to be conducted, and the two deaths to be investigated. Archie discovers that another member of the League, Dr. Leopold Elkus, is also tangentially involved in the two deaths and, as Elkus is sympathetic to Chapin, begins to suspect that he is helping him commit the murders. He also discovers the existence of a mysterious man with gold teeth and a pink tie who also appears to be tailing Chapin. On bringing this man to Wolfe, they discover it is in fact Andrew Hibbard. Hibbard, driven to desperation by his fear and paranoia of Chapin, had faked his death and begun following Chapin to work up the courage to murder him. Soon after, Paul Chapin is arrested for the sudden murder of Dr. Loring Burton, who is both a fellow member of the League and the man who married the woman Chapin was in love with. This prompts Wolfe to take the drastic step of leaving his home to consult with Chapin, while Archie gains the trust of Burton’s wife and learns that Dora Chapin, the wife of Paul Chapin and Burton’s former house-maid, had visited Burton before he was murdered. Believing Dora to be the murderer, Archie attempts to confront her but is taken by surprise, drugged, and incapacitated. Upon regaining consciousness, Archie is alarmed to discover that Dora Chapin has apparently kidnapped Wolfe. On receiving a message from Wolfe, however, he learns that Wolfe has convinced Dora Chapin that he poses no threat to her husband and does not believe him to be guilty of murder. Wolfe then summons the members of the League to his office, where he produces Hibbard and reveals a confession he has apparently received from Paul Chapin. To the League’s surprise the letter confirms, as Wolfe suspected all along, that Chapin had no involvement in the deaths of their two mutual friends at all. The deaths were an unfortunate accident and a suicide respectively, but Chapin, psychologically incapable of murder but resentful of his friends for both their responsibility for his injury and their pity towards him, sent the poems to scare his friends and gain his vengeance on them that way. Incredulous and skeptical of Wolfe’s claims, the League vote on whether to pay Wolfe. When the vote indicates that Wolfe will not receive his fee, Wolfe presses one member--Ferdinand Bowen, a stockbroker--to change his vote. When Bowen refuses, Wolfe reveals that Bowen is in fact Burton’s murderer. Burton had discovered that Bowen had been embezzling from him and other members of the League whose investments he managed, and Bowen used the fear and paranoia that everyone had of Chapin to stage Burton’s murder and throw suspicion on Chapin. Bowen is arrested, leaving Archie to realise that Chapin’s letter was faked. His vengeance thwarted, Chapin reveals to Wolfe that he will be basing a character on Wolfe in a forthcoming novel, and that character will meet a very unpleasant end. The unfamiliar word \\"Nero Wolfe talks in a way that no human being on the face of the earth has ever spoken, with the possible exception of Rex Stout after he had a gin and tonic,\\" said Michael Jaffe, executive producer of the A&E; TV series, A Nero Wolfe Mystery. \\"Readers of the Wolfe saga often have to turn to the dictionary because of the erudite vocabulary of Wolfe and sometimes of Archie,\\" wrote Rev. Frederick G. Gotwald. Examples of unfamiliar words — or unfamiliar uses of words that some would otherwise consider familiar — are found throughout the corpus, often in the give-and-take between Wolfe and Archie. * Viva voce, chapter 2. Wolfe refers Archie to a conversation in the office that was transcribed by a stenographer hired while Archie was away: :I nodded, glancing over the typewritten pages. \\"Andrew Hibbard.

I've spent the past four decades reading and re-reading Stout's novels for pleasure, and they have yet to lose their savor ... It is to revel in such writing that I return time and again to Stout's books, and in particular to The League of Frightened Men, Some Buried Caesar, The Silent Speaker, Too Many Women, Murder by the Book, Before Midnight, Plot It Yourself, Too Many Clients, The Doorbell Rang, and Death of a Doxy, which are for me the best of all the full-length Wolfe novels. Cultural references Rene Magritte's 1942 painting, Les compagnons de la peur, bears the title Gallimard used for The League of Frightened Men when Stout's novel was published in France. \\"A number of the paintings of René Magritte (1898–1967), the internationally famous Belgian painter, are named after titles of books by Rex Stout,\\" wrote Magritte's attorney and friend Harry Torczyner. \\"He read Hegel, Heidegger and Sartre, as well as Dashiell Hammett, Rex Stout and Georges Simenon,\\" the Times Higher Education Supplement wrote of Magritte. \\"Some of his best titles were 'found' in this way.\\" Magritte's 1942 painting, Les compagnons de la peur (\\"The Companions of Fear\\"), bears the title given to The League of Frightened Men when it was published in France in 1939 by Gallimard. It is one of Magritte's series of \\"leaf-bird\\" paintings. Created during the Nazi occupation of Brussels, it depicts a stormy, mountainous landscape in which a cluster of plants has metamorphosed into a group of vigilant owls. \\"The title of this widely exhibited painting—like those of many of his works—was drawn from wide-ranging literary sources, not least the detective novels of Rex Stout,\\" wrote Apollo magazine. Susan Moore, associate editor of the British arts journal, described Magritte's painting as \\"compellingly sinister. The wartime date of this canvas, painted during the Nazi occupation of Belgium, is significant, for there is a real sense of foreboding in this near monochrome image of beady-eyed, watchful owls.\\" Christie's auctioned Les compagnons de la peur for more than $6 million in February 2015.

Papyrus 75 (P75) is a partial codex containing most of Luke and John. Comparison of the two versions of John in the Bodmer Papyri with the third-century Chester Beatty Papyri convinced Floyd V. Filson that \\"...there was no uniform text of the Gospels in Egypt in the third century.\\"\\"A comparison of all three, which had their origins in Egypt, shows that there was no uniform text of the Gospels in Egypt in the third century.\\" (Filson 1962: 52). There are also Christian texts that were declared apocryphal in the fourth century, such as the Infancy Gospel of James. There is a Greek-Latin lexicon to some of Paul's letters, and there are fragments of Melito of Sardis. Among the works is The Vision of Dorotheus, one of the earliest examples of Christian hexametric poem, attributed to a Dorotheus, son of \\"Quintus the poet\\" (assumed to be the pagan poet Quintus Smyrnaeus). (P29). The earliest extant copy of the Third Epistle to the Corinthians is published in Bodmer Papryri X. The collection includes some non-literary material, such as a collection of letters from the abbots of the monastery of Saint Pachomius, raising the possibility that the unifying circumstance in the collection is that all were part of a monastic library.Kessels and Van der Horst 1987:214.

Vatican acquisition  Plans announced by the Foundation Bodmer in October 2006Sale of Bodmer Papyri to sell two of the manuscripts for millions of dollars, to capitalize the library, which opened in 2003, drew consternation from scholars around the world, fearing that the unity of the collection would be broken. Then, in March 2007 it was announced the Vatican had acquired the Bodmer Papyrus XIV-XV (P75), which is believed to contain the world's oldest known written fragment from the Gospel of Luke, the earliest known Lord's Prayer, and one of the oldest written fragments from the Gospel of John. The papyri had been sold for an undisclosed \\"significant\\" price to Frank Hanna III, of Atlanta, Georgia. In January 2007, Hanna presented the papyri to the Pope.

These are in contrast to , contemporary plays, which generally focus on commoners and domestic issues. is usually translated as \\"period plays\\". Film and television productions in this mode are called , and share many of the same features. Overview As the stereotypical audience for and kabuki were the merchant classes () of Edo period Japan, stories involving court nobles and heroic samurai were somewhat far removed from daily life, and the more everyday stories that dealt with contemporary, urban themes. Even though many of the viewers may have been samurai, the Edo period in which these plays were largely composed and performed was a period of peace, and so the notion of fierce battles and heroic sacrifices represented something of a romanticised escape in fiction. Stories were almost always derived from classic epics () or other historical sources, often with elements changed, such as the invention of characters to make the story more interesting or to otherwise serve the author's purposes. Though most of these stories derive originally from historical fact, the sources used by the playwrights were more legend than accurate narratives, and fantastic or magical elements were further added by the playwrights. One play, , revolves around actual historical figures of the Genpei War, including and his retainer . However, the historically false conceit that certain clan generals survived and remain in hiding is central to the plot. Other fantastical elements, such as the (fox-spirit) character , are also added to the story. Though almost always take place in the distant past, they often were intended to make reference to contemporary events. For much of the Edo period, the depiction of contemporary events, in particular, depictions of the s and criticism of the Tokugawa shogunate, were strictly banned. As a result, plays were designed to use historical or literary references as metaphors for current events. The famous play , also known as the tale of the forty-seven , is one example; though the actual forty-seven and the events surrounding their attempts at revenge for their lord took place in the early 18th century, only a few decades before the play debuted, it was depicted onstage as taking place in the 14th century, with the names of all the principal figures involved being changed. In many other plays, the , from whom the s claimed descent, were used to represent the shogunate. The clan, who lost the War to the clan in the 1180s, commonly were represented as oppressed or wronged, and symbolized the playwrights' (and perhaps the actors') criticisms of the government. is one example of this, as is \\"Battles of , which tells of the Ming Dynasty loyalist who fought against the Qing Dynasty in the late 17th century.

Martin Bodmer Foundation in Geneva. Martin Bodmer (November 13, 1899 – March 22, 1971) was a Swiss bibliophile, scholar and collector.  Biography  Martin Bodmer was the son of wealthy parents born in Zurich, Switzerland, where he lived until 1948. His father died in 1916 leaving a very large fortune. In 1918, Bodmer began studying German language, then gave up and took a trip to United States and Paris. He studied a few semesters of philosophy and in 1921 he founded the Gottfried Keller Prize, a renowned Swiss literary award. In 1930 he founded the bimonthly \\"Corona,\\" which was published until 1943 in Munich. With the start of the Second World War he devoted himself to the International Committee of the Red Cross and became its vice president. During the Second World War, many famous writers and journalists stayed in Bodmer's house in Zurich, including Rudolf Borchardt, Selma Lagerlöf, Rudolf Alexander Schröder, and Paul Valéry. He started collecting rare books at the age of 16 and devoted all his life to create an extraordinary library of world literature. Bodmer selected the works centering on what he saw as the five pillars of world literature: the Bible, Homer, Dante Alighieri, William Shakespeare and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.Koch, Hans-Albrecht: Spiegel der Welt: Die Bibliotheca Bodmeriana zu Gast im Schiller-Nationalmuseum / Deutsches Literaturarchiv in Marbach He prioritized autographs and first editions. In 1928 the villa was too small for his collection and he bought an adjacent former school building to accommodate his books. After the war he resumed his long-standing project to build a \\"Library of world literature\\", or \\"Bodmer Library\\" in specially designed buildings, collecting the most significant messages of humankind, including not only literature and art, but also religion, history and politics. He left Zurich and transferred its collection to Cologny, just outside Geneva, on the shores of Lake Geneva. Bodmer amassed 150,000 works in eighty languages, including first editions of major works, the Papyrus 66 which is one of the oldest almost completely preserved manuscripts of John's Gospel (2nd century), the original of Grimm's Fairy Tales, the only copy of the Gutenberg Bible and the Shakespeare First Folio in Switzerland, a string quintet by Mozart, the prose version of Lessing's Nathan the Wise, Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary, Thomas Mann's Lotte in Weimar, original editions of Don Quixote, Faust, and valuable papyri, known as Bodmer Papyri, from ancient times, including a papyrus manuscript dating to the third century of the complete Dyskolos, an Ancient Greek comedy by Menander, which was recovered and published in 1959. Bodmer extended its project to cuneiform tablets and ancient coins. Before his death, Bodmer refused the proposal of an American millionaire who offered him $60 million (1971), and with the consent of his children placed his collection at the heart of the Martin Bodmer Foundation, a private cultural institution headquartered in Cologny, which keeps managing and expanding the collection as of today.

It was first published in the collection Poems, in Two Volumes in 1807. History The sonnet was originally dated 1803, but this was corrected in later editions and the date of composition given precisely as 31 July 1802, when Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy were travelling to Calais to visit Annette Vallon and his daughter Caroline by Annette, prior to his forthcoming marriage to Mary Hutchinson. The sonnet has always been popular, escaping the generally excoriating reviews from critics such as Francis Jeffrey in the Edinburgh Review when Poems in Two Volumes was first published. The reason undoubtedly lies in its great simplicity and beauty of language, turning on Dorothy's observation that this man-made spectacle is nevertheless one to be compared to nature's grandest natural spectacles. Cleanth Brooks analysed the sonnet in these terms in The Well Wrought Urn: Studies in the Structure of Poetry. Stephen Gill remarks that at the end of his life Wordsworth, engaged in editing his works, contemplated a revision even of \\"so perfect a poem\\" as this sonnet in response to an objection from a lady that London could not both be \\"bare\\" and \\"clothed\\" (an example of the use of paradox in literature). That the sonnet so closely follows Dorothy's journal entry comes as no surprise because Dorothy wrote her Grasmere Journal to \\"give Wm pleasure by it\\" and it was freely available to Wordsworth, who said of Dorothy that \\"She gave me eyes, she gave me ears\\" in his poem \\"The Sparrow's Nest\\".

It is located in the municipality of Voždovac.  Location  Trošarina is located around the crossroads of the Boulevard of Liberation, Kružni put and Crnotravska streets.  History  In 1821, the state government decided to put the food trade in order and to establish the quantity and quality of the goods imported to the city. Part of the project was introduction of the excise on the goods (in Serbian called trošarina) and setting of a series of excise check points on the roads leading to the city. One of those check points, which all gradually also became known as trošarina, was on the Avala Road. As the neighborhood later expanded around it, it was named after it. In 1930, the first road in Serbia paved with asphalt was built from Trošarina to the Avala mountain, as the new Avala road. It was also the first traffic route in the state marked with the horizontal road surface markings and the regular traffic signs. The road was used for the Interbellum rallies, which continued after World War II. Record holder, for over 20 years, was Dowager Queen Maria, an avid driver, in her Rolls-Royce.

Martin made his first appearance for the team during the 1986-87 National League and remained a stalwart of the team until his retirement after the 1999 championship. During that time he won two All-Ireland medals, five Leinster medals, one National League medals and three All-Star awards. In 1994 Hanamy captained the team to the All-Ireland title. At club level Hanamy is a one-time Leinster medalist with the St. Ryangh's club. In addition to this he has also won four county club championship medals. Playing career =Club= After enjoying some success in the various juvenile grades, Hanamy made the St. Ryangh's senior team by the mid-1980s. He won his first county club championship title in 1987 following a defeat of Seir Kieran. In 1990 Hanamy was club captain when St. Ryangh's defeated Birr to give him a second county championship medal. After surrendering the title, St. Ryangh's bounced back in 1992. A defeat of Lusmagh gave Hanamy his third county championship. He picked up a fourth winners' medal in 1993 as St. Rynagh's retained the title after a defeat of Birr. Hanamy later won a Leinster medal after a one-point defeat of Dicksboro. =Inter-county= Hanamy was selected for the Offaly minor and under 21 hurling sides. however, he was unlucky in missing out on a really big prize. In 1986, the Offaly minor hurlers won the All-Ireland title, however, Hanamy was 19 years old and not eligible to play. Hanamy made his senior hurling debut for Offaly in 1987. From 1988 to 1990 he collected three consecutive Leinster titles, however, Offaly were defeated in the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final on all three occasions. In the 1989 All-Ireland semi-final Offaly embarrassingly lost to an unfancied Antrim who were later trounced by Tipperary in the championship decider. Two years later in 1991 Hanamy captured a National Hurling League title, Offaly's first, and the future was looking brighter. Three years later in 1994 Hanamy was captain of Offaly and he won his fourth Leinster title. Offaly later progressed to the All-Ireland final where they played Limerick. With four minutes to go Offaly were trailing by five points, however, a scoring spree in the remaining time resulted in the side actually winning the game by 6 points. Offaly manager Éamonn Cregan had orchestrated a great win over has native county and Hanamy finally collected his first All-Ireland medal. In 1995 Hanamy captured another Leinster medal. The game itself against Kilkenny was regarded as the best game of the year and is regarded as one of the greatest games of all-time by some for the sheer level of skill displayed by both teams. Hanamy's side later went on to lose the All-Ireland final to Clare, who won their first All-Ireland title since 1914. 1998 proved to be a controversial year for Offaly. Hanamy's side reached the Leinster final but lost to Kilkenny. This defeat prompted their manager, Babs Keating, to describe the Offaly hurlers as \\"sheep in a heap\\", and he promptly resigned. It looked as if Offaly’s championship hopes were in disarray, however, they overcame Antrim in the All-Ireland quarter-final and qualified to meet Clare in the semi-final. The first game ended in a draw and had to be replayed, however, the replay was ended early because of a time- keeping error by the referee. Following a protest on the pitch of Croke Park by the Offaly supporters it was decided that Clare and Offaly would meet for a third time. Hanamy's side won the third game and qualified to play Kilkenny in the final. Offaly reversed the Leinster final defeat by winning the All- Ireland final by 6 points. Hanamy had won his second All-Ireland medal. In 1999 Offaly once again reached the latter stages of the All-Ireland championship, however, they were beaten by Cork in the All-Ireland semi-final.

Katzin with Bernard Girard (uncredited), and starring Geraldine Page, Ruth Gordon, Rosemary Forsyth, Robert Fuller and Mildred Dunnock. The screenplay by Theodore Apstein, based on the novel The Forbidden Garden by Ursula Curtiss, focuses on an aging Arizona widow who hires elderly female housekeepers and cons them out of their money before murdering them. The music score was by Gerald Fried and the cinematography by Joseph F. Biroc. The film was funded by American Broadcasting Company (ABC), Palomar Pictures Corporation, and The Associates & Aldrich Company, and distributed by Cinerama Releasing Corporation. Plot Claire Marrable, the vainglorious ageing widow of a prominent businessman, is distraught upon discovering that her husband's estate has been stripped of all assets, leaving her in debt and with nowhere to live. His only personal effects include a briefcase, a butterfly collection, and a stamp collection. Claire relocates to Tucson, Arizona to be close to her nephew, George, and his wife Julia. Late one evening, Claire lures her live-in housekeeper, Rose Hull, outside to plant a pine tree, and clobbers her to death with a rock before burying her in a shallow grave. She hires the timid Edna Tinsley as a replacement housekeeper shortly after. Edna invests money in stocks Claire claims to have gained significant capital on; when she inquires about them, Claire murders her in the same fashion as the last housekeeper, burying her in the yard beneath a new pine tree. She burns all of Edna's belongings except for her Bible, though she disposes of the front page which bears Edna's name. At one of George and Julia's dinner parties, Claire is introduced to Harriet Vaughn, a young widow from the East Coast whose husband was a stock broker. Harriet and her young nephew, Jim, rent a cottage from George neighbouring Claire's property, much to Claire's displeasure. Harriet subsequently begins a romance with Mike Darrah, a car restorationist from Phoenix. Meanwhile, Claire hires retired nurse Alice Dimmock as her new housekeeper. Alice discovers Edna's Bible in Claire's library and is visibly perturbed, and later retrieves pieces of Edna's mail; the letters enquire about Edna's whereabouts. Claire claims Edna was a drunk and she fired her, but Alice appears sceptical of her story. One afternoon, a stray Labrador Retriever, named Chloe, viciously continues to bark outside Clarie's house. Claire grows worried that the dog will unearth the bodies and makes several attempts to get rid of her. She reveals to Alice that Chloe is a tramp and that her former housekeeper, Rose Hull, used to feed and care for Chloe. Mike stops by one day to visit Alice; he is, in fact, Alice's nephew. It is revealed that Alice is posing as a housekeeper to investigate her good friend Edna's disappearance. Mike uncovers Edna's bank account, which has been almost entirely drained of funds. Claire plans an impromptu trip to attend a music festival in New Mexico the next morning. Alice asks if she can drive into town, claiming that she needs to buy toothpaste and stockings for the trip; while she is gone, Claire finds a full tube of toothpaste in Alice's bathroom. Suspicious, she investigates further, and finds a new box of stockings in Alice's dresser. Claire finds a letter to Alice from Mike regarding Edna's bank account, confirming her suspicion that Alice is on to her. Claire confronts Alice, who admits that she is searching for Edna, and demands to know where she is before accusing her of murder. The women begin fighting, and Claire chases Alice through the house. Claire beats Alice over the head with a phone receiver, rendering her unconscious. The next morning, Harriet stops by to tell Claire that George has been attempting to call, but has been unable to reach her. Inside, Claire tells her that Alice injured her head on a falling tree branch during a windstorm the night before and pretends, within Harriet's earshot, to talk to an incapacitated Alice in her bedroom. That afternoon, Claire dresses herself in Alice's clothes and wig, and drives the incapacitated Alice to a nearby lake and sinks the car. Shortly after, George and Julia arrive at the same time as a telephone repairman. George asks where Alice is, and Claire claims that she went to the drugstore to retrieve allergy medication. Mike and Harriet arrive moments later, inquiring about Alice's whereabouts. George answers a phone call notifying that Alice was found dead in her car, which crashed off the road into the lake. That night, Claire invites Harriet and Jim over for dinner and serves them drugged egg nog. Jim is fascinated by Claire's husband's stamp collection, and Claire offers to give it to him. Once Harriet and Jim are unconscious, she drags their bodies into their cottage and lights the home on fire, trapping Chloe in the process. In the morning, Claire finds the pine trees in her yard upturned and the graves exposed. She is confronted by the sheriff, George and Julia, as well as Harriet, Jim, and Mike; Mike saved them the night before and stopped the fire. Jim returns the stamp collection to Claire, which she learns is, in fact, worth over $100,000. Claire looks over her pine trees and laughs hysterically. Cast Production The Forbidden Garden by Ursula Curtiss was published in 1962. The New York Times called it \\"chilling\\". The Guardian said it was one of the author's best and should be \\"read in one sitting\\". Film rights were bought by Robert Aldrich who had produced two successful horror films, What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962) and Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964). Both films dealt with aged women who become scheming or demented, resorting to violence and murder. In September 1967, Aldrich announced he would make the film under the title What Ever Happened to Aunt Alice? It would be made by his production company, The Associates and Aldrich. In October Aldrich announced the film would be part of a four-picture deal his company signed with ABC Pictures, the others being The Killing of Sister George (1968), (then uncompleted) The Greatest Mother of 'em All (1970), and Too Late the Hero (also 1970). William Inge signed to write the script. Aldrich did not direct Aunt Alice, but he did produce it. Bernard Girard was the original director. By August, Geraldine Page and Ruth Gordon had signed to play the leads and the script was written by Theodore Apstein. \\"It's a wonderful part and a wonderful script\\", said Gordon. Geraldine Page's character, Claire Marrable, portrayed an aging woman, when in fact, Page was 43-44 years old at the time during the film's production and release. Filming for What Ever Happened to Aunt Alice? began on October 23, 1968 on location in Tucson, Arizona, with additional photography taking place at Aldrich Studios in Los Angeles. Principal photographing was completed on January 5, 1969. Robert Fuller, who had a support role, had been signed to a three-picture contract with the Associates and Aldrich. In November, it was announced that Bernard Girard, who was directing the film, \\"has withdrawn due to differences in interpretation\\" and would be replaced by Lee Katzin. Release =Theatrical= What Ever Happened to Aunt Alice? premiered theatrically in New York City on July 23, 1969 in 48 theatres and grossed $540,000 in its first week, placing number one at the box office in the United States. It was subsequently given a wide release on August 20, 1969. The film opened the 1969 Cork Film Festival in Ireland, and received its European premiere in London on September 21, 1969. =Critical reception= The Los Angeles Times called the film a \\"thoroughly enjoyably romp of jolly horror\\". Vincent Canby of The New York Times deemed the film \\"an amusingly baroque horror story told by a master misogynist\\", and praised Page as an \\"affecting\\" actress. Variety similarly praised the acting, noting: \\"Page as a high and mighty wealthy eccentric delivers a bravura performance. Gordon, working crisply, offers a remarkable portrait of a brave woman. The two ladies play off each other relentlessly and audience reaps the rewards.\\" Donald Guarisco of AllMovie wrote: \\"This Robert Aldrich production is a second-tier version of the thrills he pioneered in his self-directed film What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? The problem is simple: What Ever Happened to Aunt Alice? has the stars right, but the material is underdeveloped. The script has an engaging premise that would be a perfect vehicle for all sorts of creepy thrills, but the story never capitalizes on the possibilities of its memorable lead character duo.\\" =Box office= The film earned rentals of $2,025,000 in North America and $1.2 million in other countries. After all costs were deducted, it recorded a loss of $860,000. =Home media= The film was released for the first time on DVD on July 11, 2000 by Anchor Bay Entertainment, and again in 2004 by MGM, though both releases are discontinued. The 2004 edition was additionally released as part of the now discontinued \\"MGM Movie Collection: 4 Horror Movies\\" (alongside Edge of Sanity, The Spiral Staircase and Equus) on February 1, 2011. On January 17, 2018, Kino Lorber announced they would be releasing the film on Blu-ray and DVD featuring a 4K restoration. It was finally confirmed on October 31, 2018, that the film would receive its Blu-ray and DVD release on January 8, 2019. Proposed follow-up In October 1969, Aldrich announced that he would make a third \\"What Ever Happened to...\\" film, What Ever Happened to Dear Elva? based on the novel Goodbye, Dear Elva by Elizabeth Fenwick. However, the film was never made.

Biography Born as Rosalie Gaull in Jackson, Michigan, she studied government studies, graduating with honors from Smith College in 1958. She met her husband-to-be, future federal Judge Laurence H. Silberman, in 1955 during summer school at Harvard University. Career Silberman raised three children while the family lived in Hawaii during the 1960s, but she also worked as a teacher in suburban Washington before getting involved in politics and public affairs. President Richard Nixon appointed her to the Presidential Commission for the Education of Disadvantaged Children, and she worked as a press secretary for U.S. Sen. Robert Packwood (R-Oregon). When the Silbermans moved to San Francisco in 1979, she did development work for the San Francisco Conservatory. In 1984, President Ronald Reagan appointed her to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), where she served until 1995, rising to the positions of vice-chair and commissioner. Her support of Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas led to the formation of the Independent Women's Forum (IWF), which had its origins in 1991–92, when Mrs. Silberman, along with Barbara Olson and Anita Blair, among others, started an informal network of women who supported the Thomas nomination despite allegations of sexual harassment by Anita Hill, a former colleague at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. She had worked with Thomas at the commission and was a close friend. During his contentious confirmation, she spoke out on his behalf and helped edit The Real Anita Hill, a book by David Brock that savaged Hill and portrayed her charges as a political dirty trick. From 1995–2000, she was executive director of the Office of Congressional Compliance, an independent authority established by Congress to oversee the new law requiring that Congress abide by many of the same workplace regulations that covered the rest of the nation. In 2002, Donald Rumsfeld appointed her to the Defense Department Advisory Commission on the Status of Women (DACOWITS), where she served as Boardmember, and, later, Chairperson Emeritus until her death five years later. Death Silberman died from complications from breast cancer on Sunday, February 18, 2007 at Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, D.C., at the age of 69. She was survived by her husband of 49 years; three children and, at the time of her death, eight grandchildren.

It used elements of Kurdish nationalism to recruit. It was led by Sheikh Said and a group of former Ottoman soldiers also known as the Hamidiye regiments. The rebellion was carried out by two Kurdish sub-groups, the Zaza and the Kurmanji. Background In Turkey there existed a strong anti-Kurdish policy in the first years of the Turkish Republic. Mustafa Kemal Pasha, in his speech in Eskisehir on 14 January 1923 about the Mosul-Kirkuk area also addressed the Kurdish issue and said: ‘'the second issue is the problem of Kurdishness. The British want to establish a Kurdish state there (in Northern Iraq). If they do, this thought spreads to the Kurds within our borders. To prevent this, we need to cross the border South.'’\\"Eskişehir İzmir Konuşmaları\\" Kaynak Yay., İst.-1993, sf.95 During and after the negotiations of the Treaty of Lausanne, the British spokesmen made remarks about this.

On 19 May 1924, the results of the negotiations in Istanbul could not be reached and Britain took the issue on 6 August 1924 to the League of Nations. The Sheikh Sait uprising emerged during the days when British occupation forces declared martial law in northern Iraq, removed their officer's permits, and carried their troops to Mosul. In those days, the Colon of Ministers was increasingly under scrutiny, and a powerful British fleet was moving to Basra.\\"Türkiye Cumhuriyetinde Anlaşmalar 1924–1938\\" Genelkurmay Yay., Nak.-1972, sf.43–44; ak. U.Mumcu, \\"Kürt-İslam Ayaklanması\\" sf.53 Prior to Sheikh Said's rebellion, the prominent Pashas of the War of Independence worried about the anti-religious and totalitarian policy of Atatürk's government and therefore on 17 November 1924, the Terakkiperver Cumhuriyet Fırkası (TCF), the first opposition party in the history of the Republic was established.Ali Fuat Cebesoy, Siyasi Hatıralar, Vatan Neşriyat, İstanbul 1957; Tarık Zafer Tunaya, Türkiye’de Siyasi Partiler, İstanbul 1952, sayfa 606. There was a general consensus that Atatürk's actions were against religion. In the TCF’s article which led by Kazım Karabekir it says that \\"The political party is respectful to the religious beliefs and thoughts\\". One of the TCF officials, Fethi Bey, said \\"The members of the TCF are religious. CHF is messing up with the religion, we will save the religion and protect it\\".Nurşen Mazıcı, Belgelerle Atatürk döneminde Muhalefet (1919-1926), Dilem Yayınları, İstanbul 1984, sayfa 82. Two weeks before the Sheikh Said incident, in late January 1925, the TCF Erzurum deputy Ziyaeddin Efendi, with heavy criticism of the actions of the ruling CHF in the chair of the Grand National Assembly; that innovation is nothing more than isret (getting drunk), dance, beach mischief, prostitution increased, Muslim women are losing their decency, getting drunk is being encouraged but most important of all, the religious emotions are getting dishonored and this new regime that brings nothing more than filth and dragged the country into the mud\\".Metin Toker, Şeyh Sait ve İsyanı, Akis Yayınları, Ankara 1968, sayfa 21.The Azadî forces under the lead of Halid Beg Cibran were dominated by the former members of the late Ottoman era Hamidiye regiments, a Kurdish tribal militia established during the reign of Sultan Abdul Hamid II to deal with the Armenians, and sometimes even to keep the Qizilbash under control. According to various historians, the main reason the revolt took place was that various elements of the Turkish society were unhappy with the Turkish Parliament's abolition of the Ottoman Caliphate on 3 March 1924. According to British intelligence reports, the Azadî officers had 11 grievances.Olson, Robert (1989), pp.43–45 Apart from Kurdish cultural demands and complaints of Turkish maltreatment, this list also detailed fears of imminent mass deportations of Kurds. They also registered annoyance that the name Kurdistan did not appear on maps, at restrictions on the Kurdish language and on Kurdish education and objections to alleged Turkish economic exploitation of Kurdish areas, at the expense of Kurds. The revolt was proceeded by the smaller and less successful Beytüssebap revolt in September 1924, led by Halid Beg Cibran and Ihsan Nuri on the orders by the prominent Azadî member Ziya Yusuf Bey.Olson, Robert (1989). pp.48–49 The revolt was subdued, and its leaders Halid Beg Cibran and Ziya Yusuf Bey were captured and courtmartialed in Bitlis. Sheikh Said, issued various declarations against the people with the signature of \\"Emir’ül Mücahidin Muhammed Said El-Nakşibendi\\". In addition, the Alevi Zaza tribal chiefs sent letters to the Alevi Zaza tribal chiefs, to the Kurdish bey, the network and the tribal leaders and the Turkish gentlemen and aghas in Ergani with the same signatures and invited them to join in a common struggle against the Kemalist rule. In one of the published statements. \\"Since the day it was founded, the Head of the Republic of Turkey and his friends are trying to destroy the foundations of Islam by acting oppose to the Quran, denying Allah and the Prophet and exiling the caliph of Islam now demolishing this illegitimate regime a must to do for all Muslims and is legit according to the Sharia of Muhammed\\".M. Şerif Fırat, Doğu İlleri ve Varto Tarihi, TKAE Yayını, Ankara 1981, sayfa 180. Also, in a letter which Sheikh Said sent to the Alevi Zaza tribal leaders Halil, Veli and Haydar in Varto it is written that: \\"In the name of Saving the Islam from the heretic Mustafa Kemal’s hands, started to marching to the Susar. For this jihad, i strongly believe that your tribe which has bravery and zeal will come into aid regardless to sects, it is a duty for every Muslim who says 'Lailahe illallah Muhammedün Resulüllah'. O' Eyyühel-Ensar, let us save our religion and honor from these heretics and we will give your tribe the lands that you want. This heretic government will make us heretic like themselves.

Participation in the rebellion Front row, left to right: Shiekh Sherif, Sheikh Said, back row: Sheikh Hamid, Major Kasim (Kasım Ataç), Sheikh Abdullah. = For the rebellion = Sheikh Said appealed to all Muslims of Turkey to join in the rebellion being planned. The tribes which actually participated were mostly Zazas. However the Xormak and Herkî, two Zaza-Qizilbash tribes were the most active and effective opponents of this rebellion. experience in confronting the Turkish government.Olson, Robert (1989), pp.97–98 The Azadî, and several officers from the Ottoman empire have supported the rebellion. Robert Olson states that viewing the several sources, a number of 15'000 rebels is about the average of the involved rebels in the revolt.Olson, Robert (1989). p.102 = Against the rebellion = That some Alevi tribes who participated in the Koçgiri rebellion refused to join the rebellion was a major setback as they had a lot of Other tribes also desisted from supporting the rebellion, as their leaders preferred to be in good standing with the Turkish government.Olson, Robert (1989), p.96 Some claim British assistance was sought realizing that Kurdistan could not stand alone. The Kurdish population in around Diyarbakır, farmers as well as Kurdish notables, desisted from supporting the rebellion. The influential Kurdish Cemilpasazade family even supported the Turkish Government. Also the ruler of Cizre, Sheikh Saida and the powerful Sheikh Ziyaettin from Norşin wouldn't support the rebellion and preferred an arrangement with the Kemalists.Behrendt, Günter (1993), pp.373–374 During this rebellion, the Turkish government used its airplanes for bombing raids in Palu-Bingöl area. In the course of this operation, the airfield near Elâzığ road was used. However, according to the British Air Ministry there are few reports on the use of Turkish airplanes in suppressing the Sheikh Said rebellion. The reports originate from the British Air Command at Mosul, which was in charge of intelligence for all of Iraq. At the beginning of the rebellion the Turks had one squadron (filo) consisting of seven airplanes. Of these only 2 were serviceable. But In the course of the rebellion more than 70 aircraft have been involved in subduing the rebellion.  The Rebellion  Turkish soldiers encircling Palu, Çapakçur (present-day: Bingöl), Genc (present-day: Kaleköy, Solhan), Piran, Hani, Lice, Ergani, Egiland Silvan, Cumhuriyet Newspaper, 30 March 1925.Following the suppression of the Beytüssebap revolt, the Turks attempted to prevent an other rebellion. In February 1925, they moved into the Piran (today called Dicle) area to detain some Kurdish notables, Olson, Robert (1989), p.107 but were prevented by from it by men loyal to Sheikh Said. The intrusion by the Turkish army provoked the Kurds around Sheikh Said, and reportedly they have either killed or arrested all the Turkish officers in the areas under their control. On 13 February 1925, Sheikh Said addressed the people in his sermon in the Piran mosque and stated: The madrasahs were closed. The Ministry of Religion and Foundations was abolished and the schools of religion were connected to the National Education. In the newspapers, a number of irreligious writers dare to insult the Prophet and extend the language of our Prophet. If I can do it today, I will start fighting myself and try to raise religion.Behçet Cemal, Şeyh Sait İsyanı, Sel Yayınları, İstanbul 1955, sayfa 24. Sheikh Said was elected as the next commander of the Kurdish independence movement gathered around Azadî and Darhini was declared the capital of Kurdistan on the 14 February 1925. Sheikh Said, who had taken the governor and the other officers captive while charging against Darhini (16 February), tried to gather the movement under a single center with a declaration urging the people to rise up in the name of Islam. In this statement, he used his seal which means 'the leader of the fighters for the sake of religion' and called everyone to fight for the sake of religion. Initially, the rebellion was initiated on behalf of the Islamic Sharia, but was later converted to the Kurdish independence movement.Sulhi Dönmezer, Türkiye Cumhuriyeti Devleti'ne Yönelik Bozguncu Hareketler ve Tehditler, Atatürk Araştırma Merkezi Dergisi (Sayı 38, Cilt: XIII, Temmuz 1997) The rebellion soon expanded and by 20 February, the town Lice, where the 5th Army corps was headquartered was captured. Olson, Robert (1989), p.108 After receiving the support of the tribes of Mistan, Botan and Mhallami, he headed to Diyarbakır via Genç and Çapakçur (today known as Bingöl) and captured Maden, Siverek and Ergani. Another uprising, directed by Sheikh Abdullah, also moved towards Muş via Varto. The rebellion force which had taken over the Varto, even if they moved through Muş on later, they did beaten by militia force around Murat bridge and made them to retreat to Varto. On 21 February, the government declared martial law in the eastern provinces. Army troops sent to the insurgents on 23 February were forced to retreat to Diyarbakir in the Winter Plain against the Sheikh Said forces. The next day, another uprising under the leadership of Sheikh Sharif, who entered Elazığ, kept the city under control for a short time. Elazığ was looted by rebels for several days.János M. Bak, Gerhard Benecke, Religion and rural revolt\\", Manchester University Press ND, 1984, , pp. 289–290. At the 1 of March, the Kurds managed to assault the Diyarbakır airport and destroy three of the airplanes.Olson, Robert (1989), p.120 In one of the bigger engagements, in the night of 6–7 March, the forces of Sheikh Said laid siege to the city of Diyarbakır with 5,000–10,000 men. In Diyarbakır the headquarters of the Seventh Army Corps was located.Olson, Robert (1989), p.104 But neither the Kurdish notables nor the Kurdish farmers in the region in and around Diyarbakır refused to support the rebellion.Olson, Robert (1989), pp.98–99 The Muslim Revivalists attacked the city at all four gates simultaneously. All of their attacks were repelled by the numerically inferior Turkish garrison, with the use of machine gun fire and mortar grenades. When the rebels retreated the next morning, the area around the city was full of dead bodies. When a second wave of attacks failed, the siege was finally lifted on 11 March. After a large consignment, a mass attack (26 March), and with a suppress operation the Turkish troops made many of the enemy troops to surrender and squeezed the insurgency leaders while they were preparing to move to the Iran in Boğlan (today known as Sohlan). Sheikh Sharif and some of the tribal leaders were captured in Palu, and Sheikh Said too in Varto was seized at Carpuh Bridge with a close relative's notice (15 April 1925). By the end of March, most of the major battles of the Sheikh Said rebellion were over. The Turkish authorities, according to Martin van Bruinessen, crushed the rebellion with continual aerial bombardments and a massive concentration of forces. (also London: Zed Books, 1992) The rebels were unable to penetrate beyond Hınıs, this was one of the two major areas where Sheikh Said was well known and he enjoyed considerable influence there (he had a tekke in Hınıs). This failure excluded the possibility of extending the rebellion. On the other hand, Hasan Hayri Efendi, who was Dersim Deputy and Alevi Zaza, entered into solidarity with Sheikh Sharif, appointed by Sheikh Said as Commander of the Elaziz Front. A joint letter with Sheikh Sharif in Elaziz was sent to all the tribal leaders of Dersim on 6 March 1925.M. Nuri Dersimi, Kürdistan Tarihinde Dersim, Halep 1952, sayfa 180. = Political measures by the Turkish Government = Turkish troops with the detained Sheik Said Mustafa Kemal Atatürk foresaw the seriousness of the rebellion and urged İsmet İnönü to come to Ankara, as he had been resting for a vacation at an island near Istanbul. Atatürk welcomed İnönü and his family at the Ankara Station to explain him how serious the situation has become. Mustafa Kemal, Ali Fethi (Okyar) and İsmet Inönü had a meeting on the 24 February 1925, which lasted for 7 1/2 hours and the main subject was the rebellion.Olson, Robert (1989), p.123 Following, the Government of Ali Fethi has issued a circular which vowed strict measures against the rebels on the 25 February 1925 and announced the reign of martial law in the eastern provinces and classified the use of religious aims against the government as treason. The Turkish Parliament was not pleased with this action and in response, the Turkish prime minister Ali Fethi was criticized by the politicians of the Republican People's Party. However, Mustafa Kemal Pasha, advocated for the resignation of Prime Minister Ali Fethi against the rapid rise of the incidents and appointed İsmet Pasha to establish a new government on 2 March. Ali Fethi resigned on the 3 March and was replaced by Ismet Inönü.Olson, Robert (1989), pp.123–124 Within days, the Turkish Grand National Assembly adopted the () and granted the government emergency powers. The ban on the uprising has been extended to include other measures. In addition, it was decided to re-establish the Independence Courts in Ankara and Diyarbakır.  Aftermath  Seyit Abdülkadir, the leader of the Kurdish Teali Society and several of his friends who were accused of supporting the rebellion, were arrested in Istanbul and taken to Diyarbakır to be trialed. As a result of the trial, Seyit Abdulkadir and five of his friends were sentenced to death by the Independence Tribunal in Diyarbakır on the 23 May 1925 and executed four days later. A journalist for a Kurdish newspapers in Bitlis, the poet Hizanizâde Kemal Fevzi was also among the executed. The Independence Tribunal in Diyarbakir also imposed a death sentence on Sheikh Said and 47 riots rulers on the 28 June 1925. Penalties were carried out the next day, by Sheikh Said coming up first. The President of the Independence Tribunal in Diyarbakır that sentenced the rebels stated on 28 June 1925: In total over 7000 people were prosecuted by the Independence tribunals and more than 600 people were executed. The suppression of the Shaykh Said Uprising was an important milestone in the control of the Republican administration in Eastern Anatolia and South East Anatolia. On the other hand, the developments that emerged with the uprising led to the interruption of the steps towards transition to multi- party life a while ago. Also against the Progressive Republican Party () was opened an investigation on the grounds that he was involved in the riot and was soon closed under a government decree. After the uprising, the Turkish state prepared a Report for Reform in the East (Şark Islahat Raporu) in 1925, which suggested that the Kurds shall be Turkified. Thousands of Kurds fled their homes in southeastern Turkey and moved to Syria, where they settled and were granted citizenship by the French mandate authorities. In the Fall of 1927, Sheikh Abdurrahman, the brother of Sheikh Said, began a series of revenge attacks on Turkish garrisons in Palu and Malatya. In August 1928 Sheikh Abdurrahman and another brother of Sheikh Said, Sheikh Mehdi, turned themselves in and made use of the amnesty law issued by the Turkish Government in May of the same year.  Legacy  After 66 years of Shaik Said rebellion. The Berxwedan news which is the media organ of the PKK carried the subject to its papers like this: \\"Finally, the three months lasting Zaza resistance was suppressed in a bloody way by Kurdish-supported Turkish units. Thousands of Zaza people lost their lives. Hundreds of Zaza villages pillaged, lots of families were exiled to the Western provinces of Anatolia. By the way lots of Kurdish aghas, Beys and tribal leaders regardless their support to the Turkish nation, could not escaped from being exiled too.\\"Berxwedan Gazetesi, Sayı: 120 (Almanya/Bonn, 01 Mart 1991), s. 5.

He won several honors, such as the 350th Harvard University Anniversary Medal. Biography Crite was born in North Plainfield, New Jersey, on March 20, 1910. The family relocated to Massachusetts and from the age of one until his death Crite lived in Boston's South End. Crite's mother, Annamae, was a poet who encouraged her son to draw. Showing promise at a young age, he enrolled in the Children's Art Centre at United South End Settlements in Boston and graduated from the English High School in 1929. His father Oscar William Crite was an doctor and engineer, one of the first black people to earn an engineering license. Though he was admitted to the Yale School of Art, he chose to attend the School of the Museum of Fine Arts and graduated in 1936. Recognition came early as well. His work was first shown at New York's Museum of Modern Art in 1936. Crite then attended Harvard Extension School, where he earned a BA degree in 1968. Crite was among the few African-Americans ever employed by the Federal Arts Project. In 1940, he took a job as a engineering draftsman with the Boston Naval Shipyard; it supported his work as an artist for thirty years. He later worked part time as a librarian at Harvard University's Grossman Library. In 1986, Boston named the intersection of Columbus Avenue and West Canton Street, just steps from his home, Allan Rohan Crite Square. In 1993, Crite married Jackie Cox-Crite. Together they established the Crite House Museum in their home at 410 Columbus Avenue in Boston's South End. Suffolk University awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1979. He died in his sleep of natural causes on September 6, 2007, at age 97. His widow established the Allan Rohan Crite Research Institute to safeguard his legacy, which Crite never thought important, by authenticating and cataloging his many scattered works. Artwork Douglass Square, Boston, by Allan Crite. Oil. 20\\" x 24\\". 1936. Commissioned by the Federal Arts Project.Crite hoped to depict the life of African-Americans living in Boston in a new and different way: as ordinary citizens or the \\"middle class\\" rather than stereotypical jazz musicians or sharecroppers. Through his art, he intended to tell the story of African Americans as part of the fabric of American society and its reality. By using representational style rather than modernism, Crite felt that he could more adequately \\"report\\" and capture the reality that African Americans were part of but often unaccounted for. Crite explained his body of work as having a common theme: His paintings fall into two categories: religious themes and general African-American experiences with some reviewers adding a third category for work depicting Negro spirituals. Spirituals, he believed, expressed a certain humanity. Crite was a devout Episcopalian, and his religion inspired many of his works. His 1946 painting Madonna of the Subway is an example of a blend of genres, depicting a Black Holy Mother and baby Jesus riding Boston's Orange Line. Other pieces such as School's Out (1936) reflect on the themes of community, family, society. On his faith and the role of liturgy in his pieces, Crite said in an interview: His work is recognizable to the use of rich earth tone colors. According to one biographer, his favorite color was \\"all colors\\" and his favorite time of year was \\"anything but winter.\\" According to one reviewer, \\"Crite's oils and graphics, even when restricted to black and white, are bright in tonality, fine and varied in line, extremely rhythmic, dramatic in movement, and often patterned.\\" Crite's works hang in more than a hundred American institutions, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Chicago Art Institute and Washington’s Phillips Collection. The Boston Athenaeum holds the largest public collection of his paintings and watercolors, a bequest from Crite in gratitude for his long tenure there as a visiting artist. Books Crite's illustrated books include: *Were You There When They Crucified My Lord. A Negro Spiritual in Illustrations (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1944) *All Glory: Brush Drawing Meditations On The Prayer Of Consecration (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Society of Saint John the Evangelist, 1947) *Three Spirituals from Earth to Heaven (1948), in which he illustrated religious stories from such African-American spirituals as \\"Swing Low Sweet Chariot\\" and \\"Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen\\" Exhibitions Crite's major exhibitions included: *1920s Harmon Foundation Exhibitions *1930s Museum of Modern Art, New York *1936 Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. *1939 Boston Museum of Fine Arts *1978 the Boston Athenaeum *1999 Frye Art Museum, Seattle His works were shown in a coordinated series of posthumous exhibitions in 2007-08, at the Boston Public Library, the Boston Athenaeum, and the Museum of the National Center of Afro-American Artists.

The original and most well known is Peter Parker created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko originating from the Earth-616 universe. Within the mainstream Marvel Universe there have been characters that have taken the mantle such as Ben Reilly, Mac Gargan and Doctor Octopus. Outside of the mainstream universe, there are different incarnations of Spider-Man in alternate universes. Popular examples include characters such as funny animal parodies like Spider-Ham, an alternate future version named Miguel O'Hara, a daughter of Peter Parker named Mayday Parker in the MC2 universe, a different take on Peter Parker in the Great Depression era, the Ultimate version of Peter Parker and his successor, Miles Morales, along with a variant of Spider- Man where Peter's supporting character, Gwen Stacy, becomes Spider-Woman instead of Parker. Originally, these characters were depicted as separate from each other, but they have crossed over together in storylines like \\"Spider- Verse\\", \\"Web Warriors\\", and Spider-Geddon, in teams such as Spider-Army and Web Warriors, where the many different versions of Spider-themed characters are the major protagonists of the storyline. Some of these characters appeared in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Some of these characters were temporarily merged in the same universe in the 2015 comic book series Secret Wars as a part of the Spider-Man family. There have been different version characters in other media that have crossed over in comics as well. Prime Earth (Earth-616) Peter Parker, the Spider-Man of Earth-616 is the main incarnation of the character and appears in nearly every single piece of other media surrounding Spider-Man. Other universes Other related characters exist in alternative versions of the Marvel Universe called the Multiverse. These characters originally appeared in their own continuity but later on crossed over with the mainstream Spider-Man family. In 2015 all the alternate comic book universes were destroyed and only a few characters joined together with Earth-616 characters in its own universe including various Spider-Men. =DC crossovers= In some intercompany crossovers with DC Comics, Spider-Man has worked alongside Superman twice, once to defeat Doctor Octopus and Lex Luthor and the other to stop Doctor Doom from providing the Parasite with long-term access to the powers of both the Hulk and Wonder Woman. He also worked alongside Batman to defeat Carnage and the Joker, the two later collaborating to defeat the Kingpin and Ra's al Ghul, with Fisk eventually aiding the heroes in the end. =Earth X (Earth-9997)= Spider-Man of Earth-9997, art by Javier Rodriguez In the series Earth X and its sequels, in which its universe's Earth is designated as Earth-9997, Peter Parker’s identity as Spider-Man is revealed and he is no longer a superhero. In time, he becomes overweight and resembles his late uncle as he ages. After the death of his wife, his daughter bonds to the Venom symbiote and fights crime, much to his dismay. During the course of the series, he becomes a police officer. Three other related characters appear: In the same universe, an African American homeless man was mutated from the Terrigen Mist and his skin mutated into red reptilian skin with black lines. He can use his Energy Web to trap his victims in a trap of illusions. He went by the alias “Spiders Man.” =Earth-13584= On Earth-13584, Spider-Man underwent a further mutation that turned his skin blue, caused him to develop a spider-like language, and enabled him to make webs that have an effect on Iron Man's armors and Doctor Strange's magic, while emitting a smell that repels the monsters on the Thing's side. Using these webs, Spider-Man surrounded a section of Hell's Kitchen to act as his territory for him and his gang (consisting of Daredevil, Hawkeye, Shang-Chi, Iron Fist, Colleen Wing, and Misty Knight). The Dark Avengers had to make their way through Spider-Man's territory in order to rescue Moonstone and Skaar from Strangetown, which resulted in them running into Spider-Man's gang.Dark Avengers #187. Marvel Comics. After Spider-Man's gang subdues the Dark Avengers while thinking that they are knockoffs of the originals, Ai Apaec speaks with Spider-Man in their spider-like language, stating that they are good guys. Spider-Man releases them from their webs. The Dark Avengers and Spider-Man's gang arrive in Strangetown, where they fought the All-Seeing Eye and the Soulsnake that are on Doctor Strange's side. After the two creatures are killed, Spider-Man is killed by Tigra as Doctor Strange stated that his two creatures were sacrificed so that Spider-Man can be brought down.Dark Avengers #188. Marvel Comics. =Exiles= In the series Exiles, which involves inter-dimensional travel, several alternative versions appear: * The Spider is an alternative version of Spider-Man who merged with the Carnage symbiote and became a psychopathic killer. Before being displaced in time, he had been on death row in his home reality.Exiles #12 He originates from Earth-15 and was a member of Weapon X. * A Spider-Man who is a member of the Fantastic Five and dies in a battle against the Spider.Exiles #20-22 * A Peter Parker who is part of a mutant superhero team, Force-X, led by Emma Frost.

A fight ensues and the creature and Wolverine are both slain. As Blink and Nocturne depart this reality, it is shown that the creature bit the young Peter.X-Men Unlimited #41 * Morph fought a Demon Spider-Man on an alternative world. Later, the Demon Spider-Man was viewed briefly by Mojo and Major Domo as it attacked a young couple in a parking complex, but the Demon Spider-Man killed itself.Exiles #8 (March 2002) =House of M= In House of M, a Marvel crossover event, the Scarlet Witch alters reality to make mutants the ruling class over humans. This world is ruled by mutants and their leader, Magneto. In the miniseries Spider-Man: House of M, Peter Parker is believed to be a mutant, and Spider-Man's identity is widely known. He is rich, famous and married to Gwen Stacy, and they have a young son named Ritchie. Aunt May and Uncle Ben are alive and in good health, and J. Jonah Jameson is Peter's often- abused publicist. Unfortunately, his life unravels when Jameson reveals to the world that Spider-Man is not a born mutant. After the world is restored to normal, Peter suffers terribly with the memory of the life he left behind, expressing a desire to kill Magneto, whom he mistakenly believes was behind the events of the House of M, and the Scarlet Witch, whose powers were responsible for the altered reality.House of M #7 (2005) This version is later killed by Karn during the \\"Spider-Verse\\" event.Superior Spider-Man #32 (2013) =The Manga= Spider-Man: The Manga is a Japanese manga illustrated by Ryoichi Ikegami which retold the story of Spider-Man in a Japanese setting. It was originally published in Japan from January 1970 to September 1971 in Monthly Shōnen Magazine. The main character is named to maintain the Japanese adaptation. =Marvel Mangaverse= =Marvel Adventures= This version of Spider-Man first appeared in Marvel Adventures Spider-Man #53-61 before appearing in the re-titled Spider-Man: Marvel Adventures comic book series. A modern-day high school student, this Spider-Man's origin is similar to his mainstream counterpart, but his supporting cast is significantly different. Although Gwen Stacy exists in this universe, she and Peter are not dating — instead Peter is dating a brand-new character named Sophia \\"Chat\\" Sanduval, who is a mutant with the ability to talk to animals. Peter's relationship with Gwen's father, Captain George Stacy, also differs from the original version — here, Captain Stacy discovers Peter's secret identity early on, yet rather than hide this information from Peter (as his mainstream counterpart did), he confides in Peter and becomes Spider-Man's unofficial police contact. While this Spider-Man battles supervillains, he is generally more concerned with combating street-level crime and focuses heavily on taking down the Torinos, a powerful New York City Mafia family. =MC2= An alternative version of Peter Parker also exists in the Marvel Comics 2 (MC2) universe, appearing as a supporting character in Spider-Girl. The title follows almost the entire 616 timeline of the character up until the first attempt at a \\"relaunch\\" by the company, 1999, where it deviates and provides an alternative ending to the Final Chapter storyline. Peter's wayward daughter May is revealed to be alive and well, and is returned to both Parkers by Peter's first clone, the redeemed Kaine. Despite now being a father, Peter continues to fight crime as Spider- Man, and begins to cope with the new responsibilities brought by his baby daughter. Two years later, during his final battle against the Green Goblin, rather than survive unscathed, Peter loses a leg to his arch-enemy and Osborn is killed. Peter finally realizes the price he has paid for being Spider-Man, and ends his career to raise a family with Mary Jane and May. Over the years, he overcomes his physical handicap and ultimately joins the NYPD in a scientific capacity. However, after saving him from an insane Normie Osborn, his daughter May \\"Mayday\\" Parker begins a career as Spider-Girl behind his back, a decision Peter begrudgingly is forced to accept and deal with, made difficult by his love for May. Regardless of his handicap, Peter returned to the role of Spider-Man several times. Once was to aid his daughter and Darkdevil, the son of Ben Reilly, against Kaine, another to convince the latest Spider-Man (the son of Jessica Drew) to cease risking his life, and in Spider-Girl #100 to save May from the Hobgoblin. Peter and MJ ultimately have a second child, Benjamin \\"Benjy\\" Parker Jr., who is temporarily rendered deaf after possession by the Carnage symbiote and being blasted with high-frequency sonics. Benjy later develops powers of his own at an infant age. Peter was killed by Daemos, the brother of Morlun, during the \\"Spider-Verse\\" event while trying to protect Benjy and Mayday.The Amazing Spider-Man (vol. 3) #8 Near the end of Spider-Geddon, the Other appears to resurrect him. Spider-Girl The Spider-Girl comic book series, originally published under the MC2 imprint, features May \\"Mayday\\" Parker, Peter's daughter in an alternative continuity. This timeline diverged from the regular continuity when Peter and Mary Jane's daughter is returned to them by Kaine. In Spider-Girl, Peter has been retired from crime fighting since his final battle with the Green Goblin, which cost him a leg. Peter has settled down to family life and works for the New York City Police Department as a forensic scientist. His teen daughter May follows in his footsteps against his wishes, but Peter eventually helps her train for her calling. Peter appears in costume several times in Spider-Girl, either to restrain and protect May, or to assist her. Peter is among the superheroes kidnapped by Loki in the spin-off series Last Hero Standing. In the recent Spider-Girl storyline \\"Brand New May\\", Peter has uncovered a lab, within it is a stasis tank containing an exact physical symbiote duplicate of Mayday Parker, with notes left behind by Norman Osborn suggesting she is the real Mayday, and not a clone. When protecting his nephew Normie from an exploding test tube, Peter is affected by the serum within much like Osborn was...and begins to develop erratic behavior. He ultimately overcomes an attempt by Norman Osborn to control his mind and defeats him with the aid of his daughter, her clone, and the spirit of his Aunt May. Spider-Man (Gerry Drew) In the same MC2 continuity as Spider-Girl, Gerald \\"Gerry\\" Drew, the son of Jessica Drew, inherits spider-powers and poses as Spider-Man. Created by Tom DeFalco and Ron Frenz, he first appeared in Spider-Girl #32 (May 2001), and is a supporting character in Spider-Girl. Within the context of the stories, Jessica Drew, the original Spider-Woman, had retired from superheroics and gotten married. She gives birth to a baby boy, Gerry, who was diagnosed with a strange blood-borne disorder due to radiation exposure in the womb. With doctors and medicines unable to help her son, Jessica recreates the experiment that cured her of her radiation poisoning, the experiment that made her Spider-Woman. The experiment imbues Gerry with spider-powers, but did not cure him. Gerry's illness strains his parents' marriage and leads to their divorce. Feeling responsible for the break-up, Gerry becomes withdrawn. Jessica tries to alleviate his pain by telling him stories from her past, his favorites involving Spider-Man. Determined to make his short time on Earth count, Gerry designs his own Spider-Man costume and equipment based from his idol's, and convinces his mother to train him in how to use his powers. Calling himself Spider-Man, he meets Spider-Girl, and the two initially clash.Spider-Girl #33 During a fight between several villains, a bullet intended for Spider-Man kills one of the villains when Spider-Girl shoves him out of its way. Upset that he was responsible for a death, Gerry runs into Darkdevil, who trains him to be a more effective crime-fighter. At the request of Peter Parker, the original Spider-Man, Gerry decides to retire from superheroic adventuring, while Reed Richards searches for a cure for his blood disease. =Spider-Monkey= A spider monkey-themed Spider-Man appearing in Marvel Apes. The character was later killed by Jennix in the \\"Spider-Verse\\" event.The Amazing Spider-Man (vol. 3) #11 =Marvel Cinematic Universe= In the Marvel Cinematic Universe (Earth-199999), this version of Peter Parker / Spider-Man is played by English actor Tom Holland. =Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects= In the Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects series, set on Earth-50701, Spider-Man was abducted by an alien scientist named Doctor Niles Van Roekel. The Thing, Wolverine, Elektra, the Human Torch, and Storm are also abducted and injected with a drug in an attempt to corrupt them. Once infected, Spider-Man's costume is brown-and-bronze with a blue spider mark in his chest. Spider-Man and the other heroes are eventually able to fight off the corrupting infection and defeat Van Roekel. In the aftermath of the invasion, Paragon and the Imperfects join together to share the Earth with the heroes.Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects #1-6 = Marvel Zombies version = A zombified Spider-Man from Marvel Zombies #1 (December 2005), a cover homage to the original version's first appearance in Amazing Fantasy #15 (Aug. 1962), art by Arthur Suydam The Marvel Zombies universe features a Spider-Man who has been turned into a flesh-eating zombie after being infected by Zombie Captain America.Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness #1 Although Spider-Man is just as ravenous as the other zombies when hungry, when he has eaten, Spider-Man is racked with guilt at what he has done, especially for having eaten Mary Jane and Aunt May, but unable to change his nature.Marvel Zombies #4 At the conclusion of the original series, Spider-Man is one of the heroes who become the Galacti, having consumed the original Galactus and subsequently acquiring his cosmic powers.Marvel Zombies #5 In Marvel Zombies 2, he notices that his hunger is starting to fade and, as a result, is the first of the Galacti to turn against his fellow zombies.Marvel Zombies 2 #3 Eventually with the aid of Forge, Malcom, and the Acolytes, the zombies retaining their hunger are defeated. Spider-Man is one of the zombies that remain and continues work to rebuild New Wakanda and bury the dead. In Marvel Zombies Return Spider-Man is teleported to a new world, where he consumes and infects the Sinister Six (except for the Sandman). As his cosmic abilities did not come with him, and his web-shooters have dried up, the zombified superhero is forced to make do with his own veins and arteries. Following the death of the Spider-Man of this universe (mistakenly killed by the Sandman in revenge for the deaths of the other members of the Sinister Six)Marvel Zombies Return #1 the zombie Spider- Man works on developing a cure for the plague with the aid of the Kitty Pryde of this universe, using nanites and the blood of this world's Wolverine.Marvel Zombies Return #2 With the zombie Giant-Man having followed Spider-Man to this new reality, Spider-Man resolves to stop Giant-Man.Marvel Zombies Return #3 Spider-Man releases the Sandman, now infused with nanites, and wipes out every zombie hero and villain. Zombie Spider-Man dies from being exposed to his own weapon. =Mutant X= The Mutant X version of Spider-Man diverges from his mainstream counterpart in Amazing Spider-Man #102, in that he was unable or unwilling to cure himself of having six arms. For unexplained reasons, he reverses his name to the Man-Spider. A third divergence occurs when he and his clone continue to co-exist after the end of the original Clone Saga. The two keep this a secret by taking care to never appear in public at the same time,Mutant X #6 (March 1999) but the Man-Spider is forced to admit the truth after his clone is killed by Madelyne Pryor.Mutant X #5 (February 1999) He himself is later killed.Mutant X #32 =Newspaper strip= The Peter Parker of the daily Spider-Man newspaper strip continues his career as a struggling photographer constantly facing down the abuse of his less-than-satisfied boss J. Jonah Jameson, whilst battling crime in his disguise as Spider-Man. In addition to opposing classic enemies, much of the strip sees Peter battle new enemies. He has also teamed up with various heroes through the strip's run, such as Daredevil and Wolverine. He is married to Mary Jane in this continuity, and has often been aided by her in his battles with his enemies. This universe was visited by Morlun during the \\"Spider-Verse\\" event, but due to time distortions constantly resetting things so that the simplest actions take weeks to progress, Morlun finds his efforts to consume this version of Peter fruitless. The Master Weaver of the Inheritors elects to rebel against his masters for once and seals this universe away in a pocket dimension, where it will remain safe from any further attacks.Spider-Verse #1 (2014) =Powerless= Marvel published a miniseries called Powerless in 2004, which describes a Marvel Universe without superpowers. In this series, Peter Parker appears as a young man nicknamed Spider-Man on the Internet. This version had also been bitten by a radioactive spider, but instead of gaining spider- powers, his hand became atrophic. In this continuity, Peter is in love with Gwen Stacy; Mary Jane is not featured.Powerless #1-6 =Ruins= Warren Ellis' parody of Kurt Busiek's Marvels, Ruins, was a two-part miniseries set in an alternative universe (designated Earth-9591) where the situations that led to the heroes of the Marvel Universe gaining superpowers led to horrific deformities and deaths instead. In this world, when Parker was bitten by a radioactive spider, instead of gaining spider-powers, he broke out into an infectious rash that covered his body before his painful death. He had visited the offices of the Daily Bugle beforehand and infected fellow photographer Phil Sheldon, who set off to figure out how his world took a wrong turn, but succumbed to the disease before he could write his book. =Spider-Boy= In the Amalgam Comics universe of Earth-9602, Spider-Man was combined with DC's Superboy to create Spider-Boy. He is featured in Spider-Boy #1 (April 1996) and Spider-Boy Team-Up #1 (June 1997). In this continuity, Spider-Boy is the clone of researcher Peter Parker, created during an explosion in the Project Cadmus Labs. Adopted by Cadmus director General Thunderbolt Ross, he is given the name \\"Pete Ross\\".

He is able to shoot webs using a special \\"web gun\\" developed by Cadmus. Spider-Boy is an honorary member of the Legion of Galactic Guardians 2099 (an amalgamation of DC's Legion of Super-Heroes and Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy plus the Marvel 2099 timeline). In the Spider-Verse miniseries, he is seen in the background during a fight with the Inheritors. =Spectacular Spider-Man Adventures= The United Kingdom-based Panini Comics publication Spectacular Spider-Man Adventures was loosely based on the continuity of the 1994 animated TV series. In this series, Peter Parker deals with the day-to- day headaches of balancing a social life with his superheroics. He has a close circle of friends such as Liz Allen, Harry Osborn, and Flash Thompson, and he is involved in a relationship with Mary Jane. However, in this continuity, Mary Jane does not possess an existing knowledge of his dual identity, and thus Peter finds juggling his life with her and his crime-fighting career difficult. Despite this, Mary Jane loyally supports Peter, believing it is his dangerous job as a photographer that keeps him away from dates and other activities. A look into the future reveals Peter and MJ ultimately get married in this continuity and have a daughter, May, who is active as Spider-Girl. At some point in this future, Peter loses his leg, which forces him to retire as Spider-Man.Spectacular Spider-Man Adventures #1-185 (1995-2005) =Spider- Ham= =Spider-Man 1602= Peter Parquagh is a counterpart to Peter in the miniseries Marvel 1602, albeit without spider-powers.

A running gag involves Peter repeatedly almost getting bitten by unusual spiders, something that finally occurs at the very end. In the sequel miniseries, 1602: New World, he takes the identity of the Spider. Later, Peter's dual identity is revealed, and with the death of his beloved Virginia Dare at the hands of Norman Osborne, he returns to Europe and falls in love with Marion Jane Watson and joins her family of theater performers. During a battle with Baron Octavius, Norman Osborn, and Curtis Connors in Venice, a bystander picks up some of Peter's webbing, which eventually served as the basis for the Super Soldier Serum and created Captain America in World War II in this universe.1602: New World #1-4 (2005) While in the Globe Theatre, he is attacked and killed by the supervillain Morlun.Guardians of the Galaxy Free Comic Book Day Special (2014) Spider-Man 1602 appears in Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions as an alternative costume for Spider-Man Noir, and in Edge of Time as a costume for Miguel O'Hara. =Spider-Man 2099= A geneticist named Miguel O'Hara gained his spider-powers from a gene splicing incident, when the company he was about to quit injected him with a dangerous drug called Rapture. He tried to rid himself of the drug by using the gene splicer he helped to invent but, unbeknownst to him, a jealous co-worker had set it to repeat the previous experiment of a spider. The last time they had tried this experiment, it killed the test subject (the main reason Miguel O'Hara quit), but this time it worked. Instead of becoming a company-owned version of Spider-Man he became the opposite, a Spider-Man to fight Alchemax and the other large corporations ruling the world in 2099. He now fights crime as the Spider-Man of 2099.Spider-Man 2099 #1-3 (1992) =Spider-Man 2211= Spider-Man (Max Borne), also known as Spider-Man 2211, is a superhero who appears in comics published by Marvel Comics.

In the original game he was added as a younger character with whom younger audiences could identify when it was decided to use an older Peter Parker for the game. =Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse= The 2018 animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse adapts the \\"Spider-Verse\\" storyline and the Ultimate Spider-Man books starring Miles Morales. Variations of Miles Morales, Spider- Gwen, Spider-Ham, Spider-Noir, SP//dr, Spider-Man 2099, and the Spider-Man from the 1960s animated series (voiced by Shameik Moore, Hailee Steinfeld, John Mulaney, Nicolas Cage, Kimiko Glenn, Oscar Isaac, and Jorma Taccone, respectively) are featured. The film also features two different versions of Peter Parker. The version in Miles' dimension has been Spider-Man for over 10 years, was married to Mary Jane Watson, and also had a secret underground lair in Aunt May's backyard that housed dozens of different Spider-Man costumes and gear. In the movie's first act, he is killed by the Kingpin while trying to stop the villain from using a particle accelerator to access other dimensions. His death inspires the recently bitten Miles Morales into carrying on his mission as the new Spider-Man and stopping the Kingpin from endangering the city. Unlike other versions, the Peter native to Miles' dimension had blonde hair. He was voiced by Chris Pine. Spider-Man's exposure to the particle accelerator causes an alternate version of Peter Parker to get sucked into Miles' dimension. This version of Peter is in his 40s and has been Spider-Man for over 20 years. He was also married to Mary Jane Watson, but they divorced after he refused to have children with her. This, coupled with the death of his Aunt May, sent Peter's life into a downward spiral where he gave up being the wall-crawler, resulting in him getting lazier and overweight. He reluctantly agrees to mentor Miles on becoming the new Spider-Man to return to his home dimension, but later tries to prevent Miles from joining the other displaced Spider-Men when the young hero's inexperience begins to hold them back and volunteers to sacrifice himself so the other heroes can get home. Miles later joins them in the final fight against the Kingpin and his minions after he learns how to control his powers and instills new confidence in Peter that he will successfully defend his dimension. Thanks to his experience with Miles and a run-in with an alternate version of his ex, Peter decides to give his relationship with Mary Jane another shot. He was voiced by Jake Johnson.

Tin mining is central to the history of settlement at Whiteworks, which was once home to one of Dartmoor's largest tin mines. The original cottages and their inhabitants were related to this industry, until the area became used increasingly for farming in the 20th century. The site has now largely been abandoned, although Whiteworks is still on the route of many walks including Abbots Way Walk passes 500 m to the west. Geography The road to Whiteworks, with Fox Tor Mires on the left Whiteworks is situated in an area of open moorland about south-east of Princetown, overlooking the notoriously dangerous Fox Tor Mires. A difficult path leads across the mires to Fox Tor itself, which lies about south-east of the hamlet. Vehicle access to Whiteworks is via a narrow dead-end road branching off from the B3212 at Princetown. This road is an extension of the one constructed by Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt to his property at Tor Royal. The granite at Whiteworks has been subject to a process of kaolinisation: the feldspar minerals have decomposed to form a white clay known as kaolin. As a result, when the tin ore cassiterite was mined there, it was white in colour, giving the name 'White Works' to the site. There are a few species of moss particular to the Whiteworks area, namely Polytrichum urnigerum, which is found in streams, and Bryum turbinatum. History According to the evidence of stannary rolls, tin working at the Whiteworks mine site dates back to 1180, when it was associated with mediaeval field systems on the eastern edge of Fox Tor. More active mining began around 1790, when the Industrial Revolution began to fuel demand for tin, while also providing the technology to move from opencast mining to subsurface methods, previously impossible on the difficult Dartmoor terrain. Initially, there were no tin smelting houses operating in Devon, so Whiteworks sent tin ore to Calenick Smelting House, near the Cornish town of Truro. Mining continued irregularly during the 19th century, accompanied by drainage work designed to make the Fox Tor Mire safer. During part of this time the mine was one of the largest on Dartmoor, along with Eylesbarrow and Gobbet. At the beginning of the 1870s, for example, the mine produced 8–9 tons of tin ore per year. At this time, the mine was owned by Tavistock-based mining entrepreneur Moses Bawden. A ruined building on the south-west of the site By the 1880s the mine was disused, although a revival of ore values at the beginning of the 20th century meant that mining activity was briefly recommenced. Mining at the site then ceased completely in 1914. For these final years of activity, the mine was under shared ownership with Golden Dagger Mine and Hexworthy Mine. Around the turn of the century, a new farmhouse had also been constructed, and with the cessation of mining activity, the land around Whiteworks was increasingly used for livestock farming and breeding animals such as ponies. By the 1980s, Whiteworks had mostly been abandoned and some of the buildings, including the farmhouse, were demolished by the Dartmoor National Park Authority. A few cottages remain complete, one of which is owned by Plymouth College and used as a base for outdoor activities. Other buildings, related to previous mining or farming activities, lie in ruins, interspersed with the fenced-off remains of mine shafts. These ruins, combined with the surrounding geography, make Whiteworks a popular location for hikers, especially on walks starting in Princetown. The annual Abbots Way Walk on the 1st Sunday in October on its way from Buckfast Abbey to Tavistock pass with 500 m of Whiteworks. Cultural references The hamlet appears in the novel Miser's Money, by Dartmoor author Eden Phillpotts. The area around Whiteworks also provided inspiration to Arthur Conan Doyle for the Sherlock Holmes story The Hound of the Baskervilles: it is believed that the Fox Tor Mire is the location of the fictional Grimpen Mire, which would place Baskerville Hall on the site of the cottages at Whiteworks.

Raimi series Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man/Peter Parker in Sam Raimi trilogy * Spider-Man: On May 3, 2002, the feature film Spider-Man was released. It was directed by Sam Raimi and stars actor Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker. The film uses computer-generated imagery whenever Spider-Man does any action that can be troubling for Maguire and stuntmen (e.g. web slinging). Although the film adaptation took liberties with the character's history and powers—notably, he was bitten by a genetically modified rather than a radioactive spider (an idea originating with Ultimate Spider-Man), had organic web-shooters rather than mechanical ones, and had a long-standing crush on Mary Jane Watson—it generally held true to the character and was widely embraced by the viewing public. It opened at a record US$114.8 million and earned more than US$403 million in the U.S. and Canada, the highest North American gross of any film released that year, though surpassed internationally (see 2002 in film).

The studio released the film on May 4, 2007, on a budget reported to be more than US$250 million. The film features three villains: the Sandman / Flint Marko (portrayed by Thomas Haden Church), the New Goblin / Harry Osborn (portrayed by James Franco), and Venom / Eddie Brock (portrayed by Topher Grace). Bryce Dallas Howard plays Gwen Stacy. The plot centers on Peter and MJ's relationship problems, which are exacerbated by the arrival of an alien symbiote that takes over Spider-Man's costume and, despite enhancing his powers, also amplifies his anger, arrogance and other negative personality traits. Despite mixed reviews by critics, Spider-Man 3 opened to record- breaking sales with $59 million on its first day. * Spider-Man 4 began production in 2008 with Raimi attached to direct and the core cast of the previous films to return. A fourth, fifth and sixth film were all planned. Come 2009, however, Raimi dismissed the rumors that all three films were being made, instead confirming that only the fourth film was under development at the time. Sony hired James Vanderbilt in October 2007 to pen the screenplay, after contacting David Koepp, the screenwriter of the first film. The script underwent further revision by playwright David Lindsay-Abaire in November 2008 and twice more by Gary Ross in October 2009 and by Alvin Sargent. Sony had also hired Vanderbilt to pen scripts for Spider-Man 5 and Spider-Man 6. On the subject of villains, Raimi considered showcasing the transformation of Dr. Curt Connors into the Lizard, with Dylan Baker reprising his role. He also had plans to upgrade Bruce Campbell to a more significant role than his prior cameos, presumably as the villain, Mysterio. In December 2009, it was reported that John Malkovich was in talks to play the Vulture, with Anne Hathaway playing Felicia Hardy. Reports stated that Hardy would be taking a departure from her prior portrayals in this film, becoming \\"Vulturess\\" instead of the familiar Black Cat. In 2013, Raimi later denied the rumors and said that Hathaway would've been Black Cat if the film was ever made. Disagreements between Raimi and Sony threatened to push the release date back. Raimi reportedly doubted that he could adhere to the film's May 6, 2011 release date without sacrificing quality. Further complicating things, Raimi reportedly went through four revisions of the script, with different writers, and still \\"hated it\\". With so many issues, Sony cancelled the film in January 2010. Webb series * The Amazing Spider-Man began production in December 2010 and was directed by Marc Webb from a screenplay by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent, and Steve Kloves.

After Sony and Disney's Marvel Studios reached a deal to reintroduce Spider-Man into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the sequels of The Amazing Spider-Man series, including the proposed spin-off were officially cancelled. In March 2016, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Sony are moving forward with the standalone Venom movie with Dante Harper penning the script while Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach would be producing and overseeing the project.

Max Favreau, the son of director Jon Favreau, plays young Peter Parker. * The first reference to Spider-Man within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, following the deal with Sony, is at the end of Ant-Man. According to director Peyton Reed, the reference is made by a reporter who says to Samuel \\"Sam\\" Wilson / Falcon who is looking for Ant-Man. The reporter states, \\"Well, we got everything nowadays. We got a guy who jumps, we got a guy who swings, we got a guy who crawls up the walls, you gotta be more specific.\\" * Peter Parker's first on-screen Marvel Cinematic Universe appearance in Captain America: Civil War (2016), when Tony Stark recruits him to fight alongside his faction of the Avengers.

Eventually, he received the call to join the parent club, making his MLB debut with the visiting Mets on June 2, 1987, against the Los Angeles Dodgers. That night, he really was quite impressive, battling through five tough innings, allowing eight hits and three earned runs, while striking out three and yielding two bases on balls — all of which resulted in a no-decision.

He was Master of the Royal Household to Queen Anne.  Early life  Dunch was the only son of Hungerford Dunch MP of Little Wittenham and Down Ampney and his wife Catherine Oxton, daughter of William Oxton of Hertfordshire. He was born in Little Jermyn Street, London, 14 December 1657, and baptised 1 January 1658. The freedom of the borough Wallingford was conferred on him on 17 October 1695, and he was at one time proposed as its high steward, but was defeated by Lord Abingdon, who polled fifteen votes to his six. On 2 May 1702 Dunch married Elizabeth Godfrey, one of the maids of honour to the queen, and one of the two daughters and coheiresses of Colonel Charles Godfrey, by Arabella Churchill, sister to the Duke of Marlborough. Her elder sister Charlotte, married Hugh Boscawen, afterwards Lord Falmouth. Political career Dunch joined heartily in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and seems to have been a Whig throughout life. He was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for the borough of Cricklade at the two elections in January and November 1701 but was defeated in a contest in July 1702. He was re-elected MP for Cricklade in the general elections of 1705, 1708 and 1710. At the 1713 general election he was returned unopposed as MP for Boroughbridge in Yorkshire. He was elected MP for Wallingford, a constituency which several of his ancestors had served in parliament at the 1715 general election and sat until his death four years later. It was rumoured in June 1702 that Dunch would be created a baron of England. Gossip also asserted in April 1704 that his father-in-law Colonel Charles Godfrey would become Cofferer of the Household and that Dunch would succeed Godfrey as Master of the Jewel Office. A third rumour, in 1708, was that Dunch would be made Comptroller of the Household. In fact the reward for his services was the position of Master of the Household to Queen Anne on 6 October 1708. When the comptrollership fell vacant on Sir Thomas Felton's death, in March 1709, Dunch tried for it in vain. He was deprived of the mastership in 1710, but was reappointed on 9 October 1714. Dunch was a member of the Kit-Kat Club, a dining and gathering point for Whigs supporters and as was the custom of the club his portrait was duly painted and engraved. He also had a reputation as a gambler and bon-vivant and is said to have clipped his fortunes by his gambling. Dunch died on 31 May 1719 and was buried in the family vault at Little Wittenham Church on 4 June, near Wallingford, in Oxfordshire (then Berkshire), in the village where the family had had their seat for over 170 years. Family Many of Edmund's forebears had been parliamentarians, particularly representing Wallingford. William Dunch, auditor to the Mint for Henry VIII and Edward IV, represented Wallingford (1563), and was High Sheriff of Berkshire (1569–1570). It was William who bought the manor of Little Wittenham in 1552, which was the family seat. His son, Sir Edmund Dunch (1551–1623), represented Wallingford in 1571 and was High Sheriff of Berkshire (1586–1587). His son Sir William Dunch (1578–1611) represented Wallingford in 1603. He married Mary Cromwell in 1599, the daughter of Sir Henry Cromwell and aunt to Oliver Cromwell. It is believed that Mother Dunch's Buttocks, the variant name for the two rounded local hills Wittenham Clumps, is associated with her. William's brother Samuel (1592–1666) represented Wallingford in 1620. William's son, Edmund (1603–1678), was Governor of Wallingford Castle, and later became Baron Burnell of East Wittenham, though he lost this title at the Restoration (this being the only title conferred by the Protector and not confirmed by Charles II). He too represented Wallingford in 1627 and 1640, and was High Sheriff of Berkshire. Edmund's son Hungerford Dunch (1639–1680) was returned for Wallingford in 1660 but elected to serve for Cricklade. Hungerford's son was this Edmund Dunch (1657–1719). Dunch had no sons, and was the last Dunch to represent Wallingford. With his death, the male line of this branch of the Dunch family became extinct.

Slaves did not have easy access to instruments, so vocal work took on new significance. Through chants and work songs people of African descent preserved elements of their African heritage while inventing new genres of music. The culmination of this great sublimation of musical energy into vocal work can be seen in genres as disparate as Gospel Music and Hip- Hop. The music of the African diaspora makes frequent use of ostinato, a motif or phrase which is persistently repeated at the same pitch. The repeating idea may be a rhythmic pattern, part of a tune, or a complete melody.The Ostinato Idea in Black Improvised Music: A Preliminary Investigation Wendell Logan The Black Perspective in o93-215 The banjo is a direct decedent of the Akonting created by the Jola people, found in Senegal, Gambia and Guinea-Bissau in West Africa. Hence, the melodic traditions of the African diaspora are probably most alive in Blues and Jazz. Middle East * Liwa (music) and Fann at- Tanbura, performed in Arab states of the Persian Gulf. Mizmar (dance) is performed in the Hejaz and Tihamah regions of Saudi Arabia. Caribbean =Cuba and Latin music in the Caribbean= The roots of most Cuban music forms lie in the cabildos, a form of social club among African slaves brought to the island. Traditional Afro-Cuban styles, include son, Batá and yuka and Rumba. The Cuban contradanza, which became also known as the Habanera, the first written music to be rhythmically based on an African rhythm pattern, gained international fame in the 19th century. The habanera \\"El Arreglito\\" composed by the Spanish musician Sebastian Yradier, was adapted to become one of the most famous arias in Georges Bizet's 1875 opera Carmen, \\"L'amour est un oiseau rebelle\\". =Dominican Republic= Bachata is a popular guitar music that originated in the Dominican Republic. Having strong African and Spanish influences, it is therefore also considered to be music of Latin America. The subjects of bachata are often romantic with tales of heartbreak and sadness. The original term used to name the genre was amargue (\\"bitterness\\", \\"bitter music\\", or \\"blues music\\"), until the more neutral term bachata became popular. =Haiti and Francophone music in the Caribbean= Haitian music is familiar to people in the English-speaking world as Méringue. It developed during the early decades of the 19th century. When jazz became popular worldwide, mini- jazz (mini-djaz in Haitian Creole) was created as Haiti's local variety. Kadans, Haitian Creole for cadence, followed the mini-jazz era. Kadans had an influence on the development of Zouk in the French-speaking Antilles of the Caribbean. Haiti's most well-known modern music genre is compas music. It was first popularized in the 1950s by Nemours Jean-Baptiste. Zouk music Zouk is a style of music originating in Guadeloupe and Martinique during the 1980s. It has many influences, from Haitian, calypso, beguine and compas. The conventional zouk sound has a slow tempo, and it is sung in Antillean Creole, although it also has varieties that have developed in francophone Africa. It is popular throughout the French-speaking world, including France and Quebec. =Former British West Indies and the Lesser Antilles= Jamaica Early forms of Afro-Caribbean music in Jamaica was Junkanoo (a type of folk music now more closely associated with The Bahamas), the quadrille (a European dance) and work songs were the primary forms of Jamaican music at the beginning of the 20th century. These were synthesized into mento music, which spread across the island. In the 20th century, influences from the United States were fused to create the uniquely Jamaican forms dancehall and ska. Subsequent styles include reggae, rocksteady and raggamuffin. (Mical 1995) Lesser Antilles As is the case throughout the Caribbean, Lesser Antillean musical cultures are largely based on the music of African slaves brought by European traders and colonizers. The African musical elements are a hybrid of instruments and styles from numerous West African tribes, while the European slaveholders added their own musics into the mix, as did immigrants from India. Trinidad & Tobago In Trinidad and Tobago, whose calypso style is an especially potent part of the music of the other former British colonies, which also share traditions like the Big Drum dance. Trinidadian folk calypso is found throughout the area, as are African-Caribbean religious music styles like the Shango music of Trinidad.Manuel, Caribbean Currents, pgs. 183 - 211 Calypso's early rise was closely connected with the adoption of Carnival by Trinidadian slaves, including camboulay drumming and the music masquerade processions. In the 1970s, a calypso variant called soca arose, characterized by a focus on dance rhythms rather than lyricism. Soca has since spread across the Caribbean and abroad. Steel drums are a distinctively Trinidadian ensemble that evolved from improvised percussion instruments used in Carnival processions. Steel bands were banned by the British colonial authorities. Nevertheless, steel drums spread across the Caribbean, and are now an entrenched part of the culture of Trinidad and Tobago. French Caribbean islands and others The French islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe share the popular zouk style and have also had extensive musical contact with the music of Haiti, itself once a French colony though not part of the Lesser Antilles. The Dutch colonies of Curaçao, Bonaire and Aruba share the combined rhythm popular style. The islands also share a passion for kaseko, a genre of Surinamese music; Suriname and its neighbors Guyana and French Guiana share folk and popular styles that are connected enough to the Antilles and other Caribbean islands that both countries are studied in the broader context of Antillean or Caribbean music. United States When Africans came to the United States they brought their music with them. Over time, a new genre of music developed, called spirituals. Spirituals were the songs that the enslaved Africans sang. Most have religious texts, and they were sung by the enslaved Africans at many different times, including while working, in prayer meetings, and in black churches. They helped the enslaved Africans cope with slavery. They were composed by the community and the genre came out of the enslaved African experience. Spirituals developed because the enslaved Africans masters forced Christianity onto them. Through Christianity, the enslaved Africans learned many hymns. Eventually, the hymns and the text of the Bible combined with many elements of music that the enslaved Africans had brought with them from Africa, such as antiphony (the call-and-response pattern) and syncopation. This eventually formed into the genre called Spirituals. Many other African-American music genres, such as gospel and jazz, developed from this genre.  Protest Music of the African Diaspora  = 2016-present = As the music of the African Diaspora progresses, more recent and popular songs have demonstrated an act of protest in their lyrics and significant elements that are featured in the music of the African Diaspora. An example of a song would be, \\"Formation\\" by the African American singer, Beyonce Knowles; released in 2016. This popular musical composition mentioned racial injustice events that triggered the Black Lives Matter Movement (e.g. police brutality/violence) but, also included Beyonce embracing her distinct African heritage.  Authenticity  In his book, The Black Atlantic, Sociologist Paul Gilroy starts a discussion of authenticity in the Black trans-Atlantic arena of diasporic music production by presenting how black music has become a truly global phenomenon leading to a dilution of black music into an ever-increasing number of genres and styles across the world. This dilution has created tension around what music can be considered authentically Black. In understanding how authenticity is conceived, Gilroy discusses how authenticity functions as an aspect of Black music that comes from perceived proximity to the origin of said music. On page 96 of his book The Black Atlantic he was quoted saying: > “folk, or local expressions of Back culture have been identified as > authentic and positively evaluated for that reason, while subsequent > hemispheric or global manifestations of the same cultural forms have been > dismissed as inauthentic and therefore lacking in cultural or aesthetic > value precisely because of their distance (supposed or actual) from a > readily identifiable point of origin.” However, Gilroy proceeds to counter this perception by saying, “In all these cases it is not enough for critics to point out that representing authenticity involves artifice. This may be true, but it is not helpful when trying to evaluate or compare cultural forms let alone in trying to make sense of their mutation.” By making the word artifice synonymous with the representation of authenticity in this context, Gilroy is acknowledging the lack of definitive ability to denote authenticity. Gilroy then goes a step further to express how sticking to conversations of what is authentic hurts our ability to better understand the “mutation” of Black music as it engages and it changed by the Black Diaspora. In understanding the motivations behind pronouncing authenticity, Gilroy identifies the financial and market-based benefits to this pronouncement by saying, “the discourse of authenticity has been a notable presence in the mass marketing of successive Black folks cultural forms to white audiences,” demonstrating the reason for desiring being denoted as authentic. However, he also acknowledges that even seemingly authentic art forms like hip-hop, an American art form, are diasporic in nature incorporating global influences into their origin questioning how definitive apparent authenticity can be. Gilroy describes Hip-Hop as having “formal borrowings from the linguistic innovations of Jamaica's distinct modes of 'kinetic orality,' \\" this flips his earlier description of authenticity on its head by presenting a seemingly culturally regional and authentic Black art form as a truly global manifestation, depicting how ambiguous authenticity can be. As such, Gilroy effectively deconstructs the concept of authenticity.

He has lived in Halifax, Nova Scotia since 1973 and worked as an engineer with the Bedford Institute of Oceanography, where he was supervisor of mechanical and oceanographic systems development before retiring in 2006. In the 1970s, he began making urban landscape photographs using an 8x10 negative camera and developing and printing his own work. In 1981, inspired by local performance artist Ellen Pierce, he decided to focus on figurative work. Apparently needing to know his subjects very well before photographing them, he often spends more time talking than actually taking pictures. He has forged deep friendships with some of his subjects, whom he has continued to photograph on numerous occasions.S. C.

Probably because of the often erotic nature of his pictures, he has worked largely in obscurity within his own community. A 1989 exhibit at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design was publicly opposed and posters were removed. After the show ended, his works were damaged when they were removed from the walls.S. C.

His work has also been shown at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Denmark and the Saidye Bronfman Centre for the Arts in Montreal. A thirty-year retrospective exhibition was mounted at Mount Saint Vincent University Art Gallery in 2007 and in 2011 he curated and wrote the catalogue essay for the exhibition, Lisette Model: A Performance in Photography which ran from October 8 through November 20, 2011 at MSVU Art Gallery. His works are included in the collections of the National Gallery of Canada and Mount Saint Vincent University. He currently lives and works in Halifax with his wife, Ingrid Jenkner.

It featured exhibits that presented modern science and scientific issues in an accessible way, geared for the general public. It explored current scientific issues that were important for the nation's and world's public policy decisions, as presented in reports by the United States National Academies. The National Academy of Sciences replaced the museum with LabX. Exhibit development The Koshland Science Museum was part of the National Academy of Sciences. Exhibits were developed based on guidance from committees of scientific experts, who donated their time and expertise to the museum. Each exhibit had its own Scientific Steering Committee, or group of subject-matter experts who oversaw exhibit content and review information. A core group of museum staff members facilitated all aspects of exhibit selection, including development and fabrication. The museum also received input from advisory groups, whether in- person, in the community, or online. The museum also had a Museum Advisory Board, which was involved in strategic planning. The museum was centered around two primary exhibits: \\"Earth Lab\\", which focused on issues related to climate change, and \\"Life Lab\\", which emphasized learning, aging, nutrition, and infectious disease. The museum also had a \\"Wonders of Science\\" section devoted to interactive exhibits. Origin of the museum Opened in April 2004, the Marian Koshland Science Museum was named for Marian Koshland, an immunologist and molecular biologist who conducted groundbreaking research in the behavior of antibodies. The museum has been developed as the result of a gift from her husband, Daniel Koshland, a molecular biologist specializing in the study of enzymes and bacteria. The Museum shared a name with the Marian Koshland Integrated Natural Science Center at the elite liberal arts college, Haverford College. Location The museum was located at 525 E Street, NW. The museum entrance was at the corner of 6th & E Streets, NW, in the Penn Quarter neighborhood of Washington, DC. It was 3 blocks north of the National Mall.

It is located in the far north of Grenada. Sauteurs is overlooking over the Sauteurs Bay. It is the largest town in the northern part of Grenada and it is the capital city of the Saint Patrick Parish. History Here, the last remaining Carib Natives in Grenada jumped off a 40-meter-tall cliff later named Caribs' Leap to their deaths in 1651 rather than face domination by the conquering French. Thus the town was named Sauteurs, which is French for \\"jumpers\\". The trees and grotto erected in 1664 by Dominican Fathers to make a souls for Caribs and their place are a wooden deck from the century to today. In 1721, the French established St Patrick's Catholic church, which in 1784 the British government handed over to the Anglicans. However, the church was destroyed by fire. A police station now occupies the site. On 1 March 1796, , the armed transport Sally, and two commandeered sloops evacuated some 11 to 2100 British troops and militia who were trapped at Sauteurs by insurgents during Julien Fédon's revolt. In 1840 a new St Patrick Catholic church was constructed and remains to this day. Education In 2012 there were six Government/Assisted schools located in the Sauteurs area. Education is free and compulsory up to the age of 16. There are also several tertiary institutions in Sauteurs, like St. Patrick's Multi- Purpose Training, part of the T.A.

History In the 13th century the territory and city of Recanati became heavily involved in the struggles between Guelphs and Ghibbelines. On 27 July 1263 the diocese was completely suppressed by Pope Urban IV in the Bull Cives Recanatensis, due to its support of Manfred, who claimed the Kingdom of Sicily.Pope Urban IV, \\"Cives Recanatenses\\", in Bullarum diplomatum et privilegiorum sanctorum Romanorum pontificum Taurinensis editio, Tomus III (Turin 1858), pp. 697–698 (in Latin). It was not restored until 1289. By the beginning of the 14th century the anti-papalist Ghibbelines were in control, and rejected papal control through the Rector of the Marches. In order to bring Recanati into submission, Pope John XXII embarked upon a program of punishment which included the reduction of Recanati's civil status and the removal of the bishopric.Cappelletti, III, pp. 671-672; VII, pp. 212-216. The Diocese of Recanati suppressed in 1320, and did not regain its episcopal status until 1356.Leopardi, p. 116. The Diocese of Macerata was established by Pope John XXII on 18 November 1320, in the Bull Sicut ex debito, which also suppressed the diocese of Recanati. The castrum Maceratae was raised to the status of a city, and its territory, which was partly in the diocese of Camerino and partly in the diocese of Fermo, was detached from those two dioceses and included in the new diocese of Macerata. The parish church of S. Giuliano in Macerata was elevated to the status of a cathedral, and the seat of the bishop of Macerata installed in it. Bishop Fridericus of Recanati was transferred to the new See of Macerata, with all the powers, rights, and privileges which he had enjoyed when Bishop of Recanati. The cathedral Chapter of Recanata was also transferred to the Cathedral of S. Giuliano in Macerata, with the same dignities, grades, numbers, and income as they had enjoyed at Recanati.Cappelletti, III, pp. 672-678. In 1698, the cathedral Chapter of Macerata had one dignity, the Archdeacon, and seventeen Canons.Ritzler-Sefrin, V, p. 251 note 1. On 17 March 1586, Pope Sixtus V, in the Bull Pro excellenti, raised the town of Loreto to the status of a bishopric. To provide territory to support the apparatus of a diocese, the already existing diocese of Recanati was suppressed, and its territory was transferred to the new diocese of Loreto. The cathedral of Recanati was demoted to the status of collegiate church. Bishop Galeazzo Moroni, the Bishop of Recanati who was also Bishop of Macerata, was released from his connection to the diocese of Recanati. To compensate the diocese of Macerata for the loss of Recanati, it was united with the newly (re-)created Diocese of Tolentino on 10 December 1586.Sixtus V, Bull Super universas. in: Cf. Gams, p. 703. The diocese, in its current configuration, was established in order to conform to Italian civil law which was embodied in the Concordat between the Vatican and the Italian Republic of 18 February 1984. After extensive consultations, Pope John Paul II decreed that the status of the bishop governing several dioceses aeque personaliter was abolished, and that the Diocese of Macerata-Tolentino was merged with the Diocese of Osimo e Cingoli, the Diocese of Recanati and the Diocese of San Severino (Treia) to form a single diocese, albeit with a long name. The changes were embodied in a decree of the Sacred Congregation of Bishops in the Roman Curia, promulgated on 30 September 1986.Acta Apostolicae Sedis 79 (1987), pp. 729-732. The seat of the merged dioceses was to be in Macerata.AAS, p. 731, no. 1: All of the cathedrals except Macerata were to have the status of co-cathedral.AAS, p. 731, no. 3: Hodiernae Ecclesiae Cathedrales urbium Tolentinae, Recinetensis, Cingulanae et Treiensis titulum sument Concathedralium, in memoriam earum inclitarum et veterum traditionum. The diocesan offices (curia) was to be in Macerata, as was the diocesan tribunal, the diocesan seminary, the College of Consultors, the Priests' Council, unless otherwise directed by the bishop.AAS, p. 731, no. 5 On 17 April 1772, the city of Macerata witnessed the marriage of Charles Edward Stuart (the Young Pretender) and Princess Louise of Stolberg-Gedern, performed by Bishop Carlo Augusto Peruzzini (1756–1777) of Macerata. =Synods= A diocesan synod was an irregularly held, but important, meeting of the bishop of a diocese and his clergy. Its purpose was (1) to proclaim generally the various decrees already issued by the bishop; (2) to discuss and ratify measures on which the bishop chose to consult with his clergy; (3) to publish statutes and decrees of the diocesan synod, of the provincial synod, and of the Holy See. John Paul II, Constitutio Apostolica de Synodis Dioecesanis Agendis (March 19, 1997): Acta Apostolicae Sedis 89 (1997), pp. 706-727.

In 1687 Bishop Fabrizio Paolucci (1685–1698) had his Synodial Constitutions published, but it is uncertain when he held his synod.Constitutiones synodales ab illustriss. et reverendiss. d. d. Fabritio Paulucci, episcopo Maceraten. et Toletinati, aeditae anno M.DC.LXXXVII (Macerata: Muti & Sassi 1687). In 1728, Bishop Alessandro Carlo Gaetano Varano (1698–1735) held a diocesan synod.One of its decrees is referred to in Francesco Ansaldo Teloni, Dioecesana synodus, p. 54: Præsbyteri vero poenam suspensionis ipso facto incurrent, si choreas ducere cum fæminis, aut larvati ausi fuerint incedere. Bishop Domenico Spinucci (1777–1796) held a diocesan synod in Macerata on 9–11 May 1784, and another at Tolentino on 23–25 May. Bishop Francesco Ansaldo Teloni (1824–1846) held a diocesan synod in Macerata from 8 to 10 August 1830, and another in Tolentino from 22 to 24 August 1830. The decisions were published in 1832.

The Romanesque Revival style Opera House is located at 2020 Post Office Street in Galveston's Historic Downtown Cultural Arts District. It was named \\"The Official Opera House of Texas\\" in 1993 by the 73rd Texas Legislature. It has a seating capacity of 1,040.http://conventionsouth.com/business-directory/9569/the-grand-1894-opera- house/  History  In 1894, Henry Greenwall (often spelled Greenwald) raised $100,000 for construction of The Grand Opera House and Hotel in Galveston. It opened on January 3, 1895 with a live performance of the play, The Daughters of Eve. The Grand has stood through notable hurricanes, including the Galveston Hurricane of 1900, Galveston Hurricane of 1915, Hurricane Carla, and Hurricane Ike. The Grand began as a major, live performing arts theatre but after passing through a Vaudeville phase, it slowly evolved into a movie house. The movie house closed in 1974 and was purchased the same year by the Galveston County Cultural Arts Council. They transformed the movie house back into a theatre and then renovated and restored it to its former beauty. The restoration included volunteer efforts and support from private foundations. The theatre was listed in the National Register of Historic Places as \\"1894 Grand Opera House\\" in 1974. The Galveston County Cultural Arts Council owned the Opera House until 1986, when it became a stand-alone organization known as 1894, Inc. Maureen M. Patton is The Grand's Executive Director, having served as Director under the Arts Council beginning in 1981. Hurricane Ike hit Galveston Island on September 13, 2008, but The Grand was reopened on January 3, 2009 on its 114th anniversary. All of the damage that the hurricane and the flood had caused was repaired with only 92 days of construction.

Architecture  thumb \\"When it opened in 1895, the 70' x 37' x 69' stage was THE LARGEST IN THE STATE OF TEXAS and one of the largest in the country... Even today, a stage whisper can be heard without a microphone, and no seat is more than 70 feet from the stage.\\" The Grand has been through natural disasters, such as fires and hurricanes, as well as neglect during its time as a movie house. It has been rebuilt and remodeled more than once, such as during the devastating Galveston Hurricane of 1900, when its rear wall and roof caved in. The front wall of the building is made of red stone, brick, and terra cotta; the large, glass doors are framed by a carved, Romanesque style stone arch. Inside, the glass box office sits in between the two sets of doors. The carpet is a historic pattern of colors found in the decorative curtain and stenciling of roses and scrolls on the ceiling and boxes. The floors are marble tile, and the walls are wainscot. The banisters and railings are of long leaf red-heart pine, like the wainscot. A large, bronze statue of a woman holding a torch stands on the newel post on The Grand staircase. Inside the theater auditorium, red, velvet curtains frame the stage and eight opera boxes. Blue velour lines the chairs. The stage curtain (originally painted by architect Frank Cox) is a replication of the original, depicting “Sappho and Companions”.

The Scots had begun better, beating the Irish 3–0 in their second game and so entered the final match with a real chance of victory.

It builds with tom-tom drums and four guitars, amplified with buzzing feedback. It devolves into a drumbeat with dissonant blasts of guitar. \\"The Spectacular Commodity\\" takes its name from situationist theory. The song moves through various tempos with three guitars playing in different octaves, bass, and drums. The climax occurs nine minutes into the track, as one guitar plays high open chords and the other two act as accompaniment. \\"Structure\\" is built around repeated harmonics. \\"Light Fields (In Consonance)\\" begins by constructing rhythms out of one-note patterns. Toward its conclusion, the figures begin ascending into octave scales. The title track uses the overtones from excessive guitar feedback. They form a dense, chaotic soundscape that continually rises. Critical reception Upon its initial release, The Ascension received positive reviews from music critics. In a review for The New York Times, John Rockwell wrote that The Ascension did a better job than Lesson No. 1 of capturing the impact of Branca's live concerts but that \\"his work may be too grand and loud ever to be captured on disk.\\" It ranked the album 6th on its list of the best albums of 1981. Kristine McKenna wrote in the Los Angeles Times that the album \\"does a surprisingly good job of conveying the awesome power of his live performance…[it] lacks the glorious dimension of Branca's live show, but is good enough to serve as an introduction to a major new talent.\\" The Village Voice writer Robert Christgau described the album as \\"great sonically\\" but continued that \\"the beat's overstated and the sense of structure…mired in nineteenth-century corn.\\" In the 1981 Pazz & Jop list, compiled by Christgau based on a survey of several hundred critics, The Ascension placed 51st. Since its original release, the album has garnered critical acclaim. Pitchfork Media awarded it a perfect 10 score. XLR8R commented that \\"if these recordings pale in comparison to the live experience, [they] are no less rapturous for it.\\" AllMusic called it \\"one of the greatest rock albums ever made\\", adding that its \\"sonic experimentation\\" was more in the tradition of avant-garde musicians La Monte Young and Phill Niblock. Tiny Mix Tapes said that The Ascension diverges from punk and classical traditions \\"as simply essential 20th-century music.\\" Fact magazine ranked the album 8th on its list of the best albums of the 1980s. Release and impact The Ascension was released through Ed Bahlman's label 99 Records. Bahlman sold over 10,000 copies out of his shop on MacDougal Street in Manhattan, New York, and the vinyl copies became a rare collector's item.Foege 1994, p. 37 Although the album was successful for an independent release, it did not receive any interest from major labels.Masters 2007, p. 130 New Tone Records re-released the album on CD in 1999, and Acute Records re-released it in 2003 with old footage of Branca performing in the apartment of his Theoretical Girls bandmate Jeffrey Lohn.Chick 2009 The Ascension has remained Branca's most popular album. Branca released a sequel titled The Ascension: The Sequel in 2010. To do so, he re-established Neutral Records under its original name Systems Neutralizers. The Ascension influenced the work of Sonic Youth and Swans.Earles 2014, p. 49 Kurt Kellison encountered the album in 1984 and said, \\"I haven't thought about music the same way ever since.\\" After founding Atavistic Records, Kellison released some of Branca's later guitar symphonies. In 2013, David Bowie included it in a list of 25 of his favourite albums, \\"Confessions of a Vinyl Junkie\\", saying that \\"over the years, Branca got even louder and more complex than this, but here on the title track his manifesto is already complete.\\"http://scallemang.ca/bowie25albums/ Track listing Personnel *Glenn Branca - guitar *Ned Sublette - guitar *David Rosenbloom - guitar *Lee Ranaldo - guitar *Jeffrey Glenn - bass *Stephan Wischerth - drums *Ed Bahlman - producer *James Farber - recording, mixing engineer *Howie Weinberg - master engineer Notes References  * External links * Glenn Branca albums 1981 debut albums 99 Records albums ","title":"The Ascension (Glenn Branca album)"},{"id":"9713957","text":"Fortune Brainstorm TECH at the Aspen Institute Campus, in July 2011 Brian Bedol is an American television executive, entrepreneur, and founder of the sports television channels Classic Sports Network and College Sports Television. Bedol owned CSN from 1995 to 1997 and CSTV from 2003 to 2006. Bedol has since sold off both channels, to ESPN and CBS respectively, who have renamed the channels ESPN Classic and CBS Sports Network. He served as president and CEO of both companies. He left CSTV Networks in January, 2008. In 2009 he announced the formation of Bedrock Venture Partners to invest in early-stage media and technology businesses. In addition, in August 2010, Major League Soccer announced it had hired Bedol as a consultant to help the league determine what to do with its media rights. In 2012, he founded Bedrocket in partnership with Huffington Post co-founder Ken Lerer. Bedol currently serves as the company's president and CEO. Early career Brian Bedol is a \\"maverick entrepreneur in an increasingly mature industry dominated by conglomerates.\\", according to Mediaweek Magazine. He began his career as an advertising writer in Chicago writing McDonald's commercials, but soon after moved to New York as an on-air promotion producer for the not-yet-launched MTV. After returning to Harvard Business School he continued to work with MTV's parent company, Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment, and during the summer of 1984 was part of a small team that developed the business concept for Nickelodeon's evening programming block, Nick-at-Nite. After receiving his MBA from Harvard University, Bedol joined MTV founder Bob Pittman, as a partner overseeing television and home video at Quantum Media Ventures, where he created and executive-produced the ground-breaking and controversial Morton Downey, Jr. show. He was also the creator and executive producer of the Fox Network's first reality show, Totally Hidden Video. His other television credits include creator and co-executive producer of the television game show Pictionary, hosted by Brian Robbins and creator of the 1990 Fox comedy show Haywire. He also executive produced the home video of Hagler vs. Leonard: The Superfight, the top-selling sports home video of the year. While an executive at Quantum, Bedol, Pittman, and another partner, Mayo Stuntz, developed and launched Court TV with Steven Brill's American Lawyer Media. He also served on the board of directors of Quincy Jones Entertainment, the creator and producer of the hit television show, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. In 1986, Bedol, along with his partners, also led a secret effort to buy the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency. Although ultimately outbid by Martin Sorrell, Quantum had accumulated enough stock to earn over $10 million for two weeks of effort. In 1990, Quantum was sold to Time Warner, and Bedol, Pittman, and Stuntz became the executive team for Time Warner Enterprises, the company's entrepreneurial ventures unit. The division's highest profile activity was its purchase of Six Flags Theme Parks from Wesray Capital Corporation, the pioneering leveraged buyout firm started by William E. Simon and Ray Chambers. Bedol joined the board of Six Flags, and oversaw the company's marketing, advertising, promotion, and creative operations. He developed the company's controversial national advertising strategy that compared Six Flags to Disneyland. During this period, Six Flags broke its all-time attendance and revenue records. Classic Sports Network Brian Bedol and Joe Namath He left Time Warner at the end of 1992 to strike out on his own. While working on the launch of Nick- at-Nite, Bedol wanted to show classic sporting events alongside the classic sitcoms. Convinced by his associates that this was a bad idea for Nick-at- Nite, he decided to resurrect it as a stand-alone channel over a decade later. In 1995, Bedol launched his \\"Nick-at-Nite of sports\\" creation, Classic Sports Network. Partnered with Stephen Greenberg, former Deputy Commissioner of Major League Baseball and son of baseball hall of famer Hank Greenberg, the pair raised venture capital funding from Allen & Company, sports and business tycoon Wayne Huizenga, Paul Tudor Jones's Tudor Capital, and others. The network launched May 6, 1995 with a critically acclaimed programming stunt, \\"Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee, 24 hours of Muhammad Ali.\\" Bedol and Greenberg successfully negotiated programming agreements with all of the major leagues, including the NFL, the NBA and Major League Baseball. They also licensed the boxing library of Bill Cayton that included many of the most important fights in boxing history, including those of Ali, Sonny Liston, Sugar Ray Robinson, Jack Dempsey, and Rocky Marciano. Additionally, they broadcast cult classics like Home Run Derby and the Joe Namath Show, a short- lived weekly variety show co-hosted by sportscaster Dick Schaap. Unfortunately for the company, very few people could see the network. Because it was independently owned and not part of a media conglomerate, the roll-out of the network was slow. But Bedol persevered, and raised an additional $20 million from Warburg Pincus to keep the company afloat. An innovative marketer, Bedol recognized the value of using some of the greatest names in sports history to help grow the network. Since he couldn't afford to pay them in cash at the time, he formed the Classic Sports Network \\"Board of Champions,\\" and gave each of its members a slice of equity in exchange for helping to promote the channel. The board's members included Joe Namath, Magic Johnson, Mary Lou Retton, Wilt Chamberlain, Gale Sayers, Ernie Banks, and Ted Williams. The strategy was successful, and Classic Sports Network attracted a lot of attention and favorable publicity. It also attracted some unfavorable attention. After the company rejected Cablevision's approach to acquire the network in 1997, Cablevision decided to launch a competitive service called \\"American Sports Classics.\\" In March, 1997, Bedol and Greenberg filed the first complaint with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under the 1992 Cable Act. Bedol's aggressive response succeeded, as American Sports Classics never launched, and Classic Sports Network was sold to ESPN later that year for around $175 million. Bedol oversaw the integration and transition to ESPN Classic (originally ESPN Classic Sports), and left the company in early 1999. College Sports Television (CSTV) After a hiatus of a few years where he was primarily an investor in early-stage media businesses (See Other Business Ventures), in 2002 Bedol announced that he was returning to the cable industry with a new network featuring primarily college sports, called (at the time) NCSN, or National College Sports Network. It was the first sports network that recognized the power of sports to help promote the cable industry's recently introduced digital programming tiers. Bedol was quoted as saying \\"It's a marketing tool disguised as a programming service. Similar to the Classic Sports strategy, CSTV acquired the television and internet rights to thousands of collegiate sporting events from over a dozen athletic conferences, including the Big Ten, the Southeastern Conference, and Conference USA. Although the events CSTV acquired were not big enough for ESPN or Fox Sports, Bedol was one of the first media executives to recognize the value that could be created from aggregating niches using the internet. CSTV brought the long-tail theory to the internet. The creation of CSTV led to Bedol's selection by Sports Business Journal as one of the \\"20 Most Powerful People in College Athletics\\" in 2004. Later that year, acquired the internet sports division from Student Advantage. This became the centerpiece of the broadband distribution strategy that set apart from all the other players in sports, and established the company as a pioneer in the broadband distribution of live sports. This led to the selecting to distribute the national Men's Basketball Championship over the internet in 2005. The tournament has since become the internet's largest annual online sporting event. Business Week named Bedol to its list of Best Leaders of 2005, Sports Business Journal named him one of the 20 most influential people in online sports, and Sporting News named him to its \\"Power 100\\" list. CSTV was acquired by CBS in 2006 for $325 million, and Bedol was named the President and CEO of the division. Bedrocket and Sportsrocket In 2012, Bedol founded Bedrocket, to invest in, and incubate, digital media properties. Through Bedrocket, Bedol co-founded NowThis News with Ken Lerer. Bedrocket also incubated Sportsrocket, a provider of strategy, technology, and operations to sports rights holders. Sportsrocket created KickTV, in partnership with Major League Soccer, and helped build it into the leading YouTube channel for North American soccer fans. KickTV was sold to Copa90 in 2015. The company also created and operates Network A, a leading global, multi-platform action sports property. Bedrocket has also collaborated on several projects including the digital destination, Flama, with Univision, the first comedy channel on Spotify, Mike Birbiglia's film Sleepwalk With Me and an interactive interview with Jon Hamm for ESPN. Other business ventures Bedol also helped pioneer the trend of sports teams owning their own regional sports networks. As a minority shareholder in the New Jersey Nets, he was a central participant in the negotiation of the deal that led to the formation of YankeeNets, the co-ownership of the New York Yankees and the Nets. He also worked very closely with Allen & Company to develop the media strategy and structure that led to the launch of the YES Network. He also was head of the American-based venture capital group Fusient Media Ventures; Fusient is known primarily for an aborted deal to purchase World Championship Wrestling. In October 2010, he joined the Series A round financing of ticket management software firm, Spotlight Ticket Management.http://www.spotlighttms.com/financing-announcement/ Bedol earned his bachelor's degree from Boston University, and received an MBA from the Harvard Business School.

The following is a list of features which were present in Windows XP but were removed in Windows Vista. Windows Explorer *Windows Briefcase no longer allows synchronizing items across multiple computers and a removable media device. *Windows Briefcase cannot sync files or folders in locations protected by User Account Control. This removes the ability to sync many locations. *Grouping items by name in Explorer no longer groups them under each individual letter of the alphabet (A, B, C... Z) like Windows XP Explorer. When using Group By Name, items are always combined into just a few groups (A-H, I-P, Q-Z). This removes the ability to locate items by their first letter. *If hidden files are not allowed to be shown in Windows Explorer, the Status bar does not report how many hidden files are present. In addition, if all items within a folder are selected at once (by pressing or Select all), the user is not alerted to hidden files being selected. *Even after setting the ForceCopyAclwithFile and MoveSecurityAttributes values as documented in KB310316,How permissions are handled when you copy and move files and folders permissions are not retained/copied when Windows Explorer is used to copy or move objects across volumes or in the same volume.MoveSecurityAttributes not working under Windows 7Permission settings on a folder not being respected A hotfix is available (KB2617058) to restore the MoveSecurityAttributes value but not ForceCopyAclwithFile. *Thumbnails can no longer be forced to regenerate by right-clicking the image and selecting Refresh thumbnail.How do I refresh thumbnails in Windows 7? *Thumbnail support for .HTM, .HTML, .MHT and .URL files has been removed in Windows Vista.HTML Explorer Thumbnails *The Explorer thumbnail handler and metadata property handler for \`.AVI\` and \`.WAV\` files (Shmedia.dll) has been removed. *Ctrl+Enter on the selected folder no longer opens it in a new Explorer window. *Tiles view only shows the name, type and the size of items. It no longer shows information depending on the criteria by which items are sorted. *The Version file properties tab has been replaced by a Details tab that omits custom version information strings, does not show all of the same information as the Version tab and does not support copying any of the displayed information to the clipboard. *Various properties are not visible anymore from the Details tab, such as Audio sample rate and Audio sample size and Channels for certain audio files. *The column by which items are sorted is not highlighted unlike Windows XP. Only the column header is highlighted. * The address bar dropdown displays recently visited folder or file paths typed into the address bar and websites but does not show the complete top level file hierarchy. * Right clicking on the top-left icon of the Explorer window no longer shows the context menu for that folder. It instead shows the window menu just like left click or Alt+Space does. * The top-left corner of the window no longer acts like a draggable icon representing the folder. * The Desktop.ini \`Sharing=0\` parameter which could prevent a particular folder from being shared is not supported.Customizing Folders with Desktop.ini * The Up toolbar button in Windows Explorer, which allowed one to jump to a parent folder in the address hierarchy has been removed. As a result of this, the key combination to open the parent folder in a new window does not work. The keyboard shortcut, , is still available. The link to the parent folder in the Other places task pane has also been removed. The new method of viewing parent folders is to click the respective folder or its dropdown arrow from the breadcrumbs bar. * It is not possible to turn off full row selection in List view. * It is not possible to turn off autorefresh/autosorting of files and folders as sorting is treated as a state instead of as a verb.Sorting is a state and a verb (and a floor wax and a dessert topping) As a result, any file modification activity such as copy-paste, creation, rename or deletion makes items move continually to obey the sort order instead of the items appearing at the end and getting sorted only when the view is refreshed. * It is not possible to set NTFS security ACLs, ownership and audit permissions on more than one selected item using Windows Explorer because the Security tab has been removed from the Properties for multiple selected items.Vista feature regression: \\"security tab\\" missing for multiple selections in Explorer propertiesModify Multiple files' NTFS permissionFolder permissions Microsoft states that this feature was removed as the UAC prompt which may need to be displayed to gain ownership and reset permissions cannot accommodate the names of multiple selected files.How to edit the security attributes of more than one file at a time However, this justification would also apply to all other batch actions on multiple selected files such as setting attributes, using NTFS compression or Encrypting File System where a different UAC prompt is displayed and the batch action is not disallowed. * The IColumnProvider shell extension interface (column handler) has been removed. Shell extensions that display information in Explorer's columns will therefore fail to work.IColumnProvider Interface on MSDN As a result of this API removed, folder sizes cannot be displayed in a column in Windows Explorer Details view. The replacement for column handlers, Property Handlers, cannot be registered for all files.Vista Property Handler for each file stored on mapped drive * It is no longer possible to add a background to folders via a desktop.ini. * Icons of any 16-bit files including New Executables or DLLs are not extracted by Explorer (or any other 32-bit process) even in 32-bit versions, and therefore are not displayed.16-Bit Icons Are So Passé: Windows Confidential – TechNet Magazine The shell's Change icon dialog cannot browse 16-bit icon libraries and DLLs. * The collapsible File and Folder Tasks pane actions have been replaced by the Organize menu which requires an additional click after selecting items. * The navigation pane (tree view) can only be toggled through the Organize menu. The Folders button has been removed. * The Favorites menu has been removed from Explorer (not from Internet Explorer) and replaced by Explorer-specific Favorite Links in the folder navigation pane (tree view). Favorites can now only store folder location shortcuts, unlike the Favorites menu in Windows XP which also supported program and file shortcuts. * The ability to view and edit metadata at the file system level – such as description, author, tags, rating etc. stored in a file's secondary stream – through the \\"Summary\\" tab of the file's \\"Properties\\" dialog was removed.MSDN: Property System Metadata is now stored inside files; however, developers must write a Property handler for any file format in order for users to be able to edit and view its metadata. * There are limitations to opening more than 15 selected files in a single operation, i.e. by selecting more than 15 files and pressing Enter. The \\"Open\\" verb is not present in the context menu when more than 15 files are selected. * Single click to rename after selecting an item is not available in the navigation (left) pane. * Arrows indicating subfolders in the left pane cannot be set to always show. They disappear when dragging and dropping if the user clicks in the right pane before starting to drag to the left pane. * A folder tree does not expand automatically while collapsing the previous one in the navigation pane even after turning on \\"Display simple folder view\\".Description of Simple Folder View in Windows XPMicrosoft is trashing Windows Explorer * It is not possible to display the full path in the title bar when Aero Glass is enabled. When Aero Glass is disabled, the full path can be displayed in the title bar. The full path can be shown in the address bar regardless of the status of Aero, by clicking to the right of the breadcrumbs or pressing Alt+D. * The ability to customize the standard toolbar's layout and buttons was removed. * Users can no longer make the menu above all other toolbars.Registry hack allows menubar to be top toolbar in IE7, not available for Explorer * Ability to add a password to a ZIP file (compressed folder) has been removed. Though this has no effect on third-party compression tools, such as WinZip or 7-Zip, Windows Explorer can no longer open ZIP files that are protected with a password. * Filmstrip view is replaced by the Preview pane; however the state of the preview pane is not saved per folder. It can be globally enabled or disabled. Also, the preview pane does not show previews for folders whereas filmstrip view showed the preview of images within a folder if a folder was selected. Other functions available in filmstrip view such as rotating photos and navigating using Next and Forward buttons are only available in Windows Photo Gallery. * Support for enabling a folder for web sharing with Internet Information Services via the Windows Explorer interface was removed. * The \\"Computer Description\\" field is no longer shown on the Explorer view of a workgroup. It can be viewed from the command line using net view. * The Status bar does not show file information shown in the infotips when the file is selected. It no longer shows the total space used by a folder when displaying a folder's contents. Some file information is displayed in the Details pane. * The drive mapping dialog box no longer allows a network path to be mapped without assigning a local drive letter to it. * It is not possible to view the Properties of an item in the left pane of Windows Explorer using Alt+Enter. * Users can no longer browse a domain or workgroup through a tree view. All computers on the network are displayed in a unified list. The list can be \\"filtered\\" to display only computers from the desired domain, but the list is still populated with all computers on the network, slowing the process. * The ability to undo more than one delete operation has been removed from the Explorer context menu. Only the last delete operation can be undone or redone.One can still undo/redo multiple renames, moves and copy operations from the context menu and older deletes can be undone from the recycling bin or through use of previous version feature. * The file transfer dialogs for copying, moving or deleting do not show the actual file name which is being copied, moved or deleted at that instant. * The File Types tab has been removed from Folder Options. This feature was available from Windows 95 up to Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. The File Types tab allowed users to change the file associations for various types of files. It allowed configuring which application would open when a user clicked on a certain type of file, or allowed manually defining a new file extension, defining/editing custom secondary actions, showing extensions only for specific file types, or customizing the file icon. While there is a more simplified option to change the file associations, called Default Programs in the Windows Vista Control Panel, this option only allows users to change the default action that occurs when they double click a file. It does not allow users to choose which application would load if the user were to right click on a file and then choose a secondary option such as Edit. Manual registry editing or third-party software is now required to choose default programs, change file type icons, and other advanced tasks. The Open With dialog box in Windows Vista also uses the corresponding Default Programs API which limits only one registered application to be set as the default program.File types tab removed * The option on the File Types tab to configure particular file types to confirm open after download and others to open without confirmation after downloading has been removed. * Folders can only display two 3D thumbnails of files within a folder. Previously, up to four 2D images could be shown. Taskbar * The Power icon on the taskbar only appears for laptops and desktop computers with a USB-based UPS. * The Network icon on the taskbar does not give direct access to the connection settings, connection status, firewall settings, or disabling the connection. * The taskbar cannot be resized to zero height, hiding it manually (inexperienced users were often unable to continue using Windows after resizing the taskbar to zero height accidentally). * Toolbars such as \\"Quick Launch\\" can no longer be \\"dragged off\\" the taskbar as floating minibars or docked to another edge of the screen, though physical folders can be dragged onto the desktop edge in a similar manner. The Language Bar is the only toolbar that can float on the desktop. * Double clicking on the Printer icon in the notification area while printing does not open the printer's status window that allows managing print jobs.  Start menu  * Neither the new nor the Classic Start menu shows infotips for folders stored inside the folder's desktop.ini. * The All Programs mode has changed to an inline scrollable menu. As such, it is not possible to expand the All Programs menu in the Vista Start menu into flyout cascading menus. * Subfolders inside the All Programs menu in the Vista Start menu cannot be opened in Windows Explorer by double clicking as was possible with the XP Start menu or Classic Start menu. They also do not expand automatically if the mouse hovers over them (unless working in Windows Classic mode). * Holding down the \`SHIFT\` key while clicking an item to retain the Start menu is not possible in the Vista Start menu. * The Vista Start Menu does not allow expanding Connect To and Printers for quick access to network connections or print/fax devices. * The Log Off confirmation on the classic Start menu has been removed. Other Windows shell and usability features * The setting to configure Recycle Bin maximum allocated size globally (across all drives) has been removed and the equivalent Group Policy is not supported. Recycle Bin maximum size must be configured individually for each drive in MB. * Some functionality of the shell namespace extension for the Downloaded Program Files folder which hosts ActiveX controls is broken. ActiveX controls no longer show \\"Update\\" and \\"Delete\\" context menu verbs when right clicked. As a result, they can no longer be updated or deleted using the Downloaded Program Files folder. * Folders and sub-folders placed inside the Send To menu will no longer cascade i.e. expand as submenus. As a result, it is not possible to group items in the SendTo menu.Why did Vista remove hierarchical SendTo menu items in context menu? * AutoPlay settings cannot be configured per device; they are set globally.TechNet Magazine – Windows Confidential: Looking Smart by Being Stupid * It is not possible to list fonts by similarity based on PANOSE information or hide font variations such as Bold, Italic, etc. in the Fonts folder. * The option to switch between the Windows 2000/XP style \\"Fade\\" animation for menus and tooltips and the Windows 98/Me style \\"Scroll\\" animation has been removed. However, it is still possible to switch between the two options by registry editing.https://www.pcreview.co.uk/threads/switching-between-fade-and-scroll- effects-in-windows-vista.3032542/ * Some functions such as shell execute hooks and named exports have been deprecated or removed from shell32.dll. * The Windows Script Host WshShell.SendKeys() method, as well as the SendKeys() function in development environments such as Visual Basic 6, no longer work on Vista when UAC is enabled. Version 3.0 of the .NET Framework has been updated to work around the issue. * It is no longer possible to copy text fragments and other similar objects from a document, and paste them to a folder as a file (called a shell scrap object or \\"Document shortcut\\", but actually an OLE object).Scrapping the scraps * Active Desktop functionality has been removed. As a result, animated GIF files can no longer be set as the desktop background. No other dynamic web content such as HTML or HTA files can run on the desktop, although Windows DreamScene (released only for Windows Vista Ultimate) allows using videos as the background and dynamic web content can run as part of Sidebar gadgets. * The Snap To mouse pointer option to move the pointer automatically to the default button in a dialog is broken on many system and application dialog boxes and windows in Windows Vista and later. The mouse pointer simply does not move or snap to the default button in several dialogs. Search * Unlike the search feature in Windows XP, Windows Search does not display information about the location being searched in the status bar of Windows Explorer. * It is not possible to perform a case sensitive search using Windows Search. * Unlike the search feature in Windows XP, Windows Search no longer searches an item's NTFS Alternate Data Stream. * The Search Companion is no longer available.  Internet Explorer  * The About Internet Explorer dialog no longer displays the latest installed cumulative update in the \\"Update Versions\\" field. This is corrected in Internet Explorer 9 and later. * The ability to customize the toolbar layout is removed. The position of the address bar and the 'command bar' cannot be readjusted. * Internet Explorer is no longer integrated with Windows Explorer. This can also be seen in Internet Explorer 7/8 on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. * Image toolbar has been removed. Most of the commands that were on this floating toolbar – Save Picture, E-mail Picture, Set as Background, etc. – are now in the context menu that appears when an image is right- clicked. This is same for users with Internet Explorer 7 or higher on other supported Windows versions. * Offline Favorites, a feature that automatically synchronized and stored web pages for later perusal when not online, was removed in favor of using RSS feeds. * The maximum size for the \\"Temporary Internet Files\\" folder (downloaded files cache) is limited to 1024 MB in Internet Explorer 7. This also applies for Internet Explorer 7 on other Windows versions. * Several old and little-used technologies have been removed:Release Notes for Internet Explorer 7 DirectAnimation support, CDF, view-source protocol handlers and 40-bit SSL ciphers. User accounts and winlogon.exe configuration * It is no longer possible to safely relocate the profiles directory (C:\\\\Users) to another partition without using unsupported methods. Microsoft recommends against moving the user profile folder. In Windows XP, the WinNT.sif file allowed relocating \\"Documents and Settings\\" to another partition than C: before Windows installation completed. Subfolders under the user's profile can however still be redirected. Windows 7 further alleviates this issue by introducing Libraries which allow user's data to be located on another partition. * Windows Installer and the Shell in Windows Vista do not support per-user app installs without the need to show the UAC prompt.ALLUSERS property This has been corrected in Windows 7.Authoring a single package for Per-User or Per-Machine Installation context in Windows 7 * Winlogon no longer shows details of password complexity policy requirements due to the removal of GINA.Change/Modify/Edit the failed Password Complexity dialog * The Biologon API to programmatically create a new interactive user session using the InitiateInteractiveLogon function has been removed. * Unlike Windows XP, an administrator can no longer unlock the computer when another standard user has locked it. * Protected Storage (PStore) has been deprecated and therefore made read-only in Windows Vista. Microsoft recommends using DPAPI to add new PStore data items or manage existing ones. However existing applications such as Outlook 2002 which used PStore are unable to save passwords as a result. Any application that tries to create new PStore data items will fail. * Although classic logon and Ctrl+Alt+Del enforcement can be enabled through Group Policy, the classic logon prompt cannot be made to appear by pressing \`Ctrl+Alt+Del\` at the Welcome screen twice. This makes it impossible to logon to a hidden user account while the Welcome screen is enabled (when Classic Logon is not enforced through Group Policy). * Because of the classic logon being removed, domain names are no longer populated on the logon screen and cannot be selected from a drop down list.Vista logon screen does not have drop down menu to pick domains * The ability to run a Control Panel applet as a different user by using Shift+Right click has been removed. * It is not possible to override Autologon and Startup items by pressing the \`SHIFT\` key before logon. The IgnoreShiftOverride registry value is ignored. (This problem may be unique to USB keyboards; see KB977534, KB2526967) * 16-bit applications launched with administrator-level privileges always run in their own memory space, even if launched via \\"Start /Shared\\" on the command line or if the CREATE_SEPARATE_WOW_VDM flag is specified with the CreateProcess() API; 16-bit inter-process communication therefore only works for non-elevated processes, as these can still be configured to run in the same memory space. * The RunAs feature in the shell has been replaced with \\"Run as administrator\\" of User Account Control. The RunAs feature does not allow a local administrator-equivalent command shell to be started except for the Administrator account. * Internet Explorer can no longer be launched from a command prompt started with alternate credentials using RunAs. This is also true for Internet Explorer 7 running under Windows XP (it can, but you must type the complete path to the executable, not just IEXPLORE or IEXPLORE.EXE). * When User Account Control is enabled, any process started with Administrator-level privileges does not inherit the drive mappings of the interactively logged on user, despite the same account being used. This can lead to scenarios where non-UAC processes such as Windows Explorer have access to an application on a network drive, but insufficient permissions to execute it; conversely, the UAC-elevated process has sufficient local permissions, but cannot see the network application. * The GINA library and support for GINA- based authentication has been replaced with Credential Providers so that authentication plug-ins are moved out of the Winlogon process space to the fullest extent possible in order to provide more reliability and consistency.Credential Providers in Windows Vista Consequently, third-party GINA modules must be ported to the Credential Provider model. Credential providers however do not allow customization which GINA allowed. For example, it does not support programmatically using Fast User Switching.Executing a Fast User Switch programmatically – part 2 * Winlogon Notification Packages are no longer supported in Windows Vista.Winlogon Notification Packages Removed: Impact on Windows Vista Planning and Deployment * The logon screen does not show the number of running programs or unread email messages when using Fast User Switching. * The All Users wallpaper can no longer be changed. All Windows Vista machines now show the same wallpaper at the logon screen. * Due to security concerns, the All Users screen saver can no longer be changed. (Replacing the screen saver was a common method of unauthorized privilege escalation in earlier versions of Windows.) * Due to security concerns, system services can no longer natively interact with the user's desktop in Windows Vista. This is a change from all previous NT releases.Vista's Interactive Services Detection Service  ITsVISTA * Cached roaming profiles cannot be deleted directly from the file system as this renders the account unable to logon to the workstation again, even if the account is also removed from \\"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows NT\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\ProfileList\\". The only supported method of manually deleting a roaming profile is via the System applet of the Control Panel or via the commandline DelProf utility, which uses the DeleteProfile() API. * The \\"Network Configuration Operators\\" built-in group no longer delegates permissions to manage system network connections; only system-wide administrator-level permissions can now be used to achieve this. Operations like the \\"Repair\\" action of a network connection can therefore be carried out by an administrator only. * The ability to change the stored password of a domain in Stored User Names and Passwords while the computer is connected to a workgroup has been removed. * The Stored User Names and Passwords credential manager does not accept the \\\\\\\\* syntax which allowed users to wildcard all passwords in a domain.  Win32 console  * The Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) does not support all DOS video modes and therefore DOS-based and Win32 console programs cannot run in full screen mode.Some 16-bit DOS-based Programs and the Command Prompt will not run in full-screen mode in Windows Vista If Windows XP Driver Model graphics drivers are installed, or if booted into Windows safe mode, console programs can be run full-screen, however, Windows Aero is not available. * In previous versions of Windows, it was possible to save different settings for each console window. Windows would ask the user whether to apply settings for the current window or the shortcut that started the window. Windows Vista, however, saves settings for all console windows without asking the user.Command Prompt Properties * Dragging and dropping a folder or file into a Win32 console window no longer pastes the path of the folder or file.Missing Drag and Drop in Vista Command Prompt This no longer works as a result of User Interface Privilege Isolation. Graphics * When using Windows Aero, all GDI, GDI+ and DirectDraw applications run in the new compositing window manager known as Desktop Window Manager. The GDI or DirectDraw render paths are redirected through DWM; however GDI or DirectDraw are not hardware-accelerated when they are redirected.GDI is not hardware accelerated in Windows Vista * The Windows Display Driver Model specification does not support horizontal and vertical desktop spanned modes, that is, stretching the desktop across multiple monitors.Are there Control Panel features that were available under Windows XP that are no longer available on Windows Vista?Stretched Desktop or Spanning Mode Not Available in Catalyst Control Center Under Windows Vista although Dual ViewDescription of DualView in Windows XP is still available.MultiMonitor Support and Windows Vista * In Windows Vista, the Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) does not support two different display adapters. When using two display adapters, both must use the same WDDM driver. Although Windows Vista still supports XPDM drivers, a WDDM driver is required for the Windows Aero user experience.MultiMonitor Support and Windows VistaWindows Vista Display Driver Model * Windows Vista restricts the amount of memory DPMI programs can have to 32 MB (33,554,432 bytes). The limitation applies to DPMI programs running inside NTVDM. The same is not true for previous versions of Windows. * For certain CRT monitors, Windows Vista and later no longer support refresh rates higher than 85 Hz. Audio * The ability to choose a different hardware or software MIDI synthesizer other than the default Microsoft GS Wavetable SW Synth has been removed from the user interface for audio configuration in Windows Vista. A different output MIDI synth or output device port can be selected only by editing the registry or using third party MIDI default output device configuration tools.MIDI and Windows Vista Audio improvements in Windows Vista Even though the default MIDI output device is changed, not all programs that use waveOut MME use the selected MIDI synth; they continue to use the default MS Software Synth. Also, not all MIDI synths are compatible with Windows Vista and later Windows versions. * As DirectMusic was based on DirectSound which is no longer hardware accelerated in Windows Vista, DirectMusic also is software-emulated in Windows Vista.Deciding Whether to Use the MIDI or DMus Port Driver As a result, MIDI playback which is greatly sensitive to latency, timing and CPU usage can be choppy. * Sounds cannot be played for balloon notifications any more. This is corrected in Windows 10 * Sounds do not play for Classic Start menu although sounds have been assigned to \\"Menu command\\" and \\"Menu popup\\" events in Sound control panel. * Some SAPI 5.1 and SAPI 5.2 voices and applications do not work in Windows Vista and later. Only SAPI 5.3 compatible voices and applications work.An error message occurs when you try to run a Microsoft speech-based application in Windows Vista * The controls to adjust per speaker/per channel volume have been removed from the volume mixer. * It is not possible to minimize the volume control window or change its size using Ctrl+S.How to Change the Size of the Volume Control Mixer Window * It is no longer possible to double click the Volume icon in the notification area to show the volume mixer. * The position of the volume mixer window is not saved. * In Windows XP, essentially, audio would be \\"broadcast\\" to all the audio endpoints at once. However, the new audio engine in Windows Vista changes this behaviour. Basically, audio can be sent only to the specific endpoint that the system has set by default, or which the user has configured via the Control Panel setting. Although this new audio behavior provides separate Digital Signal Processing (DSP) capabilities, it is limiting in cases where audio has to be streamed to multiple devices such as headphones, speakers, HDMI out to AV receiver or analog audio to one device and digital to another.Output of analog and digital audio in Windows Vista and Media Center * The ability to customize the Windows startup sound has been removed, although the logon and logoff sounds can still be customized. * Windows Media Center drops support for the Caller ID and Windows Messenger features.What happened to caller ID in Windows Media Center? * In the Sound Control Panel applet, the ability to preview a sound from the Browse dialog box has been removed. * The option to enable or disable digital CD audio is not available in the CD/DVD drive's properties in Device Manager. * The ability to change the recording device to mono mixer or stereo mixer has been removed. * Several features have been eliminated from Windows Sound Recorder, such as the ability to import sounds, change the speed, add an echo, play in reverse mode, insertingfiles or mixing files. * Windows Sound Recorder no longer saves to wave (*.wav*) format anymore. Instead, it saves as Windows Media Audio (*.wma*) format. This is fixed in Windows 10.  Windows Media Player features  * The List Pane no longer allows deleting or editing items by right clicking items. * Categories in the player library such as Music, Pictures, Videos, Recorded TV show limited media information (metadata) columns, relevant only to their content type. In previous versions, all possible metadata columns were shown for all category types. * Buttons to always show full-screen controls, show or hide the playlist while in full- screen mode and directly close Windows Media Player from full-screen have been removed. * Auto sorting in the media library (similar to auto sorting in Windows Explorer) cannot be turned off. * Grouping cannot be turned off. Library content is always grouped by the criteria by which it is sorted. * The ability to add media to the library for searching local or network files and selectively adding only new files or existing files has been removed. Media can only be added from monitored folders. * The seek slider cannot be always shown when playing media. The mouse must be hovered over the progress bar above the playback controls to reveal the seek slider. * The sort order is not preserved in the library like Windows Media Player 10 as long as the player is open. * The file list of selected files has been removed from the Advanced Tag Editor. * Next and Previous buttons to cycle through visualizations have been removed. * Most Auto Playlists included by default in Windows Media Player 10 have been removed. * Library options to configure what action to take when double clicking files (Add to List, Play All, Play Selected Items) have been removed. * The total playlist time is no longer shown in the Now Playing list or in the Library without selecting items. It is only shown in the Library for selected items.Windows Media Player 11 FAQs * Total number of tracks is also only shown after selecting all tracks. The total size in MB is not shown in any view. * The expandable tree view was removed from the navigation pane/left side of the media library. * The Quick Access Panel, located next to the \\"Now Playing\\" tab in Windows Media Player 10 which enabled browsing the library via a pop-up/dropdown menu, has been removed. As an example of this, the library cannot be browsed through a menu and without having to switch to library view. * It is not possible to change the media player's background to black. Instead, the background is a near-white shade of the color chosen in the color chooser. * In previous versions of Windows Media Player, the keyboard shortcut \\"Ctrl + I\\" could be used to capture the frame of video being displayed at the time the shortcut was initiated. This feature was removed for Windows Media Player 11. * The License Management tool available in prior versions of Windows Media Player has been removed since version 11. It is not possible to back up and restore licenses.Windows Media DRM FAQs This prevents users of music download services from directly using Windows Media Player to back up their licenses and restore them to another computer. The user now must depend on the download service being able to assist with re-acquiring that license. Not all services support this so in some circumstances the user could lose the ability to play media which they've purchased for use with Windows Media Player 11. e.g. Walmart states: \\"Important Note: In many cases, we cannot replace song and license files if they are lost. We strongly suggest you back up your music by creating an audio CD or CDs using Windows Media Player 11\\" * Windows Media Player 10, which is downloadable for Windows XP and part of Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 includes the Fraunhofer MP3 ACM codec for ripping to MP3 format. Because of licensing restrictions, Windows Media Player 11 includes only an MP3 decoder, not an ACM encoder.You cannot use the Fraunhofer IIS MPEG Layer-3 codec to create MP3 content * The HighMAT burning capability integrated into Windows Media Player 10 is not available in Windows Media Player 11. * Display Anchor window when in skin mode option has been removed. * Enable picture support for devices option has been removed. * The Ambience, Particle, Plenoptic, Spikes, and Musical colors visualizations have been removed. * The options to use the legacy renderer, overlay mixer, video mixing renderer (VMR-7) or high quality mode (VMR-9) are not available in the Windows Vista version of Windows Media Player 11. The Windows Vista version can use only the Enhanced Video Renderer (EVR). * Support for live scrubbing or live seeking, that is, the ability to show the video frame after seeking with the mouse or after clicking with the mouse while paused is not available in the version of Windows Media Player 11 in Windows Vista and later but is supported in Windows Media Player 11 on Windows XP. * The configuration tab to associate with media file types has also been removed from Windows Media Player 11 options in Windows Vista. * On Windows Vista the ability to remove or reinstall Windows Media Player 11 is not present, as it is integrated with the operating system. * Windows Media Player 6.4 (mplayer2.exe) has been removed like it was removed in Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005. The MCI version of Media Player (mplay32.exe) has also been removed.  DirectX features  * Since Windows Vista features a rewritten audio stack and does not inherit the Hardware Abstraction Layer for audio that was present under prior versions of Windows, there is no hardware acceleration of DirectSound and DirectSound3D APIs. DirectSound and DirectMusic are emulated entirely in software. As a result, hardware accelerated audio and 3D spatialization in games utilizing DirectSound3D is no longer supported. * Direct3D Retained Mode (D3DRM) has been removed.Addressing Application Compatibility in Windows Vista * DirectPlay Voice and DirectPlay's NAT Helper have been removed.DirectX Frequently Asked Questions (Windows) * Some DirectInput functionality (action- mapper UI) has been removed as well.DirectInput ConfigureDevices in Windows Vista * DirectPlay has been deprecated.DirectPlay deprecated * The DirectMusic kernel mode synthesizer that supplies the DirectMusic components with a high-resolution timer has been removed.Timing jitter and clock drift when editing or playing MIDI in Windows Vista * Support for the DirectX 7 and DirectX 8 interfaces for Visual Basic 6.0 is not available on Windows Vista.  Media features  * Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 digital media components such as Windows Audio Converter, Windows Dancer, Windows CD Label Maker, Party Mode, Plus! screensavers and Windows Media Player skins and visualizations have been removed. * Video content support is removed from Windows Image Acquisition for Windows Vista in favor of the newer Windows Portable Devices API.Migrating from WIA to WPD As a result, the Windows Vista version of Windows Movie Maker or other analog video capture software which used WIA no longer supports importing, streaming or capturing analog video over USB or FireWire from such an analog video source as a VCR, an analog camcorder or from a Web camera.Windows Movie Maker no longer supports analog capture or webcam capture Windows Explorer also does not therefore display a webcam preview. Microsoft recommends using DirectShow-based software to capture or stream video from such sources. * Legacy Video for Windows and ACM codecs (Indeo Video, Microsoft H.261, H.263, ACELP.net, G.723.1) are not included. * The Device Manager no longer allows showing and configuring properties for VCM and ACM codecs. * The Windows Media source filter has been removed resulting in MMS: WMV files being unable to be streamed using GraphEdit or other DirectShow applications.Windows Media Source Filter gone in Vista/Win7 – Alternatives?Issues building a streaming filtergraph for wmv in Vista  Setup and servicing  * Windows Vista can no longer be installed on a volume with the FAT file system, although reading and writing FAT data volumes is still supported. * It is not possible to install hotfixes/updates in unattended mode while displaying the progress bar. Updates can only be installed in silent unattended mode. The /passive switch is not supported. * Because of setup design changes for faster installation, it is not possible to slipstream service packs or hotfixes into the core operating system files as was possible with Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 and Windows 2000.Windows Vista Service Pack 1 White Paper Microsoft released an updated Windows Vista disc media that integrates Service Pack 1. However, the updated media is available only to certain enterprise customers, MSDN subscribers and new customers who buy the operating system after the release of SP1; it is not available to pre-SP1 end-users of Windows Vista. As an alternative, Windows Automated Installation Kit (WAIK) can be used to alter the image. * Because of setup design changes, it is not possible to perform an in-place repair reinstall of Windows Vista and later over an existing installation of Windows Vista or later. Any existing data is moved to Windows.old, Users.old folders and previously installed programs need to be reinstalled. * Windows Vista uses Package Manager (Pkgmgr.exe) and Windows Update Standalone Installer (Wusa.exe) to install software updates and hotfixes. However, these do not support the various command-line switches like Windows XP's Package Installer (Update.exe) did.Command-line switches for Windows software update packages Much of the functionality from Update.exe is missing. For example, there is no way to skip backing up uninstall information for hotfixes using the /nobackup or /n switch.Update.exe switches and Package manager As Windows Vista performs no cleanup of operating system files in %Windir%\\\\WinSxS for superseded updates, this folder's disk usage can increase considerably over time. * There is no longer a progress bar shown for each individual downloaded update in the Windows Update UI. There is only a total progress bar. Windows Update also no longer shows a detailed progress of how many megabytes or kilobytes of the updates have been downloaded; it only shows a total size and a percentage of progress completion.  File system, drivers, memory and hardware  * Windows Task Manager no longer shows the peak commit charge. It only shows current commit charge and the maximum limit. * The driver-signing policy post installation is always set to Warn, eliminating the Ignore and Block options that were available in Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Windows 2000.Driver Signatures and PnP Device Installation: Windows Driver Kit * For Plug-and-play hardware which is plugged in after Windows Vista is installed, it is not possible to choose from a list of available staged or on-disk device drivers in the Found new hardware wizard which starts automatically. The Found new hardware wizard automatically searches for the driver and fails if it does not find a driver in the driver store or Windows Update. Only the Update Driver wizard which can be invoked from Device Manager then allows manually choosing a driver from a list. * Windows Management Instrumentation Driver Extensions to WDM are no longer supported. * Unsigned 64-bit kernel-mode device drivers can no longer be installed. * Advanced settings for PS/2 mice such as sample rate, input buffer length and fast initialization are not available in Mouse properties in Device Manager. * Offline Files (Client Side Caching) has been completely rewritten for Vista, dropping backward compatibility of registry configurability XP supported as described in KB811660, dropping API support for various support tools such as CscCmd.exe and CacheMov.exeHow to move the client-side caching (CSC) folder to a new location in Windows Vista in the process. Furthermore, if the cache is encrypted (per the default setting), then multiple users of a machine can no longer make the same file available offline, as the cache is now encrypted by user-specific EFS. *Offline Files cannot be set to automatically synchronize at logoff. This was removed for performance reasons. *Administrator-level access and a reboot are now required to point files pinned in the Offline Files cache to a new location following any change in the UNC path to a network share. * USB devices no longer turn off their indicator light after being safely removed with the icon from the notification area. The USB port to which a device is attached but safely removed still remains powered.The Safely Remove Hardware feature does not stop power from being provided to a USB device in Windows Vista  Boot, shutdown, power management  * The Low Battery Action cannot be set to run an external program any more. * Although the Low Battery Alarm and Critical Battery Alarm sounds were updated in Windows Vista, the operating system's battery meter only displays an onscreen notification when a battery's energy reaches a low or critical level; the use of these sounds is reserved for third-party battery meter applications. Microsoft states that this is by design.http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950161/en-us * Detailed battery information, such as the battery name, unique ID number, chemistry type, and manufacturer information has been removed from Power Options. * There is no longer a built-in graphical user interface to configure boot options. The command-line tool, BCDEdit.exe has to be used. * The Startup Hardware Profiles feature in System Properties has been removed. * Unlike previous versions of Windows, Windows Vista does not display a progress indicator during hibernation. Microsoft states that this is by design.http://support.microsoft.com/kb/958103 Windows Vista does display a progress indicator after resuming from hibernation, but it is an indeterminate progress bar instead of a determinate progress bar used in previous versions of Windows. * Although it is possible to customize the action Windows takes when the hardware Power button is pressed, it is no longer possible to set power options to ask the user every time what action to take upon pressing it. Therefore, selecting a different power action in each case is not possible. * The Shutdown menu has been removed from Windows Task Manager, not from the Start menu. * The Shutdown.exe command line tool no longer displays a real- time countdown timer when the system is set to a timed shutdown or restart. * The \`shutdown\` command-line tool limits the delay option (\`-t\`) to 600 seconds (10 minutes).

In the series, Lelouch is a former prince from the superpower Britannia who is given the power of the \\"Geass\\" by a witch known as C.C. Using the Geass and his genius-level intellect, Lelouch becomes the leader of the resistance movement known as The Black Knights under his alter ego to destroy the Holy Britannian Empire, an imperial monarchy that has been conquering various countries under control from his father. He is voiced by Jun Fukuyama and his younger self is voiced by Sayaka Ohara. Lelouch was designed by the group of manga artists Clamp, who aimed to create a stylish and visually appealing character. The character of Lelouch has been recognized as one of Japan's most popular characters during the time Code Geass aired, appearing at the top of several polls. Publications for anime and manga saw Lelouch as an interesting character. Despite his ruthless methods to destroy an empire, he still has several strong relationships that made him a likeable character. His voice actors Fukuyama and Bosch have been praised for their work as Lelouch's voice. Creation and design Early designs of Lelouch and his alter ego, Zero, (top right), by Clamp. While designing the concept art for Lelouch, the series' original character designers, Clamp, had initially conceived of his hair color as being white. Nanase Ohkawa, head writer at Clamp, said she had visualized him as being a character to which \\"everyone\\" could relate to as being \\"cool\\", literally, a \\"beauty\\". While developing the character during the initial planning stages, the series' core staff at Sunrise, director Gorō Taniguchi, writer Ichirō Ōkouchi, and the production team discussed numerous possible influences for the character with Clamp, such as the Japanese idol duos KinKi Kids and Tackey & Tsubasa. During the early planning stages for Lelouch's alter ego, \\"Zero\\", Clamp had wanted to create a mask never witnessed prior in any Sunrise series. Zero was one of the earliest developed characters. Ōkouchi wanted a mask to be included as a part of the series, because he felt that a mask was necessary for it to be a Sunrise show. In early designs of the character, Zero possessed long silver nails. For the 10th anniversary of the series, Taniguchi decided it was necessary to do further development with Lelouch which lead to the newest film. While the staff believe the franchise will be expanded in following years, they no longer plan to use Lelouch's character. Japanese voice actor Jun Fukuyama said he had no problems in voicing Lelouch for the Lelouch of the Resurrection film in contrast to the television series, finding his character simpler to understand as rather than end the war, Lelouch participated in the film solely to protect his sister. Fukuyama claimed that Lelouch was one of the most successful works in his entire career to the point many people called his work as a masterpiece. As a result, following the ending of the television series, Fukuyama started receiving offers in regards to doing other anime series. He also remarks he had fun working alongside Suzaku's actor, Takahiro Sakurai, whom he looked after due to his experience. Appearances =In Code Geass= First season Lelouch is introduced in the first episode of the series as a student of Ashford Academy, where he is a member of its student council. He accidentally boards a truck used by Japanese resistance operatives. Within the truck is a capsule holding a witch known as C.C. (pronounced \\"Cee Two\\"), who sacrifices herself to save him from the military forces trying to recapture her. When it seems as if her sacrifice was pointless, C.C. offers him the \\"Power of the King\\", the mythical power of Geass. The Geass manifests itself in him as the power of absolute obedience, which allows him to make people obey his orders without question. With his new power, Lelouch begins his rebellion against the Britannian Empire, starting by killing his half-brother, Clovis la Britannia, after extracting information about the murder of his mother, Marianne. He takes up the identity of Zero and later forms the Order of the Black Knights, becoming a revolutionary and gaining popular support amongst the people. The turning point in his rebellion comes when his half- sister, Euphemia li Britannia, declares the region under Mount Fuji the Special Administrative Zone of Japan, giving the Japanese people their name and country back, albeit in a much smaller area. Lelouch confronts her at the opening ceremony and tries to have her shoot him, hoping to make himself a martyr. When she says she plans to give up her royal title, he surrenders and agrees to work with her. However, at this moment his Geass permanently activates without him knowing, and an offhand comment about ordering her to kill the Japanese causes Euphemia to do just that. Lelouch reluctantly kills her and uses the massacre as an excuse to spark the Black Rebellion, in which he declares Japan to be an independent nation and leads an attack on the Tokyo Settlement. The attack goes well at first, but when Lelouch learns that Nunnally has been kidnapped, he abandons the battle, leaving his forces helpless against the better-organized Britannian military. Lelouch makes his way to Kamine Island to search for Nunnally, but is confronted by Suzaku. The second season reveals that Lelouch is defeated by Suzaku, who arrests his former friend and brings him to his father. Akito The Exiled After Suzaku brings Lelouch to Charles, he offers to hand him over on the condition he be inducted into the Knights of the Round, much to Lelouch's dismay. Charles agrees, and uses his Geass to alter Lelouch's mind. With this, Lelouch becomes the empire's Evil Military Adviser, Julius Kingsley, wearing an eyepatch over his Geass. Lelouch makes a few appearances in the miniseries, first seen in Suzaku's custody as he clutches his right eye while begging his friend for water, only to be silently turned down. In his second appearance upon arriving in St. Petersburg, Kingsley proudly declares that the Emperor has placed him in charge of all the Eastern front operational planning for Britannia's military. In the third episode, Lelouch encounters Shin Hyuga Shaing and others for a meeting. In which he tries to arrest the others in his plan. Lelouch showcases a clip to create fear and havoc within the city. Later on, he plays chess along Hyuga, but starts hallucinating Kingsley and past memories from Rebellion. Later on Hyuga figures out that he was both Zero and Lelouch and calls his squad. Suzaku, in an attempt to defend the secret, kills most of the squad whilst Lelouch rips off his eye-patch. Eventually, both are captured, with Hyuga later declaring Kingsley executed and revealing that he is Zero. From here, Lelouch begins to regain his memories in a traumatized fashion, prompting Suzaku to strangle him, until Lelouch begins to cry and beg Suzaku to kill him. They are saved by Rolo Lamperouge, and from there Charles is forced to use his Geass on Lelouch again. This time, he is unaware of his royal heritage or being Zero, but still lives a life strikingly similar to the one he led at the start of the series. Second season A year after the Black Rebellion, after the Emperor wiped out his memories, Lelouch is living as an Ashford student with Rolo Lamperouge assigned to oversee the delusion under the guise of Lelouch's younger brother. Lelouch's memories are restored by C.C., and he resumes leadership of the Black Knights, gaining Rolo's trust in the process. When Nunnally is appointed as Governor of Area 11 and announces her plans to reestablish the Special Administrative Zone of Japan, Lelouch engineers the legal exile of the Black Knights by getting the Britannians to agree to exile Zero in exchange for bringing one million participants for Nunnally's new Japan. The Black Knights escape to the Chinese Federation, where Lelouch begins forging an alliance with the other world powers to create a force that rivals Britannia. He starts by destabilizing the Chinese Federation, returning control to Empress Tianzi from the High Eunuchs. Once Lelouch's new alliance, the United Federation of Nations, is formed, their first act is to liberate Japan. Despite Lelouch's desire to protect his sister, his Geass forces Suzaku to shoot a nuclear weapon, destroying a large portion of the Tokyo Settlement and presumably killing Nunnally. Schneizel then convinces the Black Knights to betray him with a despondent Lelouch willing to be killed by his former comrades, until Rolo sacrifices his life to save him. Lelouch decides to go to Kamine Island and defeat his father. Joined by Suzaku, he learns the truth that his mother faked her death and has been aiding the Emperor in their goal to wipe out individuality from the world. Lelouch, awakening his full Geass powers while rejecting the reality his parents intend, controls the will of the C's World entity itself to erase the Sword of Akasha and his parents out of existence. One month later, Lelouch usurps the Britannian throne and appoints Suzaku as his knight to set the stage for their ultimate plan, the Zero Requiem. As Emperor, Lelouch dismantles the Britannian class system and frees every colony. He then requests that Britannia join the U.F.N, but proceeds to take the council members hostage after it is revealed that Britannia's large population would give him a majority voting block. This brings him into conflict with Schneizel, who has Nunnally in his custody and commands the Damocles (a floating fortress which he intends to place into a position which would allow him to fire nuclear weapons worldwide), and the Black Knights now under Kaname Oghi. In the final battle, as Suzaku fakes his death, Lelouch outwits Schneizel and places him under a Geass command to serve Zero. From there, learning that Nunnally has regained her sight and has been acting on her own plan to unite the world through the fear of the Damocles, Lelouch uses his Geass on her to give him the Damocles' key. With Schenizel and the Damocles both under his control, Lelouch declares himself the ruler of the world. Two months later, Lelouch arranges for the public execution of the Black Knight leaders and the U.F.N. representatives. It is then, as Nunnally, the U.F.N and the Black Knights learn afterwards, that the Zero Requiem's final phase takes place with Lelouch being killed by Suzaku in the guise of Zero. With his death, Nunnally succeeds her brother as Empress and the world unites in a new era of peace and cooperation. In the spinoff OVA, Miraculous Birthday, he briefly uses his power in the afterlife to say goodbye to Suzaku, Nunnally, Rivalz, Nina, and Kallen before departing. Since the end of the anime the show staff have officially confirmed on multiple occasions that Lelouch is truly dead and not immortal because Lelouch paying for his sins through death was their sense of ethics.https://twitter.com/ichirou_o/status/998739444415971328https://twitter.com/ichirou_o/status/998739563676774400https://twitter.com/ichirou_o/status/998739609440862208https://twitter.com/ichirou_o/status/998739723303641095https://twitter.com/ichirou_o/status/998739766987243520https://twitter.com/ichirou_o/status/998739811874689025 One such example was the \\"Geass Memories\\" anniversary twitter event where screenwriter and co-creator Ōkouchi said: \\"At the very least, he should be aware of his sins and atone for them with death. That was the ethical viewpoint of me and director Taniguchi's work.\\"\\"Geass Memories\\" https://twitter.com/ichirou_o/status/998739609440862208 Lelouch of the Resurrection In the events of the 2019 film Code Geass: Lelouch of the Re;surrection, which takes place a year after the events of the recap movies which form an alternate universe, Lelouch's corpse is revealed to have been smuggled away by Shirley and literally resurrected from the dead by C.C. But C.C. reveals that Lelouch lost his memories because his soul is sealed within C's World. Eventually, C.C. manages to finally fully resurrect Lelouch when she helps Kallen, Sayoko, and Lloyd free Suzaku after he and Nunnally were kidnapped by the Zilkhistans who need the latter to restore their country to its former glory. Lelouch momentarily resumes his identity as Zero to rescue Nunnally, bequeaths his alter ego to Suzaku before traveling the world with C.C. under the alias L.L., which according to director Taniguchi was Lelouch's idea of a marriage proposal =In other media= In Code Geass: Lost Colors, the video game for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable, there are several different endings and clips of Lelouch that involve the main character, Rai who joins the same school. Across the game, the player can make Rai befriend Lelouch. Rai can also become Lelouch's best friend as well as Zero's partner. In the video game Another Century's Episode: R, Lelouch makes an appearance in his Knightmare Frame, the Shinkirō. He also appears in the spin-off with his Shinkiro. Lelouch and the rest of the Code Geass R1 cast make their debut to the Super Robot Wars franchise in this game, using their R1 Knightmares. The Code Geass manga follows the same basic plot as the anime, but with several differences. Knightmares do not exist. As for Lelouch's character, he is still the same as he was in the anime. He takes on the identity Zero, but largely focuses on his activities with the Black Knights. Nightmare of Nunnally features Lelouch's transformation into Zero by merging with C.C. This time the Geass grants Lelouch supernatural strength allowing him to battle the Knightmares in hand-to-hand combat. Surprisingly Lelouch knows the same martial arts as Suzaku. After several fights against Britannia, Zero orders the Black Knights to side with the army to defeat the Emperor as Euphemia is due to take over the empire. Once the Emperor is defeated, Zero's death is announced, as Lelouch inherits C.C.'s name and immortality, becoming C.C. The Demon King and goes forth to spread Geass and to promote conflict around the world. In the manga Suzaku of the Counterattack, Lelouch obtains his Geass in the same way as in the anime series, except that his Geass symbol is slightly rendered. Many of the Black Knights are not loyal to Zero and often split off into renegade factions or act without his knowledge. Lelouch is held responsible for a terrorist attack when a Black Knights faction had gone renegade without following his instructions. He later goes to kill his father only to discover that he was already killed by Schneizel, his half- brother; however, it is later revealed to be Schneizel's scheme to get Lelouch executed and to take C.C.'s Code. Near the end of the manga, Lelouch tries to use his Geass on Schneizel, but the latter punctures his left eye, leaving him never to use his Geass again. In Tales of an Alternate Shogunate, set in 1853 at the Bakumatsu Era, Lelouch is the commander of the military counterinsurgence brigade known as the Shinsengumi, formed under the orders of the Shogunate to fight the rebel group known as the Black Revolutionaries, but was secretly the leader of that group as Zero and has gained information from within. The event is set in Kyoto, and Lelouch had recently acquired his geass from C.C. and had stolen Britannian's new Knightmare, Gawain. In a special Code Geass Picture Drama episode, Lelouch appears on December 5 for Ashford Academy's school festival, helping Rivalz, now school president, along with some of his friends. However a battle erupts in school grounds by the Neo- Chinese Federation, led by a former eunuch, whom takes everyone hostage. With help of his friends, Lelouch manages to stop the Federation soldiers. In the aftermath, the entire episode is revealed to be a dream which the ghost of Lelouch used to thank everyone.Code Geass: The Miraculous Birthday (コードギアス 反逆のルルーシュ キセキの誕生日, Kōdo Giasu: Kiseki no Tanjōbi) In a special OVA parody episode, based on the Alice in Wonderland story, Lelouch is narrating the story and appears in the role as the Mad Hatter.Code Geass: Nunnally in Wonderland Character outline Lelouch vi Britannia is the son of the Emperor of Britannia, Charles zi Britannia, and the late Imperial Consort Marianne, making Lelouch the Eleventh Prince of the Holy Britannian Empire. He was seventeenth in line to the Imperial throne prior to his mother's assassination, an event which also left his sister blind and crippled. His father banished him and his sister Nunnally to Japan, where they were used as political tools. It was during his stay at the Kururugi household that he first met Suzaku Kururugi, who would later become his best friend. His mother's death and his father's apparent unconcern about it were huge blows to Lelouch. He always felt that it was unfair for both his mother and sister, and therefore made it his goal to pursue a better world for Nunnally. He also seeks to discover the true reason for his mother's death, as she was murdered in the Aries Imperial Palace, a place terrorists would be unlikely to penetrate successfully without being noticed, if at all. Lelouch is an individual who is calm, sophisticated, and arrogant due to his aristocratic upbringing. At school, Lelouch conducts himself as a sociable, likeable, and often easy-going student; however, in reality, this is a mask to hide his true nature. As Zero, his true nature is expressed. His charisma and beliefs in justice gain him the trust and respect of many soldiers and leaders. Lelouch possesses very strong philosophical beliefs, which define both his actions and his motivations. Perhaps his most notable is that he rejects his father's beliefs of Social Darwinism. He believes the world can live in cooperation rather than through conflict and struggle. To achieve this aim, he believes that the ends justify the means; he is willing to commit acts of evil to bring down a worse evil in the process, and is always focused on getting results regardless of the methods used. Lelouch also has strong beliefs concerning death and killing, thinking that a person should only kill if he is prepared to die himself. =Abilities= Lelouch's Geass, given to him by C.C., grants him \\"the power of absolute obedience\\", allowing him to plant commands within a person's mind upon eye contact, similar to extreme hypnosis. Activation of his Geass is visually represented by the manifestation of a Geass sigil in his left eye. Commands dictated in this state are written into the minds of anyone he makes eye contact with. The people under this power obey Lelouch's orders to the best of their ability. Once it is cast, the orders can neither be changed or canceled, nor can the subjects resist its absolute influence. Also, Lelouch can only cast Geass on a person once; afterward, the power won't work on them anymore after its conditions have been fulfilled, unless their initial command has been removed by a Geass canceler. Even without his Geass, Lelouch is a formidable opponent. Having a peerless intellect, he is capable of devising and executing plans and strategies with fantastic speed and precision. He rarely battles opponents directly. Instead, he usually attacks with coordinated groups or armies focused under his direct command. He thinks of his battles as chess games, at which he is a masterful player, always beating anyone who played against him. Lelouch often gambles on his chess games against Britannian nobles and other skilled players as a pastime as a student. As a teenager, he makes use of his masterful skills as a commander in real battle, predicting enemy movements and giving orders on how to respond to forces at his command, and utilizing traps and schemes that were strategically put in place to destroy the enemy. In contrast, his physical state is poor; however, he displays above-average hand–eye coordination, both with firearms and the keyboard-based control system of the Shinkirō. Lelouch is also shown to be very charismatic and persuasive, his beliefs in justice able to win the support of the populace through well-delivered speeches combined with his ability to make miracles through superior strategic planning. In episode 14 of R2, V.V. remarks that Lelouch is a lot like his father. Lelouch's Knightmare, the Shinkirō Lelouch usually operates standard Knightmares, but pilots such as Suzaku and Cornelia, both of whom are masterful pilots who use faster and more advanced models, are commonly able to overwhelm him in single combat. Lelouch is typically accompanied by Kallen, who serves as his personal guard. After stealing the advanced model, the Gawain, Lelouch co-pilots it with C.C., controlling the weapons and command functions while C.C. handles navigation and flight, until it was lost in the ocean, when trying to deal with Jeremiah. After the Black Knights are exiled from Japan, Lelouch pilots the Shinkirō, which has the strongest defense of any Knightmare, but it requires an intellect of his level to perform the complex calculations needed for it to be effective. Reception =Popularity= Lelouch's character has been well received by viewers of the series, appearing in various anime polls. Lelouch was voted the most popular male character of 2006, 2007, and 2008 in Animage magazine's annual Anime Grand Prix and Newtype magazine named him the best anime male character of the decade. In the Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation Awards from 2008, Lelouch was nominated as one of the best male characters. In 2014, NTT customers voted him as their 13th favorite black haired male anime character. His voice actor Jun Fukuyama also won the \\"Best Actor in a Leading Role\\" award for his portrayal of the character at the first Seiyu Awards in 2007. Fukuyama's work as Lelouch's voice actor also lead him to win the Tokyo International Anime Fair in the category \\"Best Voice Actor\\". =Critical= Critics for anime and manga series have also commented on Lelouch's character. Anime News Network's Carl Kimlinger stated that Lelouch \\"is hard to like\\" because of his narcissistic personality, but noted that his bonds with Nunnally and his friends make up for that. Bamboo Dong from the site agreed with Kimlinger, though noted that Lelouch' made the character interesting to watch. Gia Manry from the same site listed Suzaku and him as the third best \\"frenemies\\" in anime due to how their friendship falls apart as a result of their rivalry. Mostly positive response were given by Danielle Van Gorder from Mania Entertainment due to Lelouch's differences from most of anime's protagonists and how his double life as a Zero and as a student is shown across the series. Chris Beveridge from the same site praised Lelouch's actions in R2 when he becomes Britannia's Emperor, describing him as \\"the classic angle of the villain with good motives\\" because of the dangerous actions he does for a greater good. Beveridge also commented on his confrontations with Scheizel and Nunnally, mentioning the rivalry across the series in the former and citing the latter as heartbreaking. Johnny Yong Bosch's work was also the subject of praise. IGN compared him with Light Yagami from the Death Note series, due to his double life and his questionable methods, respectively. The double life aspect has also been praised due to how such change also differentiates the show's tone from a high school comedy to an action show, and how he \\"winds-up\\" between his two selves. Moreover, his reasons for evil actions have also been found to help viewers to like the character. Also from IGN, Ramsey Isler found Lelouch's double life trait as rather comical as after short prologue of his role as Zero in an episode, he is seen doing homework at school for being absent to classes. Kevin Leathers from UK Anime Network enjoyed Lelouch's personality as his cold persona made the series \\"refreshing\\" from other mecha anime. Lelouch is ranked 23rd on IGN's 2009 list of best anime characters of all time, and 18th on IGN's 2014 list. The Fandom Post noted that Suzaku and Lelouch's relationship might attract female viewers so he recommended an anthology manga to them, praising the multiple designs presented. Kotaku enjoyed both Lelouch's and Suzaku's traits due to how both of them consider themselves evil, resulting in the series achieving an appealing ending due to how the duo orchestrate Lelouch's death in order to bring peace to the chaos they created. In regards to his role in Lelouch of the Re;surrection, Anime News Network noted that while the film centers around the multiple consequences of Lelouch's actions across the television series in regards to the returning cast, he was not the main character, as instead, the narrative focused more on C.C. Nevertheless, the writer noted that one of the biggest mysteries behind the film that people wondered was if Lelouch revived something that might have ruined the television series' ending. The Fandom Post commented that when reviving, with it being the thing he was looking forward the most, Lelouch retains his old traits such as his love interests and his bond with Suzaku. However, he still found his ending with C.C too abrupt despite feeling appropriate at the same time. On the other hand, Kotaku criticized his role in the OVAs Akito the Exiled due to their lack of relevance.

A total of six seasons of the series have been released: five seasons on the internet, and one season on television. In 1999, the crew began the series with a pilot episode, named \\"Banjo Frenzy\\", which featured a blue dinosaur, a sky blue squirrel, a yellow rabbit, and a purple beaver. The first official episode was named \\"Spin Fun Knowin' Ya!\\", which aired on Christmas Eve of that same year, and featured later versions of the dinosaur, rabbit, squirrel, and beaver, and – from that point on – the crew began introducing new characters to the show. It quickly became an internet phenomenon featuring millions of visits per episode. In 2006, the Happy Tree Friends television series aired on G4 in the United States. It also aired on G4 and Razer in Canada in 2007. A spin-off called Ka-Pow! debuted on September 2008. In 2010, after airing fifteen episodes for the third web season, a hiatus began, in which there were only Break shorts airing with a subliminal message at the end of each, which reads \\"Happy Tree Friends is dead!\\". This situation concerned many fans because they thought that the series were going to end soon. The writers confirmed that they were playing a joke on the fact that the characters die a lot, making a pun phrase with the word \\"dead\\". The hiatus ended on December 8, 2011, allowing the series to return once again with the fifteenth episode of the third season, named \\"Clause for Concern\\". In addition to the show's five seasons and a spin-off, there have been some special episodes and shorts. These include eleven \\"Smoochies\\", ten \\"Kringles\\", thirteen \\"Break\\" shorts, five \\"Love Bites\\", and sixteen other irregular episodes that are unindexed. The \\"Smoochie\\" shorts involve three different items being dropped next to a main character, only for them to be killed in three different ways, each regarding the item. These have been adapted into the Happy Tree Friends website where one can choose an item to drop. The \\"Kringle\\" shorts are Christmas-themed shorts that feature the main characters doing various Christmas-related tasks, only to be killed in various ways. The \\"Love Bites\\" were Valentine's Day-themed shorts, that went with the basic structure of a Happy Tree Friends episode. The \\"Break\\" shorts were produced in 2008, when no new episodes were produced until the following year. A new break short debuted in 2009.

It was founded in the 5th century. Nothing is heard of the diocese or of its bishops after the sixth decade of the 6th century. The time and reason for its cease is speculative.Cf. Compagnoni, p. 159. Cappelletti, VII, p. 470. It was contained within the Papal States. The diocese was always immediately subject to the Holy See (Papacy). The effort to revive the diocese of Cingoli was begun during the reign of Pope Innocent XIII, the initiative coming from the town of Cingoli itself.Cappelletti, pp. 566-567. Having received their memorial, on 26 August 1721, the Pope requested from Cardinal Orazio Spada his comments on each of the items mentioned by the Public of Cingoli.Rafaelle, Delle Memorie, Parte Prima Num.

Unfortunately Pope Innocent died on 7 March 1424, before the bulls could be prepared. The matter was left to the new pope, Benedict XIII (Orsini). In 1725, by virtue of the Bull \\"Romana Ecclesia\\" of 19 August 1725, Pope Benedict XIII revived the diocese of Cingoli, and united it aeque principaliterEach diocese remained separate from the other, but they shared one single bishop. with the Diocese of Osimo to form the Diocese of Osimo e Cingoli.Rafaelle, Delle Memorie, Parte Prima Num.

On 28 September 1972, Archbishop Carlo Maccari of Ancona and Numana was named Bishop of Osimo; no mention is made of Cingoli.Acta Apostolicae Sedis 64 (1972), p. 645.

On 19 March 1984, on the recommendation of the Episcopal Conference of the ecclesiastical province of Picenum, and by order of the Congregation of Bishops of the Roman Curia, the diocese of Cingoli was enlarged by the addition of five parishes which had belonged to the Archdiocese of Camerino.Acta Apostolicae Sedis 76 (1984), p. 910. The diocese of Macerata e Tolentino, Recanati, Cingoli, e Troia, in its current configuration was established in order to conform to Italian civil law which was embodied in the Concordat between the Vatican and the Italian Republic of 18 February 1984. After extensive consultations, Pope John Paul II decreed that the status of the bishop governing several dioceses aeque personaliter was abolished, and that the Diocese of Macerata-Tolentino was merged with the Diocese of Osimo e Cingoli, the Diocese of Recanati and the Diocese of San Severino (Treia) to form a single diocese, albeit with a long name. The changes were embodied in a decree of the Sacred Congregation of Bishops in the Roman Curia, promulgated on 30 September 1986.Acta Apostolicae Sedis 79 (1987), pp. 729-732.

His photographs illustrate his material. Life Robert F. Burgess was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on November 30, 1927. He built his first diving gear out of a World War II gas mask, 50 feet of air hose, and an air compressor to explore a Michigan shipwreck in 1944. At the end of World War II, he served as a ski trooper with the 88th Infantry Division named the Blue Devils by the Germans, and took his GI Bill abroad, studying French first at the Berlitz Language School in Trieste, Italy, and later at the University of Neuchâtel in Switzerland. During this time he skied the Alps as part of the University's athletic program. Returning to Trieste to sell his German Amphibious Jeep, he and a companion purchased an Italian Lambretta motor scooter and rode it back to Switzerland, crossing the Great St. Gothard Pass and two other major mountain ranges at night. For their summer vacation he and a companion moved to Italy's Island of Capri for three months where they learned to skin dive. After studying abroad he returned to the U.S. to complete his education, majoring in Journalism at Michigan State University. Then, moving to Florida he wrote and photographed features for every major U.S. outdoor magazine including several abroad. With his new bride, Burgess returned to Switzerland in 1956. In Milan they purchased an Italian Lambretta motor scooter that winter, riding it 700 miles, across the Rivieras to Spain, where they took a ferry to the Balearic Islands. They wintered on the island of Majorca, where he fished with Majorcan trawler fishermen, gathering material for a novel. That spring they ferried to Valencia and motor scootered across Spain to Madrid, where he and his wife lived for the next 3 years. While there Burgess wrote his first novel and numerous travel articles for periodicals in England, Spain and America. During that time, on assignment for \\"Argosy\\" Magazine, he and a companion crossed the Mediterranean aboard a freighter with the French Foreign Legion, then back- packed through Tunisia to find and climb Hill 609, a fortified German mountain fortress during World War II. Returning later to the U.S., he served as editor for the \\"Florida Outdoors Magazine\\" wrote free-lance features for sport diving and sport fishing magazines throughout the country, and for the last 20 years has contributed articles on these subjects as Editor-At-Large for the \\"Florida Sportsman Magazine\\". Over the years Burgess has written and published over twenty books on such subjects as sharks, shipwrecks, underwater archaeology, treasure diving, cave diving, travel, and Ernest Hemingway (whom he met in Pamplona during that author's last Pamplona fiesta). In January 1994, Scuba Schools International awarded Robert Burgess their most prestigious award, given only to divers with verified log books who have met or exceeded all their requirements, including at least 5,000 dives, to achieve the elite SSI rating of Platinum Pro 5000 Diver. Robert F. Burgess lives in north Florida, where he continues to write magazine articles and books.

Flaviano Tomb of Pope Gregory XII, S. Flaviano The Diocese of Recanati was a Roman Catholic diocese in Italy. It was founded in 1240 by Pope Gregory IX.Leopardi, p. 26. Eubel, Hierarchia catholica I, p. 410, note 1 (stating that the bull was dated 4 July 1240). Its principal church, S. Flaviano, was raised to the dignity of a cathedral on 21 December 1239, and separated from the jurisdiction of the diocese of Osimo. The diocese of Osimo was suppressed, having chosen to support the Emperor Frederick II against the pope.Cappelletti, Le chiese d' Italia VII, pp. 197-198, quoting the bull in full. On 22 May 1240, the Castello di Recanati was raised to the dignity of a city by Gregory IX.Leopardi, p. 26. During its early history it often lost and regained its episcopal status due to Papal politics.Umberto Benigni (1911). \\"Recanati and Loreto.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911; retrieved: 6 February 2019. On 27 July 1263 the diocese was completely suppressed by Pope Urban IV in the Bull Cives Recanatensis, due to its support of Manfred, who claimed the Kingdom of Sicily.Pope Urban IV, \\"Cives Recanatenses\\", in Bullarum diplomatum et privilegiorum sanctorum Romanorum pontificum Taurinensis editio, Tomus III (Turin 1858), pp. 697–698 (in Latin). History Pope Sixtus V was greatly devoted to the cult of the Virgin Mary and the Holy House of Loreto, purported to be the house in Nazareth in which the Virgin Mary was born or lived, and which was transported by angels to Tersatto, Croatia, in 1291.Pope Sixtus himself states in Pro excellenti § 1: in cuius medio inest illud sacrum cubiculum divìnis mysteriis consecratum, in quo dicta Virgo Maria naia fuit, et ibidem ipsa, ab angelo salutata, Salvatorem Mundi de Spiritu Sancto concepti, ministerio angelorum illuc translatum; et ad dictam ecclesiam, ob miracula, quae in dies omnipotens Dominus , intercessione et meritis eiusdem B. Mariae Virginis, in eodem cubiculo operari dignatur.... These legends can only be traced back to the 14th century. Loreto was an eccclesiastical territory belonging to no diocese and directly subject to the Holy See (Papacy). Pope Sixtus conceived of a plan to honor the Virgin by exalting the town where her shrine was located. On 17 March 1586, he decreed, in the Bull Pro excellenti, that the town (oppidum) of Loreto should be raised to the status of a city (civitas), and that the city should become the center of a diocese, with its seat at the Basilica of the Virgin Mary. To provide territory to support the apparatus of a diocese, the already existing diocese of Recanati was suppressed, and its territory was transferred to the new diocese of Loreto. The cathedral of Recanati was demoted to the status of collegiate church. Bishop Galeazzo Moroni, the Bishop of Macerata who was also Bishop of Recanati, was released from his connection to the diocese of Recanati. Sixtus went even further. He wanted Loreto to enjoy the prestige of being a festival city. He had already, on 7 July 1590, ordered the Auditor of the Rota for Macerata to police and restrict the festivals associated with the grain harvest and the wine harvest.Bullarum diplomatum et privilegiorum sanctorum Romanorum pontificum Taurensis editio Tomus IX, p. 358: committimus et mandamus ut feriarum dies, tam messium et vindemiarum quam aliis anni temporibus in rubrica introductos, praeterquam in honorem Dei ac Sanctorum ex praecepto S. R. E. indictos, cum mercantilium et aliarum quarumcumque causarum expeditioni opus fore aut expedire iudicaveris, moderari, restringere iisque ad tui libitum derogare debeas.... He also he intended to transfer the annual fair of Recanati to Loreto. The bull was ordered, but Sixtus died before it could be finished or executed.Leopardi, p. 201. Recanati sent ambassadors to his successor, Pope Urban VII, to congratulate him and to complain about Sixtus' injustices, but the new pope died after only thirty days in office.Leopardi, p. 201-202: debeant nomine publico reddi et restitui Ecclesiam Cathedralem jam translatam in Ecclesiam Lauretanam, cum omnibus suis introitibus, et cum Gabellis in Civitate Laureti, et Territorium, indebite et injuste, et absque aliqua culpa, defectu, sive demeritis nostrae Civitatis ablatas per Sixtum Papam V. The next pope, Gregory XIV was favorable to the idea of the restoration of the diocese of Recanati, but reversing the actions of a previous pope required subtlety and preparation. He therefore appointed a commission of cardinals, which agreed to reverse the acts of Sixtus V almost completely. The Administrator of Loreto, however, intrigued and eventually got Gregory XIV to appoint a second commission, which was agreed to restore the bishopric of Recanate, but not its territory. In the meantime, Pope Gregory died on 15 October 1591.Leopardi, p. 202, with note 1. The next pope, Innocent IX, immediately proposed in Consistory the restoration of the diocese of Recanati, and on 19 December 1591 issued the decree. But Innocent died on 29 December 1591, and the bull remained unsigned. Pope Innocent VIII was elected on 30 January 1592, and on 9 February he issued the bull which restored the diocese of Recanati and united to it the diocese of Loreto, to form the Diocese of Recanati-Loreto.Leopardi, p. 203. In implementing the Lateran Pact of 1929, it was necessary that the Holy See (Papacy) make extensive changes in the status of the diocese and sanctuary of Loreto. The Holy Shrine was to be placed under the direction of the Holy See, but that presented a problem, since the Basilica was the seat of the bishop of Recanati e Loreto; the seat had to be removed.Lateran Pact, Article 27: The basilicas of the Holy House in Loreto, of San Francesco in Assisi and of Sant'Antonio in Padua with the buildings and annexed works, except those of a merely secular nature, will be sold to the Holy See and their administration will be freely assigned to the Holy See. The other bodies of any kind managed by the Holy See in Italy as well as the colleges of missions will also be free from any interference by the State and by conversion. However, Italian laws concerning the purchases of moral bodies remain applicable. Pope Pius XI, therefore, in the Bull Laurentanae Basilicae of 15 September 1934, suppressed the diocese of Loreto and removed the seat of a bishop from the basilica.Pius XI, \\"Lauretanae Basilicae\\", Acta Apostolicae Sedis 26 (Citta del Vaticano 1934), pp. 578-579: Quapropter, suppleto, quatenus opus sit, consensu interesse habentium vel habere praesumentium, Apostolicae potestatis plenitudine, episcopalem cathedram in Basilica Lauretana exsistentem supprimimus; atque eamdem Basilicam aedesque continentes, ab Ordinarii Recinetensis et Lauretani iurisdictione in omnibus exemptas, Nostrae Ipsius iurisdictioni directo subiicimus.... The relationship of the bishop between his dioceses of Recanati and Loreto aeque personaliter was dissolved, and the diocese of Loreto was incorporated into the diocese of Recanati. The current Bishop of Recanati, Aluigi Cossio, was to be called the bishop of Recanati-Loreto, for the time being.\\"Lauretanae Basilicae\\": Suppressa autem cathedra Lauretana, et ipsam Lauretanam dioecesim, quae hucusque cathedrali Ecclesiae Recinetensi aeque principaliter unita'exstitit, eidem dioecesi pleno iure in perpetuum incorporamus, eius titulo tantum servato; propterea Episcopus Recinetensis pro tempore exsistens Episcopi Recinetensis-Lauretani titulo fruetur. On 11 October 1935, the Roman Curia's Consistorial Congregation published a decree, stating that Pope Pius XI had ordered that the jurisdiction of the Administrator of the Pontifical Basilica of Loreto should extend to the city of Loreto and the surrounding district, in which the jurisdiction of the bishop of Recanati-Loreto was to be suspended as long as papal administration applied. The bishop of Recanati thus lost part of his diocesan territory, and Loreto's obligation to contribute to the bishop's income was terminated. Sacra Congregatio Consistorialis, \\"Pontificiae Administrationis Lauretanae decretum\\", Acta Apostolicae Sedis 26 (Citta del Vaticano 1934), pp. 71-73: benigne statuit ut iurisdictio Administratoris Pontificii Basilicae Lauretanae ad territorium Lauretanae civitatis eiusque districtus, iuxta praesentes fines civiles, quod ad dioecesim Recinetensem-Lauretanam pertinet, exstendatur, totaliter suspensa proinde, durante Administratione Pontificia, super eodem territorio, iurisdictione Ordinarii Recinetensis-Lauretani. On 30 September 1986 it merged with the Diocese of Macerata-Tolentino, the Diocese of Osimo e Cingoli and the Diocese of San Severino to form the Diocese of Macerata- Tolentino-Recanati-Cingoli-Treia, abolishing the status aequaliter principaliter, resulting in there being one diocese and one bishop.Congregation of Bishops, Decree Instantibus votis, Acta Apostolicae Sedis 79 (Citta del Vaticano 1987), pp. 729–732. (in Latin) The changes were made necessary by a legal agreement between the Holy See and the Italian State: Quod autem effecit ut haec studia adhuc magis urgerent atque opportuna evaderent, vis legis fuit die 3 iunii 1985 normis tributa, quae recentioribus Pactis initis inter Sanctam Sedem et Gubernium Italicum continentur ; quibus quidem normis statuitur hinc « Circumscriptionem dioecesium (...) ab auctoritate ecclesiastica libere constitui » (art. 3/1 Pactorum diei 18 februarii 1984); illinc vero dioeceses iure canonico constitutas adipisci posse, iuridicam personalitatem in iure civili italico (cf. art. 29 Normarum quae approbatae sunt per Protocollum diei 15 novembris 1984). =Chapter and cathedral= The bull which created the cathedral of S. Flaviano in Recanati did not mention the new cathedral Chapter. In a document of 10 September 1256, however, appear the signatures of Paolo di Tedelgardo, Prior of the Chapter, and ten Canons. In an act of 14 April 1290 appear the signatures of Archdeacon Corrado and sixteen Canons.Ughelli, I, p. 1217. Leopardi, p. 35-36. When the diocese was restored and made part of the Diocese of Macerata e Recanati in 1356, the Cathedral of Macerata had an Archdeacon and eight Canons, while the co-cathedral in Recanati had a Provost and eight Canons. The Provost of Recanati was also Archpriest of the cathedral. In the mid-fifteenth century the Chapter of Recanati was again headed by an Archdeacon, but in 1467 the archdeaconate was suppressed, and the principal dignity of the Chapter was again the Provost.Leopardi, pp. 36-37. The archdeaconate was restored in 1518, by Bishop Luigi Tasso (1516–1520), who also issued new regulations for Canons and Altaristi.Vogel, p. 266. When the seat of the bishop was in Macerata, the services in the Cathedral of S. Flaviano in Recanati were maintained by the College of Mansionarii (Altaristi), fourteen in numberLeopardi, p. 38, 40. In 1682, the Chapter of Recanati had four dignities (Provost, Archdeacon, Archpriest, DeanLeopardi, p. 37, 39-40.) and twelve Canons, while the Chapter of Loreto had four dignities and seventeen Canons.Ritzler-Sefrin, Hierarchia catholica V, p. 330, note 1. In 1746, the Chapter of Recanati had four dignities and eighteen Canons, while the Chapter of Loreto had four dignities and twenty Canons.Ritzler-Sefrin, Hierarchia catholica VI, p. 354, note 1. There had also been a College of Canons at the church of S. Vitus, but in 1461 the Canons were assimilated to the cathedral Chapter. Their Cantor, however, did not become one of the Canons.Vogel, p. 215. =Synods= A diocesan synod was an irregularly held, but important, meeting of the bishop of a diocese and his clergy. Its purpose was (1) to proclaim generally the various decrees already issued by the bishop; (2) to discuss and ratify measures on which the bishop chose to consult with his clergy; (3) to publish statutes and decrees of the diocesan synod, of the provincial synod, and of the Holy See. John Paul II, Constitutio Apostolica de Synodis Dioecesanis Agendis (March 19, 1997): Acta Apostolicae Sedis 89 (1997), pp. 706-727. Bishop Rutilio Benzoni (1592–1613) held a diocesan synod in Loreto on 21 September 1588, after having made a general pastoral Visitation of the entire diocese. He held a second synod on 24 November 1592.Leopardi, pp. 204-206. Vogel, pp. 366-367. Benzoni held a synod at Recanati on 24 November 1609, in which he appointed a committee to revise the calendar of saints' days for the diocese; the calendar was published in 1611.Vogel, pp. 373-375. Cardinal Agostino Galamini (1613–1620) held a diocesan synod for Recanati on 14 November 1614, and for Loreto on 23 November.Vogel, p. 379. Cardinal Giulio Roma (1621–1634) held a synod at Recanati on 29 January 1623; in accordance with the decrees of the Council of Trent, the offices of Theologus and Penitentarius were established in the cathedral Chapter. He held another synod on 15 November 1632, and again on 18 April 1633. He presided over a synod at Loreto on 8 January 1626, regulating clerical discipline and the operation of the Choir of the Basilica.Vogel, p. 384. Bishop Ciriaco Vecchioni (1767–1787) presided over a diocesan synod at Recanati on 29 April—1 May 1781, and had their constitutions published in 1782.Vogel, p. 424. Bishops =Diocese of Recanati= Latin Name: Recinetensis Erected: 1240 *Rainerius (1241–1244?)Raniero had previously been Bishop of Osimo (8 September 1240). He was appointed by Pope Gregory IX on 17 January 1241. Osimo was punished for its support of Frederick II by the loss of its bishopric. The date of the termination of his tenure is unknown; the bull of appointment of his successor remarks that the diocese had been widowed for some time.

Some dependoparvoviruses are also known as adeno-associated viruses because they cannot replicate productively in their host cell without the cell being coinfected by a helper virus such as an adenovirus, a herpesvirus, or a vaccinia virus. Species There are currently ten recognized species: *Adeno-associated dependoparvovirus A, the type species *Adeno-associated dependoparvovirus B *Anseriform dependoparvovirus 1 *Avian dependoparvovirus 1 *Chiropteran dependoparvovirus 1 *Pinniped dependoparvovirus 1 *Rodent dependoparvovirus 1 *Rodent dependoparvovirus 2 *Squamate dependoparvovirus 1 *Squamate dependoparvovirus 2 Virology Dependoparvoviruses have an icosahedral shape, measure 22 nm is composed of 60 wedge shaped proteins triangulation number = 1). Three proteins (VP1, VP2 and VP3) are present in each capsomere. Each capsid is made from 5 VP1, 5 VP2, and 50 VP3 proteins. The capsid does not have an envelope. The genome is a single molecule of single stranded DNA with a length of 4.7 kilobases. It has only two open reading frames. The 3' open reading frame is the structural capsid protein, cap, which can be spliced to form two RNAs, one for virion protein 1 (VP1) and the other goes on to eventually make VP2 and VP3. The second gene, rep, can be spliced into four different, nonstructural, regulatory proteins that all aid in the genome replication. These proteins are named Rep 78, Rep68, Rep 52, and Rep 40 based on their molecular weight. Due to inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) at each end of the genome, a T shaped secondary structure is formed. The complementary areas leave a 3' hydroxyl group single stranded for the replication to begin. This 3' hydroxyl group is used as a primer for the leading strand synthesis. Both positive and negative sense strands of DNA are made. Double stranded intermediates are formed throughout the replication; this means the two strands, positive and negative sense, will be matched up. Host range These viruses are capable of replication within all vertebrates. They are only limited by the virus they must infect with, also known as the helper virus. These helper viruses are necessary for the replication of a dependoparvovirus. A common helper virus in humans is the adenovirus. Gene therapy Dependoparvovirus is not infectious enough to trigger an immune response; this makes it a good virus to use as a gene therapy tool. Gene therapy is a possible treatment for a variety of disorders and diseases that are genetic in origin. Viral vectors are currently being developed to transport genes into human cells. Since this virus does not stimulate an immune response it can be used multiple times effectively without being neutralized before infection . Another reason these viruses are reliable vectors is the known insertion point for the genome. This virus always inserts its contents into the same place on chromosome 19. This predictability can cut down on the chances of inserting into an important area that might disrupt normal gene function or increase the risk of developing cancer. At this time, one challenge using this virus as a therapy tool is the fact that the genome is fairly small. With less than 5kb in the genome the amount of genetic material that can fit into the capsid is limited. Work is currently being done to increase the amount of information this vector can deliver. This may be accomplished by the ITRs found at both the 5' and 3' end of the genome. Since the ITRs have the same sequence they will leave complementary strands exposed if they are removed. The complementary strands can undergo recombination and join two 5kb inserted fragments together.
