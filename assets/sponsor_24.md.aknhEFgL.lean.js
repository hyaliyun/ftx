History =Establishment of the Parish= The first colonists living in what was then called \\"Mystic Side\\" attended the church in Charlestown, which forced the settlers to make a long journey, including taking a ferry. At the time, only church members were freemen and constituents of the body politic. As the ability to vote was tied to membership in the church, the residents of Mystic Side were eager to establish their own church; and gathered themselves in 1648, despite not having the permission from the General Court to assemble. Corey, Deloraine. 1898. History of Malden. In 1650 the Parish ordained its first regular minister, Marmaduke Matthews. Matthews had been preaching in Hull, Massachusetts but had lost the favor of the freemen there, and thus his ordination in Malden was opposed by the other churches and by the magistrates of the General Court. Matthews was ordained while the General Court sought to hold public inquiry into his \\"erroneous expressions, others weak, unconvenient and unsafe expressions\\" in his preaching. As a result of this conflict with neighboring churches, the historical record suggests that Matthews was lay- ordained, instead of ordained by the elder Charlestown congregation as was customary. The second ordained minister to preach in Malden was Michael Wigglesworth, a preacher and poet who was renknowned for his scriptural poem The Day of Doom. Recent Years The congregation unanimously called the Rev. Otto O'Connor as its settled minister in 2017, making him the 36th settled minister. In line with other member congregations of the UUA, the congregation adheres to the Unitarian Universalist faith and affirms the Seven Principles of Unitarian Universalism.

It is also known as Mess Hall (former). It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004.  History  Cockatoo Island became a gaol in 1839, following advice by New South Wales Governor George Gipps to the British Secretary of State for the Colonies that convicts would be sent to the island after the closure of the Norfolk Island convict establishment. The convict buildings (see also Prison Barracks Precinct, Convict Barracks Block, Military Guard Room and Biloela House) was built over several years, the buildings beginning to be occupied from October 1841. Quarrying of grain silos (at the Underground Grain Silos and Biloela House) was one of the early convict activities. In order to service Royal Navy ships, the Fitzroy Dock was built on the island and completed in 1857. Cockatoo became the major government dockyard in Australia. In 1869 prisoners were transferred from the island to Darlinghurst, and the prison buildings became an industrial school for girls and a reformatory from 1871. The dockyard area was now separated from this institutional area on the top of the island by a fence. Following the departure of the females in 1888, prisoners were again sent to the island, and the gaol function continued until about 1909. Meanwhile, the dockyard function expanded, and the Sutherland Dock was built in 1890. The NSW Public Works Department declared Cockatoo the state dockyard. In 1913 Cockatoo became the Commonwealth Dockyard, and the island, both through ship-building and servicing, played an important role both in the development of the Royal Australian Navy and during the First World War. The former prison buildings were now used for office purposes. From 1933 the dockyard was leased from the Commonwealth by Cockatoo Docks and Engineering Co Ltd and the island played a very significant role during the Second World War. After the war the dockyard (now known as Vickers) continued, and submarine facilities were introduced. The dockyard closed in 1992, and there was some demolition. Sale of the island was proposed. The island is now vested in the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust. The mess hall was built after Gother Kerr Mann was appointed engineer on the island (Commanding Royal Engineer Colonel George Barney had designed the earlier buildings). Construction took place between about 1847 and 1851. The mess hall was built west of the convict barracks and, with walling to the southwest and northwest, completed the enclosed nature of the convict precinct. Following the industrial school and later prison period, and after the Commonwealth took over, the mess hall was altered for office purposes and the windows were enlarged. The building though is generally intact. The mess hall and the other convict-era buildings form the only remaining imperial-funded (as opposed to colonial) convict public works complex in New South Wales and form one of the most complete groups of convict structures in Australia.  Description  Mess Hall is a part of Prison Barracks Precinct, Cockatoo Island, Sydney Harbour. The mess hall is a finely detailed sandstone building, which was originally freestanding. With its fine gable and east end, it is a dominating feature in the precinct. On the ground floor, openings are square, while on the upper floor (above simple verandah supports on timber posts) are two attic windows with rounded heads. The gabled roof is clad with corrugated iron. The style is Old Colonial/Victorian Georgian. = Condition = The 1997 Conservation Management Plan noted that the roof of the central hall would require renewal, that some repairs had recently been made internally (but that more work was needed) and that the tie-rods in the roof trusses might need re-tightening. As at May 2001, the mess hall was substantially intact, and the stonework was in mainly good condition with the interior being generally satisfactory.  Heritage listing  The Mess Hall was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Processes The mess hall, completed c.1847-51, is historically highly significant for its association with early convict administration in the Australian colonies. It is also associated with the other phases of Cockatoo Island's history, as an industrial school for females and as a major shipyard. Criterion B: Rarity The building is part of a group of convict buildings which is the only remaining imperial convict public works complex in NSW, and is one of the most complete groups of convict structures in Australia. Criterion D: Characteristic values The mess hall is also an important example of the Colonial/Victorian Georgian style of convict structure of the period. Criterion E: Aesthetic characteristics The mess hall, with its fine detail and dominating gabled design in Old Colonial/Victorian Georgian style, has architectural significance and makes an important aesthetic contribution to the precinct. Criterion F: Technical achievement The mess hall, with its fine detail and dominating gabled design in Old Colonial/Victorian Georgian style, has architectural significance.

After the war, he remained in communist Czechoslovakia and became an advocate for Czech-German reconciliation. Life Holzer was born into a Jewish family of Czech origin in Kobersdorf, Austria-Hungary (now Austria), in 1902. In 1919, following the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Holzer elected to become a citizen of the new country of Czechoslovakia. He graduated with a degree in engineering, but continued to live in Austria, where he served on several volunteer fire brigades. In 1936, he moved to the town of Kolín and opened a firefighting business with a friend from Austria. After the German invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1939, Holzer managed to hide his Jewish heritage for some time, despite the fact that he was religious, because his business partner did not betray him. After the business partner was decapitated by a wire laid by Czech resistance operatives in 1940, Holzer went into hiding, but was eventually discovered and deported as part of the Aufbaukommando to Theresienstadt concentration camp in late 1941, becoming the head of the firefighting and air raid department. Theresienstadt was largely used as a transit camp for deporting Jews to Nazi ghettos and extermination camps, but as a member of the Aufbaukommando and important functionary in the camp, Holzer was protected from deportation. Under his leadership, the fire brigade helped control the flooding on the nearby Elbe river and repair buildings after storms. They also put out fires set by drunken SS men. Using his influence in the camp, Holzer recruited members of the resistance into the fire brigade to prevent their deportation; he later estimated that half of firefighters were engaged in resistance activities. Holzer saved Siegfried Lederer from deportation for almost two years in this way. Lederer was eventually deported to Auschwitz in December 1943, but escaped the following April in order to warn the population of Theresienstadt that deportees faced mass murder in gas chambers. However, the leadership of the Theresienstadt resistance (including Holzer) ultimately decided to suppress the report because they feared it would lead to disorder and catastrophe. Nevertheless, Holzer and other fire brigade members helped Lederer smuggle weapons and a radio transmitter into the concentration camp. In the last days of the camp's existence in April and May 1945, it was feared that the Germans would attempt to murder the remaining inhabitants. Holzer and the fire brigade threatened resistance with hoses and other improvised weapons. After liberation, Holzer returned to Prague and married Wilma; both were the only survivors of their families. About 40,000 Czechoslovak Jews had declared themselves ethnic Germans on prewar censuses, of whom about 3,000 survived the Holocaust. These Jews were targeted for deportation during the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia; Holzer was one of the few allowed to remain. He chose not to emigrate after the 1948 Communist takeover and worked as a factory manager. Unusually, Holzer was not subject to strict travel restrictions that the Communist regime imposed on most of its citizens and frequently visited Western Europe. He had many friends from his firefighting activities, and worked on Czech-German reconciliation. The Austrian government granted him a small pension in 1967 in recognition of his pre-war firefighting career; Holzer was allowed to receive the money in a blocked foreign account, which he used to fund his foreign travels. When he died in January 1989, the Czech government allowed his foreign friends to attend his funeral.

It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004.  History  Cockatoo Island is the largest island in Sydney Harbour. It is not known who first called it Cockatoo Island, though it was known as such long before it was called Biloela. This name was given to the island in 1870 by the Reverend William Ridley, a student of an Aboriginal language, in response to a request from the Governor for a suitable name. The island has been subject to five major administrative/occupation phases. = Prison Dockyard 1839-64 = The expansion of settlement 1810-20 under Governor Macquarie led to the construction of places of confinement including Norfolk Island and Macquarie Harbour. Assigned convicts were left under the control of landowners but convicts in government service and secondary offenders in penal settlements were housed in barracks as soon as these could be constructed. In time the settlements on Norfolk Island and in Tasmania were defeated by isolation and the inability of Sydney and Hobart based administrators to exercise adequate control. In 1839 Governor Gipps advised the Secretary of State for the Colonies that he was forming an establishment on Cockatoo Island for Imperial prisoners withdrawn from Norfolk Island. Unlike contemporary New South Wales (NSW) penal establishments which were executed under contract, the work on Cockatoo Island was carried out by the prisoners. Expenses were met from Imperial, not Colonial, funds emphasising the role of the Imperial Government in the establishment of Cockatoo Island. The buildings were constructed to the design of the commanding Royal Engineer, George Barney, responsible for convict and military buildings in NSW. Twelve grain silos were also cut out of the rock in 1839 to store grain, following Gipps' order that the government would make provision for the storage of 10,000 bushels on the island within two years. The year 1839 also saw the expansion of the island's convict gaol with the construction of the barracks; U-shaped in plan, the barracks held accommodation for 344 convicts. As transportation ceased in 1840 the prison was used to house an increasing number of colonially sentenced convicts. As the island was surrounded by deep water it was ideal for maritime activities as a British outpost at a time of increasing rivalry between European nations and the United States of America in the Pacific Ocean. In 1846 Governor Gipps reported to the British Government that convicts would be employed in clearing and preparing the island for the construction of a dry dock. Approved in 1847 the colonial government built Fitzroy Dock between 1847-57 with convict labour. The first ship, HM Surveying Brig Herald, docked in 1858. Gother Kerr Mann, one of Australia's foremost nineteenth century engineers, was responsible for the design and construction of Fitzroy Dock, the first begun in the southern hemisphere and contemporary with Mort's Dock at Woolwich. Captain Gother Mann was Engineer in Chief at Cockatoo Island from 1847 and later became Superintendent of Convicts. During this time additions were made to the gaol including an ornate mess hall and houses for prison officials including Biloela House for the prison governors. This period was also one of brutality against any unrest from the prisoners leading to a Select Committee of Inquiry chaired by Henry Parkes in 1861. The brutalising conditions of the Island were admitted but no discernible improvements occurred. Up to 500 prisoners were held there but the usual number was about 250. Officers' accommodation was erected in the 1840s-50s including superintendents quarters, clerk of petty sessions, military officers quarters and quarters for the free overseer. = NSW Department of Public Works 1864-1913 = During this period the administration of the dockyard and prison split. The land above the escarpment remained in institutional use but, as the docks expanded, the foreshores became dedicated to dockyard use. During the latter part of the nineteenth century Sydney's population increased rapidly producing a poorly educated, dysfunctional, community. Punishment, reform and education became key concerns. Cockatoo Island is associated with this period through the training ship Vernon and the establishment of the Girls Institution and Reformatory from 1871-88. In 1871 the training ship Vernon for boys, an initiative of Henry Parkes, was anchored at the north-east corner of the island with recreation grounds and swimming baths by 1896. Although the young prisoners were kept separate from the dock they worked there on ship building and repairs. From 1861 dock development had occurred with the first stone workshop buildings for metal working, foundry and general activities, drawing and administrative offices. In 1868 Fitzroy Dock was reported to be the third most important dry dock in the country after Mort's Woolwich dock and the Australasian Steam Navigation Company works in Pyrmont. By 1870 a new dock was recommended at Cockatoo Island by Captain Gother Kerr Mann. While this was being debated the male prisoners were transferred to Darlinghurst gaol from the island in 1871. During the 1870s the Underground Grain Silos were pressed into service for water storage. In 1869 the Executive Council had approved the transfer of prisoners from Cockatoo to Darlinghurst; the prison buildings subsequently became an Industrial School for Girls and a Reformatory in 1871. However, overcrowding elsewhere forced the return of male prisoners and the barracks were divided between prisoners of both sexes. The new dock, approved in 1882, was longer than any existing in the world. This dock, the Sutherland Dock, built by private contractors and free labour, eventually cost and was completed in 1890. The tender was awarded to twenty-three year old Australian engineer Lewis Samuel. New workshops were also built with wharfage for repair work. However, during the 1880s prison accommodation continued to deteriorate and the number of prisoners declined to about 100 each, male and female. In 1888 the girls departed and the establishment was again proclaimed a prison. Further additions included a fumigation building, surgeon's consulting rooms and isolation cells were added in 1897 with stone quarried on site. Although the prison was condemned in 1899 by the Public Works Committee it remained in operation. Electricity was installed in 1901, the birth year of the new independent nation, the Federation of Australia. As British control ceased in 1901 the NSW government took over with further building of workshops in corrugated iron on steel frames forming additions to the original stone workshops. The dockyards expanded rapidly. Major new workshops were provided, now largely in brick, along the eastern shore with docking wharves and included an erecting shop, foundry, blacksmith and shipwright shop. In 1903 a Royal Commission was established to look at all aspects of the working of the Government docks and workshops. In 1908 a steel foundry was established on the Island followed by a range of new workshops. By 1905 parts of the men's prison quarters collapsed so that in 1906 they were transferred to shore for the last time and relocated at Long Bay Gaol. The female prison division was similarly closed in 1909; NSS Sobraon, the school ship, was given to the Royal Australian Navy in 1911 and became HMAS Tingira.Bastock, Australia's Ships of War, p. 64 = Commonwealth Dockyard 1913-33 = In 1911 the Royal Australian Navy was established and in 1913 the Australian Government bought the island from NSW for pounds. Despite the building expansion from 1900 much of the dock and workshops equipment was in poor shape and major expansion and upgrading of equipment was increased. Development occurred on the escarpment above the dockyard. By 1912 a lift had been constructed up the escarpment with most of the structures in the centre of the island demolished and replaced by more efficient structures. The prison buildings were converted into drawing offices and new boiler and turbine shops added. The old power house, containing a steam driven dock pump and consisting of a brick building with columns and arches attached to the facade, was demolished. The new larger power house and chimney built in 1918, which still stands, provided for steam turbine electric generating equipment, electrically driven air compressors, dock-dewatering pumps and hydraulic pumps. The Australian Government had ordered several naval vessels in 1912, including the cruisers HMAS Brisbane and HMAS Adelaide each of 5,600 tonnes and 25,000 shaft horse power (18,650kw) and several destroyers. One of these, HMAS Heron, was handed over in February 1916 to become the first steel warship to be built in Australia. No 1 slipway was lengthened whilst the Brisbane was being built for its launching in 1915 and the floating crane Titan was assembled from British-made sections. Little further development occurred between the wars. As naval activity decreased, commercial shipbuilding grew until the Depression when all activity declined. Under Navy control until 1921 it was then placed under a Board of Control responsible to the Prime Minister's Department soon superseded by the Australian Commonwealth Shipping Board. During the 1920s, in addition to industrial structures, three pairs of houses were erected on the island. In 1928 the Sutherland Dock was enlarged and a decision made to lease the dockyard to private enterprise. = Cockatoo Docks and Engineering 1933-48 = In 1933 the island was leased to Cockatoo Dock and Engineering Company Ltd (later Pty Ltd). With the outbreak of World War Two the island became the major ship repair facility in the Western Pacific, following the loss of Singapore. Major repairs and fitting out were undertaken at the docks including work on troop carriers, the RMS Queen Mary and RMS Queen Elizabeth, RMS Aquitania and RMS Mauretania and major vessels of the Royal Australian Navy and United States Navy. Two tunnels were constructed during the war under the plateau to improve material movement on the island. New buildings were erected throughout this period. The war years, 1939-46, saw the reconstruction of roads and the construction of a new road giving access to the upper part of the island. Six wharves, once covered by five ton and fifteen ton travelling cranes, were available for berthing ships for fitting out or refitting. The maximum depth of water alongside wharves was about 26ft. The Titan, a 150 ton floating crane commissioned in 1917, was another important facility. During the war period it operated almost continuously. It was used for commercial as well as naval work and dealt with numerous lifts of heavy and important equipment in the port. The workshops included the engineering shop, the electrical section, the tool section and the sheet metal section and a well equipped standards room and meteorology section. The yard's own quality control section operated above and beyond the normal navy overseeing staff. In 1947 Vickers UK purchased Cockatoo Dock and Engineering Pty Ltd and established Vickers Cockatoo Docks and Engineering. = Vickers Cockatoo 1948-92. = In 1950 the Australian Commonwealth Shipping Board ceased to function and was replaced by the Cockatoo Island Lease Supervising Committee. The top level of the island had by now drawing offices for each of the hull, engineering and electrical sections, the estimating, planning and costing offices and residences for several of the executive staff of the yard. More recently, two large concrete water towers were constructed on the plateau and several brick and concrete buildings were added to the southern and eastern shores. In December 1992 the original lease expired; the island is still owned by the Commonwealth. Between 1992-93 some forty buildings were demolished. Several other structures are no longer extant.  Description  Cockatoo Island Industrial Conservation Area is about in Sydney Harbour, between Birchgrove Point and Woolwich Point, comprising the whole of the Island to low water. Cockatoo Island contains a wide variety of extant buildings and structures which contribute to the cultural landscape. The vistas to and from the island play an important role in the character of the setting. The island's present landform has been developed through quarrying and landfill with natural elements limited in extent and profile. The cultural landscape is articulated by man-made cliffs, stone walls and steps, docks, cranes, slipways and simple built forms. A number of areas or precincts have been identified within the cultural landscape.Godden Mackay 1997:43 These include the area of the Colonial Prison, the Docks precinct, the timber boatbuilding and workshops precinct, the docks workshops precinct, the powerhouse and slipways precinct, the technical offices and workshops precinct and the residential precinct. The building types and architectural styles generally reflect the administrative/occupation period in which they were constructed. = 1839-1864 = Construction generally occurred on the upper parts of the Island and included the prisoner's barracks 1839-42, mess hall 1847-51 and the military guard house of 1842 in the Colonial Georgian style and the two storey military officers quarters 1845-57 and the free overseers quarters 1850-57 in a restrained Victorian Georgian style all in the local sandstone. To the east residential buildings include the superintendent's quarters (Biloela House) c 1841 and the clerk of petty sessions residence c 1845-50 and a number of smaller structures characterised by their simple plans, stone walls and hipped or gabled roofs. Among the latter is the former iron and steel foundry erected c 1856 as a sandstone machine shop. Other items include the in-ground water tanks and grain silos the (former) engine house and workshop and the rock cut Fitzroy Dock or No 2 Dock; length 474ft maximum beam of vessel Fitzroy Dock, which could be docked 48ft maximum draft 18ft (at high water at ordinary spring tides). The dock retains its entrance caisson in place. Associated with the construction of the Fitzroy Dock is the engineers and blacksmith's shop of c 1853 in the Victorian Georgian style. This building is one of the earliest surviving industrial structures on the island and a vital feature of the nineteenth century industrial environment of Sydney. The associated two storey boilers, pumping engines and offices building was erected c 1845-57 in the Victorian Georgian style; the primary building housed the Fitzroy Dock pumping station from 1853. = 1864-1913 = Less built development occurred during this period with new uses accommodated through adaptation and alteration. Additions were made to the dockyards and several new warehouses built. These include a Federation style brick and stone building, as well as a combination of steel framed and clad buildings on the east, south and west sides of the Fitzroy Dock. The latter include the mould loft, the shipwrights shed, the pattern storage buildings. The powerhouse built with Sutherland Dock at the western end of the Island was replaced in 1918 by the present Federation Warehouse style power house on the docks. Sutherland Dock, or No 1 Dock, completed 1882-90 has a length of 690ft, a breadth of 88ft and a depth over the sill of 32ft. At high water of ordinary spring tides, the maximum breadth at which a ship could be docked, was 85ft. The largest ship accommodated was the QSMV Dominion Monarch, 26,500 tons, 620ft x 84ft 10 inches. The heavy machine shop of 1896 abuts the engineers and blacksmith's shop of 1853. Other warehouse type structures which survive from this period include the boiler house of 1908, the engine house of 1909 and the coppersmith's shop. = 1913-1947 = Substantial built development took place during this period related to the expansion of the dockyards. Several larger scale industrial warehouse buildings were erected in the centre of the island on the site of the former Biloela Female Gaol. These buildings are primarily steel framed with corrugated galvanised iron cladding. Extant buildings of this type include the estimating and drawing offices 1915-18 and the electrical shop 1915-16. Other buildings were constructed in the dockyards area; these appear to have been subsequently demolished with the exception of the Federation styled timber vernacular administration buildings to the south. The powerhouse of 1918 in the Federation Warehouse style is constructed of load bearing brickwork below a steeply pitched gabled roof. The powerhouse chimney remains in place. Residential buildings in the western part of the higher ground include primarily Federation style semi-detached structures executed characteristically in red brick with tiled roofs. These semis have been extended with fibro additions. A two storey semi 1913-16 to the north is more impressive in its architectural expression and features sunhoods, decorative eaves and balustrades. During the Cockatoo Docks and Engineering Phase (1933-48) numerous warehouses were built which dominate the lower levels of the island. These are predominantly steel framed and clad with corrugated iron sheeting. Other structures are related to the importance of local river traffic on the surrounding waterways; the Parramatta Wharf turnstile shelter of 1945 is one of these. The muster station of 1945 is a reminder of the post war operation of the dockyards. Other structures, including air raid shelters and administration buildings, are evidence of the importance and operation of the island during the hostilities of World War Two. = 1948-92 = Numerous warehouses were built during this phase. Many are steel framed with corrugated iron sheeting cladding. A group of red brick warehouses with curved roofscapes were constructed primarily after World War Two. A group of international style buildings at the south-eastern corner of the dockyards forms a distinct group. Among the latter is the former weapons workshop of 1971. In addition to the standing buildings described above the island contains numerous items of remnant equipment. Significant items include two Belliss and Morcom steam engines, lathes, planing equipment, hydraulic presses, plate bending machinery, boring machines, rivet presses, threading machinery, plate rolls, steam hammers and cutting equipment. The only building which retains its equipment intact is the powerhouse; equipment includes the dewatering system, the air compressors, the hydraulic pumps and the mercury rectifier bank used to convert AC to DC. The dockyard areas include a steam-driven rail-mounted jib crane of mixed parentage (possibly 1870), electric travelling portal jib cranes and long jib cantilever cranes of the 1920s, electric travelling jib cranes of the 1940s, fixed tower cranes of the 1960s and electric portal jib cranes of the 1970s. The waterfront areas also accommodate wharves, slipways and shipbuilding berths. Among the latter are shipbuilding berths No 1 and No 2, slipways 3 and 4 and the 250 ton patent slipway. Smaller slipways include a boathouse slipway, yacht slip and an unmarked slipway. The cruiser wharf No 2 of 1914 (demolished 1999) is constructed on timber piles and was used to unload items for the island and for fitting out ships built in the yards. Wharf No 3 the Bolt Wharf is a concrete wharf erected in the post war period 1945-60. Destroyer Wharf (demolished 1999) is based on an old stone lined wharf of 1891 below the present timber wharf of c 1914. The nearby Ruby Wharf and Steps is a timber longshore wharf on piles which includes a set of timber steps to water level; the original Ruby steps below the present structure date to c 1853. Other wharves and jetties include Camber Wharf, Timber Wharf, Patrol Boat Wharf, Sutherland Wharf, Old Plate Wharf, Patrol Boat Jetty and New Plate Wharf. Other elements associated with the transport of goods and materials include remnant trolley tracks, tunnels, roads (the Burma Road) and stores tunnels. Cockatoo Island has substantial standing and sub-surface archaeological features associated with the above. Some areas of the island are likely to contain stratified material while other areas of the foreshore may contain buried early structures such as wharves and jetties. = Condition = All but the most significant items of plant and machinery were sold in 1991 and all industrial buildings not of exceptional significance were sold in 1992. The demolition removed some forty buildings from the island, mostly in poor condition. These were mainly warehouse type buildings with pitched roofs, clad in steel. Other demolished structures included ancillary and small industrial buildings. Several other structures are no longer extant including Fitzroy Wharf, Coal Wharf and a number of slipways.  Heritage listing  Cockatoo Island Industrial Conservation Area was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Processes Cockatoo Island is important for its association with the administration of Governor Gipps who was responsible for the establishment on the Island of an Imperially funded prison for convicts withdrawn from Norfolk Island in the 1840s; the establishment of maritime activities during the 1840s culminating in the construction of Fitzroy Dock 1851-57 under Gother Kerr Mann, one of Australia's foremost nineteenth century engineers; and the construction of twelve in-ground grain silos following a government order that provision would be made to store 10,000 bushels of grain on the island. The subsequent development of shipbuilding and dockyard facilities has clearly been in response to Federation in 1901, when the New South Wales government took over management of the island; the formation of the Royal Australian Navy in 1911; and the Commonwealth Government 's purchase of the island in 1913. The first steel warship built in Australia, HMAS Heron, was completed on the island in 1916. During World War Two Cockatoo Island became the primary shipbuilding and dockyard facility in the Pacific following the fall of Singapore. Post war development of the facility reflects the importance of the island facility to the Australian Government. Criterion B: Rarity Cockatoo Island is the only surviving Imperial convict public works establishment in New South Wales. Individual elements of the convict Public Works Department period include the rock cut grain silos, the Prisoners Barracks and Mess Hall 1839-42, the Military Guard House, the Military Officers Quarters and Biloela House . The range of elements associated with the shipbuilding and dockyard facility date from the 1850s and include items of remnant equipment, warehouse and industrial buildings and a range of cranes, wharves, slipways and jetties which illustrate the materials, construction techniques and technical skills employed in the construction of shipbuilding and dockyard facilities over 140 years. Individual elements within the dockyard facility include Fitzroy Dock and Caisson 1851-57, Sutherland Dock 1882-90 the Powerhouse 1918, the Engineer's and Blacksmith's Shop and the former pump building for Fitzroy Dock. Criterion D: Characteristic values The industrial character of the cultural landscape of the Island has developed from the interaction of maritime and prison activity and retains clear evidence of both in a number of precincts. The cultural landscape is articulated by man made cliffs, stone walls and steps, docks, cranes, slipways and built forms. Extant structures within the precincts are important for their ability to demonstrate: the functions and architectural idiom and principal characteristics of an imperial convict public works establishment of the 1840s; and the functions and architectural idiom and principal characteristics of the range of structures and facilities associated with the development and processes of the dockyard and shipbuilding industry over a period of 140 years. The range of elements associated with the shipbuilding and dockyard facility date from the 1850s and include items of remnant equipment, warehouse and industrial buildings and a range of cranes, wharves, slipways and jetties which illustrate the materials, construction techniques and technical skills employed in the construction of shipbuilding and dockyard facilities over 140 years. Criterion H: Significant people Cockatoo Island is important for its association with the administration of Governor Gipps in the 1840s, the construction of Fitzroy Dock from 1851-57 under Gother Kerr Mann, Federation in 1901, the formation of the Royal Australian Navy in 1911 and the construction of the first steel warship built in Australia, HMAS Heron.

He is best known for the large murals he painted on the walls of Detroit institutions, such as “The Life & Times of Frederick Douglass,” at the Detroit Public Library’s Frederick Douglass Branch, and “Renaissance City,” at Cass Technical High School. He also painted portraits of prominent figures like singer and civil rights activist Paul Robeson. Biography Foster was born in Detroit on May 8, 1925, and lived there his entire life, except for a brief time when he studied art in Europe in the 1940s. Foster began drawing at age five or six, and was an exceptional art student, recognized by teachers and peers at an early age. “I was nice up until I was 12,” he recalled, “then all hell broke loose. I was possessed by demons...and one way to exorcise those demons was to paint.” In 1939, at age 14, he won first prize at an exhibition of the Pen and Palette Club, a training and studio space for black artists sponsored by the Detroit Urban League. He was the youngest member. At the Pen and Palette Club, Foster studied with Hungarian artist Francis de Erdely, who was renowned for his skill in figure drawing. Foster went to Cass Technical High School and also studied at Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills. Through the help of his teachers at Cass, he received a scholarship to study at the Society of Arts and Crafts (now the College for Creative Studies), where he studied under painter Sarkis Sarkisian. After that, Foster spent time studying in Europe, at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière in Paris, and the Heatherley School of Fine Art in London. Foster was gay, and according to friends was “frank about his sexual persuasion,” despite the hostility towards homosexuality at the time. Several younger artists remember him as a positive role model, and parties that he threw at his studio were widely attended. Also, one of his good friends and patrons was Ruth Ellis, notable Detroit LGBT activist. Arts career Foster has been referred to as “Detroit’s Own Michelangelo,” and was considered by friends to be “the dean of black artists in Detroit” at the time., He came to be known around the city as an artist with a mastery of human anatomy, an excellent portrait painter, and, perhaps most widely acknowledged, a public muralist with a commitment to African- American history and culture. In 1958, Foster helped found, with artists Charles McGee and Henri Umbaji King, the Contemporary Studio on the John C. Lodge Expressway. The popular studio, part of a burgeoning network of local black artists, was the brainchild of Henri King and Harold Neal, along with 15 other artists, many of them alumni of the Society of Arts and Crafts. Foster’s time studying at the Society under Sarkis Sarkisian linked him with many of Detroit’s most active black artists who Sarkisian had also mentored. In 1965, Dr. Charles H. Wright, who would become Foster’s friend and patron, established the International Afro-American Museum (now the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History), where Foster would serve as Artist-in- Residence. By 1962, the Negro Digest reported that LeRoy Foster had already won four prizes at the annual Michigan Artists Exhibition at the Detroit Art Institute and had sold more than two hundred paintings. In 1968, Foster was featured in a traveling exhibit at the Detroit Institute of Art, alongside other prominent African-American artists such as Ernest G. Alston, sculptor Oscar M. Graves and Hughie Lee-Smith. In 1972 Foster painted one of his most well-known murals, the 10’ x 12’ “Life and Times of Frederick Douglass,” which was installed the next year in the Frederick Douglass branch of the Detroit Public Library. The painting is based on the 1859 meeting in Detroit of Frederick Douglass and John Brown, shortly before Brown’s raid on Harper’s Ferry, and also portrays Douglass’s life at several different stages. The mural was heavily influenced by Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel fresco, and also features a portrait of Foster himself attending the meeting. Foster went on to paint other prominent murals in Detroit, including “Kaleidoscope,” commissioned for the Southwest Detroit Hospital in 1976, and his 18’ x 20’ “Renaissance City,” at Cass Technical High School, made in 1979, which depicts the city rising from the ashes of the 1967 riots. In 1978, Foster made a series of paintings commemorating Paul Robeson’s 80th birthday. His friend Leno Jaxon, founder of American Black Artists, Inc. and first director of the Afro-American Museum, once attempted to convince the Detroit Institute of Art to show the work, but it was rejected, generating controversy. In 1981, Foster's art work was included in the exhibit \\"Prominent Black Artists, Past and Present\\" at the Karamu House and Renaissance Galleries in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1985, “Renaissance City” was vandalized, and only a few months afterward Foster’s home and studio burned down. Friends and fellow artists, spearhead by Dr. Charles Wright, organized donations and an art auction to support Foster and pay for the restoration of the mural, which was completed in 1986. At the celebration for the restoration, Detroit Free Press columnist Susan Watson called Foster a “genius.” In 1990, towards the end of Foster’s life, Leno Jaxon organized a showing of his work at American Black Artists, Inc. Also in 1990, Foster signed the second floor beam in the Scarab Club, a longtime institution of Detroit artists. Students Detroit native and former Michigan Chronicle illustrator Telitha Cumi Bowens was a protege of LeRoy Foster. Death Foster suffered from diabetes and his deteriorating health resulted in blindness and loss of his legs. He died of kidney failure on March 23, 1993, at Grace Hospital in Detroit.

He was born in England and transported to Australia for forgery in 1837. While working as a meteorologist at South Head, Sydney, he started exhibiting paintings. The surviving landscape paintings are now considered as early documents of Colonial Sydney.Neville, R. (2002). George Edwards Peacock in the Picture Gallery, State Library of New South Wales  Early life  George Edwards Peacock was born in Sedbergh, Yorkshire on 4 September 1806 and educated at Sedbergh School. He was the younger son of the vicar of Sedbergh, Rev. Daniel Mitford Peacock, and Catherine, nee Edwards; both sons were given her maiden name. Peacock was admitted as a solicitor in February 1830 and although he ran his own practice it did not fare well.Darby, Garry, George Peacock, b.1806 In 1836 he forged a power of attorney for transfer of stock valued at £7,814, the property of his brother, Rev. Edwards George Peacock. After appearing in court for the forgery he was sentenced to death at London's Old Bailey but the sentence was commuted to transportation for life. Before being sent to Australia Peacock spent time on board the hulk Justisa, moored in the Thames. Peacock eventually reached Sydney aboard the Prince George on 8 May 1837. As a 'special’ or educated prisoner, he was sent to Port Macquarie where he acted as clerk to the prison barracks. There is no evidence that he painted at this time and three months after his arrival, Peacock’s wife and son joined him at Port Macquarie. By 1839, however, his family was living in Sydney and Peacock was requesting a transfer there. By 1840 he was back in Sydney training at Paramatta Observatory with the government astronomer, James Dunlop and he was afterwards employed as a meteorologist at the South Head Weather Station. While Peacock's work was dismissed as 'unworthy of confidence' by the Colonial Astronomer, Rev. William Scott, Peacock's reports remain the only daily account of Sydney's weather between 1840 and 1856. After his marriage break- up, he moved into a nearby cottage and the views from the road to Sydney became the subject of many of his paintings. On 27 November 1847, the Sydney Chronicle announced that the Governor had granted a conditional pardon to George Peacock which enabled him to proceed to all parts of the world except England.FRIDAY (27 November 1847). Sydney Chronicle (NSW : 1846 - 1848), p. 2. Retrieved 17 September 2018, He appears to have been most active as a painter between 1845 and 1852 and in 1847 he exhibited with the Society for the Promotion of the Fine Arts in Australia. On 22 June 1850 Bell's Life reported on an exhibition of local works at Kern and Mader's of George Street where they were highly complimentary of a copy of an oil picture by Mr. Peacock of South Head. They also listed 'Richmond Road' and 'Buttermero Lake' as landscapes by Peacock.LOCAL INTELLIGENCE. (22 June 1850). Bell's Life in Sydney and Sporting Reviewer (NSW : 1845 - 1860), p. 2. Retrieved 17 September 2018 In March 1851 the dealer J.T. Grocott had five of Peacock's oil views of Port Jackson on display at his gallery, together with lithographs after Peacock's painting, Citizens' Mayor's Picnic. After the closure of the meteorological station in South Head little is known about Peacock's movements. In an article in the Sydney Morning Herald from 1857, P. G. K. says that Mr. Peacock had 'bolted from the colony' suggesting this may be the reason no later works have come to light.[ http://nla.gov.au/nla.news- article12992543 METEOROLOGICAL].

Stemming from the fusion of the Revenu de solidarité active (RSA) and the Prime pour l'emploi (PPE), the prime d'activité supports the occupation and buying power of low-income workers, rectifying certain problems posed by the both the RSA and PPE. As of January 1, 2016, the prime d'activité is issued by Caisse d'allocations familiales and Mutualité sociale agricole (fr).  Creation and codification  The prime d'activité was created by the August 17 law #2015-994 relative to labour relations and employment:, title IV, and took effect on January 1, 2016. It is codified in book 8 of the social security code, specifically L 841-1 to L 847-1, R 842-1 to R 848-1 and D 843-1 to D 848-5. The provisions were finalised by simple decree (fr) #2015-1710 on the 21 December 2015 and was published in the Journal officiel de la République française on the 22 December 2016.  Objectives and motivations of the prime d'activité  The creation of the prime d'activité is the result of several reports on two previous insufficient provisions regarding labor and low-income support, namely the RSA and the PPE. The RSA, whose goal was to promote re-entry into the workforce without fear of earning less than unemployment benefits, was only used by a third of potential beneficiaries due to administrative complexities, fear of overcompensation (and thus repayment), and social stigma. Furthermore, in all but rare cases, the RSA was not issued to those under 25. The PPE, a tax credit supplementing low-wage incomes, however, reached between 95% and 97% of potential beneficiaries, but allocated relatively low amounts (a monthly average of 33€ in 2014) with a one-year discrepancy in relation to employment. The prime d'activité corrects these drawbacks. It is unconnected to the RSA and is issued monthly at a \\"fixed\\" three-month rate irrespective of any changes in employment, reducing the incidence of overcompensation, and can be claimed at age 18 with a simplified administrative process. The average amount allocated in 2015 was per month. The objective remains to encourage re-entry into the workforce, even into low- paying positions, and supplementing low incomes.  Conditions  All earnings cited here are legally defined in relation to SMIC (fr) and are shown in monthly net in practice. On January 1, the net monthly SMIC was 1,130€. * General conditions: Be a national of the European Economic Area (EEA) and reside in France. For homeless individuals, selecting a place of residence at a Centre communal d'action sociale (fr) or other certified organisation. *Conditions specific to the prime d'activité: be on a regular stay in France for at least 5 years if foreign to the EEA. *Conditions for employees: earn between € and per month (79.5% to 133% of SMIC). *Conditions for craftspersons and self-employed individuals: earn between and per month (79.5% and 242.6% of SMIC). *Conditions for storekeepers: earn less than in revenue per month (the actual income of the shopkeeper being only a fraction of the monthly revenue). *Conditions for students and apprentices: earn at least per month (78% of SMIC). *Conditions for those earning less than net per month (79.5% of SMIC): Proof of no other occupation (neither student nor apprentice).  Amount  The prime d'activité is inversely proportional to earnings. Example for a single childless earner in 2017 * net per month (25% of SMIC): bonus of per month. * net per month (100% of SMIC): bonus of per month. * net per month (130% of SMIC): bonus of per month.

The game was initially released for Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita on July 31, 2018, and Bit Kid announced a Nintendo Switch version shortly afterward, to be released October 11, 2018.  Gameplay  Inspired by Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, Chasm tells the story of an aspiring knight eager to prove their worth, on a quest to a mining town whose resources are essential. Although the story is the same for all players, the exact layout of the world map is unique for each adventure, through the game's use of procedural generation combined with handmade room sequences. Combat (also similar to Castlevania) gives the player an option of a melee weapon and a sub-weapon to do most of your damage. As the players venture down into the mine, they can level up, collect new weapons from swords to whips, use artifacts which make the environment explorable in different ways for new areas. The boss fights in the game rely on memorizing attack patterns. Besides that, there are rooms with moving or disappearing platforms, environmental hazards and traps, making a balance between combat and platforming. On the journey, there are townspeople trapped in cages. Releasing them sends them back up to the town, with a shop or service offered in the process, and unlocks a new sidequest expanding on the service they offer. Each map is segmented into themed sections like catacombs and gardens.  Development  Initial development started in 2012 with a prototype. The main character was only able to fight and jump, and his design barely changed since then. Bit Kid, Inc. hoped they could sell the idea of an old-fashioned game to publishers at the Game Developers Conference, but nobody offered to fund the game. The team decided to crowdfund the game instead through Kickstarter in 2013, which was successful.  Reception  Critical reception for the PC version of Chasm was mixed to positive. Jeremy Peeples of Hardcore Gamer called it \\"one of the finest Metroidvanias ever created.\\" Tom Marks of IGN said \\"Chasm is a lovely and fun Metroidvania with a lot of cool new ideas, even if its randomized maps are uninteresting.\\" Writing for GameSpot, Tom McShea said \\"Chasm is a well-crafted adventure\\" and praised its \\"superb combat and visual design.\\"  References   External links  * 2018 video games Indie video games Metroidvania games Linux games MacOS games Windows games PlayStation 4 games PlayStation Vita games Nintendo Switch games Single-player video games Video games developed in the United States Kickstarter-funded video games ","title":"Chasm (video game)"},{"id":"58505816","text":"Delane C.

It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004.  History  Cockatoo Island became a gaol in 1839, following advice from New South Wales Governor George Gipps to the British Secretary of State for the Colonies that convicts would be sent to the island after the closure of the Norfolk Island convict establishment. The convict precinct (Prison Barracks Precinct, Barracks Block, Military Guard Room, Mess Hall, and Biloela House) was built over a number of years. Quarrying of grain silos (Biloela House and Underground Grain Silos) was one of the early convict tasks. To service Royal Navy ships, Fitzroy Dock was completed in 1857. Cockatoo Island Dockyard became the major government dockyard in Australia. In 1869 prisoners were transferred from the island to Darlinghurst, and the prison buildings became an industrial school for girls and a reformatory in 1871. The dockyard area was now separated from the institutional area on the top of the island by a fence. Following the departure of the females in 1888, prisoners were again sent to the island, and the gaol function continued until about 1909. Meanwhile, the dockyard function expanded, and the Sutherland Dock was built in 1890. The NSW Public Works Department declared Cockatoo Island the state dockyard. In 1913 Cockatoo became the Commonwealth Dockyard, and the island, both through ship-building and servicing, played an important role both in the development of the Royal Australian Navy and during the First World War. The former prison buildings were now used as offices. From 1933 the dockyard was leased from the Commonwealth by Cockatoo Docks and Engineering Co Ltd and the island played a very significant role during the Second World War. After the war the dockyard (now known as Vickers) continued, and submarine facilities were introduced. The dockyard closed in 1992, and there was some demolition. Sale of the island was proposed. The island is now vested in the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust. The powerhouse was constructed in 1918 to replace the 1884 pump house which had been built for Sutherland Dock. The new building was erected on the same site at the western end of the island, and was built to supply not just the electricity for the dock pumps but all of the island's electrical power. Electricity was supplied at 240 volts DC from two steam turbine-driven generators. The boilers were located in an adjacent building to the north which, along with its contents, was removed after the Second World War. A very large chimney was also built. As well as playing a crucial role in all of Cockatoo Island's operations from 1918 onwards, the powerhouse was the largest DC generating plant in Australia.  Description  Power House & Pump House is at the west end of Cockatoo Island, Sydney Harbour. The powerhouse is a good example of Federation Romanesque style, as seen in the rounded arches that distinguish the building. It is built of brick, laid in English bond, and there are sandstone capitals, string courses, sills and cornices. The roof was once tiled, but was later clad with corrugated asbestos cement. Windows are narrow and tall and are set into the heavy brick walling in arches to provide a continuous brick coping for the travelling crane rail. There is a brick tower on the south wall. Internally, a suspended ceiling conceals steel roof trusses, and the lower walls are rendered and retain some of the original black dado and red striping. Of particular importance is the collection of electrical, hydraulic power and pumping equipment still inside the building. This is the most extensive and rare collection of such equipment in Australia. The chimney, a Sydney Harbour landmark, is a very fine piece of brick construction. The base is square and ornate with profiled capping, and the round stack also has ornate capping. The chimney is three bricks thick, and the internal skin is of fire bricks. On the base is a plaque showing the July 1918 date of erection. = Condition = According to the 1997 Conservation Management Plan, the roof appeared to be sound, though the gutters and bargeboards were poor. As at May 2001, the powerhouse brickwork was mostly in good condition, though exterior joinery and windows were poor. Apart from bird droppings, the interior was in good condition. The basement area including the pumps was flooded. The exterior brickwork of the chimney appeared to be in good condition.  Heritage listing  Power House & Pump House was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Processes The powerhouse is historically significant for its role in providing all of the island's electrical power from the time of its construction in 1918. The powerhouse thus has a direct association with the operation of what was a major Australian naval dockyard, including during both world wars. Criterion B: Rarity The powerhouse contains the most extensive and rare collection of early Australian electrical, hydraulic power and pumping equipment in the country. Throughout its period of operation, the building was the largest DC generating plant in Australia. Criterion D: Characteristic values With its distinctive round-arched design, the powerhouse is a good example of Federation Romanesque style.

In addition to their unique body adaptations, birds have a range of described behaviours that differ from the foraging behaviours of other animal groups. According to the foraging habitat, birds may be grouped into foraging guilds. Foraging includes a range of activities, starting with the search for food, making use of sensory abilities, and which may involve one or more birds either of a single or even of multiple species. This is followed by locomotion and movements to obtain or capture the food, followed by the processing or handling of the foods prior to ingestion. Like all organisms foraging entails balancing the energy spent (in search, locomotion, avoiding predators, handling food) and energy gained. The high metabolic rate of birds, among the highest in the homoeotherm groups, constrains them to ensure a net positive gain in energy and have led evolutionary ethologists to develop the idea of optimal foraging.  Energetics  Foraging involves expending energy and seeking food can be both time and energy consuming. Birds make use of a variety of approaches to improve the efficiency of their foraging. These include foraging in flocks which provides many eyes to seek patches rich in food while also reducing the risk of predation by increasing the efficiency of detecting predators, increasing time spent on handling food, and by reducing individual risk. It has been suggested that individuals may exchange information for instance at communal roosts.  Foraging guilds  Assemblages of bird species that share common habitats or substrate from which food is gathered, and to some extent foraging technique are conceptual grouped within in foraging or trophic guilds. Various attempts have been made to classify foraging guilds for ecological studies and universal and undisputed classifications do not exist. It must also be noted that species may belong to multiple foraging guilds depending on situation (for example, while breeding, in migration, or in disturbed habitats). Specific classifications are used in ecological and behavioural studies. The classifications are often made according to multiple hierarchical criteria and a full classification may include multiple terms. To take an example a bird may be described as \\"nocturnal gleaning insectivore\\" with parts of the classification dealing with the time of day, the diet and the technique used to obtain food. Guild classification on food type based mainly on terms used by North American ornithologists includes: * Carnivore - (feeding on) vertebrates * Crustaceovore- crustacea *Insectivore - insects *Molluscivore - molluscs *Piscivore - fish * Vermivore - various elongated invertebrates especially annelids * Sanguinivore - blood feeding (e.g. oxpeckers, vampire ground finch) * Frugivore - fruits * Granivore - seeds * Nectarivore - nectar (e.g. sunbirds, hummingbirds) * Herbivore - plants (vegetative parts) * Omnivore - a variety of foods Guild classification based on habitat or substrate from which food is gathered (from generic to specific) includes: * aerial ** subcanopy * ground ** meadow * arboreal ** bark ** floral ** upper canopy ** lower canopy ** undergrowth ** foliage * water ** coastal *** coastal beach *** coast bottom *** coastal rock *** coastal water surface ** freshwater *** freshwater marshes *** freshwater bottom *** freshwater shoreline *** freshwater surface ** mud ** pelagic *** pelagic surface ** riparian *** bottom ** shoreline Western reef heron foot stirringGuild classifications based on foraging technique include the following. These may also involve other associated behaviours. * Ambushing / stalking - waiting for prey to come within reach, may involve slow walking ** Baiting is a technique known in about 12 species of herons. Here the herons drop feathers or small objects on the water surface to attract fishes to investigate the disturbance and come within striking range of the bird. Burrowing owls use dung to attract beetles. **Foot stirring movements are used by egrets as part of their strategy to disturb prey into range. A variation is foot raking, where the submerged sediment is disturbed by a slow and deliberate backward dragging of one of the feet. * Chasing - pursuing prey on the ground *Leaping - making use of jumps that are powered by the legs *Dabbling - in aquatic birds, involves dipping the head or neck (ie not just the bill) under water * Plunging - diving from air into water to capture prey with bill or into open mouth * Foot plunging - involves plunging from the air to the water or ground surface to seize prey using the feet * Diving - in aquatic birds, involves the whole body being submerged * Excavating - in arboreal birds, searching in wood or bark by drilling a hole * Hammering - delivering a series of pecks without pause (used by woodpeckers) * Scaling - feeding under bark by removing or prying bark **Remsen and Scott (1990) more specifically defined terms like chisel and flake * Scratching - to remove a layer of substrate using the feet * Piracy or Kleptoparasitism - used by some birds to make others disgorge their prey. This is seen in many species of bird including raptors, skuas and a few others and notably absent among seed-eating birds. It is found mainly when hosts are found in numbers and when the food item is large and visible. *Gleaning - picking specific items from the surface of the substrate * Hover-gleaning - picking specific items while flying * Grazing - feeding on grasses, sedges, or their seeds in fields or meadows * Probing - inserting bill into substrate and using touch or taste to detect prey * Mantling - spreading wings and body around prey to protect from piracy, especially seen in birds of prey. **Tool using is seen in some birds. New Caledonian and Hawaiian crows fashion tools to obtain food while woodpecker finches are known to use cactus spines to extract prey out of holes in wood that are too narrow for their beaks to be inserted in. *Gaping - inserting bill into substrate and then opening apart the bill to pry * Grubbing - digging up soil for roots and tubers * Skimming - flying low over water to pick food items using beak * Scavenging - feeding on refuse or carrion *Hawking, fly-catching, or aerial sallying refers to obtaining aerial food, typically flying insects. The birds typically stay on the wing while handling and ingesting the prey. The more specific term flycatching is used to describe birds that fly out of a perch to capture and insect to return with the prey to a perch before handling the prey. **Flush-and-pursue - here the prey is first put into flight before pursuit *Screening - flying with open bills to capture aerial prey *Straining - strain food from water or mud using special structures in the bill *Foraging - a more general term for picking food from a substrate Other miscellaneous foraging behaviours include:Hartlaub's gulls foot paddling.Foot trembling movements may be used by waders such as plovers and lapwings. They are used mainly on wet soil or while wading in shallow water. Some waders move around rapidly in circles, these include the phalaropes, best known for their pirouetting movements, often in deeper water that reaches until their body. Among the first to document the behaviour was the German ornithologist Oskar Heinroth who described it in 1915. Foot paddling is a foraging behaviour unique to gulls (subfamily Larinae of the family Laridae). The behaviour is exhibited while perched in shallow water, and sometimes on dry land, over short grass or bare soil. The gulls rapidly move their feet up and down while staying at a spot and it is thought that this flushes subterranean prey that they then detect and feed on although there is no definite evidence. Other terms describing the term have included paddling, puddling, pumping, stamping, thumping, tramping, trampling, treading and trembling. The behaviour is found in young gulls and is considered to be innate and does not require learning. The behaviour has been compared by lay observers to rapid dancing moves.

Becker (9 July 1937, Wiesbaden - 7 May 2012, Freiburg im Breisgau) was a German agricultural scientist, specializing in the area of vine breeding and viticulture.Norbert Becker in Gesellschaft für Geschichte des Weins (Society of the History of Wine)  Early life  Becker spent his youth on a vineyard near Wiesbaden in the Rheingau. While still at secondary school he helped out there and as a waiter in the vineyard‘s inn, became used to the aura of Rhineland wine culture. After his school years at the humanistic Dilthey-Gymnasium in Wiesbaden (in 1958) he completed his military service as an officer candidate. He was for two years an apprentice in practical agriculture and then studied agricultural science at the Justus-Liebig- University in Gießen, obtaining a diploma in 1964. Becker was an assistant at the Orcharding Institute of the same university and a doctoral student at the Forschungsanstalt Geisenheim (Geisenheim Research Institute) where he obtained the degree Dr. agr. in 1968. He then started as a trainee at the State Ministry of Agriculture in Hessen.  Career  At the beginning of 1970 he entered service with the state of Baden-Württemberg at the Federal Institute of Viticulture in Freiburg (Staatlichen Weinbauinstitut Freiburg.) His area of work involved vine cultivation (Rebenzüchtung) and viticulture. During his tenure fungus-resistant new cultivars were developed (Reben-Neuzuchten), that can be grown practically without spraying (with fungicide). The most promising of these, and also those of his predecessor Johannes Zimmermann were tested in the institute‘s cultures, in vinyards (Winzerbetrieben) and then developed to the stage when they could be used in practice. Among these are the following vine types: Johanniter, Bronner, Solaris, Helios and the red wine types Prior, Baron, Monarch, Cabernet Cortis, and Cabernet Carbon. Becker taught viticulture students and master vintagers. In his spare time he led Saturday viticulture excursions in the frame of the \\"general studies“ programme of the University of Freiburg. In retirement he followed his work-oriented hobby – the cultural, historical and health aspects of wine.  Selected publications * Norbert Becker und H. Güss: Der Wein, Lebensfreude und Gesundheit.

Her brother was Peter Burrell, 1st Baron Gwydyr, and two of her sisters also married into the aristocracy: Elizabeth, who married the Duke of Hamilton (and later the Marquess of Exeter), and Isabella, who became Countess of Beverley. Isabella's husband, Algernon, was the brother of Frances's husband, Hugh. Marriage and children She married the future duke, then styled as an earl, in May 1779, shortly after his childless marriage to the former Lady Anne Crichton-Stuart had been dissolved by Act of Parliament. He inherited the dukedom when his father died in 1786, making his wife a duchess.

The name was used for various pharmaceutical preparations produced by several manufacturers from the end of the 17th century to the beginning of the 19th. In addition to the name, these preparations had in common the fact that the major therapeutic ingredient was the bark of the cinchona tree, from which quinine is obtained. Reference to the drug can be found in all Portuguese Pharmacopeia between 1681 and 1821. History Água de Inglaterra was used for the treatment of malaria, which at the time was endemic in several regions of Portugal, including the Sado River valley and the Guadiana river. It was initially introduced from England in 1681 by Dr. Fernando Mendes, who “received a handsome gift from (King Dom Pedro) on condition that he should reveal to him the secret of his composition and withhold it from the public”. However, the popularity of the mixture was short-lived, either because it did not perform as claimed or because of the sudden death of Mendes. The medicine, which was produced through an infusion of the cinchona bark in alcohol, was subsequently popularised in the 1730s by Jacob de Castro Sarmento, a Portuguese doctor who lived in London from around 1720. Sarmento is believed to have left Portugal in order to freely practice the Jewish religion. He was elected to the Royal Society in 1730 and was the first Jew to obtain a Doctorate in Medicine from a British university. He was a pioneer in work to develop a smallpox vaccine. Sarmento set up a profitable distribution network for Água de Inglaterra in Portugal and it became one of the most widely used drugs in the country. Others, including Castro Sarmento's nephew who claimed his uncle had shared the formula with him, produced their own counterfeit versions. The rights of the nephew's son in this regard were disputed in the Portuguese Parliament as late as 1821, having earlier been endorsed by the Prince Regent.Two pharmacists in Lisbon also produced their own versions. With the isolation of quinine from the cinchona bark by Pelletier (1788-1842) and Caventou (1795-1877) it could be consumed as a salt. This resulted in Água de Inglaterra losing the importance it had had in the 18th Century. A quinine-based product known as Água Inglesa (English Water) continues to be produced and sold in Brazil.

It was designed by Douglas S. Agnew, Arthur Palin (original Federation House) and Paul Sorensen (garden) and built in 1941. It is also known as Mahratta and Site and Heatherlee. The property is owned by The School of Philosophy. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  In 1838 Governor Darling made a land grant to emancipated convict, Thomas Hyndes. Hyndes had been in possession of the land since 1830, working it with convict labour and supplying timber to the colony. In 1840 he sold the land and in 1854 it was again sold, to John Brown, timber merchant. Brown bought it to cut as much timber off the land as possible.Ratliffe, 1990, 95-6 An property of the Bank of NSW. It was part of John Brown's which he purchased from the first pioneer of the district, Thomas Hyndes. This land extended from Pearce's Corner, Wahroonga, fronting Lane Cove Road to a short distance beyond its junction with Fox Valley Road and extending to the boundary of the Lane Cove River. Brown aspired to own a square mile of land. This was a magnificent forest area then. Brown cleared land for an orchard and felling forest trees for timber. His expanding interests led to the name \\"The Squire\\". The names of Brown's sons and daughters have been perpetuated in the names of Lucinda, Ada and Roland Avenues, Wahroonga, in the vicinity. =Ownership under Gerald Allen= No real subdivision was effected until 1893, when Francis Gerard purchased \\"The Foxground Estate\\" from John Brown. This land at the corner of Fox Valley Road and Lane Cove Road (Pacific Highway), Wahroonga was known as 'Brown's Paddock'. It passed through several hands until a Mr Gerald Allen became owner (in 1912: Garden Clubs of Australia, 2016, 18) and renamed it from Heverlee to Mahratta after a Bombala sheep station where his grandfather was overseer.Thorne, 1968, 53-7, 143-4. The name Mahratta comes from two Indian words: Maha Ratcha meaning \\"The Great Kingdom\\" in sanskrit.GCoA, 2016, 18 Under the direction of architect Arthur Palin, Mr Allen made extensions and upgraded the substantial Federation home. The mansion was noted for its cedar staircase and copper ceiling in the billiard room. Allen commissioned garden designer Paul Sorensen in 1925 to lay out its then garden (now ). His design created two levels divided by a graceful balustrade wall with steps leading from the upper level down to a sunken rose garden, croquet court and extensive lawns. Exotic trees were planted including cedars (Cedrus deodara/Himalayan cedar and weeping blue Atlas cedar, C.atlantica 'Pendula'), other conifers, maples (Acer spp.) and oaks (Quercus spp.), many coming from Sorensen's nursery in Leura. Other trees thought to have been planted at this time include the Queensland firewheel tree (Stenocarpus sinuatus), crows foot ash (Flindersia australis), Bunya Bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii) and tallowwood (Eucalyptus microcorys). All have matured to become magnificent trees. = Ownership by James Joynton Smith = Allen sold in 1930 to Sir James Joynton Smith who was a member of the NSW Legislative Council, Lord Mayor of Sydney and owner of the Carrington Hotel in Katoomba. = Ownership under the Field family = In 1939 Sir James sold Mahratta to Caragabal Pastoral Co. Pty Limited, a company associated with the family of Thomas Alfred (T.A.) Field, wealthy grazier and meat merchant (who with his brothers had inherited their father's wholesale and retail butchery business). As well as developing the company's wholesale and export trade they purchased pastoral properties throughout eastern Australia. Field had the old house demolished in 1940 and built the present mansion in 1941 in the old house's footprint. He commissioned architect Douglas S Agnew to design the present building (not the Abercrombie wing to its north-west) and it was completed in 1941. Designed in the Art Deco style accounts for the theatrical charm and majesty of the house, no less exemplified than in the experience of the entry and main hall with its curved, scagliola finished staircase, curved wall and pilasters. It is acknowledged as one of the finest Art Deco mansions in Sydney even though it was completed well after the Art Deco period ended. On its completion Field brought Sorensen back to extend and complement his design of the original garden. The curving red gravel driveway was built and Sorensen oversaw planting of the front lawn and the two dawn redwoods (Metasequoia glyptostroboides) and two red Japanese maples (Acer palmatum) that frame the entrance to the house's porte-cochere. The wide garden (bed)s facing the house are filled with colourful shrubs set against a backdrop of trees, lily pillies (Syzygium spp.) and other rainforest trees were planted to blend in with the exotics elsewhere in the garden. The walled courtyard at the back (north) of the house leads out through a moon gate to lawns shaded by two Himalayan cedars and on to the pleasant Refectory Courtyard to the left (west). To the right (east) is the tennis court with luxuriant plantings of Rhapis palms and rhododendrons between it and the house and a long garden bed of azaleas and camellias on the eastern (Pacific Highway) boundary. Mr Field died in 1944 but his widow Jessie, continued to live in Mahratta until 1960. = Bank training college = The two-storey house of together with tennis courts and swimming pool was bought in 1960 by the Bank of NSW (now Westpac Banking Corporation) for use as a training college for its senior officers. Four full-time gardeners were employed. Sorensen was retained by the bank to \\"redesign and develop the grounds to a very high standard\\". Possibly the most significant planting of the time included the cedars, now mature, planted close to the house. The Bunya Bunya pine near to the Fox Valley Road boundary is a local landmark. The major landscaping feature included in the design of the new mansion was the continuous brick fence with its magnificent gateways, matching that of the main house. The bank made some alterations and extensions made to the residence, which were designed by the same architect in a manner sensitive to the original house in scale, materials and details.National Trust of Australia (NSW), 2008, 30. In the mid-1960s while they worked in Telegraph Road, Pymble, and others in the vicinity Brian Smith (the only apprentice to landscape architect and nurseryman, Paul Sorensen) (and sometimes Ib Sorensen) lived for more than two years in the attic of an old coach house nearby. They brought supplies and cooked their own meals. One of the jobs they worked on at this time was Mahratta on the corner of Fox Valley Road and the Pacific Highway.McMaugh, 2005, 584-5 The bank in 1964 built the new three-storey Abercrombie wing to the house's north-west, for residential purposes. Though the bricks are closely matched (the original quarries were re-opened for their manufacture), there was no attempt to replicate the Art Deco forms of the rest of the building. =Ownership under The School of Philosophy= Mahratta was acquired in 1990 by the School of Philosophy which uses it as a venue to conduct public courses in practical philosophy. It also holds events such as lectures, workshops and residential retreats for human development. In 1991 Ku-Ring-Gai Municipal Council received of land as a section 94 contribution from development to the west of Mahratta, which formed part of Gerald Allen's 1912 purchases. The western section of the land purchased by Ross Field in 1946 formed part of this development.TBLA, 2011, 18 Council has since (2011) made a pocket park on Mahratta's northern edge, named \\"Curtilage Park\\". The School of Philosophy's members recognise the historic significance of the property and wish to keep it in good order for future generations. The Friends of Mahratta was established in 2010 to raise much-needed funds for the care of the property. All proceeds from open house and garden events go to the upkeep of the property and students also volunteer help to assist with maintenance.GCoA, 2016, 19  Description  =Site and garden= The property is bounded on the east by the Pacific Highway and on the south by Fox Valley Road. A loop driveway off Fox Valley Road to the porte-cochere of the house's southern side sweeps down to the southeast corner of the road with the Pacific Highway. Between house and highway is a tennis court with a pavilion on its western (facing the house) side and a path leads through shrubs and trees lining the eastern boundary. Expansive lawns flank the house's south- west, south and south-east. To the south-west is a lower terrace (formerly a croquet green) with a pergola to its north (sited mid-way along the house's western wing's facade) with two flights of steps above and below it. Below the croquet green is a terraced formal rose garden. In the far southwest of the property (in 1990) is a cottage. A side drive leads to this off the Fox Valley Road gate. On the house's northern side is a formal courtyard formed by two wings. A high brick wall and moon gate lead from this into less and less formal garden areas. Northeast of the moon gate is a summer house. Another drive leads from the northeast corner of the house east to the Pacific Highway, around the north of the tennis court. North of the house are wide lawn areas and to the northwest a woodland area. Northwest of the house is a service area with two small sheds and west of that a mixed shrubbery, north of the rose garden. This garden more than any other, shows its designer Paul Sorensen's ability to combine exotic and native trees into a cohesive design. His usual range of exotic plants is very evident: Himalayan cedars (Cedrus deodara), maples, English oak (Quercus robur), tulip trees (Liriodendron tulipifera), sweet gum (Liquidambar styraciflua). To these, he added other conifers such as dawn redwoods (Metasequoia glyptostroboides) and Araucaria species as well as exotic broadleaf trees common in Sydney: Jacaranda mimosifolia and Cape chestnut (Cupania capensis). With this considerable mix is a range of native trees, mostly from the moister coastal zones, the leaves of which are mostly in rich glossy greens which blend with, complement and add to the richness of foliage so evident in the garden. These native trees include the Queensland firewheel tree (Stenocarpus sinuatus), gap axe/ coogara/coogera or rose tamarind (Arytera divaricata), Queensland nut (Macadamia integrifolia), lily pilly (Syzygium luehmannii), lemon scented gum (Corymbia citriodora), lacebark (Brachychiton discolor) and Illawarra flame tree (B.acerifolius). Two other rare trees in the garden are the rose apple (Syzygium jambos) and a karaka or New Zealand laurel (Corynocarpus laevigatus), both along the eastern Pacific Highway frontage. A diverse range of shrubs also adorn the southern and eastern borders of the property, including tree gardenia (G.thunbergii), Camellia japonica cv.s, Gordonia axillaris and others.Read, Stuart. pers.comm., 10/12/2009; with additions, 3/10/2012 It is difficult to know which trees were planted by Sorensen as there appears to have been a considerable garden here before he began. He carried out extensive tree surgery to many of the old trees and trained wisteria (W.sinensis) from tangled heaps into more manageable plants. The understorey was completely cleared out and, after fumigation to kill oxalis and onion weed infestations, was replanted with the present shrubbery. The great variety of trees is used to delineate and articulate the spaces around the house and to provide a dense tree cover around the two street boundaries so that from within the garden you are not conscious of the heavy traffic on the highway outside. Belts of trees are under-planted with azaleas (Rhododendron indicum cv.s), rhododendrons, magnolias and other shrubs. The sinuous red gravel drive with its carefully detailed brick edging, annual beds and standard roses divides the lawn as it sweeps towards the house where each side of the porte-cochere is marked by a dawn redwood tree (Metasequoia glyptostroboides). Sorensen included a clipped yew hedge (Taxus baccata) against the front wall of the house but most of this is now (1990) missing. On sunken terraces to the south-west of the house are a rose garden and a lawn used for putting and croquet. These two elements are separated by a tall hedge, mostly made up of native vegetation, whilst the stair linking them is canopied over by a remarkable weeping Himalayan cedar (Cedrus deodara Pendula). The rose garden is very formal in its layout and quite a departure from Paul Sorensen's usual style, although he had previously designed such a garden at Rannock, Blayney and was later to design another at Fernhill, Mulgoa. All the roses were chosen by Sorensen and carefully located on a drawing, although when it came to the central bed the drawing is noted \\"The best white available\\", leaving the choice somewhat open. Above the rose garden, Sorensen indulged in his practice of (re-)using pieces of old buildings in gardens by positioning an elaborately carved coat of arms from an unknown Victorian style sandstone building. The placing (beside a set of steps at the southern end of the rose garden) appears to be rather arbitrary. Altogether the garden at Mahratta is eminently suitable for its purpose and the four gardeners who tend it (in 1990) are justifiably proud of the standard of care they provide.Ratcliffe, 1990, 95-6, amended and added to by Stuart Read, 10/12/2009 =House= A very fine two-storey Art Deco-influenced interwar house of red face brick with a hipped tiled roof. The exterior emphasises the streamlined and circle-based aspects of the style with circular windows, circular motifs in steel window grilles, horizontal string courses and panels of small ceramic tiles, rounded brick corners, circular chimneys and piers of unusual specially moulded curved face bricks (National Trust of Australia (NSW)). The interior contains many original fittings and finishes demonstrating a high level of 1940s craftmanship. A sweeping staircase has a curved balustrade made of scagliola. Curved glazed doors slide into curved recesses. Original Art Deco bathrooms and ball room, stone fireplaces, timber panelling in some rooms.Friends of Mahratta, 2014 The house featured in an advertisement promoting gambling in 2018. Extensive shots of the formal interior areas, including a motorcycle being ridden down the main hall, and golf balls being hit from the grand staircase (improbably landing in the music room) give an idea of the internal architecture and fittings. = Modifications and dates = Used as Westpac Training Centre for a time, modifications made to accommodate this. Rewire complete 2019  Heritage listing  As at 7 November 2013, Mahratta is a large, intact, 2 storey mansion erected in 1941 in an unusual style which combines Art Deco and Classical Georgian Revival elements. It is perhaps the largest and finest property of its type erected in wartime Sydney. The house replaced a substantial Federation period residence situated on a site in Warrawee but retained and incorporated the majority of the earlier landscape elements including a sunken rose garden and outbuildings. It was built for T. A. Field, a notable figure in the retail and wholesale meat industry, by the architect Douglas Agnew. The house is substantially intact exhibiting a high degree of face brick, bronze and wrought iron detailing externally and is characterised by a dramatic porte-cochere on the south and an enclosed Pompeian Court on the north. Extended in 1964 by the addition of a west wing, the whole achieves a unity of style, form, texture and materials from the sensitively designed additions. Internally the house retains a series of superb public spaces and rooms of fluid design and highly crafted materials. The oval staircase executed in marble and scagliola, the well-proportioned ballroom and elliptical dining room, finely detailed joinery and original fittings all combine to achieve a very rare and dramatic domestic interior from the period. The property has historic associations and aesthetic values due to the involvement and advice of landscape designer Paul Sorensen in its garden. The open landscaped setting and mature plantings provide a fine setting and backdrop to the house. Red gravel driveways snaking through the open lawns reinforce the colour and texture of the house. Occupation by the Westpac Banking Corporation since the 1960s, using the house as a Staff Training College has ensured a high level of maintenance to both the house and grounds. This has ensured that Mahratta has retained all of the essential characteristics of its cultural significance. Separate statements of significance exist for the garage and chauffeur's quarters, gardener's cottage, tennis pavilion, laundry, sheds and greenhouses. The open lawns and gardens to the north, east and south of the main house are an essential component in achieving a fine open setting for the house. To the west, the Croquet Lawn and Rose Garden with their backdrop of dense mature trees and shrubs are a key component of the cultural and historic setting having survived almost intact from the original (Federation era) house. The open areas to the west of the property are of little cultural significance to the main house, but contain a series of very large native trees.Schweger Brooks, 1989 Reasons for listing; cultural, architectural, landmark value, state significance Note: grounds, fence, outbuilding to Fox Valley Road & garage building.LEP, 1992 Mahratta was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

Service history Marine Carp departed the west coast 14 November 1945, and steamed to the Philippines to embark Pacific war veterans for return to the United States. She returned to Los Angeles, from Manila, just before Christmas, thence sailed on a trooplift run from the Mediterranean late in January 1946. Steaming via the Panama Canal, she embarked troops at Naples, Italy, and Le Havre, France, in February, and steamed back to the United States arriving New York, early in March. After completing another trip to the Mediterranean and back in the spring of 1946, she entered the Maritime Commission National Defense Reserve Fleet.

Its first graduation was in 1924. So far ASPU has prepared more than 100 thousand teachers. In 1972 the Institute was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labor. Before its foundation, an Organizing Committee (Preparatory Commission) was created for the establishment of the institute in late 1920. Fatullah Bey Rzabeyli was appointed the Chairman of the Committee. The members were Habib Bey Mahmudbeyov and Rahim Jafarov. Abdulla Shaig, Muhammed bey Efendiyev, and Sadig Huseynov also took part in the activities of the committee. They also participated in the organization of the one-year pedagogical courses which played a key role in the establishment of the Pedagogical Institute in Azerbaijan and also delivered lectures in these courses. The Organizing Committee was to prepare a curriculum for the institute and present it to the Azerbaijani People's State Education Commission, to find qualified personnel and to resolve the issue of teaching aids and construction. The Committee began its work on June 9, 1920. On June 13, 1921, the Azerbaijani People's Education Commission approved the first statute of the Pedagogical Institute. The statute defines the structure, duties, and rights of the institution and also specifies the subject disciplines included in the curriculum, as well as the rules of the colloquium, acts of admission and examinations to strengthen the knowledge and control of students. 317x317px According to the curriculum, students in the first year were supposed to teach the subjects such as mathematics, Mother tongue, the Russian language, literature, music, etc. In the second year, students were divided into specialties and trained in accordance with the relevant subjects. On November 12, 1921, three days before the beginning of the classes the first meeting of the Council of the Institute was held at the Pedagogical Institute and questions were also discussed about the organization of lessons and other important tasks. In the first years, the Institute trained teachers in the field of history, philology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics as well as theoretical courses and experimental studies in botany, zoology, physiology, chemistry, geology, and mineralogy. The students were educated within the framework of the program of the Baku State University by such teachers as F. Rasulzade, S. Huseynov, A. A. Amirov, S. Kh. Osinanzade. In this period the most powerful scientific center of the department was the faculty of physiology. In 1921 the Department of History and Public Literature was established. The new department was responsible for teaching the humanitarian and special disciplines, philosophy, logic, pedagogy, didactics, political economy, the foundations of the state law and other subjects. From 1925 to 1926 the department was divided into two independent departments: the Department of History and the Department of Philology. Between 1923 and 1924 the Ministry of Education of Azerbaijan allocated 112 thousand manats for educational, scientific and economic work of the institute. In those years, the Institute's basic library was also enriched. At the time of the library\`s creation, there were just 50 books in the Azerbaijani language and 73 books in different languages. A few years later the library fund of German literature was significantly increased from Moscow and other cities. In the academic year 1923-24, there were 2,000 copies in Azerbaijani and 1,000 copies in the Russian language in the library. From 1924-25 school years, the institute began to work with a 4-year curriculum. At that time, 142 students were studying at the university. Students from neighboring countries, such as Georgia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, etc., also studied at this educational institution. = Famous graduates = Abramov Yevda - Azerbaijani statesman, deputy of Milli Majlis (Azerbaijani Parliament).

It was assessed at doses of 25 to 75 mg in an oil solution once a month by intramuscular injection. LPP was associated with high contraceptive failure at the low dose and with poor cycle control. The medication was found to produce estrogenic effects in the endometrium in women due to transformation into estrogenic metabolites. A single intramuscular injection of 50 to 100 mg LPP in oil solution has been found to have a duration of action of 14 to 30 days in terms of clinical biological effect in the uterus and on body temperature in women. LPP has a long biological half- life in rats when given as an intramuscular depot injection; its half-life was similar to that of nandrolone laurate (nandrolone dodecanoate) and was about 2-fold longer than that of nandrolone decanoate, 10-fold longer than that of lynestrenol and nandrolone phenylpropionate, 50-fold longer than that of progesterone, and 430-fold longer than that of nandrolone.

He was Chair in Social Administration at the University of Sheffield from 1977 to 1988.  Life  Eric Edward Sainsbury was born on 16 December 1925 in Newham where his father was a wage clerk. He grew up at Leigh‑on-Sea, Essex, and at Formby in Lancashire, as the family moved with his father's work. After attending high school in Southport, he volunteered for the Royal Air Force during the Second World War but was sent to the Barnburgh colliery as a Bevin Boy. After nearly four years there, he won a place at Balliol College, Oxford, to read English. He then taught at Leigh-on-Sea for three years, and then returned to education to complete postgraduate certificates at the University of Sheffield and the London School of Economics, awarded in 1955 and 1956 respectively. He then worked as a probation officer, before returning to Sheffield as a tutor in social work in 1961; five years later, he was appointed to a lectureship in social administration, and was promoted to senior lecturer in 1973 and then to the new Chair in Social Administration in 1977. Five years later, he became Head of the Department of Sociological Studies, serving until 1985.Alan Walker, \\"Eric Sainsbury obituary\\", The Guardian, 30 March 2014. Retrieved 17 September 2018.\\"Professor Eric Sainsbury 1926–2014\\", University of Sheffield. Retrieved 17 September 2018. He worked with John Westergaard (Chair in Sociological Studies) to \\"develop Social Policy as an intellectual bridge between Sociology and Social Work\\"; this led to the establishment of a social policy honours course in the department.Sociological Studies: A History To Be Proud Of (University of Sheffield, 2013), p. 2. Amid departmental funding cuts and declining student numbers, Sainsbury took early retirement in 1988 to ensure that more junior staff did not lose their jobs; Westergaard had done the same two years earlier. Sainsbury's research focused on user-centred social work; he advocated for social workers to listen and take account of individual user's desires and needs. He also wrote about the welfare state, mental health and disadvantaged children. Outside of academia, Sainsbury sat on the Home Office's Advisory Council on Child Care and the Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work; he was an adviser to the Department of Health's Chief Scientist, and was a magistrate. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1996 for community service in Sheffield, and received honorary degrees from Birmingham City University and Sheffield Hallam University. Sainsbury was also a keen piano player. He died on 11 March 2014, and was survived by his wife Audrey; their son Julian had died in 2007.

Extended in the mid-18th century and little altered thereafter, it is a Grade II* listed building. History Cadw records the original house as being built in the late Elizabethan era, . The architectural historian John Newman attributes the mid-18th century rebuilding to the Lucas family, either the father Robert, who was \\"buying land aggressively in the 1730s\\", or his son, Richard. Cadw, following Sir Joseph Bradney, the Monmouthshire antiquarian, concludes that the son, High Sheriff of Monmouthshire in the 1760s, was the more likely builder. The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales Coflein database records the evidence of contemporary formal gardens. Further reconstruction took place in the Victorian era although Cadw acknowledges that it is hard to establish what was done. By the mid-20th century, the house was derelict, with a lengthy reconstruction beginning in the 1980s. Architecture and description Constructed of local rubble, the whole house was extended and rendered in the 18th century rebuilding. The main block, now of two storeys with attics, was originally fully three storeys in height. The \\"galumphing\\" porch and roof are Victorian additions. The interiors contain \\"rich decorative fittings\\" from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. The footprint of the original 16th century house is now difficult to determine, although Newman concludes it must have been \\"of considerable size (and) baffling plan\\".

There is a belief of absolute obedience to the religious leader, a group-specific interpretation of the Bible and a teaching of the imminent coming of Jesus Christ, with a provision of the place for the final shelter. =Fiji= The church is currently based in Fiji, after its leader, Pastor Shin Okjoo, predicted a famine in Korea. The group and its leader believe that Fiji is the so-called \\"center of the world as promised in the Bible\\" and moved there in 2014. Per the group's website, a missionary for the church was sent around the world to discover a land to survive the famine, and after scouting 60 countries settled on Fiji. After the members arrived in Fiji all of the 400 followers' passports were reportedly seized by church leaders. Mainstream churches in Fiji have reportedly raised accusations against the church for being a cult for years. A spokesman for the local Methodist Church told reporters, \\"I think it's common knowledge here that the movement is a cult movement...\\". =Corporate= The church raises funds for the church using Grace Road Group, which opened businesses across Fiji that range from construction to agriculture. The company employed, in August 2018, at least 300 Koreans and 100 Fijians. The businesses opened by the group include restaurant chains, beauty salons, a construction firm, a hardware store, and a farm in partnership with the Fiji National University. A statement from the organization claims that the allegations against Pastor Shin Okjoo are false and have gone too far. The statement continued with \\"GR Group family, who have been working proudly as owners are very enraged by all the lies...Those who wish to slander us have created unspeakable lies about passport confiscation, forced labour, incarceration and violence.\\" Investigations, allegations of abuse and arrests Footage has emerged of the Church's followers forcibly slapping each other, supposedly to beat the Devil out of each other. In a documentary aired in South Korea, testimony of ex-church members detailed allegations of physical abuse and overwork. Pastor Shin Okjoo and other members would surround individuals and beat them. In 2014, Pastor Shin Okjoo was sued for $6 million by a man with schizophrenia, who alleged that she oversaw an attempt to cure him of his mental illness with prayer. The lawsuit alleged that she supervised the religious cleansing of the defendant, by binding him with duct tape, and deprived him of his medication for 10 days, ultimately causing him to lose his leg due to gangrene. Three of its members were arrested after arriving at Incheon Airport in Seoul, South Korea in July 2018. In August 2018, investigations into the group, after the arrest of the group's founder, included allegations of incarceration, assault, and the exploitation of foreign currency, were continued by Korean Police. The church headquarters in Navua were raided on 14 August by Korean police, the Department of Immigration, and the Fiji Police force. After the raid followers of the church were offered consular assistance. On 30 July 2019, it was announced that Shin Okjoo was found guilty and sentenced to serve six years in jail. Following the announcement, cult members were angry and shouted requests for the victim's 'false' statements to be thrown out.

Recovery process When data is deleted from storage devices, the references to the data are removed from the directory structure. The space can then be used, or overwritten, with data from other files or computer functions. The deleted data itself is not immediately removed from the physical drive and often exists as a number of disconnected fragments. This data, so long as it is not overwritten, can be recovered. The software scans disks in two different ways, run in succession, to look for lost data: first based on the file directory and the second based on the storage content. The first method scans the file directory and recovers simply deleted or Recycle Bin emptied data, where the file record and associated data content are still intact. The second method searches sector- by-sector through the storage content to recreate files from the data field. This second method takes a much longer time, and does not retain the original file names or folder structure. The discovered data can be filtered to search for particular files, and users may preview files before recovering.

It was designed by Charles Étienne Soubre and Jean-Laurent Hasse and is the only building constructed for the Liège International in 1905 which was not demolished at the end of the event. The event's organising committee left it to the city and it became the 'Palais des Fêtes et des Expositions', hosting conferences, balls, banquets, salons and major exhibitions such as the exhibition on the COBRA movement in 1951. The city's prints and drawings collection and the Walloon artistic collection from the city's Musée des Beaux-Arts were both housed in the building from 1952 onwards. The Musée des Beaux-Arts' main site in an annexe of the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts de Liège on rue des Anglais was destroyed in the 1970s and so all its modern and contemporary art collections were moved into the Palais, which was renamed the Musée d'art moderne. The Walloon art was moved out in 1980 to a complex in the Féronstrée et Hors-Château district designed by Henri Bonhomme. The Palais underwent a major renovation from 1988 onwards, reinstating the open space from the original 1905 design. It reopened in 1993 as the Musée d'art moderne et d'art contemporain (MAMAC). At the end of 2011 the musée des beaux-arts was revived in the Bonhomme building as part of a plan to combine MAMAC, the 'Fonds ancien' collection, the prints and drawings and the museum of Walloon art into a single entity named Musée des Beaux-Arts de Liège or BAL (Beaux-Arts Liège), housed in the former Walloon art galleries. On 28 February 2016 the Musée des Beaux-Arts closed and the whole collection was moved to a new museum housed in the Palais, named La Boverie.

He was a hatter, doing in business in New York City and Philadelphia, and from 1840, a commission merchant in Galveston, in the Republic of Texas. From the 1850s until 1885, Bremond was a railroad entrepreneur. He co-founded the Galveston and Red River Railroad, later known as the Houston and Texas Central Railroad, and he served as the company's top executive until 1858. Bremond believed that Moseley Baker was his \\"spirit guide,\\" and led him to establish the Houston, East and West Railway. He was the president and principal of this railroad until his death in 1885. Early life Paul Bremond was born 11 October 1810 in New York City to Dr. Paul Barlie Bremond and Catherine (Green) Bremond. When Paul was born, his father was still a recent emigrant from France, while his mother hailed from nearby Fishkill, New York. He was already working for a hat maker at the age of twelve, and was the co-owner of his own shop in New York City seven years later. He left the partnership the next year, and arrived in Philadelphia at the age of twenty. Career =Merchant= Bremond started his own shop in Philadelphia. In this new enterprise, he purchased assembled hats— \\"in the rough\\"—and finished them. After six years of selling hats, he may have made as much as $40,000 in profits, though he lost much of this wealth in the Panic of 1837. By 1839 Bremond located to the new town of Galveston in the Republic of Texas. However, the ship carrying his possessions, the brig Virginia, ran aground and all of his personal property was lost. The next year, though, he started his own auction house, and also operated as a commission merchant. These ventures were profitable, and he invested the proceeds in various Texas businesses while forming business relationships with William Van Alstyne and William Marsh Rice. =Railroads= Map of Houston and Texas Central Railroad, 1867 Bremond focused new investment upon transportation enterprises by the 1850s. These first gambles on this business sector included a plank road from Houston to the Brazos Valley, and the Galveston and Red River Railroad. Though Bremond was from Galveston, he favored a segment running from Houston toward central Texas, and a diverse group of investors—including Ebenezer Allen (Texas politician), Thomas William House, Sr., William J. Hutchins, Francis Moore, Benjamin A. Shepherd, and James H. Stevens—joined Bremond, Rice, and Van Alstyne.Maxwell (1998), pp. 6–7. Service began between Houston and Cypress in 1856, just a year after construction started. An extension of the railroad was complete to Hempstead in 1858, and the railway was renamed the Houston and Texas Central Railroad. Bremond served as the company's president through 1858, though he persisted as an investor. Bremond was an avowed spiritualist. He started his own spiritualist group in Houston, and claimed that his \\"spirit guide,\\" Moseley Baker, gave him instructions from the grave to build a new railroad through the Piney Woods.Maxwell (1998), p. 9. In 1875, Bremond gained a charter from the state of Texas for the Houston, East and West Railway, with a grant to build as far north as the Red River (Texas). The charter also authorized the company to build branches through east Texas, with possible western routes to Laredo, Corpus Christi, and Waco. At an organization meeting of the nascent firm, Bremond was selected to serve as president. He was also the dominant shareholder among the incorporators, holding more shares than the combined stock owned by all others at the meeting. Construction began in Houston in 1876 at a junction of the Texas and New Orleans Railroad. Bremond opted for a narrow gauge railroad to be financed through his Texas land grants and from timber freight revenue.Maxwell (1998), pp. 11–13. Late in 1876, Bremond found his first two locomotives in Philadelphia, the Centennial and the Girard, which were transported over water to Texas. The new railroad project faced a great natural obstacle: the West Fork of the San Jacinto River. Bremond ordered a steel bridge from the Cincinnati Bridge Company, which was sent to the construction site via barge. The first twenty-mile segment was ready for operation to New Caney in April 1877. A year later track was extended another twenty-three miles to Cleveland, with daily service available to both towns and the five sawmills along the route. The railroad offered Sunday excursions to supplement its revenues.Maxwell (1998), pp. 13–15. Bremond insisted that additional investment in the railroad should be solicited from local sources, arguing that this would better align the interests of the railroad with those of the community. A half million dollars of the firm's original capital was invested by Bremond. By contrast, the other incorporators only placed small amounts of money at risk. So much of the railroad was associated with Bremond that it was commonly known as \\"Bremond's Road.\\" Another indication of this association was his issuance of company drafts to himself and his family, drawing $150,000 from the company account and replacing $97,000 during one period. Bremond amassed land in twelve Texas counties on his own account, and transferred some of these acquisitions to the company to be used as right-of-way.Maxwell (1998), pp. 17–18. Bremond did not succeed in raising sufficient capital from local sources, and in 1878, he issued $1.3 million in first-mortgage bonds through Union Trust Company of New York City. After fees and commissions, this bond issue raised $1 million, enough to finish the railroad to Nacogdoches by 1883.Maxwell (1998), p. 20. The Houston, East and West Railway offered daily service on the 140-mile route between Houston and Nacogdoches.Maxwell (1998), p. 25. In April 1882, The Texas legislature voided the Railroad Land Grant Law, ending the issuance of land certificates to developers of railroads. This implied losing one source of revenue to the company. In 1883, the Houston, East and West Railway had spent all capital from its first bond issue, and Bremond proposed another round of financing to the company directors. He obtained thirty-year financing for an additional $750,000 from Union Trust Bank, raising the company's total debt to $2 million. With this infusion of capital, the company built a viaduct over the Sabine River, taking the road into Louisiana.Maxwell (1998), pp. 28–29. Personal life Bremond married three times. In 1831, he married Harriet Martha Sprouls (died 1846), a native of New York City. Their only son, Edward, served as head of the Houston Fire Department. After 1846, Bremond married Mary E. Van Alstyne, with whom he had five daughters. He was widowed a second time, and he wedded Viscountess Mary Louise de Valernes in 1870.Maxwell (1998), pp. 8–9. Margaret Bremond, daughter of Paul and Harriet, married William Marsh Rice in 1850. Death and legacy Bremond died in Galveston on May 8, 1885 and was interred at Houston's Glenwood Cemetery. He was survived by Mary Louise Bremond, who inherited his shares in the Houston, East and West Railway. His son, Edmund, was appointed as a company director.Maxwell (1998), pp. 37. Though the Houston Post estimated Bremond's wealth at over $2 million upon his death, his lost money in the Houston and Texas Central Railroad, and in the Houston, East and West Railway.Maxwell (1998). pp. 3335. Bremond is the namesake of Bremond, Texas, as well as the namesake of streets in several Texas towns.

Biography  Meshcheryakov was born on February 9, 1978 in the Moscow Oblast. He had two brothers, and grew up in a good family. Before the murders, he had no connections to the crime world. After graduating from high school, he served in the army, then graduated the vocational school with the welder specialty. He worked as a driver in a motor company in his hometown, and had impeccable characteristics. However, as Meshcheryakov's parents later told the investigators, he had suffered a brain injury as a child, and it was not possible to overcome the negative consequences in the end. In the army, Meshcheryakov laid in a hospital after a nervous breakdown, and later became ill with diabetes mellitus. His friends noted that Meshcheryakov was a rather reserved and uncommunicative person, but none of them could believe that he would later become a murderer. The first murder Meshcheryakov committed was in September 2002, in the area of the Lytkarinskoye Highway. Having deceived a woman into his car pretending to be a taxi driver, he dragged her into the forest, killed her and then took her money and valuables, leaving the corpse in the lover's lane, where it was later discovered. After this, Meshcheryakov committed four more murders, all of them in the same way: he told his victims that during the installation of gas-cylinder equipment in his car, an error occurred, and he needed to change the back seats to tighten the screws. While sitting in the backseat, he tied a rope around his victims' necks, and strangled them, taking their money and valuables afterwards. = Arrest and trial = Meshcheryakov was detained for the first time on suspicion of murder near the Moscow Kazansky railway station in Moscow, where he tried to sell the belongings of the dead. However, Andrei insisted that he bought these things from an unknown man. There was no evidence against him, and police officers had to let him go. On November 12, 2002, Meshcheryakov's car was stopped on a GAI post on one of the motor roads of the Moscow Oblast. In the car, the windshield and the front panel were smashed. As it later turned out, Andrei tried to stifle the sixth victim, but later damaged his car. As a result, Meshcheryakov with the victim to keep silent about it, but he was still detained. Initially, Meshcheryakov confessed only to the attempted murder of the sixth victim, but soon confessed to the remaining murders. Despite the psychopathic disorders found in Meshcheryakov during the forensic examination, he was found to be sane because he could fully account for his actions. In September 2003, the Moscow Regional Court sentenced him to 25 years in prison, instead of life imprisonment, which the prosecution required. At the same time he was prescribed compulsory outpatient treatment from a psychiatrist. Meshcheryakov cried at the last day of the trial, asking for forgiveness for the 5 murders, fully admitting his guilt. The Supreme Court of Russia upheld the verdict without changing.

He is a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. In the past he has served on the panel assessing nominations for Fellowship within the construction sector.  Early life and career  Roger Sainsbury was born in Hitchin in Hertfordshire. From 1959 to 1962 he read engineering at Keble College, Oxford, and then began his career as a designer at consultants Rendel, Palmer and Tritton. He worked on the design of Fawley power station, and then on site. The engineering challenges of that project made it a great learning ground for a young engineer. In 1966 he joined Mowlem and a year later was promoted to lead the team designing Immingham oil terminal, a design-and-construct undertaking. The project ran into difficulty owing to flow-induced oscillation of the tubular piles – a phenomenon capable of destroying major structures, never before encountered. Sainsbury led a multi-skilled team in solving the problem. The Natwest Tower (2011 photograph) He worked as project engineer, and then as project director, on the construction of the NatWest Tower (now Tower 42) in the City. This was an extraordinary structure, the building of which called for many innovative techniques. In 1979 he and a colleague shared the Man of the Year award from Construction News for work on that project. As a main board director, he was made responsible for Mowlem’s efforts in the field now known as PFI. Experience in the running of prisons was enlightening. A successful venture, in consortium with others, was the project to create the Manchester Metrolink. Sainsbury was responsible for setting up the company to run the system and was its first chairman. Next came London City Airport. The originator of this bold concept was Mowlem chairman, Sir Philip Beck. Sainsbury was responsible for delivering the project and setting up the operating company – and, soon after, for developing the runway extension which has allowed the airport to accept the wide variety of aircraft now operating.  Institution of Civil Engineers  With co-authors, Sainsbury has written papers for the Institution on the Immingham, NatWest and City Airport projects, for each of which he was awarded an ICE medal. In a later reference to Immingham and to his revealing of the key parameter to prevent future danger from structural oscillation, he said, “I have every reason to believe that I was the first person in the history of the world to know this. I felt at the time, and have been conscious since, how very extraordinary that was” He served as a member of Council in the 1970s and, much later, was elected to serve as vice president and then president (1998-9). Sainsbury was chairman of the ICE’s commercial arm, Thomas Telford (Holdings); in this role he supported the sale of the magazine publishing business. His presidential address (1) focused on learning from the experience of engineering difficulties. As president, he visited The Philippines, Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Ireland, France, Spain and Portugal. His official ICE portrait was painted by Christian Furr. In 2000 Sainsbury, as immediate past president, became involved in controversy over the proposal before Council that incorporated engineers be admitted to full membership and be allowed to use the post- nominal letters MICE. At a Council meeting in April he spoke against the move. The proposal was passed by Council, and enabling bye-law changes were approved by a ballot of the membership. In February 2001, Sainsbury became the first past president in the history of the Institution to resign his membership (the ICE was founded in 1818 and elected its first president in 1820). He explained that he had resigned because the bye-law changes put to the membership ballot were not those which had been approved by Council.(1)  Personal life  Since retirement, Sainsbury has committed his time to a number of charities. He was secretary of a residential care home, chairman of the local branch of the National Association of Decorative and Fine Arts Societies (now the Arts Society), and stewardship officer for his church. After three years of research, he published a history of that church. Following some years as a trustee, he was from 2014 to 2018 executive chairman of Hampstead Garden Opera (now HGO Trust Ltd). He has a wife Susan who, for many years, supported him in journeys around Europe searching for wild orchids. In years 2000-9 they completed together an unusual and deeply satisfying retirement project – to spend a three night week-end in each of England’s towns and cities having an Anglican cathedral. Of these there are 43, and each visit was carefully recorded. The couple have been active in supporting Keble college and, in2014, presented a new college register, which is signed by all matriculating students – the one previous register having been filled after 145 years.

The legendary Medb Lethderg was daughter of Conan, king of Cualu. James MacKillop identifies the Fir Chualann with the Cauci of Ptolemy's world map. As early as 1946, T. F.

West Suffolk was created by merging Forest Heath and St Edmundsbury. East Suffolk was created by merging Suffolk Coastal and Waveney. These new districts are not unitary authorities, and the two-tier structure of county and district councils remains in place.

For details of the inaugural elections to the new councils, see 2021 North Northamptonshire Council election and 2021 West Northamptonshire Council election. =Somerset= *Status: Proposed Changes in Somerset have been under consideration since at least 2018. In 2020, Somerset County Council submitted a proposal known as \\"One Somerset\\" to the Government. Under this plan, the county council and the four non-metropolitan districts of Mendip, Sedgemoor, Somerset West and Taunton and South Somerset would be replaced by a single unitary authority. The proposal awaits approval by Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick and by Parliament. The four district councils have created a rival proposal, known as \\"Stronger Somerset\\", where the county and district councils would be replaced by two unitary authorities. Mendip and South Somerset would be merged to create Eastern Somerset, while Sedgemoor and Somerset West and Taunton would be merged to create Western Somerset. The district councils argue that a single authority would be too far removed from the citizens, and say that forming two instead of one would help save £204 million. District councillors agreed to this plan in August 2020, but it too awaits approval by the Communities Secretary and by Parliament. The existing unitary authorities of Bath and North East Somerset and North Somerset would not be affected under either plan; depending on whether the One Somerset or Stronger Somerset plan is implemented, the ceremonial county of Somerset would be composed of either three or four unitary authorities.

Writers used Alf's influence over Ryder to help him improve his behaviour. The actor believed that Ryder grew up and matured during his first year on the show. The writers made a friendship group between Ryder, Coco Astoni (Anna Cocquerel) and Raffy Morrison (Olivia Deeble). They compete for his attention but Ryder develops an attraction to Coco. The pair go on to have an on/off relationship. Ryder later befriends Ty Anderson (Darius Williams), who was Home and Away's first gay character in years. Writers planned a same-sex kiss scene for Ryder and Ty. When the pair spend time alone together Ty kisses Ryder who does not reciprocate. Despite not feeling the same, Ryder has a positive reaction and is supportive of his best friend. The scene was controversial with some viewers, but the storyline and Ryder's reaction drew praise from critics and viewers. Casting The character and Radovich's casting details were announced on 23 October. Radovich secured the part shortly after graduating from the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts and it marks his first acting role. Ryder is the son of Quinn Jackson (Lara Cox) and grandson of Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher). Radovich thought he had \\"the most terrible audition\\" and subsequently booked a flight to Perth to visit friends. Radovich's agent told him that the two scenarios usually guarantee you get the role. He was later contacted by Home and Away offering him the role, and filming began in May 2017. Ryder made his first on-screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 25 October 2017. The actor was excited for everyone to watch his work. He had felt stuck in \\"limbo\\" during the five months between filming and his character's debut. Development =Characterisation= Ryder is characterised as a \\"mischievous\\" who initially causes \\"havoc\\" upon his arrival in Summer Bay. Radovich stated that his character is a \\"troubled kid with a lot of misguided anger who just wants to be loved. He's trying to reach out and connect with anyone he possibly can.\\" Ryder is also \\"confident\\", \\"cocky\\" and has a \\"cheeky side\\" to his persona. A writer from the show's official website billed the character as having \\"good looks and bad-boy charisma.\\" Radovich has also described his character as \\"a bit of a bad boy but he’s also got a heart of gold.\\" He had previously had a boarding school education but he ran away. He steals from other character's early episodes he features in. The actor explained that Ryder \\"ends up finding his way once he settles down in the bay.\\" His grandfather Alf Stewart takes on a \\"fatherly role\\" role and helps Ryder's bad behaviour improve. A writer from the show's official New Zealand website branded the Ryder an \\"over-confident\\" character. Radovich was delighted that Ryder is the grandson of the show's long-standing original character Alf. He told Damien Madigan from The Blue Mountain Gazette that \\"everyone knows who Alf Stewart is so it's pretty crazy. I have to pinch myself knowing my character is related to Alf.\\" He added that working closely with Meagher and Parker was beneficial to his progress in acting as they coached him. Radovich is six years older than his character but found the opportunity to play a school pupil \\"fun\\". He told Daniel Kilkelly that \\"I think having a second chance at it is quite a lot of fun.\\" He added that despite Ryder being much younger than him, he found it easy to relate to that point in Ryder's life. Radovich believed that writers slowly matured the character into someone who more responsible and appreciative of his friends. He told Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy that \\"he came into the Bay being quite a larrikin and somebody who didn't have much responsibility for his actions. I think that now he's got a support group of friends, he's realised how important they are to him.\\" Ryder has a sensitive side which writers began showcasing more often and the actor found it more interesting to play. Radovich felt that it made Ryder \\"a more mature and well-rounded person\\". Radovich told Sarah Ellis from Inside Soap that he thought Ryder's maturity had always been there but hid behind \\"humour and cracking jokes\\". =Introduction= Ray Meagher plays Ryder's grandfather Alf Stewart.His first scenes see him break into the Surf Club. When he is later caught for trying to steal from Hunter King (Scott Lee) and VJ Patterson (Matt Little), Ryder explains that he is Alf's grandson. Ryder refuses to give out Quinn's phone number, leading his aunt Roo Stewart (Georgie Parker) to suspect he has run away. Ryder also steals money from Alf's wallet and meets local resident Coco Astoni (Anna Cocquerel). Ryder's spate of thefts were the first scenes Radovich had to film on the show. The actor told Ali Cromarty from New Idea that \\"Ryder is caught stealing money and has to run away. It was pretty terrifying and so overwhelming.\\" Ryder's mother Quinn is the long lost daughter of Alf. While in the army he had an affair with Mary Jackson, an American officer stationed in Australia. She left to live in the US and Alf did not know that Quinn had been born. Quinn's initial time in the show brought back bad memories for Alf. Ryder's arrival brings back those memories, especially because writers created an identical scenario with Alf not knowing that Ryder exists. Radovich said that his character if from a \\"broken home\\" and his reason for coming to Summer Bay is to find his family. He wants to know the Stewart family because his life with Quinn is not enough. The actor explained that Quinn is \\"a single mother, who is trying her best, but Ryder is looking for something more.\\" Ryder decides to stay in Summer Bay and live with his estranged family. Parker, who plays Roo told Zoe Burrell from New Idea that her character is \\"extremely excited\\" he is staying and part of the family. Roo wants to be a role model for Ryder and Parker added \\"she's very keen for them all to have a healthy relationship and get along. And to give Ryder stability.\\" Alf is not keen to concentrate on bonding with Ryder. Parker explained that Alf is convinced Ryder will return to live with Quinn and is afraid to build their relationship up only to lose him. Roo \\"has other ideas\\" and is \\"happy\\" Ryder came to live with them. Ryder's bad behaviour escalates following an argument with Quinn. He steals a car, drives off and hits Roo with the car. An Inside Soap reporter said that Ryder is full of \\"fury\\" and is so \\"angry\\" that he fails to notice Roo before running her over. Roo survives but is left in severe pain. Following this Ryder and his friend Raffy Morrison (Olivia Deeble) steal a boat. They are left \\"horrified\\" when they discover the dead body of Dennis Novak (Mirko Grillini) in the sand. =Relationship with Coco Astoni= Writers introduced a \\"love triangle\\" story for Ryder involving Coco and her best friend Raffy. Ryder spends time with both Coco and Raffy during a movie night. Raffy confesses that she likes Ryder causing Coco to hide her own feelings for him. Writers played Ryder and Coco nearly getting into a relationship multiple times but Coco is always hesitant. Each time Ryder shows Coco how much he likes her, Coco's anxiety takes over and they remain friends. Ryder later tries to impress Coco but she is preoccupied with her cancer stricken mother Maggie Astoni (Kestie Morassi). Raffy tells Coco that Ryder may lose interest in her so she decides to pursue and kiss him. Cocquerel told a reporter from Inside Soap that her character wants to prove to Ryder she wants to be with him. She added \\"I think he's a little surprised by her forwardness - but its certainly a welcome move.\\" Raffy encourages Coco to make it official with Ryder. They plan their first date and Coco's normally over protective family support her dating Ryder. Cocquerel explained that Coco \\"really likes\\" Ryder. She described Ryder as \\"a little irresponsible, but he's also kind and funny\\", which Coco likes about him. Despite her excitement, an anxious Coco ruins their first date. When Coco returns from a trip away, she keeps talking about a friend named Jeremy. This causes an issue with Ryder. After a short break-up they get back together. A What's on TV writer said that Ryder is \\"super-excited\\" to be with Coco again and they plan another date. Coco's father Ben Astoni (Rohan Nichol) becomes concerned and asks Alf and Roo to talk with Ryder. Roo offers him advice about her own experience with pregnancy, so he and Coco are aware moving forward in their relationship. =Same sex kiss= The character's role in the show's first gay storyline in nine years became controversial. Ryder was the subject of a same-sex kiss scene with Ty Anderson (Darius Williams). Anti or pro-LGBT viewers argued via the social networking website Facebook, making their views about the kiss public. The reaction was mostly positive, with the show being praised for its new found diversity. The scene was significant for Home and Away because its management had previously edited out controversial kissing scenes in between Charlie Buckton (Esther Anderson) and Joey Collins (Kate Bell) in 2009. Radovich was thrilled to be a part of Ty's gay storyline because the show had not explored the issue much before. He believed it is an important story because some fans had long wanted Home and Away portray gay stories. The show films six months in advance so the anticipated what the audience's reaction to the scene would be. Williams has stated that prior to filming the kiss scene he had been in constant conversation with writers, directors and Radovich about how to portray it. The scene was treated like any other during pre- production. On the day of filming, a number of rehearsals took place without the actors kissing. The final cut features the kiss, which Radovich claimed \\"we just treated it like any other scene.\\" Williams stated that the response he received from viewers was \\"overwhelmingly positive\\". The kiss scene occurs after Ty develops feelings for Ryder, despite dating their friend Raffy. Ty likes to create music and he shares some private songs with Ryder. Radovich called it \\"quite an intimate moment for them.\\" Ty then discusses his friendship with Ryder, who then compliments him.He misunderstands the situation and kisses a surprised Ryder who pulls away. Despite not reciprocating, Ryder is supportive of his friends feelings. Some viewers praised Ryder's positive reaction to Ty's sexuality. The story progresses with Ryder trying to support Ty. He tells Ty that it is okay for him to be gay. The encounter leads to an embarrassed Ty causing a fight with Ryder. Radovich told Digital Spy's Kilkelly that Ryder is shocked about the kiss, but more so because he misjudged Ty's feelings and tried to get him in a relationship with Raffy. He added that \\"Ryder just wants to support Ty as much as possible [...] I think that Ryder's reaction will definitely showcase that.\\" He thinks Ty had a difficult life in foster care and wants to help him. Ryder also wants to protect Raffy, but Radovich explained that Ty is his best mate and \\"he wants to do good by him no matter what.\\" The actor concluded that it helped to show how the character had developed and matured during his time on the show. Reception Johnathon Hughes from the Radio Times branded the character a \\"delinquent dude\\" and Quinn's \\"misbehaving offspring\\". He also named \\"cocky\\" Ryder a \\"bad boy\\" type character. New Idea's Burrell said that Ryder's arrival turned the \\"iconic\\" Stewart family upside down. She branded him the \\"long-lost member\\", \\"troubled teen\\" and newcomer who \\"certainly ruffled a few feathers.\\" A What's on TV reporter opined that Ryder and Ty had an \\"annoying bromance\\". Seth Adamson from TV Soap said that \\"the relationship between Coco and Ryder has been anything but smooth sailing since they first laid eyes on each other months ago.\\" He added that the situation between them was just \\"too intense\\" and branded their first date a \\"debacle\\". He also opined that Ryder arriving in the show was a \\"eerie case of history repeating itself\\", making comparisons to Quinn's arrival twenty-two years earlier.

It uses a computer algorithm to automatically create test items that are the basic building blocks of a psychological test. The method was first described by John R. BormuthBormuth, J. (1969). On a theory of achievement test items. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press. in the 1960s but was not developed until recently. AIG uses a two-step process: first, a test specialist creates a template called an item model; then, a computer algorithm is developed to generate test items.Gierl, M.J., & Haladyna, T.M. (2012). Automatic item generation, theory and practice. New York, NY: Routledge Chapman & Hall. So, instead of a test specialist writing each individual item, computer algorithms generate families of items from a smaller set of parent item models.Glas, C.A.W., van der Linden, W.J., & Geerlings, H. (2010). Estimation of the parameters in an item-cloning model for adaptive testing. In W.J. van der Linden, & C.A.W. Glas (Eds.). Elements of adaptive testing (pp. 289-314).

DOI: 10.1080/15305058.2011.635830. Context In psychological testing, the responses of the test taker to test items provide objective measurement data for a variety of human characteristics.Van der Linden, W.J., & Hambleton, R.K. (1997). Item Response Theory: a brief history, common models, and extensions. In R.K. Hambleton, & W.J. van der Linden (Eds.). Handbook of modern Item Response Theory (pp. 1-31). New York: Springer. Some characteristics measured by psychological and educational tests include academic abilities, school performance, intelligence, motivation, etc. and these tests are frequently used to make decisions that have significant consequences on individuals or groups of individuals. Achieving measurement quality standards, such as test validity, is one of the most important objectives for psychologists and educators.Embretson, S.E. (1999). Issues in the measurement of cognitive abilities. In S.E. Embretson, & S.L. Hershberger (Eds.). The new rules of measurement (pp. 1-15). Mahwah: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. AIG is an approach to test development which can be used to maintain and improve test quality economically in the contemporary environment where computerized testing has increased the need for large numbers of test items. Benefits AIG reduces the cost of producing standardized tests,Rudner, L. (2010). Implementing the graduate management admission test computerized adaptive test. In W.J. van der Linden, and C.A.W. Glas (Eds.). Elements of adaptive testing (pp. 151-165). DOI: 10.1007/978-0-387-85461-8_15. as algorithms can generate many more items in a given amount of time than a human test specialist. It can quickly and easily create parallel test forms, which allow for different test takers to be exposed to different groups of test items with the same level of complexity or difficulty, thus enhancing test security. When combined with computerized adaptive testing, AIG can generate new items or select which already-generated items should be administered next based on the test taker's ability during the administration of the test. AIG is also expected to produce items with a wide range of difficulty, fewer errors in construction, and is expected to permit higher comparability of items due to a more systematic definition of the prototypical item model.Irvine, S. (2002). The foundations of item generation for mass testing. In S.H. Irvine, & P.C. Kyllonen (Eds.). Item generation for test development (pp. 3-34).

Weiss (Ed.), Proceedings of the 2009 GMAC Conference on Computerized Adaptive Testing. Web: www.psych.umn.edu/psylabs/CATCentral. Radicals, incidentals and isomorphs Test development (including AIG) can be enriched if it is based on any cognitive theory. Cognitive processes taken from a given theory are often matched with item features during their construction. The purpose of this is to predetermine a given psychometric parameter, such as item difficulty (from now on: ). Let radicals be those structural elements that significantly affect item parameters and provide the item with certain cognitive requirements. One or more radicals of the item model can be manipulated in order to produce parent item models with different parameters (e.g., ) levels. Each parent can then grow its own family by manipulating other elements that Irvine called incidentals. Incidentals are surface features that suffer random variations from item to item within the same family. Items that have the same structure of radicals and only differ in incidentals are usually labeled as isomorphsBejar, I. I. (2002).

There can be two kinds of Item Cloning: On the one hand, the item model may consist of an item with one or more open places, and cloning is done by filling each place with an element selected from a list of possibilities. On the other hand, the item model could be an intact item which is cloned by introducing transformations, for example changing the angle of an object of spatial ability tests.Glas, C. A. W., and van der Linden, W. J. (2003). Computerized adaptive testing with item cloning. Applied psychological measurement, 27, 247–261. doi: 10.1177/0146621603027004001. The variation of these items’ surface characteristics should not significantly influence the testee's responses. This is the reason why it is believed that incidentals produce only slight differences among the item parameters of the isomorphs. 50px The material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. Current developments A number of item generators have been subjected to objective validation testing. MathGen is a program that generates items to test mathematical achievement. In a 2018 article for the Journal of Educational Measurement, authors Embretson and Kingston conducted an extensive qualitative review and empirical try-outs to evaluate the qualitative and psychometric properties of generated items, concluding that the items were successful and that items generated from the same item structure had predictable psychometric properties.Embretson, S.E., & Kingston, N.M.

Empirical results of psychometric quality are favorable overall, and the tests and items are consistent as measured by multiple psychometric indices.

The computer-generated items showed acceptable psychometric properties. The sets of items administered to these two groups were based on a common set of interlanguage anchor items, which facilitated cross-lingual comparisons of performance.

DOI: 10.1016/j.lindif.2007.03.005. presented studies on automatically generated algebra word problems and examined how a quality control framework of AIG can affect the measurement quality of items. = Automatic generation of figural items = Four-rule-based figural analogy stem automatically generated with the IMak package (for more information, see Blum & Holling, 2018).The Item Maker (IMak) is a program written in the R programming language for plotting figural analogy items. The psychometric properties of 23 IMak- generated items were found to be satisfactory, and item difficulty based on rule generation could be predicted by means of the Linear Logistic Test Model (LLTM). MazeGen is another program coded with R that generates mazes automatically. The psychometric properties of 18 such mazes were found to be optimal, including Rasch model fit and the LLTM prediction of maze difficulty.Loe, B.S., & Rust, J. (2017). The perceptual maze test revisited: evaluating the difficulty of automatically generated mazes. Assessment, 1-16. DOI: 10.1177/1073191117746501. GeomGen is a program that generates figural matrices.Arendasy, M. (2002). Geom-Gen-Ein Itemgenerator für Matrizentestaufgaben. Viena: Eigenverlag. A study which identified sources of measurement bias related to response elimination strategies for figural matrix items concluded that distractor salience favors the pursuit of response elimination strategies and that this knowledge could be incorporated into AIG to improve the construct validity of such items.Arendasy, M.E., & Sommer, M. (2013). Reducing response elimination strategies enhances the construct validity of figural matrices. Intelligence, 41, 234-243. DOI: 10.1016/j.intell.2013.03.006. The same group used AIG to study differential item functioning (DIF) and gender differences associated with mental rotation. They manipulated item design features that have exhibited gender DIF in previous studies, and they showed that the estimates of the effect size of gender differences were compromised by the presence of different kinds of gender DIF that could be related to specific item design features.Arendasy, M.E., & Sommer, M. (2010). Evaluating the contribution of different item features to the effect size of the gender difference in three-dimensional mental rotation using automatic item generation.

DOI:10.1016/j.intell.2010.06.006. Arendasy also studied possible violations of the psychometric quality identified using item response theory (IRT) of automatically generated visuospatial reasoning items. For this purpose, he presented two programs, namely: the already-mentioned GeomGen and the Endless Loop Generator (EsGen). He concluded that GeomGen was more suitable for AIG because IRT principles can be incorporated during item generation.Arendasy, M. (2005). Automatic generation of Rasch-calibrated items: figural matrices test GEOM and Endless-Loops Test EC. International Journal of testing, 5(3), 197-224.

It was designed by Henry Austin Wilshire, and built from 1884. It is also known as Inglewood; Inglenook. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 13 October 2006.  History  Woodlands (originally called Inglewood) pre-dates the development and growth of the Ku-ring-gai municipality. It lies within the boundaries of the original grant given to Ku-ring-gai pioneer, Henry Oliver (1821). It remains as one of the most substantial residential properties built prior to the 1890 subdivision of Oliver's holding. Subdivision of this original block was indicative of the development of large private land holdings into suburban allotments in anticipation of the Hornsby to St Leonards railway line which commenced operation on 1 January 1890. Edward Allyn Braham of Sydney purchased a block of four acres, two roods and twenty seven perches (1.88 hectares) on 4 October 1884 for A£500. Woodlands was built on this block of land. Braham was a gentleman's outfitter of the firm Braham and Mulch.KRGHS, 1996, 45 At the time that Braham purchased the property the Railway Commissioners had not yet acquired part of the land for the Hornsby to St Leonards railway line. On 19 January 1889, the Railway Commissioners acquired a portion of Braham's property for the sum of £134, 17s and 6p. In December 1890, Braham sold the remainder of the property to George Munro, coinciding with the year in which the railway officially opened. Ethel Turner, her stepfather Charles Cope, mother Sarah, sisters Lilian and Rose, and brother Rex, were amongst the new residents that were attracted to Ku-ring-gai with the promise of a healthy new lifestyle, \\"clear of air and free from pollution\\". The Cope family were tenants of the then Inglewood (now Woodlands) from 29 September 1891 until December 1894. During the time that Ethel Turner resided at Inglewood, she was deeply influenced by the native Australian bushland that provided a fundamental component of the setting for Seven Little Australians. The Cope family's move from Paddington to Lindfield was a pivotal part in the writing of Seven Little Australians. The isolation of the suburb of Lindfield \\"had an effect, like adding half a dozen hours or so to days that since leaving school had been filled to the very brim; red, lonely roads running up hill and down dale; silent bushland everywhere filled with towering gums and wattles and the songs and flittings of birds; sunrises and sunsets uninterrupted by houses - of course one wrote a book!\\".From \\"A Chair in the Sun: The Life of Ethel Turner\\", p. 76 The three years spent at Lindfield (now Killara) are well documented in \\"The Diaries of Ethel Turner\\" (Philippa Poole) with references to social engagements, courtship with her future husband, Herbert Curlewis and most importantly commencement of her literary career. Turner's writing during this period was prolific. Apart from the three books written whilst living at Inglewood - Seven Little Australians (1893), The Family at Misrule (1894) and The Story of a Baby (1894), she also wrote many stories and articles that were published in the Illustrated Sydney News, The Parthenon, Tasmanian Mail, The Bulletin, Daily Telegraph and Town and Country Journal. Turner and her family worshipped at St. John's Church at Gordon, she was married in that church, and local identities referred to in her diary included the Pockley family at Killara.KRGHS, 1996, 115 The subsequent ownership of Inglewod by Andrew J. Sievers (1895) marked a new chapter in the history of the property with significant changes to both the exterior and interior. During Sievers' ownership the Victorian Georgian style house, a classic Georgian-styled two-storey villa with attic was remodelled and extended in the then more contemporary Federation Filigree style. It is likely that the house was renamed \\"Woodlands\\" during this period. Sievers returned from his tenure in Europe as Acting Consul to the Royal Swedish and Norwegian Consulate (1887) with significant ideas that added innovations to his home. Sievers' died in 1916 with ownership passing to Agnes Parkinson. Agnes Parkinson in turn sold the property after six years to John Waugh, a bachelor, for the sum of five thousand one hundred pounds. John Waugh died in 1945. Following Waugh's death, Eric B. Mills is understood to have purchased Woodlands in 1946. The property acquired by Eric Mills extended from the present day Kiamala Crescent on the north to Treatts Road on the south and encompassed the formal entry to the property from Treatts Road. The lands formerly associated with Woodlands to its north and east were subdivided and offered for auction under the title of the \\"Waugh Estate\\" on 27 November 1948. The auction by Hardie and Gorman Pty Ltd was the first on-site auction of vacant lots of land following World War II in New South Wales. The auction drew large crowds as restrictions on the sale of vacant lots in the wake of World War II had been lifted on 20 September 1948. On 14 October 1948, the land presently forming the eastern boundary of WoodlandsLot C DP 362736 was added to the property as compensation for land resumed by Ku-ring-gai Council on the northern boundary, to allow for the extension of Kiamala Crescent to Werona Avenue. This parcel of land had previously formed a small part of the original estate. The Mills family later subdivided Woodlands on 24 September 1952, and sold the southern lot fronting Treatts Road.Lot 1 DP 91685 The subsequent construction of a red brick house on this lot resulted in the loss of formal gardens and the alienation of Woodlands from Treatts Road. As a consequence the street address of \\"Woodlands\\" changed to that of the adjoining suburb of Killara. Mature palm trees still mark the former entry to Woodlands on Treatts Road. The house and remnant grounds of Woodlands (Ingelwood) have remained in the ownership of the Mills family and at the time of preparing this information (2006), William J. Mills was the listed owner. Mrs Patricia Mills the wife of Eric B. Mills had an interest in Ethel Turner and wrote an article about her in \\"Descent\\" the genealogical magazine in 1967. =Ethel Turner (1870 - 1958)= Ethel Turner was born on 24 January 1870 at Balby, Yorkshire England, second child of Bennett George Burwell (d. 1872), a commercial traveller and his wife Sarah Jane (née Shaw). Burwell died in Paris during Ethel's infancy. In 1872 Ethel's widowed mother Sarah Jane Burwell married Henry Turner, a widower with six children. They were to have a daughter Jeannie Rose (b.1873). Ethel and her older sister Lilian Wattnall Burwell (1867-1956) took their step father's name and were known by it throughout their professional careers. Turner, a factory manager, fell into financial difficulties and left only 200 pounds when he died at Coventry in August 1878.Australian Dictionary of Biography In 1879 the twice widowed Mrs Turner migrated to NSW with her three daughters, Ethel, Lilian and Rose. Also in her care were her step daughter Lucy Turner and another child known as Annie. On 31 December 1880, Sarah Turner married Charles Cope, a clerk of the NSW Lands Department. The following year, Charles and Sarah had a son, Rex (b.1881). At this time they lived at Woollahra, moving to Paddington in 1885 remaining there until 1890. Turner's autobiographical novel \\"Three Little Maids\\" (1900) describes her mother's struggle to maintain her family in genteel poverty and presents the third marriage to Charles Cope as a means of rescue. Ethel and her older sister Lilian Turner, who would also become an author, attended Sydney Girls High School.Ethel from 1883 -1888 Their literary careers began with the magazine they established at school called the Iris. In 1889 following her graduation from school, Ethel and Lilian founded and co- edited a literary magazine, entitled The Parthenon. The Parthenon consisted of romantic fiction, serial stories, essays, poems, household hints, reviews and letters. By Turner's admission, many of the contributions were contributed by herself and Lilian under various pseudonyms, with the children's page largely being Ethel's responsibility. The Parthenon which lasted for three years sold about 1,500 copies per month and made £50 annually for its editors. The Parthenon had already been in circulation for two years when the Cope family moved to Lindfield in September 1891. Ethel Turner's diaries likened the move to the house in Lindfield (now Killara) to \\"being buried alive to live in a quiet little country place after the bustle and excitement of town life.\\" The lapse of The Parthenon, and Ethel's subsequent contribution to the Illustrated Sydney News in the form of the children's page prepared Ethel for what she referred to as her \\"grand work\\". The move to Lindfield served to provide her with the inspiration for this undertaking. On 24 January 1893, the day of her birthday, Ethel Turner began writing Seven Little Australians. Nine months later in October Turner wrote \\"Finished 7 Little Australians, hurrah. Now I only have to copy out 7 chapters and it is ready to go and hunt for a publisher.\\" The writing of Seven Little Australians was completed while sitting in a low hanging branch of an apple tree in the orchard within the grounds of \\"Inglewood\\". At other times she wrote inside the house both in the drawing room and the bedroom that she shared with Lilian. Seven Little Australians was a watershed in Australian children's literature due to its depiction of an Australian rather than British family. The conflict and melodramatic aspects within the family life of the fictional Woolcott's have ensured the universal longevity which has made it popular worldwide. Following the publication of Seven Little Australians, Turner wrote The Family at Misrule\\" in 1894 and The Story of a Baby in the same year. In December 1894, the Cope family moved to a house they had built in Powell Street, Killara called Bukyangi. By 1896 a further three books were written and published by Turner - The Little Duchess, The Little Larrikin and Miss Bobbie. In April of this same year she married Herbert Raine Curlewis (1869 - 1942), Barrister at Law, and later Judge of the Industrial Arbitration Court (1917) and the District Court (1928). Ethel and Herbert Curlewis moved to a rented cottage at Mosman while building their own house Avenel which overlooked Middle Harbour. This house, Avenel was where Ethel lived for the rest of her life. From 1897 until 1928 Turner wrote and published a further thirty six books. She also became Editor of Sunbeams a weekend coloured comic supplement of the Sydney Sun until 1931. At the peak of her editorship, Turner who called herself Chief Sunbeamer received four thousand letters in one week. It was also during her editorship that Turner encouraged the creation of the iconic comic strip character Ginger Meggs. Ethel and Herbert Curlewis had two children, Ethel Jean Sophia (1898 - 1930) and Adrian Herbert (1901- 1985). Jean Charlton (née Curlewis) who was also an author died of tuberculosis in March 1930, Ethel was said to be so affected by her daughter's untimely death that she did not write another book. Ethel Turner's son Sir Adrian Herbert Curlewis (1901 - 1985), was a Judge, surf life-saver and administrator. He graduated from Sydney University and was called to the Bar in 1927. He served in Malaya in World War II and was a prisoner of war from 1942 to 1945. He was a New South Wales District Court Judge from 1948 to 1971, retiring at the age of 70. He was also President of the Surf Life Saving Association of Australia from 1933 to 1974, and President of the International Council of Surf Life Saving from 1956 to 1973. Ethel Turner died at Mosman on 8 April 1958, in her eighty eighth year. She was buried in the Anglican section of the Northern Suburbs cemetery. Extracts from her diaries were compiled and published by her grand daughter Philippa Poole in 1979. Of the four houses in which Turner completed her writing, Woodlands is only one of the two houses, with Yanalla, that still remain. Ethel and Herbert also lived at Neuk in Mosman and Avenel but these two properites have since been demolished. =Comparison to Grandview= Woodlands (prior to its Federation style modifications) displayed many similarities to the c.1880 \\"Grandview\\" located on the Pacific Highway at Pymble.  Description  Woodlands (formerly known as Inglewood, Inglenook) is situated on approximately corner block (formed of 2 lots) bound by Kiamala Crescent to the north and Werona Avenue to the west. The house occupies a central position on the site with evidence of the original tennis court adjacent to the western side of the house. The original entrance (Treatts Road) is marked by two palm trees, subdivision of the property has altered the original front (southern) boundary. In its original form () the house was a two-storey square brick building reminiscent of the Victorian Georgian style ('a classic Georgian-styled two-storey villa with attic'. The bricks were coated with stucco and marked to give the appearance of ashlar masonry. A paint scrape on one of the external walls suggests that the original stuccoed brickwork was painted a pale red colour. The family that has owned the property since 1946 has advised that the masonry was painted a grey colour when they first purchased it. It was originally approached from what was Treatt's Road, Lindfield. The later subdivision of the property to the south fronting Treatt's Road has had a negative impact on the aesthetic attributes and landmark qualities of Woodlands. The carriage loop was originally accessed with a driveway from Treatts Road as evidenced by two Canary Island palm trees (Phoenix canariensis) on the road which once flanked this driveway entry.Design 5, 2006, 44NB: there are several other such palm trees in a line on the nature strip of this road today - Stuart Read, 28/5/2010 In its present form Woodlands retains the original footprint of the Victorian house with extensive renovations to the external facade of the property and some modifications to the interior in the Federation Filigree style. The Federation Filigree overlay is evident in the timber verandahs extending along the full length of the western side and approximately one third of the eastern perimeter. Midway on the eastern wall is a timber and glass addition which houses the sunroom. Central to the front of the house is a two-storey bay with gable roof, flanked either side by a timber verandah. French doors on both upper and lower storeys are symmetrically aligned to the right and left of the front door. Each French door has adjoining timber shutters. The external brick walls are rendered and painted white. The roof is made of slate tile. Entry into Woodlands is reached by an ascending series of sandstone steps flanked by sandstone step walls. The panelled front door is inset with a stained glass bird motif within a leadlight frame. Australian fauna motifs are repeated throughout - on the interior door leading to the rear of the house, and in a grand stained glass window above the cedar staircase. The garden retains much of its early layout and fabric, with mature trees including the relatively rare Queensland lacebark (Brachychiton discolor), Illawarra flame (B.acerifolium) and two mature eucalypts (likely to be Sydney blue gum, E.saligna) on the nature strip / (Werona Avenue) street providing and retaining a sympathetic \\"bushland\\" or \\"rural\\" setting. The tennis court formerly west of the house has been removed, although evidence of it remains. The existing half carriage loop with its central planting in front (south) of the house may be original features. These are now accessed from Werona Avenue. Access in Ethel Turner's time would have been from Treatts Road which is now subdivided off to form a separate allotment. The rear garden facing Kiamala Crescent was subdivided off in the 1950s (part of it in the 1940s). A mature cocks-comb coral tree (Erythrina christa-galli), some eucalypts and a wooden paling fence face this rear address. Another tennis court was made in the north-east of the house in the 1950s when Kiamala Crescent and Werona Avenue works necessitated removal of the earlier court. = Condition = The property is substantially intact with original brickwork dating back to the 1880s. Subsequent renovations carried out in the early twentieth century include stained glass windows, timber work and fireplaces all of which remain in good condition. During the time in which Andrew J. Sievers was owner, he installed \\"an unusual luxury, a hot water system to serve bathroom, laundry and kitchen\\".P. Mills, \\"The Birthplace of Seven Little Australians\\", Descent, Vol.3, Pt 3, 1967, p. 100 This was an innovation which Sievers' brought with him following his return from Europe where he was Acting Consul to the Royal Swedish and Norwegian Consulate The integrity of Woodlands (formerly known as Inglewood) in terms of its association with the author, Ethel Turner is significant. The Drawing Room and Bedroom where she undertook her writing remain intact. Furthermore, the original footprint of the house remains intact despite the external and internal additions. There is evidence of the original ashlar masonry finish below the verandah which gives a partial view of the external appearance of the property as it was during Ethel Turner's tenure. In terms of its appearance as a Federation property renovated by Sievers, the house is substantially intact despite various subdivisions that have been made to its boundaries throughout its history. = Modifications and dates = ;1884 - 1894 During the period when Ethel Turner was a resident of Woodlands, the dwelling was a square house with a long balcony and a painted striped bullnose verandah roof. Ethel Turner describes the interior of the house in The Diaries of Ethel Turner \\"the Drawing Room is on the left hand side, a nice long room with four windows and pale blue walls. On the right hand side was the Dining room - rather small, with a small room attached. Upstairs were four bedrooms, downstairs kitchen, servant's rooms and various outhouses.' According to plans completed for the Sievers' renovation,Architect Henry- Austin Wilshire the layout of the house is as described by Ethel in her diary: * Drawing Room being * Dining Room being on the ground floor level. * Bedroom 1 being at the front of the house, on the upper level * Bedroom 2 being * Bedroom 3 being * Bedroom 4 being . Evidence suggests that the kitchen and servants quarters were contained within a lean-to style timber building. ;1895 Ownership of the house passed to Andrew Johnstone Sievers in 1895 and subsequent renovations gave the property its current appearance of a distinctly Federation Filigree style property. Cast iron decorations were replaced by turned timber verandah posts, a timber balcony around the perimeter of the building, and a new central two storey front bay with gable roof. Evidence of the attachments of original cast iron frieze and fringe are evident on the lower front wall. On the eastern wall, the base of the verandah has been built over the original ashlar masonry wall, thereby protecting the original colour, a pale red, which can be viewed through a series of shallow arches. Significant alterations were made to the size of the property. Sievers made additions which consisted of a laundry and kitchen and enclosed the verandah to the rear lower portion of the property. A bathroom and additional bedrooms were added to the upstairs level. Sievers also moved the cedar staircase from the front to the back of the hall. *1921 Ku-ring-gai valuation cards stated that the house had 6 rooms and an office, with a slate roof, stables and shed. *1946 acquired by Eric Mills - the property extended from the present day Kiamala Crescent on the north to Treatts Road on the south and encompassed the formal entry to the property from Treatts Road. *1948 The lands formerly associated with Woodlands to its north and east were subdivided and offered for auction under the title of the \\"Waugh Estate\\" on 27 November 1948. *1952 Subdivision of \\"Woodlands\\" and sale of the land fronting Treatts Road, Lindfield. The land subdivided and sold is the present Lot 1 DP 91685. = Further information = Listed on the Local Environment Plan for Ku-ring- gai.  Heritage listing  As at 13 July 2006, the Woodlands (formerly known as Inglewood) is of State heritage significance for its historic association with the acclaimed Australian children's author Ethel Turner (1870 - 1958) whose most famous literary work Seven Little Australians was written during Turner's occupancy of the property. Ethel Turner lived at Woodlands with her family from September 1891 to December 1894. During this period she wrote three books: her first and most famous children's novel 'Seven Little Australians'; its sequel The Family at Misrule; and The Story of a Baby. Seven Little Australians and its sequel were strongly influenced by the social and domestic environment of Woodlands and its natural surroundings creating a provocative portrayal of children and Australian identity in the late 19th century. Seven Little Australians has been in print for well over 100 years. It has sold over several million copies in the English language. It has been translated into at least 13 languages, performed as a stage play and been made into a film, a BBC television series in 1953, a 10 episode television series for the ABC in 1973 and a musical in 1988. Woodlands is one of the earlier substantial Ku-ring-gai residences pre-dating the Hornsby to St Leonards railway line which opened in 1890. The two storey late Victorian Georgian style house demonstrates many aspects of the Federation Filigree style having been remodelled during the Federation period. It provides a rare example of the layering of the Victorian and Federation era styles in domestic architecture. Woodlands was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 13 October 2006 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Woodlands (formerly known as Inglewood) is of Local heritage significance as one of the oldest surviving examples of architecture in the Lindfield/Killara area. It is an excellent surviving example of pre-railway settlement within the Ku-ring-gai municipality. The significance of the property is derived from it being one of few examples of a large residence in Ku-ring-gai, occupied by a businessman (Edward Allyn Braham, merchant), prior to the coming of the railway. The advent of the railway attracted many businessmen to the Ku-ring-gai municipality with the promise of a healthy new lifestyle, 'clear of air and free from the pollution from an inadequate Sydney sewerage system.'Moore, Pike, Proudfoot & Lester Tropman and Associates, Municipality of Ku-ring-gai Heritage Study, 1987 The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. State Significance: Woodlands (formerly known as Inglewood) is of State and local heritage significance for its association with the acclaimed Australian children's author Ethel Turner (1870 - 1958) whose most famous literary work Seven Little Australians was written during Turner's occupancy of the property. Ethel Turner lived at Inglewood with her family from September 1894 to December 1896. During this period she wrote three books: her first and most famous children's novel 'Seven Little Australians'; its sequel The Family at Misrule; and The Story of a Baby. Seven Little Australians has been in print for over 100 years. It has sold over two million copies in the English language. It has been translated into at least 11 languages, performed as a stage play, and been made into a film, a BBC television series in 1953, and a 10 episode television series for the ABC in 1973. The novel and its sequel were strongly influenced by the social and domestic environment of Woodlands and its natural surroundings to create a provocative portrayal of children in late 19th century Australia. Ethel Turner published 42 books during her lifetime. Of the four houses occupied by Ethel Turner during her writing career (1894 - 1928), only \\"Woodlands\\" remains. Although there have been changes to the house both externally and internally, the Drawing Room and the bedroom where Turner wrote her most famous book remain. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Woodlands (formerly known as Inglewood) is aesthetically distinctive and has landmark qualities at the Local level. Although altered from its original fabric, it continues to represent a good example of Federation architecture and fittings. The interior of the property boasts a stained glass window on the rear wall which provides a magnificent backdrop to the hall and cedar staircase. Gardens surrounding the property of Woodlands evoke a past synonymous with nineteenth century gardens as described in Ethel Turner's literature. The property occupies a landmark position high on the ridges of the Hornsby plateau within the Ku- ring-gai municipality. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Local Significance: Ethel Turner is widely known as Australia's most significant children's author. The NSW Premier's Literary Awards have included an Ethel Turner Prize for young people's literature since 1979. Ethel Turner is also commemorated by a plaque on Writer's Walk on Sydney's foreshore. In the suburb of Lindfield, the local bushland reserve is called \\"Seven Little Australians\\" Park in commemoration of her most famous book. In addition the library of Lindfield Public School is named the Ethel Turner Library in her honour. 'Seven Little Australians' is the only Australian children's book to have remained continuously in print since its first publication in 1894. Its translation in 1895 marked it as the first Australian children's publication to have received payment in foreign currency. There have been over forty different editions in ten languages, and its story has been told in the form of stage plays and films. The television serial titled \\"Seven Little Australians\\" made in 1973 continues to be shown on television as recently as 2005. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Local Significance: The underground water tank which supplied the bathroom, laundry and kitchen with hot running water is of local heritage technical significance and merits full investigation and further research. It is situated on the eastern side of the property approximately two metres from the enclosed verandah. The site is likely to yield technological and archaeological relics. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Local Significance: \\"Woodlands\\" (formerly known as 'Inglewood') is a locally rare example of pre-railway settlement in the Ku-ring-gai locality. Written evidence states that A. J. Sievers installed an underground water system to supply the bathroom, laundry and kitchen with hot running water which may be a rare surviving example of this technology. Further investigation is required to determine the extent of its importance. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Local Significance: Woodlands (formerly known as Inglewood) is locally significant as an example of the substantial residential properties which pre-dated the development of the railway and the suburb of Lindfield/Killara. In addition it demonstrates a layering of the Federation architectural style over a mid Victorian building that in its original presentation was not dissimilar to the c.1880 \\"Grandview\\" at Pymble.

It is a private limited company retailing bathroom suites, fittings, accessories and showers directly to consumers via its website.  History  Better Bathrooms Ltd was founded by Colin Stevens. Before Better Bathrooms, Stevens sold golf equipment and clothing on eBay. He then sold bathroom taps, before expanding to a wider range of bathroom equipment. Stevens Left the business in Nov 2017 and sold his shares in April 2018, Stevens retired as Director of the company and was replaced by George Mills Bramston Adam In Nov 2017. The business was then 100% owned by BGF business growth fund. The business was acquired by Roxor Group also owned by BGF in October 2018, before then entering into administration in February 2019. In March 2019, the Better Bathrooms brand was acquired by Buy It Direct Ltd. Upon Buy It Direct taking over ownership of the Better Bathrooms brand, Buy It Direct's Nick Glynne became Managing Director. = Expansion = Stevens launched the website betterbathrooms.com in 2001. Four years after the website launch, the first Better Bathrooms showroom was launched in Wigan, Greater Manchester. This was followed by two more showrooms in the North West, with stores in Warrington in 2007 and Manchester in 2010. A fourth showroom was launched in Leicester in December 2013, and a fifth was opened in Slough in 2014. Their first Scottish showroom was opened in Edinburgh in December 2015. On Boxing Day 2015, a 35,000 sq. ft showroom opened in Birmingham. The latter was the largest showroom to be owned by the bathroom retailer. = Investment = In 2013, private equity firm BGF (Business Growth Fund) paid £10m to acquire a 30 per cent stake in Better Bathrooms. This was part of BGF’s £30 million investment in the North of England. In July 2016, they awarded a £4m follow-on fund to the retailer, bringing the total investment to £14 million. They proceeded to manage the entire Stevens family out of the business and ran the company to huge losses. They subsequently did a paper transaction and sold the business to another business they also own the roxor group. The business quickly went into administration. Stevens was asked to come back as chief executive but declined due to lack of cash and unrealistic Growth plans set by the Previous management team that was the BGF and George Adams.  Awards  Stevens was named Entrepreneur of the Year at the 2012 National Business Awards. 2015 Employer of the year at the National Business awards. In the same year, the company earned itself a place in The Sunday Times Virgin Fast Track 100 after sales hit £36 million. In 2013, the bathroom retailer beat Victoria Plumb, Just Fabrics and World Stores (now owned by Dunelm) to claim the Best Home and Garden Retailer award at the eCommerce Awards for Excellence. In 2015, they were shortlisted for the National Business Awards for the second time. In 2018, Better Bathrooms was nominated in the UKTI Growth Business of the Year category and in the Employer of the Year category.

Lee graduated from Princeton University with a bachelor's degree in 1972, then became a systems programmer (at Texas Instruments from 1972 to 1974 and at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in 1974–1975) and a teacher at Wooster School in Danbury, Connecticut in 1975–1977. He continued his studies at Tufts University in 1977–1978. He received his doctorate from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1982 under the direction of Richard Melrose with dissertation Higher asymptotics of the complex Monge-Ampère equation and geometry of CR manifolds. From 1982 to 1987 Lee was an assistant professor at Harvard University. At the University of Washington he became in 1987 an assistant professor, in 1989 an associate professor, and in 1996 a full professor. His research deals with, among other topics, the Yamabe problem, geometry of and analysis on CR manifolds, and differential geometry questions of general relativity (such as the constraint equations in the initial value problem of Einstein equations and existence of Einstein metrics on manifolds). In 2012 he received, jointly with David Jerison, the Stefan Bergman Prize from the American Mathematical Society. Lee created a mathematical software package named Ricci for performing tensor calculations in differential geometry. Ricci, named in honor of Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro and completed in 1992, consists of 7000 lines of Mathematica code.

She was Professor of Sociology at the University of Bradford from 1972 to 1999, and served as President of the British Sociological Association from 1975 to 1977.  Career  The daughter of John and Marjorie McKenny,Dedication in Sheila Allen, New Minorities, Old Conflicts: Asian and West Indian Migrants in Britain (Random House, 1971). Sheila McKenny was born on 2 November 1930 in Gilberdyke, East Yorkshire, but grew up in Lincolnshire. Her father was chronically unemployed and the family struggled financially during the Great Depression and the Second World War. Her mother valued education and Sheila won a scholarship at the girls' grammar school in Sleaford (Kesteven and Sleaford High School); she was the first in her family to attend a grammar school (her parents had been unable to afford her brother's uniform when he won a place at the boys' equivalent), and went from there to the London School of Economics to read sociology – a venture her father considered \\"pointless\\" for a woman but which her mother also encouraged. After graduating, she completed a postgraduate course in anthropology based on fieldwork in south-east Asia. She was a senior research assistant for a time, and then joined the University of Leicester as a lecturer in sociology in 1961. Five years later, she moved to the University of Bradford to take up a senior lectureship. She was promoted to a readership there in 1971, and then in 1972 became the university's first female professor when she was appointed to the Chair in Sociology. She stayed in the position until retiring in 1999, after which she remained at Bradford as an emeritus professor. Outside of university, she was President of the British Sociological Association from 1975 to 1977.Helen Roberts and Juliet Webster, \\"Sheila Allen: Uncompromising sociologist who pioneered the concept of institutional racism in Britain\\", The Independent, 4 May 2009.

Retrieved 17 September 2018.Anthony Giddens and Gavin MacKenzie (eds.), Social Class and the Division of Labour: Essays in Honour of Ilya Neustadt (Cambridge University Press, 1982), vii.For McKenny's prizes upon leaving school in Sleaford, see \\"Lazy girls warned—Early leavers told 'it's £800 wasted'\\", Lincolnshire Echo, 16 November 1949, p. 1 (retrieved via the British Newspaper Archive, 18 September 2018). McKenny married twice, firstly to Tim Williams in 1953; they divorced, and she married Vic Allen in 1968. They subsequently divorced, but with him she had two daughters, Lucy and Sophie. Her and Allen kept an open house at times, hosting a diverse range of guests from intellectuals to trade unionists. In later life, she suffered from a variety of health problems, and died on 16 January 2009.  Research  From a personal perspective, McKenny (who went by her married name Allen after 1968) became interested in sociology as a means of understanding and improving the world. The Independent described her as \\"an uncompromising intellectual, feminist, and socialist, and an impressive role model for generations of students who were taught, mentored, challenged, argued with and supported by her. For those in authority, she was often 'an impossible woman' precisely because she refused to be bullied and intimidated. She understood the importance of power relations and divisions of every sort in society – ethnicity, class, gender, disability.\\" She wrote widely on issues of race, class and gender, established Bradford's Ethnicity and Social Policy Research Centre, and was director of the Youth and Work: Differential Ethnic Experience project there. She was especially interested in the intersections of race and gender and was probably the first academic to write about institutional racism in a British context (in a 1973 article); she was also interested in the difficulties faced by migrant single women who had to deal with British institutions run by and set up for men. In the mid-1970s, she established one of the earliest women's studies masters courses, and also established evening part-time courses at Bradford, to help people from disadvantaged backgrounds attend university. In 1974, she organised (with Diana Leonard) the first British Sociological Association conference on sexual divisions within society.

It was designed by Sir John Sulman and built from 1895 to 1896. It is also known as Ingleholme and Garage. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  =Turramurra= Turramurra is , above Pymble and from the Sydney central business district. It has an average of of rain per annum, one of the highest for the Sydney metro area. It has a population of close to 11,000 and an area of . It is bordered on one end by the Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park and on the other by Lane Cove National Park. Originally a timber-getting area, European settlement begun in 1822 until after 1850 when orchardists came to occupy extensive landholdings producing a variety of citrus and other fruits including persimmons, custard apples and Chinese pears. The Turramurra railway station was opened on 1 January 1890. The suburb was then known as Eastern Road and it was nearly a year later on 14 December 1890 that Turramurra was named after the Aboriginal word meaning \\"high hill\\". The railway brought immediate progress. In 1881 the population was only 142, by 1891 it was 788 and in 1901 1,306. There was no electricity until 1927, water was piped from Wahroonga Reservoir and the outside loos were regularly emptied by the nightwatchman. The gaslights were lit each evening by the gaslighter. Those with very large properties kept cows for instant milk supply. Many dairies were established and the milkman delivered twice a day. By 1920 fruit fly put an end to all commercial growing of fruit on the North Shore and the land were converted into Chinese gardens.Edwards, 2009, 1-2 =Bobbin Head Road= Bobbin Head Road (formerly Ku-Ring-Gai Chase Road) is said to be an Aboriginal word for \\"a smoky place\\", or, named after a rock resembling a head bobbing in water when the tide comes in, or, said to be the name of a farm owned by one \\"Hutchinson\\". \\"Ku-Ring-Gai\\" is the modified version of the name of the Aboriginal tribe (Guringai) that dwelt in the region. The word was first used by Europeans in the naming of Ku-Ring-Gai Chase National Park. Boomerang Street is from an Aboriginal word for \\"weapon for throwing when hunting\\". =Ku-Ring-Gai Avenue= The most expensive subdivision, with lots of or more available, is the portion around Ku-ring-gai Avenue and Boomerang Street and a number of houses listed in the Sands Directory of 1903 are found here.

He mapped out the road that was to be built to gain access to the site. When the cottage was nearing completion, however, his parents had a change of heart, deciding that the location was too secluded for them and \\"very dull\\". In view of this Sulman bought another property nearby, right on Lane Cove Road (now the Pacific Highway) just across the road from Womerah Avenue. It was there that he built his parents' home. They moved to their new house in 1896 and named it Addiscombe after the village in Croydon on the outskirts of London where they had lived before emigrating to Australia. Ingleholme, Boomerang Street, Turramurra, Sydney, ca. 1906, Ingleholme, Boomerang Street, Turramurra, Sydney, ca. 1906 Sulman decided to move in to the first home and convert it to his family home and named it Ingleholme. The house was in a continual state of flux from the time Sulman decided to move in. He extended it several times as his family grew, major phases of development coinciding with the birth of his children: Geoffrey in 1894, Joan in 1896, Thomas in 1899 and John in 1906. The building he designed occupied a floor space of and comprised a drawing room, dining room, large music room, nine bedrooms, a playroom, two bathrooms, kitchen pantry, storeroom, two box rooms, extensive stabling with asphalted and covered yards, two men's rooms and outbuildings including workshop, cycle and gardener's shops, rubbish destructor and a \\"good gymnasium\\". It was replete with up-to-date home conveniences, water, gas and drainage by a perfectly acting septic tank. The grounds comprised of garden, lawn and orchard and of good paddocks with good views. The garden was laid out formally with spacious lawns, clipped hedges, topiary, a vine walk, a kitchen garden, drying ground, fowl yards, paddocks and a small lucerne patch. The house is built of dark brown brick trimmed with red brick. A series of pitched and hipped roofs are covered with Marseilles tiles from which emanate towers, corbelled chimneys and gables. Sulman used cavity walls in areas exposed to weather and sold walls everywhere else. The deep porch is configured in such a way as to provide more than adequate shelter to visitors from inclement weather. French doors, retractable awnings, louvers and flap shutters kept the rooms cool during summers. John Sulman in front yard of Ingleholme, Boomerang Street, Turramurra, Sydney, ca. 1900 The playroom extension was distinctive because of its size, designed by Sulman to serve the recreation needs of his seven children. It was a \\"fine large room\\" equipped with hung shutters. A glazed bay window above a dais let in natural light. Adjoining this was a large recessed hearth for a log fire with an iron canopy. According to Sulman the playroom was \\"...a source of wonder to the people of the district as there was nothing like it anywhere in the neighbourhood especially to the R.C. orchardists of the vicinity some of whom could hardly be persuaded it was not to be used as a Protestant Chapel, in which case it was intimated it would not last long and might be found in ashes any fine morning. In addition to the fireplace turret there was also a ventilator on the roof which could easily be mistaken for a bell cot. But when it began to be used for its legitimate purpose the fears of the R.C. died down and they even attended an election meeting for Charles Wade when he ran for Parliament.\\"Sulman, \\"The Story of Ingleholme\\", 12/1927, Sulman Papers, ML MSS4480 Red brick accented by white trimmed windows are in the Federation Queen Anne style. Old English vernacular is represented in the use of half-timbered gables and in the oriel windows. The expansive roof extends down onto the verandah. French doors from the principal rooms open out onto the verandah and thence onto the garden. The influence of Kerr and Stevenson may be seen in the configuration of the main spaces and principal rooms. The drawing room features Adam detailing and an inglenook, a distinctive and ubiquitous feature of Sulman's domestic designs; it is the basis of the name Ingleholme. The dining room features cedar- panelled walls. The Sulmans lived at Ingleholme until October 1910 when it became \\"necessary to find a cooler climate\\" and alleviate Geoffrey's predisposition to digestive problems during the summer months and Annie's \\"rheumatism in the hands owing to living on clay soil and shale subsoil\\". They rented lodgings at Katoomba, Wentworth Falls and Medlow Bath in the Blue Mountains before moving to Kihilla at Lawson. Kihilla remained in the ownership of the Sulman family until it was sold in 1953. The Sulman home in Sydney was at Burrangong in Warung (Warrung) Street, McMahons Point.Edwards, 11/2009 pers.comm.

But when it began to be used for its legitimate purpose the fears of the R.C. died down and they even attended an election meeting for Charles Wade when he ran for Parliament.\\". Red brick accented by white trimmed windows are in the Queen Anne style. Old English vernacular is represented in the use of half-timbered gables and in the oriel windows. The expansive roof extends down onto the verandah. French doors from the principal rooms open out onto the verandah and thence onto the garden. The influence of Kerr and Stevenson may be seen in the configuration of the main spaces and principal rooms. The drawing room features Adam detailing and an inglenook, a distinctive and ubiquitous feature of Sulman's domestic designs; it is the basis of the name \\"Ingleholme\\". The dining room features cedar-panelled walls. = Modifications and dates = Ingleholme was in a continual state of flux from the time John Sulman bought it (ostensibly for a home for his parents) and decided to move in himself. He extended it several times as his family grew, major phases of development coinciding with the birth of his children: Geoffrey in 1894, Joan in 1896, Thomas in 1899 and John in 1906. The playroom extension was distinctive because of its size, designed by Sulman to serve the recreation needs of his seven children.

Other halls were then constructed, mostly long, oblong building as well, which remind of the oblong construction of several of the Barabar caves. The archaeological evidence point to a very early construction for this vihara, probably circa 530-400 BCE. This vihara is very different from the later quadrangular vihara built from the 1st century CE in Gandhara. The absence of stupa is also noticeable, contrary to the viharas built with stupas at a later date.

Pasing has been a district of Munich since 1938. In order to distinguish the square from the Munich Marienplatz, it bares the name Pasinger Marienplatz ever since.  History  Marien figure of the Pasinger Mariensäule Modeled after the Munich Marienplatzes, the intersection of the historic river-accompanying main street, (now: Planegger Straße), with the east-west direction extending, former ducal salt road (now: Landsbergerstraße and Bodenseestraße), was named Marienplatz. For this purpose, the Pasinger Mariensäule was inaugurated on 31 October 1880, which at that time consisted of a slender, cast-iron pillar and Madonna statue still used today. Already in 1908, the Mariensäule was dismantled, since the new Tram train line (line 19 and at times also 29) had its end point there and the area was needed for alignment tracks, or a train turning point. As a result of the increasing traffic, an elongated traffic island was built on Marienplatz, where cars could initially be parked. Later, taxi only parking was placed around the traffic island. After the association, Pasinger Mariensäule e.V., began to rebuild the Mariensäule in 1977, the square was redesigned in 1980. A triangular traffic island was created with the Mariensäule in the middle. On the new rectangular pedestal was also a square pillar, upon which a canopy was placed, in which the Madonna statue stood. The statue faced the north, as it did before, towards the so-called Kopfmiller House. The edge of the traffic island was fenced by pillars and chains to the north side and around the pillars were several wide, barrel-like flower tubs. As part of the redevelopment and traffic reduction of the Pasinger center through the construction of the Nordumgehung Pasing (northern bypass), Pasing Marienplatz was rebuilt in 2013 and the Mariensäule was moved a bit to the north. According to plans by landscape architects Burger und Kühn, the old pillar was placed on a circular base, consisting of groups of rings of light granite and dark basalt. The direction that the statue faces was turned to the east (in the direction of Munich).  Location  Kring-Haus The Marienplatz is bordered to the north by the Gasthof zu Post and the Kopfmiller-Haus. On the east side are the so-called Kring-Haus and the Röder-Haus, where retail stores are located. This is followed by the Apothekerhaus with the St. Jakobs Apotheke, founded in 1880; one of the former owners was Fritz Dürrfeld. The south side of Marienplatz borders the Institute of the English Miss. On the west side is the so-called Pappschachtel (cardboard box), a makeshift building with shops and restaurants from the period between the two world wars, the 1921 created little Marienbrunnen and the historically protected Confetti- Haus.  Traffic  The center of Pasing was burdened in recent decades by heavy traffic, because of which the attractiveness of the district suffered and also restricted the development opportunities for retail. The formerly running over the Marienplatz, B 2, was relocated to the Pasinger station north running the Nordumgehung Pasing, at the end of 2012, and the Marienplatz was freed from the east-west transit traffic. The tram has been extended to the Pasinger station and now only touches the Marienplatz marginally when it turns off from the north coming Gleichmannstraße to the East leading Landsberger Straße. This is the only way for cars to drive on the Pasinger Marienplatz, in addition to the turn-off from the west running Bodenseestraße into the south leading Planegger Straße (and vice versa). Only buses and taxis are allowed to cross the square from Planegger Straße.  Criticism  Pasinger Marienplatz before the last transformation The redesign of the Pasinger Marienplatz was accepted differently. Often a positive feature is the enormous decline of former traffic loads and the idea of creating a pedestrian zone. Critics complain however, that the place is not a welcome meeting place due to the lack of greenery (flowers or trees) and the lack of seating, making it feel drab and empty. Even the subsequently erected metal chairs could possibly provide a temporary solution. Likewise, the pattern of the pavement stones can only be seen from an aerial perspective and appear unstructured from the ground. In addition, some critics say that it lacks an enclosure around the base of the Mariensäule, so that prayers could be spoken in a separate area, or the repeated damage to the lights on the base by users of the road could be prevented.

Born at Lower Glanmere, in County Cork in Ireland, Allen moved to Bristol with his parents at an early age. He later emigrated to the United States, where he trained as a boilermaker, but after some years, he returned to Bristol, finding work with the Steam Navigation Company. In 1836, he joined the Friendly Society of Boilermakers, who had just established a branch in the city. He remained active in the union, and by 1848 was acting as a delegate to its annual meeting, which lasted a full twelve days. The union became part of the United Society of Boilermakers and Iron and Steel Shipbuilders (USB), and Allen served as the secretary of its Bristol branch in his spare time. George Brogden, the general secretary of the USB, died suddenly in March 1857, and Allen was elected to replace him. At the time, the union was struggling, with many members unemployed and funds running low. Early in 1858, on his recommendation, unemployment benefits to members were reduced, and by the Autumn, they were entirely stopped. While many members were unhappy with this, its did enable the union to survive, and by the end of the year, it had 3,453 members and reserves of £1,778. Trade improved from 1859 onwards, and the union's position improved, allowing unemployment benefits to be reinstated in 1862. In light of this improved position, Allen asked the union to increase his wages, to match what Brogden had been paid. The union's members voted against this proposal, leading Allen to resign, but he was persuaded to stand in the resulting election, on a platform of being paid at the rate he had previously requested. He easily won the election and returned to office. During the remainder of the 1860s, the union continued to thrive, affiliating to the United Kingdom Alliance of Organised Trades, and then the new Trades Union Congress. However, he faced increasing criticism for his poor grasp of administrative procedures and for lacking a plan for the union's future. As a result, in March 1871 he agreed to retire on a pension of £1 per week.

It was originally co-commissioned by the Old Vic, Sadler's Wells and 14-18 NOW from Kate Prince and her company ZooNation to mark the centenary of the Representation of the People Act 1918 and the end of the First World War. However, it evolved into a full-scale dance, soul, funk and hip hop musical which premiered at the Old Vic from 8 to 22 September 2018, with a book by Prince and Priya Parmar. The main score was written by DJ Walde and Josh Cohen, with additional music by Prince. The premiere production was mounted by Prince's company ZooNation, with Maria Omakinwa (understudying for Genesis Lyneahttps://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/sep/18/sylvia-review-old-vic- suffragette-musical-pankhurst) as Sylvia, Witney White and Verity Blyth as her sisters Christabel and Adela and Beverley Knight as their mother Emmeline. Plot Starting with a flash-forward to Sylvia's expulsion from the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) in 1913, the work returns to Sylvia and Christabel's childhood, their memories of their father Richard's death, the early days of the WSPU, Christabel's relationship with Annie Kenney, the death of Sylvia's brother Frank and particularly Sylvia's close but on-off relationship with Keir Hardie. A sub-plot centres on the political and home life of Winston Churchill, pulled in different directions on the women's suffrage issue by his mother Jennie and his wife Clementine. The stakes are raised by misogynist threats and police brutality, leading Emmeline, Christabel and Flora Drummond towards a more militant stance. The pacifist Sylvia takes issue with this but still takes part in the ensuing window- breaking, imprisonment and hunger strikes. She also disagrees with their strategic delay in seeking the vote for working-class women and their reactions to Hugh Franklin's attack on Churchill and Emily Davison's death, which Sylvia sees as merely capitalising on them for press attention and public support. Ultimately Sylvia is unable to give the unquestioning loyalty required by Christabel and Emmeline and is expelled from the WSPU, freeing her up to form the East London Federation of Suffragettes in tandem with George Lansbury and lead a delegation of working-class East End women to Parliament. Sylvia comes close to achieving her goals with the third of the Conciliation Bills - the Prime Minister makes this conditional on an end to militant action, but Sylvia is unable to convince her mother and sister to call such a truce. Keir Hardie resigns his parliamentary seat in protest at the outbreak of World War One and rapidly descends into ill-health, with his wife reluctantly arranging a final meeting between him and Sylvia. Emmeline suspends suffragette activity for the duration of the war and women over 30 are granted the vote in 1918. In the final scene, Sylvia brings the child she has had with her partner Silvio Corio to attempt one final reconciliation with her mother, only to find Emmeline assisting in Christabel's campaign to win a seat - as a Conservative candidate.

Biography Otakar was born in Rokytno, a village, part of the town of Nové Město na Moravě, where his father was an innkeeper; he later moved to Fryšava pod Žákovou horou. Otakar took his first musical lessons from educator and forester František Dušek, who taught him the violin for five years, and the piano for a year. His father doubted his son's talent and sent him to the Higher Industrial School in Brno, where Otakar failed in the second year. So he started to learn brewing in Nové Město na Moravě. After training, he became a brewer in the brewery in Maffersdorf near Liberec (today Vratislavice nad Nisou). In the brewery he started a band, with great success. During his work in the brewery, he enrolled in the first year of the Prague Conservatory. He studied Pipe organ and composition, where his teachers were Josef Klička and Karel Stecker. He continued to master the piano with Josef Jiránek, and in 1911 he passed the state exam in piano. Then, he taught piano privately, and harmony, and became a choirmaster of the \\"Škroup\\" choir. He married Libuši Ichová. In 1919 he became a teacher of theoretical subjects at the Conservatory. A year later in 1920, he was appointed a professor of theory at the Conservatory. One of his students was Stefania Turkewich. His composer's work is based on the music of Vítězslav Novák and Josef Suk. Studying the scores of these masters led him to the theoretical problems of harmony in 20th century music. He produced several theoretical writings in which he published significant theoretical discoveries, the textbooks Uplná nauka o harmonii na základĕ melodie a rytmu (A Complete Harmony Course on the Basis of Melody and Rhythm; 1922; 6th ed., rev., 1949), Nauka o kontrapunktit, imitaci a fuge (Counterpoint, Imitation and Fugue; 1936; second ed., 1945), and Všeobecná nauka o hudbé (A General Music Course; 1949; completed by F. Bartoš and K. Janeček). For his theoretical and musical work he was elected a full member of the Czech Academy of Sciences and Art in 1928 and twice won the State Prize (1930 and 1937). He died in Prague on 21 January 1943. He was buried in the Fryšavský cemetery. Compositions ORCH.: 2 symphonic poems: Tillotama (1908) and King Menkera (1916–18); Radio Overture (1936); 3 CzechDances for Orch. (1939; also for Nonet).

It was designed by Russell Jack and Pamela Jack and built from 1956 to 1957 by Donald W. Taylor (Bob Ellis?). It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 24 June 2013.  History  =Indigenous history= Material in rock shelters reveals that Aboriginal people inhabited the Sydney region at least from the last ice age over 20,000 years ago. \\"Kuringgai\\" was the language spoken on the north shore.DEST & DUAP, 1996, 42, 135, 138. Although British colonisers originally chose the south side of the harbour for the settlement of the First Fleet in 1788, both the Darug people of the southern shores and the Kuringgai people on the northern shores suffered catastrophic loss of life in the smallpox epidemic that soon swept through the indigenous population, with a death rate estimated to have been between 50 and 90 per cent. Over the following century there were numerous documentary recordings of the movements of surviving Kuringgai people within the Ku-ring-gai locality, both attending Aboriginal gatherings and collecting European rations such as blankets. There are also several oral history accounts of small clans travelling through the district in the late nineteenth century.Kur-ring-gai Historical Society, 1996, 12-13 Aboriginal people continue to live within the municipality. =Ku-ring-gai area history= One of first white settlers in the Ku-ring-gai area was William Henry who farmed land next to the Lane Cove River from 1814. The early European colonisers consisted of itinerant workers, timber-getters, farmers and orchardists, self-sufficient people who often lived in isolated communities. Major transport routes by land and water were in place by the mid-1800s. The construction of the railway in 1890 and the introduction of local government to the area quickly led to the transformation of this series of isolated farming communities into a line of sought-after suburbs. The interwar period (between 1918 and 1939) saw vast improvements in infrastructure and a period of urban consolidation. Almost all of Ku-ring-gai was designated for residential development as opposed to commercial and industrial developments, and very few blocks of flats were permitted before 1940.Ku-ring-gai Council webpage \\"History of Ku-ring-gai\\", sighted 18 July 2012. The period between 1950 and 1980 was marked by a doubling in Ku-ring- gai's population from roughly 50,000 to 100,000 as part of the post-war expansion of Australian cities. The increase since 1980 to around 110,000 has been less rapid. =Jack House= 62 Boundary Road, Wahroonga is part of what was previously a grant to John Terry Hughes in 1842. Hughes was shortly afterwards declared bankrupt. The land was purchased by the Mayor of Glen Innes, Valentine Sachs in the 1890s with the proceeds from his mining ventures. When Russell and Pamela Jack purchased the site from a Mr Wayland in 1955 the land was the last undeveloped block on the street. Jack believed it remained unsold because of the steepness of the site and the creek running diagonally through it.McCartney, 2007, p. 78. The site's location on the north side of Boundary Road meant the council restrictions were not as strict as on the southern side. The northern side permitted the use of timber construction and materials other than tiles for the roof. The Jack House has a flat roof of bituminous membrane. The Jacks originally intended to construct a steel framed house along the western boundary but abandoned the idea due to the high cost involved. This change of approach, with the Jacks opting instead for brick and timber construction, led to a design that harmonised as much as possible with the existing site, even to the extent of accommodating the small creek. As well as the final design being driven by the challenging site, the Jacks also had a commitment to produce economical but human buildings. The war loan house (low interest loans for returned servicemen and women), controlled in both budget and size, reflected a change in direction by many architects during the period. In designing the house for their own family, Russell and Pamela Jack, combined post and beam Japanese aesthetics with North American influences of Frank Lloyd Wright and Richard Neutra, incorporating the natural aspects of the site, utilising exposed construction, natural materials and a modular plan.Jahn, 1997, p. 161. =1950s Sydney architecture= Residential construction in Sydney after WWII was limited to residences using brick and fibro single, double or triple fronted bungalows, with pitched roofs and usually facing the street, regardless of the orientation. Each house was equally spaced from its neighbours in accordance with local regulations.Taylor, p. 12. At the same time Australian architects who had returned from Europe began to embrace the ideas of the modern movement and adapt them to suit the unique Australian climate and environment. The \\"Sydney School\\", a term introduced by Robin Boyd in 1967 (and later classified by Richard Apperly as the Late Twentieth Century Sydney Regional style of architecture), refers to the architecture of the 1950s and 1960s that was concerned with aesthetics and a rejection of technology. In expanding upon the term, Jennifer Taylor identified the style as first being discernable in three Sydney houses, by Peter Muller, Russell Jack and Bill and Ruth Lucas. Although working separately from each other, they shared a sympathy of materials, economy and simplicity, with an appreciation of nature. They each drew inspiration from the sandstone outcrops of Sydney, water views to the harbour, and the steep terrain. A need for climatic appropriateness and an Australian style was being addressed through modest residential designs, such as the Jack House, using post and beam construction that fully explored breaking down the barriers between inside and outside, and achieving a harmonious union with nature.Urford, 2012, p. 676 Sites that had been previously considered unusable, such as the Jack House site, were the ideal sites to utilise the cost-effective solutions of post and beams construction, which could be carefully places to cause minimal disturbance to the site's rocks and trees. An important precedent to the natural siting was provided by Sydney Ancher's Maytone Avenue houses in Killara, NSW (1948–49) where the natural rock outcrops were retained. According to Jennifer Taylor, 1957 was a significant year in domestic design in Sydney. Three important houses were put before the jury for the Sulman Medal. All three of the houses were designed by architects as their own residences; Sydney Ancher's house in Neutral Bay, Bill and Ruth Lucas' house in Castlecrag, and the Jack House in Wahroonga. They were all post and beam structures and all expressed an increased awareness of the potential use of outside space.Taylor, 1984, pp. 11-23 The Jack House was most notable for its treatment of the site. The Jacks positioned the house perched on the brink of the two principal levels on the site and it is regarded as signifying a change in domestic architecture in Sydney in this regard.Taylor, 1984, p. 83 Faced with a difficult site that was densely covered with native trees and outcrops of sandstone, Jack House showed what was achievable within a modest budget and without making a significant impact on the site (AIA). The design incorporated the challenges of the site without removing them, allowing the small existing creek to run beneath the structure, and perching the house out over the slope of the site so as to sit amongst the trees. =Russell and Pamela Jack= Russell Jack studied architecture and planning at Sydney Technical College after returning from active service in the Royal Australian Air Force. Jack worked for Rudder, Littlemore & Rudder during his studies, and graduating in 1950 was awarded the Byera Hadley Travelling Scholarship. He sailed to England in 1952 and met his future wife Pamela Purves Lyttle (1928 - 2006) on board. Lyttle had graduated in architecture from the University of Sydney in 1951 and worked for the Commonwealth Department of Works in Canberra prior to heading overseas. In England, Jack worked for Tripe & Wakeham and Lyttle worked for Stillman & Eastwick-Field. Like many young Australian architects, they travelled around Europe looking at buildings. They married upon their return to Sydney in 1954, and Russell returned to work for Rudder, Littlemore & Rudder until 1956 when he left to set up practice with Denis John Wigram Allen (1926 - ), which lasted until 1976. Allen and Jack were joined by architecture student Keith Cottier in 1957. The firm became Allen Jack + Cottier in 1965. Upon her return from England, Pamela Jack worked for Baldwinson and Booth until 1958, when she went into practice as Pamela Jack Architect. She later studied ceramics at East Sydney technical College and established herself as an accomplished ceramicist. Russell Jack left the practice of Allen Jack + Cottier in 1976, joining the staff of University of NSW as a lecturer, becoming visiting professor.Scott Robertson, 2012, p. 358. Major works by Russell Jack include the Carroll House, St Ives (1959), the Palmer House, Turramurra (1959), the Waterhouse House, St Ives (1962), the Tuckson House, Wahroonga (1961), the Jacobs House, Wahroonga (1963) (Wilkinson Award), the Forsaith House, Pymble (1971), the Griffin House, St Ives (1961), the Selby House, Warrawee (1961), all in NSW, and the Cater House, Canberra, ACT (1965) which won the Canberra Medallion in 1965l and the Canberra RAIA 25 Year medal in 2011.Scott Robertson, 2012, p. 358 Jack House was the winner of the 1957 Sulman Medal for Domestic design. The Sir John Sulman Medal for Architectural Merit in NSW is an annual award presented by the NSW Royal Institute for Architects. Established in 1932 by Sir John Sulman, the original award conditions allowed for domestic and non-domestic entrants. In 1960 a separate category was developed for residential design with the creation of the NSW Wilkinson Award. The Jack House was featured in Architecture in Australia, July/September 1958 (pp. 76–78). =Comparative items= *Bill and Ruth Lucas - The Glass House, 80 The Bulwark, Castlecrag 1957 *Robin Boyd - Lyons House, 733 Port Hacking Road, Dolans Bay, 1966 *Peter Muller - The Audette House, Edinburgh Rd, Castlecrag, 1953 *Sydney Ancher - Maytone Avenue Houses, Killara, 1949 *Arthur Baldwinson - Simpson-Lee House, Roland Ave, Wahroonga, 1959  Description  The Jack House is composed of glass and brick planes, yet is defined more by the skeleton of the post and beam framing which steps down over the sloping site. The house presents a blank wall to the street but it opens up with large planes of glass on to the elevated verandah on the opposite, the north side. The floor on the uphill side relates to the ground level while that on the down side is freely suspended. The pattern of the elements of the dark stained frame against the walls of the white bagged and painted brick towards the street, and against the glass on the private side, emphasizes the order of the module. The house is a single storey flat- roofed dwelling with extensive use of glass and brick panes utilising post and beam construction. The timber frames are set according to a 10-foot module, with this order being reinforced in the partitioning of the rooms and through the use of the dark stained timber frame against the white painted brick front walls. The building occupies a steeply sloped site with frontage to Boundary Road, with the house oriented away from the street and faces northeast towards the bush. A carport, also with a flat roof, is located on the south-eastern corner of the building. The carport is accessed via a driveway from the street.Taylor, 1984, p.33-35 Entry to the house is through an arched opening in a bagged brick wall that screens the house from the street. The archway was considered reactionary at the time, with modernity typically demanding right angles. Jack defended his design choice, reasoning \\"a logical, natural opening in a brick wall is an arch\\".McCartney, 2007, p. 81 The bagged brick wall protects the house's public face from both the street and the neighbours. A timber bridge provides access to the entry space from the carport and the street. The house has a simple L-shaped plan, which centres on a small creek which runs through the site and becomes a hinge to the two wings. The entry space is at the junction of the wings. To the left is the family space, containing the living room, dining room, kitchen and study. To the right is the bedroom and bathroom wing.Metcalf, 1997, p. 89 The house was designed to allow for expansion with the growing family, facilitated by the use of non- structural internal walls. Despite its economical size, the house was intended to feel as \\"psychologically expansive as possible\\", using a free-flowing plan and floor-to-ceiling glass allowing the rooms to open to the bush.McCartney, 2007, p.81 The house is a series of continuous spaces, broken up into specific rooms but without the use of interconnecting doors. The roof and floor planes extend beyond the glass line to increase the sense of space and create unity with the landscape. The same materials were used inside and out for the same reason. = Condition = As at 9 July 2013, the house and interiors are in excellent condition. The garden is a bush setting which is largely intact. Jack House is highly intact including some interior finishes such as wall paper and it retains its original bush setting with its creek. = Modifications and dates = Initially there was no door on the study, allowing the entire living wing to be open. A door has since been added, enabling the space to be made private. The veranda between the main living area and the study has been closed in and two bedrooms added. An initially external wall of grey weathered timber now forms the interior wall of the main bedroom area. All alterations were made by the architects who lived in the house until recently. In the kitchen a set of overhead cupboards similar to those existing on the south wallnhave been added to the northern wall by the original architect. Otherwise all materials and finishes remain. In the laundry the original washing machine recess and its adjacent bench were reversed when a new machine was installed by the architect.  Heritage listing  Built in 1957, Jack House is of State significance as an excellent and intact example of the work of mid-20th century Australian modernist architect Russell Jack. An early proponent of the modern movement in NSW, Jack is attributed with developing the principles of the modern movement into a locally adapted, site responsive architecture which became known as the Late Twentieth Century Sydney Regional style of architecture. Together with Pamela Jack he designed a house which responded to its environment with sensitivity, keeping the natural bush as garden and retaining the creek that runs through the site.The house interiors include cabinetry designed by Jack, selected wallpapers and other furnishings of importance to the overall significance of the house. The house is highly regarded by the architectural profession and is considered to be an influential piece of mid-twentieth century Australian architecture. Its research value as a resource that demonstrates many features of Late Twentieth Century Sydney Regional style of architecture and design in theory and practice, and its capacity to illuminate the work of Russell Jack is proven through the ongoing use of the house as a teaching tool. It is also of State significance as an excellent representative example of the modern movement adapted specifically for the Australian environment in a domestic dwelling with intact interiors and garden setting. It is also a rare surviving and intact example of an award-winning mid twentieth century modern house. Jack House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 24 June 2013 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Jack House is of State significance for its role in the history of Australian architecture and house design. The house demonstrates mid- twentieth century architectural practice in Australia and particularly in the Sydney region. One of the early examples of the Late Twentieth Century Sydney Regional style of architecture, Jack House demonstrates the early application of the modern movement in architecture integrated with an Australian setting. An exemplary piece of modernism, the house reflects an increasing respect for the natural landscape in residential design and is indicative of the evolution of Australian architectural design in the mid 20th century. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Jack House is of State significance as the family home designed by and for Australian architects Russell and Pamela Jack. A highly regarded Australian architect, Russell Jackwas a founding partner John Allan and Russell Jack which subsequently became the firm Allen, Jack and Cottier; the practice continues to be one the most successful architectural firms in Australia. The partnership of John.Allen and Russell Jack was awarded the Sulman Medal for Jack House in 1957 The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Jack House is of State significance as a seminal work of residential modernism. The house design exhibits the influences of the work of Frank Lloyd Wright and Japanese architecture. Russell Jack, somewhat disappointed by European modernism, was influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright's approach and the nature focussed architecture of pre-War Japan. The house is modest in scale with a strong connection between the bush setting and the house, an honest expression of materials expressed through exposed construction, natural materials and a modular plan utilising a primary structure and infill walls. In 1957 Jack House was awarded the Sulman Award for architectural merit in the domestic building category. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Jack House is significant at a State level as it is held in high esteem by the wider community for its cultural values. In particular Jack House is held in very high esteem by the architectural profession as demonstrated by how widely it has been published and through its recognition by the Australian Institute of Architects who have classified Jack House as nationally significant for its humanist sensibility and respect for the natural conditions of the site. The house is regularly used as a teaching opportunity by the owner and others and opened to the public as an excellent example of modernism in Australia. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Jack House has State significance for its research value as a resource that demonstrates many features of Late Twentieth Century Sydney Regional style of architecture and design in theory and practice, and its capacity to illuminate the work of Russell Jack. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Jack House is a rare and substantially intact example of an award-winning mid century modern house. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Jack House is of State significance as an excellent, intact mid-twentieth century example of modernist residential design. Jack House is an excellent, representative and intact example of the work of Russell Jack, one of Australia's early proponents of the modern movement in architecture applied within an Australian context which became known as the Late Twentieth Century Sydney Regional style of architecture. The house is a defining example of the outstanding design skills of a well-regarded Australian architect and clearly demonstrates his design principles of modesty of scale and connection with the natural landscape.

It was designed by Bertrand James Waterhouse of Waterhouse and Lake, and built by Mr Ochs; garden laid out by Mr Mottram. The property is owned by Ku-ring-gai Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 27 May 2005.  History  =Indigenous history= =Gordon district= Historians are not really certain about the origin of the name Gordon. Like Willoughby, it probably commemorates General Sir James Willoughby Gordon who, as the quartermaster-general in England when the First Fleet sailed for NSW in 1787, would have been responsible for outfitting the fleet. One of Gordon's pioneer settlers was Robert McIntosh, who is commemorated by McIntosh Street. In 1832 he planted an orchard, which was situated opposite today's St. John's Anglican Church, on the corner of St. John's Avenue and the Pacific Highway. Another pioneer was John Brown, known as the Squire, who through his trade as a timber-cutter, became prosperous. He first acquired land in the 1850s on the site of the present Ravenswood Methodist Ladies' College. This was also site of the first post office, which opened in 1860, and the brick cottage that housed it still stands in the school grounds. Because the suburb was part of the area known as Lane Cove, this was the name of the first post office. The confusion that resulted caused it to be renamed Gordon in 1879, and the site of the post office was changed. Brown's ambition was to own a square mile of land and to this end he acquired several parcels, until by 1870 he had bought land as far down the North Shore as St.Leonards, where he had a large timber yard. St. John's Church of England, Gordon is another historic point of interest. It was built in 1872 and its rectory in the 1890s. In 1817 Governor Macquarie donated (pounds) 10 towards the building of a small wooden structure, which came to be used as a church, community centre and meeting place. A larger 1832 church was destroyed by bushfire in 1862 and an 1873 church designed by Edmund Blacket was begun and later expanded as the parish grew.Pollen & Healy, 1988, 112-3 When the railway was extended to the North Shore in the 1890s, these suburbs experienced enormous growth and suburbanisation. A subsequent increase in subdivision and land sales changed the character of the area, attracting affluent residents with a tendency to build large houses on substantial areas of land. In due course, many of these estates were further subdivided, and further homes constructed on smaller parcels of land ('Bill').Noel Bell Ridley Smith, 1998 The Gordon railway station opened in 1890. A shire encompassing the area from Willoughby to Hornsby was formed in 1906 and called Ku-Ring-Gai, after the Chase, which had been established in 1894. In 1928 it became a municipality with its headquarters in Gordon (designed by architect, artist and writer, William Hardy-Wilson) on the Pacific Highway.Pollen & Healy, 1988, 113, with additions by Stuart Read, 22 July 2010 =Tulkiyan= Tulkiyan was built on part of the of land that had been granted to Michael Ansell on 30 June 1823. In 1824, the 40 acres was sold to William Fowler, who then leased it to Messrs. Giles and Ritchie. It was further mortgaged to Samuel Lyons, an auctioneer, who, in 1843, finally disposed of the property to Robert McIntosh II who was already a landowner and occupier of other substantial properties in old Lane Cove. Following ownership by Hanna McIntosh, of this land was offered for subdivision in 1895 as Deposited Plan 3267. Lavinia McIntosh obtained title to Lot 3 of Section 1 in 1906, selling to George Chapman in 1912 who in turn transferred his title to Mrs Mary Donaldson in 1913. In 1913, Lot 1 Section of the McIntosh estate was purchased by Mrs Mary Donaldson, wife of merchant William Donaldson, who ran the City Free Stores in Kent Street, Sydney (along with three other properties located opposite, between the present Bushlands Avenue and St. John's Church). The land was one rood, 32 perches in area, and accessible to the railway station. The choice of lot by Mary and William Donaldson was made because of its location: half-way between the Chatswood and Warrawee Bowling Clubs.Wyatt, 2007, 114 Mary Donaldson had admired the houses of several of her friends built by architect B. J. Waterhouse of Waterhouse & Lake Architects. Shortly afterwards the Donaldsons commissioned B. J. Waterhouse of Waterhouse & Lake Architects to design their new home. The original cost of the house was £2,147. The house was designed as a two-storey villa, constructed in brick with a terracotta shingle roof, and designed so that the majority of rooms had their own private outdoor area or patio. Homes opposite the Donaldson property, between the present Bushlands Avenue (formerly Gertrude Avenue) and St John's Church were Cranbrook (occupier Patrick Deery), Kai-Ora, (occupier George West), and Kinawanna (occupier Rev George Brown, a Methodist missionary). The Ku-ring-gai Shire Council was also temporarily occupying the St John's Church of England Hall, a wooden building facing the main street. A year after the house was completed, 1916,Noel Bell Ridley Smith, 1998, 12Noel Bell Ridley Smith, 1998, 14 a timber framed garage was built near the north-west corner of the house, to accommodate Mr Donaldson's first car, a Studebaker. This was subsequently demolished because of white ant activity following Council's acceptance of the property (in 1985). It is understood that Mr Donaldson attempted to extend the curtilage of the property to the east, however the neighbour Mr Underwood who used his property as a market garden declined to sell off any of his land. Mary Donaldson's three children inherited the property in 1950. Margaret Helen Scott Donaldson obtained title in 1975, on the death of her sister, Mary Isabella (Maisie), retaining title until the July 1985 Deed of Trust transferred ownership to Ku-ring-gai Council. =The Donaldson Family= Mary Donaldson had been born Mary Scott, descended from the family of Mungo Scott, a successful flour miller, of Melbourne. The Donaldsons moved to Sydney around 1900 when Mr Donaldson took up a position as accountant at the new Mungo Scott Flour Mill at Haberfield (now Summer Hill) - the mill was opened by his father-in-law. The Scott family was a family of means, and Mary Donaldson had, until her death, title to Tulkiyan. Miss Donaldson's father came from a family of lesser means, and was a banker prior to his marriage into the Scott family. William and Mary Donaldson had three children: William Jnr. ('Bill'), Mary Isabella (Maisie), Margaret Helen Scott. None of the children married. Margaret Donaldson moved to Tulkiyan at age 10, when the home was completed in 1914. She lived there all her life. The house continued in family ownership until 1994, when Margaret died (aged 91) and based on her wishes, Tulkiyan became the property of Ku-ring-gai Municipal council for the use of the community. The (property and) house was acquired (the title deeds of the property and ownership of much of the contents were transferred by Margaret to Ku-Ring-Gai Municipal Council in 1985Noel Bell Ridley Smith, 1998, 10 with a provision for life tenancy; i.e. Council received the house in a fully furnished condition.Museum Services Australia, 2003 A detailed summary report on the property was prepared in 1987, a detailed inventory in 1994, a valuation of important artefacts in 1996, a conservation management plan in 1998 and a plan of management in 2000. Council agreed to form a committee to assist with the management of the property in June 2002 and the Tulkiyan Management Advisory Committee has been active since, assisting with management issues, overseeing works associated with grant funding and the process of placing a custodian/caretaker in the house. The property has been open for public inspection on a casual basis. Over the last decade a consensus emerged that the property was being under-used as a public asset. A number of tentative steps were attempted to overcome this situation, including recruitment of a caretaker (discontinued after a short period) and the preparation of a discussion paper on the future of use of the property.Meredith Walker, 1995 Resolving the future of the property has emerged as a priority for Council. There is also a specific concern that the implementation of measures designed to increase community use be matched by increased earned revenue. A detailed electronic inventory of all material held at Tulkiyan was prepared in 2002 (536 individual records) and an Interpretation Plan for the property in 2002-3.Museum Services Australia, 2003, 1 =The house= As the house has remained in the one family, and as the family did not have any need for major change, little structural alteration was made over the years. B.J. Waterhouse himself was summoned in the early stages to advise on minor details. The family nicknamed him \\"Mr Monday Tuesday\\" because of his tendency to say that he would come on Monday or Tuesday, and then fail to turn up. He also had no car and the family used to suggest that one of the reasons he failed to come was because he was waiting to be called for. The Donaldsons were introduced to B.J. Waterhouse through their friendship with Mrs A. B. Davidson of Neutral Bay. =The Garden= 1914 photographs of the house and setting show a site devoid of significant vegetation. According to (Miss Donaldson) oral history accounts, the property had been used previously for grazing cattle owned by the McIntosh family. According to the same source, B. J. Waterhouse designed the front fence and garden incorporating, it is believed, the design of the front path to the lych gate, the planting of lily pilly (Acmena/Syzygium smithii) on either side of the gate and the driveway entrance to a non-existent garage (built a year after occupation, by an unspecified builder. The garage was not designed by Waterhouse but \\"put up\\" by one, \\"Teddy\\". William's friend, Mr Bond, had persuaded him to buy a Studebaker. Later, William bought a Dodge.Tulkiyan Interim Management Report, 1986 The location of the vegetable gardens, planted to the rear of the property, and the tennis court, towards the south, were also planned by the architect. According to Miss Donaldson, the (front) garden was designed by B. J. Waterhouse and laid out by a Mr Mottram of Fox Valley Road. The front brick wall, drive gates and the main entrance lych gate are most important elements as part of the original design together with the gravel path and drive. Later gardeners were Mr Edwards and a Mr Colbert who also worked on the garden at Eryldene (nearby in Mackintosh Street, Gordon). Again, according to Miss Donaldson, Mary planted bouvardias, irises and columbines (Aquilegia sp./cv.s) in (front) garden beds and the garden itself was \\"made and remade\\" several times.Wyatt, 2007, 115 She recalled that bouvardias were among the original annuals planted (actually these are a perennial shrub but frost tender - perhaps they were discarded each year and more bought the following season)(pers.comm, Stuart Read, 7 July 2008)). Bill planted irises in the back garden. Chinese gardeners also worked in the back garden, planting vegetables along the fence line. The same oral history source also provided the information that the family became keen supporters of the planting of indigenous species in the garden, an interest which complemented Mary's existing interest in the Federation Arts and Crafts movement. This is confirmed by plant invoices and a library of books describing native plants. The garden contains a number of mature trees, particularly on the southern boundary. Some rainforest trees date back to the beginning of the garden, others were planted in the 1940s by Dr William (Bill) Donaldson - he was the plant enthusiast of the family. Bill served in World War 1, then trained as a doctor and practiced in Beecroft. He later returned to Tulkiyan after his parents' deaths and spent much of his retirement time in the garden. Many native trees are rainforest species, some rare.Friends of Tulkiyan, 2008 Bill Donaldson, after he retired, continued Mary's interest in native plants, and a number of indigenous plants can be dated to the 1960s after he retired and returned to the family home. The first and only comprehensive analysis of the garden was undertaken by David Costello, Manager of Parks & Reserves for Ku- Ring-Gai Municipal Council in 1986, after Council obtained title to the property. Costello's plan notes that Margaret had a remarkable memory for the botanical names of many rainforest species, many of which have had their names superseded (changed) since planting. At this time the garden was also visited by rainforest specialists from the Department of Forestry, who commented on the importance of the plantings. From the beginning a Mr Grundy did odd jobs around the house, both in the garden, and in the house. He came from North Sydney, and was not associated with any large firm. When any maintenance work was undertaken, the Donaldson family always attempted to retain the original character of the building, preserving not only original specifications, but details of costs of painting jobs and repair works. Additional roof tiles were stored under the house, and all original gas fittings were retained. A 1986 audit was done of the garden, listing all trees and shrubs at that time (see file). It noted that the 2 lily-pilly trees at the front fence were planted in 1915, and that another different lily pilly, Acmena ingens (syn.A.australis ssp.brachyandra)(with large red fruits) was planted in the 1940s - this one having large red fruits. Many of the receipts of the now mature plantings were kept by Miss Donaldson, whose brother Bill was the plant enthusiast. She had a remarkable memory for plant names and was able to assist in identifying a number of the rainforest tree species. Many of these have had name changes since the time of planting (Acmena changing to Syzygium for example). Shrubs throughout the garden include Prunus spp., azaleas (Rhododendron indicum cv.s), Chinese lanterns (Abutilon sp.), Kaffir lilies (Clivea spp.), lasiandras (Tibouchina spp.), spider flowers (Grevillea spp.), roses and wind flowers (Anemone spp.). Under the direction of Zeny Edwards, with plants supplied by Ku-Ring-Gai Municipal Council and Parkers Nursery, and with the assistance of the Friends of Tulkiyan, the front garden ribbon beds have been planted out and the vegetable garden at the rear revived. Council staff keep the lawn mown and edges trimmed. The custodian keeps the garden, with assistance from Friends of Tulkiyan. =Bertrand James (B.J.) Waterhouse= Bertrand James Waterhouse OBE, known to his friends and colleagues as B.J., was born in Leeds in 1876 and came to Australia with his family when he was 16 years old. He gained his architectural training at Sydney Technical College under the tutelage of John Sulman. At this time (1892) Waterhouse was articled to the English architect John B. Spencer who designed the Strand Arcade. He subsequently worked in the office of W. L. Vernon, Government Architect, until he entered private practice with J. W. H. Lake in 1907 or 1908. During its first decade of practice, the firm designed many houses in the Neutral Bay- Cremorne-Mosman areas, which was being developed rapidly as a \\"desirable\\" harbourside residential locality. His career in domestic architecture was to span some 50 years. Waterhouse had a gift for composing shapes, textures, solids and voids into seemingly casual, informal architecture; he was particularly aware of the needs to build in scale and sympathy with people. Thus his houses have a comfortable and warm character, without fuss or strain, free of unnecessary detail. Waterhouse in his early architecture followed the precepts of the English Arts and Crafts movement and his work has a close affinity to that of Voysey, Bailey Scott and Macintosh. Waterhouse could be described as the Sydney equivalent of English architect C. F. A. Voysey, whose Arts and Crafts houses in England were widely admired in the early twentieth century. A typical Waterhouse residence featured asymmetrical, picturesque massing, strongly expressed roofs, usually with dominant gables; porches, balconies and verandahs; and at least one facetted oriel or bay external wall finish, together with areas of timber shingling or tile-hanging. Inside, the main rooms displayed timber wainscoting on the walls and heavy timber beams below the ceilings. He continued to design in this manner until the early 1920s. In his later years Waterhouse designed residences in the Spanish Mission Style. Waterhouse died, aged 90, in 1965. Tulkiyan was opened to the public as a house-museum by Ku-Ring-Gai Municipal Council. It was closed to the public in 2012 because of public safety concerns. Council is looking for a manager of the property, to operate it as a house museum.Daily Telegraph, 22 September 2015 The Historic Houses Association of Australia (HAA) announced in late 2016 that they have entered an agreement with Ku-Ring-Gai Council to manage Tulkiyan House.HHA Summer 2016-17 Newsletter, 1  Description  Tulkiyan is a remarkably intact survivor of a distinctive phase in the development of domestic architecture in Australia. It is a substantial two storey brick residence located on the north eastern side of the Pacific Highway at Gordon. =Site and garden= The site is . It is bounded by paling fences to the west, north and east, while the southern (Pacific Highway) boundary is a brick fence with timber infill panels (this was replaced in 2007 with a timber retaining wall). The main entrance to Tulkiyan is through a timber gate located under a brick arch with terracotta tile detail in keeping with the detailing of the main house. Two large lily pilly trees frame the brick lych gate to the Pacific Highway front. The gravel driveway (edged with a low brick wall; and a stone wall to its north) is located at the north- western corner of the site, and is entered through this pair of timbered gates. The driveway leads to a garage north-east of the house's rear corner. The gravel path curves across the block towards the front door, joining up with the driveway. On the southern side of the house a sandstone path leads to the rear. An area of lawn is to the house's west, south-west and south. In the lawn to the house's south-east are two beds of roses. A rear garden behind the garage has a shed, incinerator, compost heaps, brick path and areas of garden beds, more lawn and trees lining the north-eastern, eastern and southern boundaries. A layout plan of the garden was prepared in 1987, identifying all plantings (trees, shrubs, herbaceous plants). According to Miss Donaldson, the garden was designed by B. J. Waterhouse and laid out by a Mr Mottram of Fox Valley Road, but has been modified several times. Later gardeners were Mr Edwards and Mr Colbert who also worked at Eryldene nearby.Anthony, 2008, 1 The front brick wall, drive gates and the main entrance lych gate are most important elements as part of the original design together with the gravel path and drive. The front fence of brick and timber complements the house. The original front gate is beneath a brick arch with terracotta shingled hood similar the chimneys. Matching timber gates on the driveway are engraved with the name. The garage was not designed by Waterhouse but \\"put up\\" by one \\"Teddy\\". This has been demolished. The original front garden layout and the pea gravel driveway and path remain, along with remnants of the original garden and early plantings. The red gravel path with brick edges curves diagonally to the north to the front door at the driveway, with ribbon beds on either side. Bouvardias were amongst the original annuals planted, later columbines. In later years Miss Donaldson liked colourful annuals here, and chided the Council to hurry up and plant each season after they had started to do some of the maintenance when she had signed the house over, but still had residence. Two large green glazed frogs sat on the front porch and their positions indicated whether Miss Donaldson wanted visitors or not. There is still a bed of small pink floribunda roses that Miss Donaldson used to pot up for visitors. The two almost symmetrical lily pilly trees on either side of the main gate were apparently planted in 1914 and dominate the front, draped in Spanish moss (Tillandsia sp.). The garden contains a number of mature trees, particularly on the southern boundary. Many of the Australian species are believed to have been planted by Dr William (Bill) Donaldson (son of the original owners) in the 1940s - he was the plant enthusiast of the family. William Jnr. ('Bill') served in World War I, later trained as a doctor and practiced in Beecroft. He later returned to Tulkiyan after his parents' deaths and spent much of his retirement time in the garden. Many native trees are rainforest species, some rare. Lists of (all native) plants date from 1940s-1952. Roses and cottage perennials dominate, as it is maintained by monthly working bees and a few hours work by Council staff. Three miniature pomegranates are planted as they feature in the plaster ceilings of the morning and drawing rooms, while the dining room design shows the fruit ripe and split open. The site has a substantial (eastern) side garden with a sandstone crazy paved path to stairs to the side verandah, which features a compartment accessible to the pantry to deliver bread, milk and meat. The back lawn is flattened, originally a tennis court, now featuring a mature macadamia, a Barklya syringifolia and new sandstone edging around 2 sides, built by Council. The other half is the site of the bricked vegetable beds, a lemon tree, formerly a picking garden and lawn, originally with clothes prop line, now removed. Chinese gardeners planted vegetables along the fence line and later Bill planted irises here. The vegetable garden remained important to Miss Margaret and even at the end of her life she still had rhubarb and strawberries. \\"Mr Grundy\\" came from North Sydney to do odd jobs in the garden and in the house. Early photographs show the block empty of vegetation, (there were vegetable gardens and a cow paddock over the fence) in contrast to today's towering rainforest trees (see below). Native species of trees (featuring huge rainforest trees along the back and sides) and shrubs include: *lily pilly (Acmena smithii), *an enormous Acmena ingens (syn.A.australis ssp.brachyandra)(with large red fruits - this specimen planted in the 1940s), Pararchidendron pruinosum / Abarema saphidoides (snow wood tulip siris), *brush bloodwood (Baloghia inophylla), *forest oak (Allocasuarina torulosa), *aniseed myrtle (Backhousia anisata), *gold blossom tree (Barklya syringifolia), *Illawarra flame tree (Brachychiton acerifolium), *coachwood (Ceratopetalum apetalum), *sassafras (Doryphora sassifras), *blue quandong (Elaeocarpus grandis), *blueberry ash (E.reticulatus), *brush box (Lophostemon confertus), *lemon-scented gum (Corymbia citriodora), *spotted gum (C.maculata), *lemon scented tea tree (Leptospermum petersonii), *cheese tree (Glochidion ferdinandii), *spider flower (Grevillea oleiodes), *silky oak (G.robusta), *native frangipani (Hymenosporum flavum), *Queensland nut (Macadamia tetraphylla), *brown pine (Podocarpus elatus), *firewheel tree (Stenocarpus sinuatus), *broad leaved paperbark (Melaleuca quinquenervia) *Syzygium floribundum (weeping lily pilly/satinash), *Harpulia pendula (tulipwood) and *weeping lily pilly (Waterhousia floribunda). *There are also a smaller tuckeroo (Cupaniopsis anacardioides), *tree fern (Cyathea cooperi) *and a young Buckinghamia celsissima planted by the mayor for the centenary of Ku-ring-Gai Council. Exotic trees and shrubs include: fried egg tree (Gordonia axillaris), Hibiscus sp., jacaranda (J.mimosifolia), crepe myrtle (Lagerstroemia indica), tree tulip (Magnolia sp.), crab apple (Malus sp.), cherry (Prunus sp.), cherry plum (P.x blireana) and sweet bay/bay laurel (Laurus nobilis). Shrubs throughout the garden include Prunus spp., azaleas (Rhododendron indicum cv.s), camellia (C.japonica cv.), Chinese lanterns (Abutilon sp.), Rondeletia amoena with pink flowers and fringe flower (Loropetalum chinense). Ground cover plants include Kaffir lilies (Clivea spp.), lasiandras (Tibouchina spp.), roses and wind flowers (Anemone spp.). Under the direction of Zeny Edwards, with plants supplied by Ku-Ring-Gai Municipal Council and Parkers Nursery, and with the assistance of the Friends of Tulkiyan, the front garden ribbon beds have been planted out and the vegetable garden at the rear revived. Council staff keep the lawn mown and edges trimmed. The custodian keeps the garden, with assistance from Friends of Tulkiyan. =House= The house is designed in the Federation Arts and Crafts style by B. J. Waterhouse. Tulkiyan is an important intact example of Waterhouse's work. The house is asymmetrical with an all embracing roof line covering balconies and verandahs. All major rooms downstairs and bedrooms upstairs have access to verandahs and sleeping out was \\"an activity seen as being conducive to health\\". Tulkiyan means \\"gable\\" in Gaelic. Tulkiyan is a face brick building with steeply pitched terracotta shingled roof and tall chimneys finished with gabled shingled caps. The roof gables are either hung with terracotta shingles or half timbered with bracketed eaves. The main entry is on the northern side of the house via a covered porch which opens under the staircase. The ground floor includes a stair hall, morning room, living room, dining room, kitchen, pantries and maids' room, while the first floor contains the four bedrooms, a bathroom and lavatory. A wide verandah on the eastern side of the house opens off the dining room and overlooks the side garden and former tennis court lawn. Each of the four bedrooms on the first floor has built in cupboards and opens onto a separate balcony. These were often used at this period for sleeping out, an activity seen as being conducive to good health. The interior of the house includes some good examples of Edwardian joinery and hardware., including a built in sideboard accessible from both the dining room and the kitchen and a fine timber stair. The original timber front entry gate is located below a brick arch with a terracotta shingled hood detail similar to that on the chimneys. A matching pair of timber vehicular gates at the driveway entry in engraved with the name Tulkiyan, an aboriginal word meaning \\"happy memories\\". The original layout of the front garden and the pea gravel driveway remain together with remnants of the original garden and early plantings around the house. Tulkiyan is typical of Waterhouse's distinctive Edwardian houses. In his writing he advocated simplicity and straightforwardness in house planning. The house has a remarkable flow of simple spaces on the ground floor and an economy of planning. As in Waterhouse's other domestic designs, the dominant, all embracing roof is a considerable technical achievement dominating the building. It broods over the general mass of the house unifying all its separate parts. Waterhouse wrote: 'The cast shadow on rough cast or brick broken by the light on glass and shutter is most beautiful, and the unifying value of the shadow is very great Balconies and verandahs should either be absorbed within the structural bounding lines of the mass, or be large enough to avoid that meagre and disjointed appearance so detrimental to the design, and should provide sufficient space for living or sleeping and out accommodation now so customary.' The principal wall material unlike many of Waterhouse's contemporary designs is a dark mahogany/brown brick combined with beautiful red/brown plane tiles and gables which are heavily half-timbered and pargetted with rough cast. Interestingly, Waterhouse was to choose a similar brick when he built his own house \\"The Gables\\" in Neutral Bay - between 1920 and 1923. The tall chimneys have their own gabled roofs and are almost a trademark of a Waterhouse design from this period. The large semi-circular arch which defined the front verandah of Tulkiyan echoes a favourite architectural motif of the great American architect, Henry Hobson Richardson. All the outdoor spaces are nicely \\"absorbed\\" into the mass. Each room has an adjacent outdoor space with the necessary requisite for \\"sleeping out\\". The house is approached from a side entrance porch into a large entry and stair hall around which radiate the principal ground floor rooms. To the right through sliding doors is the morning room with a small ingle and a picturesque window seat in a projecting bay. A door opens onto an ample verandah enclosed by a large semi-circular arch. To the left of the morning room through sliding doors and behind the verandah is the living room, behind this again is the dining room again entered by sliding doors and opening onto a loggia. This flow of space from room to room was an innovation used often by Waterhouse in his designs. Directly behind the Entrance Hall is situated the kitchen with a clever pass door and washroom under the stair landing to allow the maid to answer the front door. The rear of the house is occupied by service rooms and maid quarters which surprisingly have the best aspect and views. Contents: Still furnished and decorated exactly as it was when new with many items from David Jones and Beard Watsons: visitors can compare downstairs photos from 1914's The Sydney Mail with today. When soft furnishings wore out they were replaced with similar ones. The fuel stove and gas lights remain, despite electric lights, stove and refrigerator. There is an amazing set of records - receipts for furniture and garden plants, personal items - postcards and souvenirs brought home for the children from an overseas trip. = Condition = As at 4 January 2001, the building is in excellent condition. While the garden has not been maintained to the same degree as the house, sufficient archaeological evidence would exist on site to give a clear indication of the layout and plantings. The house (and its contents) is highly intact. The garden has been compromised but physical evidence of the original path system and driveway survives. The surviving physical and documentary evidence would provide information to allow the reinstatement of the original layout and plantings. = Modifications and dates = There have been very minor alterations to this site, comprising minor alterations to the garden, and changes to the rear entry to the property. Other than these alterations, the house is in near original condition, including the interior. 1916 Garage is built adjoining the house. Other alterations and additions throughout its history: *Metal garden shed *Later galvanised steel balustrade on western elevation, and associated gutter *Later brick garden wall *Later timber boundary fence to north, east and west boundaries. *Pipe handrail adjacent to ramped entry adjacent to the back door *Front and back door lights *Tiling to rear (north) porch *Later bathroom fitout including installation of modern cistern to lavatory *Surface mounted services and power outlets *Contemporary floor finishes to wet areas *Later shelving in pantry and store. *1914 2 almost symmetrical lily pilly trees on either side of the main gate were planted. *1940s The garden contains a number of mature trees, particularly on the southern boundary. Many of the Australian species are believed to have been planted by Dr William (Bill) Donaldson in the 1940s - he was the plant enthusiast of the family. *1998 Roof repairs and maintenance carried out by A. Stanley.  Heritage listing  As at 19 January 2005, Tulkiyan is of State significance as an important, intact example of a fine Arts & Crafts suburban villa, designed by eminent Edwardian architect B.J. Waterhouse of the architectural firm of Waterhouse and Lake, for a prominent local family. The design of the house, together with their contents, represent the taste and lifestyle of the upper middle class in Sydney prior to World War 1, and document the building's ownership and occupation by the Donaldson Family for 80 years with a minimum of alteration from the original 1913 house. The ownership has remained in the one family from the commissioning of the architect to its bequest to Ku-ring-gai Council by Miss Margaret Donaldson in 1985. The largely intact interior is furnished with most of the original contents of the house. There is comprehensive documentary evidence relating to the house, family, contents and garden. The house and its garden setting also represent the suburban expansion of Gordon during the early twentieth century.Noel Bell Ridley Smith, 1998, 43 Tulkiyan was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 27 May 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Tulkiyan is of State and local significance as the house and its contents form a unique representative collection that demonstrate the lifestyle and taste of the upper middle class in suburban Sydney during the early decades of the twentieth century. Tulkiyan is of local significance as the house represents the early phase of residential subdivision in the suburb of Gordon early in the twentieth century. It is associated with the Donaldson family, in particular Mrs Margaret Donaldson, née Scott, and her children. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Tulkiyan is of State and local significance for its ability to demonstrate through physical and documentary evidence the eighty year ownership and occupation of the Donaldson family, who originally commissioned Tulkiyan. Tulkiyan is of State significance as an important and intact example of the work of the eminent architect Bertrand James Waterhouse, OBE, FRIBA, LFRAIA (1876 - 1965). Waterhouse is regarded as the most significant domestic architect to emerge in NSW in the decade immediately before the First World War. The highly successful Architectural Practice formed by B. J. Waterhouse and J. W. Hamilton Lake in 1908 was responsible for the design of numerous stately homes, cottages, churches, cinemas and public buildings, including \\"Brent Knowle\\" (1913) at Neutral Bay, \\"Nutcote\\" (1925) at Neutral Bay and \\"Elwatan\\" (1926) at Castle Hill. Waterhouse was deeply committed to and a great proponent of the Arts and Crafts movement, however his later work embraced a number of architectural styles. The domestic architecture of Waterhouse was widely featured and documented in the publications: Australian Home Beautiful; The Salon; Architecture; Houses and Gardens; and The Home. A measure of Waterhouse's influence and reputation is demonstrated by his prominent appointments and awards. At various times he was President of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects, President of the NSW Board of Architects, Chairman of the National Planning and Development Committee, Canberra, President of the Board of Trustees of the Art gallery of NSW, and in 1949 he was awarded the Gold Medal by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects. Tulkiyan is of local significance for its association with the Donaldson family, in particular Mrs Mary Donaldson née Scott and her children, Mary, William and Margaret. Margaret Donaldson (1903 - 1994) who bequeathed the house and its contents to the community resided in the house for eighty years. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Tulkiyan is of State and local significance as an excellent and highly intact example of the domestic work of the architect Bertrand James Waterhouse from the early years of the architectural practice of Waterhouse and Lake. It is an outstanding example of Arts and Crafts period design, arranging forms in a picturesque manner, utilising high quality materials and detail. The house and its contents form a unique representative collection of the middle class preoccupation with the later manifestations of the English Arts and Crafts movement. The house in its garden setting is visually pleasing and is a well known landmark on the Pacific Highway within the Gordon area. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Tulkiyan is of local heritage significance to the community of Ku-ring-gai and the Ku-ring- gai Historical Society for its ability to reflect the tastes, values and ways of life of a single upper-middle-class family between 1913 - 1993. It is of social value for its place in the affections of the local community and those who knew Miss Margaret Donaldson. It is also important as a property gifted to the community by Miss Donaldson, an active member of the Ku-ring-gai community and Ku-ring-gai Historical Society. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Tulkiyan is of State and local significance as its contents provide an excellent source of information on the lifestyle and taste of an upper-middle-class family in suburban Sydney between the First and Second World Wars. The house is a rare and intact work of B. J. Waterhouse and survives with its full documentation, including documentary evidence of the interior decorations and furnishings, thus allowing considerable research and education opportunities into the methods of design, construction, as well as the lifestyle of the occupants. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Tulkiyan is of State and local significance as its setting and contents combine to form a rare example of an intact Arts and Crafts style residence, reflecting the tastes and lifestyle of an upper-middle-class family during the inter-war period in Sydney. The architectural style and materials of the house, its well known architect, the common use provenance of the furniture, chattels and documents, and the original and uninterrupted occupation and use by a single family make Tulkiyan unique. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Tulkiyan is of State and local significance as an excellent and intact example of the early domestic work of J. B. Waterhouse designed in the Arts and Crafts style. It is outstanding because of the integrity and condition of the house and its contents which demonstrate the lifestyle and tastes of the upper middle class in suburban Sydney during the early decades of the twentieth century. It is widely acknowledged and esteemed by the community of Ku-ring-gai and the architectural profession.

Its purpose is to raise awareness of overdoses, reduce the stigma of drug-related deaths and acknowledge the grief felt by families and friends. It was initiated in 2001 in Australia by SJ Finn who was managing a needle and syringe program at The Salvation Army Crisis Centre in St Kilda, Victoria.https://www.overdoseday.com/about-us/history/ It has been run by the Penington Institute since 2012. The first day, held in 2001 in Australia, saw 6,000 silver ribbons distributed across the country and into New Zealand. Since then the day has grown and is recognized in over 40 countries. So too, sadly, has the death toll from overdose continued to rise. Vigils were held in Vancouver in 2018, where 38 people died of overdose in July 2018. Firefighters in the city attended 6,234 overdose calls in 2017. The Ontario Pharmacists Association issued warnings about the dangers of prescription opioids. In Philadelphia, where 1,217 people died of opioid overdose in 2017 (the highest death rate of any major U.S. city), there were calls for an overdose prevention site in 2018. The Alcoholism & Drug Abuse Council of Orange County, New York organised a candlelight vigil and remembrance ceremony at the Goshen Village Square. Guests were encouraged to bring a photo or other memento of a loved one. In 2020, recovery arts organisations were planning live-stream public performances in four cities of the United Kingdom, replicating a successful initiative of 2019. However, they decided to create videos that would be broadcast on Facebook and YouTube due to the social distance measures of the COVID-19 Pandemic.

To the east is the Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole unitary authority area. County Hall, Dorchester Dorset is a unitary authority area in the county of Dorset, England, which came into existence on 1 April 2019. It covers all of the county except for Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole. The council of the authority is Dorset Council, which was in effect Dorset County Council re- constituted so as to be vested with the powers and duties of five district councils which were also abolished, and shedding its partial responsibility for and powers in Christchurch. History and statutory process Statutory Instruments for re-organisation of Dorset (as to local government) were made in May 2018. These implemented the Future Dorset plan to see all councils then existing within the county abolished and replaced by two new unitary authorities on 1 April 2019. *The unitary authorities of Bournemouth and Poole merged with the non-metropolitan district of Christchurch to create a single unitary authority called Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council, which has since created a BCP abbreviation in much of its work and amenities, to serve the coastal conurbation. *Weymouth and Portland, West Dorset, North Dorset, Purbeck and East Dorset (non-metropolitan districts) combined with the functions vested in Dorset County Council to form Dorset Council. Rationale and other tiers of government As regards to planning decisions, highways, cleaning, education and social care no confusion remains as to the potentially relevant body (including occasional open conflict of powers/responsibilities) between two tiers of local government (which can be the case where county and district councils co-exist). Significant saving (economy of scale) follows from one highly skilled and well-remunerated executive and one body of councillors as compared to six each of varying functions. Co-working measures had long been shown locally to make inroads towards an efficient, combined approach. This delivers better value for ratepayers. Allaying fears of democratic deficit, the council area's population, approximately 367,000, is smaller than the most populous and complex or larger unitary authorities such as Birmingham City Council (serving more than 1,000,000 people) and Wiltshire Council (covering a larger area). The vast majority of the unitary authority area retains another tier of local government, by having a civil parish, a late Victorian innovation which has been reduced to a consultative planning and minor amenities role such as co-funding events, festivities, footpaths and sports facilities during the 20th century. The funding of civil parishes is through a small tax supplement to council tax known as civil parish precept.

A daughter of the Earl of Bantry, she was connected to Muckross House, Macroom Castle, the St Anne's Estate in Dublin, and Ashford Castle. Life Born Olivia Charlotte Hedges-White to Jane Herbert and her husband, William Henry Hare Hedges-White, 3rd Earl of Bantry, on 27 August 1850 in County Cork, she was one of six children, five girls and a boy. Her brother became the last Earl of Bantry. Her family had lived at Muckross House, County Kerry since the 1650s. She married Arthur Guinness on 16 February 1871 at Bantry, County Cork, Ireland. They had no children. Ardilaun enjoyed painting, collecting her watercolours in a bound album, and was a member of the Water Colour Society of Ireland. The works include the landscape around Ashford Castle, the family's main home, and views from the family house in suburban Dublin. The couple completely rebuilt the Dublin house, renaming it from Thornhill to St Anne's, as well as arranging a grand addition to Ashford Castle. By the time they were finished it was considered a grand mansion, and hosted the Prince, later King George V, and Queen Victoria. Ardilaun was known for her gardens and named several roses, as well as having flowers named after her. The Ardilauns were known for the lavish parties and great hospitality they showed, as well as their philanthropic nature. Lady Ardilaun worked with the Mercer Charity Hospital as their benefactor and regularly visiting the patients. She also became a patron of the arts and was greatly admired by Lady Gregory. Ardilaun supported the Irish soldiers of the First World War, providing care packages and letters. She kept all the correspondence, providing a great resource to later historians. However, after the death of her husband and the upheaval of the Irish War of Independence and the Irish civil war, Lady Ardilaun retired to St Anne's. Increasingly cut off and isolated by her status and history, she allowed the house to fall into disrepair and in her final years she moved into the Shelbourne Hotel, where she died aged 75. Legacy She had inherited her birthplace Macroom Castle, and completely restored it and parts of the town, as it had once belonged to her direct ancestor Donough MacCarty, 1st Earl of Clancarty, a leader of Confederate Ireland in the 1640s. After the death of her husband in 1915 she lived there more often. It was nearly destroyed in 1920 along with the town of Macroom when the order was given by Major-General Sir Henry Tudor. Ardilaun was a friend and pleaded with him to spare the town, and he deferred to her. However it was occupied and later destroyed in 1922 by Anti-Treaty forces during the Irish Civil War. She obtained modest compensation from the new Irish Free State, and later sold the castle to a trust for the people of the town. She commented that \\"I am pleased to think that at all events the old inhabitants and the best elements in the town grieve with me for this great loss\\". Her demesne land at Macroom was sold to Macroom's new golf club for £1,500 in 1925.http://macroomgolfclub.com/our-club/club-history/ St Anne's house eventually burned down in 1943, having fallen even further into disrepair, and the grounds are now Dublin's second biggest municipal park. The organ in All Saints' Church, Raheny, where she is buried, was donated by Lady Ardilaun along with several stained glass windows. Lady Ardilaun's architect cousin Katherine Everett recalled visiting the ruins of Macroom Castle in August 1922, soon after the fire, and recorded Olivia's deep sense of loss: \\"When people have been born and have grown up in a house on their own land, where their forebears have lived and died for generations, they may feel not only love for it, but a bond which ties them to every stone and tree and sod of the place\\".Moulton, M.

Description The length of the shell attains 32 mm, its diameter 8.5 mm. (Original description) The shell is slender. The spire is elevated and acute. The aperture is only a little more than one-third as high as the entire shell. The shell contains numerous whorls, 11 or 12 in the spire of the adult. The protoconch is smooth, polished, papillate, thrice coiled. The initial whorls is coiled in a single plane, largely submerged. The succeeding whorls become increasingly less depressed and broadly elevated. The body whorl is moderately high and evenly convex. The line of demarcation between spire and the protoconch is indicated by the protractive thickening of the shell and by the introduction of the axial sculpture. Each of the earlier whorls contains 12 axials, feebly protractive, strongly elevated, undulatory in character, persistent from the area near the appressed posterior margin of the whorl to the anterior suture line. The fasciole is indicated on the first volution of the spire. Faintly impressed spirals appear either at the close of the first or the beginning of the second whorl. The sculpture when well established is similar in general characters to that of Crassispira calligona (Maury, 1910). There are 20 axials upon the body of the holotype, rather low, sharply pinched, restricted entirely to the area in front of the fasciole, on the body persistent to the base of the pillar, equal and uniform in strength throughout their extent and separated from one another by wide, concave intercostals. The spiral sculpture is rather subdued. The primaries in front of the fasciole number normally five on the penultimate whorl, 12 to 15 on the body whorl and columella, very low, broad, overriding the axials, separated by interspirals of approximately the same width in which are intercalated 2, 3, or even 4 microscopically fine secondaries. The spirals are narrower and more threadlike upon the base of the body and the columella, gradually becoming feeble anteriorly and on the anterior fasciole replaced by a fine, close threading. The posterior fasciole is broad, sharply defined, smoothly concave, free from axial sculpture except for conspicuous incrementals. They are very finely located spirally, the three or four threadlets upon the anterior and medial portions the least fine, those behind them mere microscopic striae, commonly obscure. A similar striation generally developed behind the sutural carina, which is sharply elevated but not crowned by a well-defined cord. The suture line is slightly impressed and inconspicuous. The aperture is narrowly clavate. The outer lip is broadly but not strongly arcuate, slightly expanded incrementally. The posterior siphonal notch is broad but rather shallow, symmetrically disposed upon the fasciole. The inner margin of the aperture is constricted at the base of the body, smoothly and rather heavily glazed. The anterior canal is a little long for the genus, rather broad and very feebly recurved. The anterior siphonal fasciole is lirate and incrementally corrugated and broadly emarginate anteriorly.* J. Gardner, the molluscan fauna of the alum bluff group of Florida - USGS.

Life Weisz was born July 2, 1919 in Plzeň, Czechoslovakia, the son of Alexander and Amalia Weisz: they moved to Berlin and finally emigrated to the United States in 1939. He married, and was survived by his wife, Rhoda, and his son, Randy and daughter, Ingrid. He died September 25, 2012 in State College, Pennsylvania. Education Weisz studied physics at the Technical University of Berlin and then at Alabama Polytechnic Institute where he received a B.S. degree in 1940. He took a sabbatical from work and gained a doctorate at ETH Zurich in 1966. Work Weisz produced 91 US patents and more than 180 papers, many related to diffusion behavior, which he applied to solid catalysts, dyeing and movement of chemicals in cells. =Early career= While studying in Berlin, he also worked on Geiger counter instrumentation and cosmic ray measurements at the Institute of Cosmic Radiation Research. After graduating in the USA, he carried out further work in these fields at the Bartol Research Foundation of the Franklin Institute and was seconded to MIT helping to develop a long-range radio navigation system, LORAN. He also taught part-time at Swarthmore College. =Mobil= In 1946 he joined Mobil as a Research Assistant, turning his attention to diffusion and catalysis, eventually rising to become Manager of the Central Research Laboratory, and staying there until his retirement in 1984. It was there that he carried out the work which made him most famous, the development of shape-selective catalysts which revolutionized many petroleum refining and chemical processes. A 1960 paper, \\"Intracrystalline and Molecular-Shape- Selective Catalysis by Zeolite Salts\\", coauthored with Vince Frilette, a Mobil colleague, became the foundation of shape-selective catalysis (which accelerated certain chemical reactions, but only for molecules of particular shape) and one of his most widely cited papers. Processes based on this and subsequent work were first commercialized in the early 1960s. The company permitted him a sabbatical period from 1964 to 1966 at ETH Zurich, where he earned a doctorate setting the foundation for some of the fundamental laws of diffusion in dyeing. =Academic career= From 1974 to 1976 he was a visiting professor at Princeton University. From 1983 he was a Distinguished Professor of Chemical and Bio-Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. From 1993 he was an Adjunct Professor in Chemical Engineering at Pennsylvania State University. In this period he applied chemical and physical principles to biomedical research, including work with Madeleine M. Joullié on the synthesis of a molecule equivalent to heparin which avoided the dangerous side-effects of the natural molecule. Honors *1972 E. V.

Description The length of the shell attains 30 mm, its diameter 9 mm. (Original description) The slender, turreted shell is rather large for the group. The body whorl and the spire almost equal in altitude. The shell contains 10 whorls. The protoconch is broken but small and smooth, probably paucispiral. The adult sculpture reticulate. There are15 axials on the early whorls of the spire, increasing to 24 on the body. They are narrow, sharp, uniformly elevated from the posterior fasciole to the anterior suture and well down upon the base of the body. The spirals are low, regularly spaced fillets overriding the costals. They number 4 on the medial whorls, a fifth appearing directly behind the anterior suture near the body, 15 upon the body whorl. Secondaries are regularly intercalated and, on the body. Tertiaries occur fortuitously. The anterior fasciole is very finely threaded. The posterior fasciole is broad, concave, sharply delimited both by its concavity and the abrupt disappearance of the axials. A prominent cord shows in front of the suture. There are three or four sharp spirals between the cord and the anterior margin of the fasciole and a few irregular filaments between the cord and the closely appressed posterior margin. The suture line is undulated in harmony with the axials. The aperture is narrow and lanceolate. The outer lip is imperfect, not thickened within. The sinus is moderately deep, placed midway between the sutural cord and the anterior margin of the fasciole. The outer lip is obliquely constricted at the base of the body. The parietal wash is thin. The anterior canal is relatively long and slender.* J.

He was well known as a \\"wit, raconteur, [and] fighter for hopeless causes\\". He was born in County Cork and attended Presentation Brothers College, Cork and Clongowes Wood College. The most common story of how he gained the nickname \\"the Pope\\" is when asked at school what he wanted to be when he grew up. A skilled student debater, he was auditor of both the University College Cork Philosophical Society and the Trinity College Dublin Historical Society; his auditorial address to the former was published in a legal journal. He was a Fianna Fáil member of both Cork City Council and Cork County Council in the 1930s, breaking with the party over its internment of republicans under the Offences against the State Act 1939 during the Emergency of the Second World War. The breach curtailed his legal career as a state prosecutor and he later led a precarious life with no permanent home or income; according to John Ryan, his mailing addresses were \\"Main Gate, Trinity College\\", and \\"Men's Hairdresser, Shelbourne Hotel\\". When the young Brendan Behan was held at a borstal in Liverpool, O'Mahony sent a famous telegram that \\"the Pope\\" was coming to defend him. He was on the committee which secured the 1947 release of S-Plan prisoners. Admired for his loquacity and genealogical knowledge, he presented a programme on Radio Éireann, was visiting professor at Southern Illinois University, and wrote a paper on John Conmee. He received the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany for his work for postwar German child refugees. He was a Knight of Malta and Man of the Trees. He tried to run in the 1966 Irish presidential election, securing one of the required four nominations, from North Tipperary County Council. He was sympathetic to elements of Irish heritage dismissed by many at the time as West British, honouring the memory of those who fought in the First World War and supporting the Irish Georgian Society. He proposed a united Ireland as a monarchy under Viscount Gormanston (highest-precedence Catholic in the peerage of Ireland) or the O'Conor Don (heir of Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair, last pre-Norman High King). A portly man, O'Mahony died unexpectedly of a heart attack. After his death, the National Gallery of Ireland purchased a portrait of him. Harry Kernoff also painted him. Friends established a bursary in his memory for study of the Irish diaspora, which was administered by the Royal Irish Academy until 2017.

Petrus Johannes van Reysschoot at the Netherlands Institute for Art History He spent a large part of his career in England, which earned him the nickname den Engelschman ('the Englishman').Victor van der Haeghen, Reysschoot, Pierre-Jean Van in: Biographie nationale de Belgique, Volume 7, p. 232-234 In England he painted history and sporting (i.e. hunting) scenes and was a portrait painter working on commissions particularly from the Midlands gentry.Petrus Johannes van Reysschoot, Danvers Osborn (1715–1753), Governor of New York by Sotheby's Life Petrus Johannes van Reysschoot was born in Gent as the son of Frans and Amelberghe vanden Neste. He was the first painter in a family which would include a large number of painters in the 18th century. He studied in France where he was registered at the Academie Royale in Paris in 1730 and later won a prize.Reginald Howard Wilenski, Flemish Painters, 1430-1830, Volume 1, Viking Press, 1960, p. 398 The Meet Between circa 1736 and 1743 the artist resided and worked in England. In England he painted history and sporting (i.e. hunting) scenes. He was also a portrait painter working on commissions particularly from the Midlands gentry. He was later nicknamed \\"the Englishman\\" because of this long stay in England. He returned to Gent on the occasion of the death of his father on 27 February 1737. On 4 April of that year he attended, as godfather, the baptism of his nephew Petrus Norbertus van Reysschoot, who would become a prominent painter and art educator. By that time he must have already have become wealthy as he bought from his seven co- heirs, for the sum of 550 livres, the paternal house called ‘de Maeght van Ghendt’’ in the Overpoortstraat, a property burdened with heavy debts. Danvers Osborn, Governor of New York On the occasion of the installation of Maria Theresa as Countess of Flanders, the States of Flanders had decided to have four portraits of the sovereign painted which would be displayed under as many dais, two at the Gent City Hall and in Bruges at the Brugse Vrije and the City Hall. Eleven portraits at three quarters size of these paintings were also made for the deputies of the States. By an act of the States dated 29 January 1744, the entire commission was awarded to Petrus Johannes van Reysschoot who at the time was still in London. Van Reysschoot was said to have promised to return soon to Gent and begin the work within two months of the act. After his return to Gent around 1744 he became a sought after history and portrait painter. The governor of the Southern Netherlands Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine visited Gent in September 1752 and participated in the jay-shooting of the local crossbowmen's guild of Saint George. The Prince shot the jay just like his predecessor as governor Isabella had done at the jay-shooting in Brussels of 1615. Van Reysschoot was commissioned to paint a record of this feat that included portraits of the key members of the crossbowmen’s guild.Michel Steels, De Schuttersfeesten van het Sint-Jorisgild in 1752, in: Ghendtsche Tydinghen, Vol 5, Nr 5, (1976), 229 The painting was delivered in 1657 and placed with much pomp in the Guild hall in November of that year. A small-scale version of the composition not including the portraits was created by the Gent painter Filips Karel Marissal and also placed in the Guild Hall (both works are now in the Ghent City Museum).Karel van Lorreinen op de schieting van het Sint-Jorisgild te Gent in 1752, at the Ghent City Museum Van Reysschoot was among the first protectors of the Gent Academy of Arts. His nephew Petrus Norbertus van Reysschoot became one of the most distinguished professors of this institution. The artist died in the house on the Overpoortstraat, which had remained his property, and was buried by the care of the Alexian brothers on 26 February 1772. In the mortuary book held by the brothers, he is registered as an unmarried painter. Work Lovers in a landscape Petrus Johannes van Reysschoot was a prolific painter who painted genre scenes, sporting scenes, landscapes, portraits and Christian religious subjects. He painted fête galantes and fête champêtres, which were inspired by the work of the French painter Jean-Antoine Watteau. These works typically featured figures in ball dress or masquerade costumes disporting themselves amorously in parkland settings. An example is the Fête champêtre with ladies seated by a tree and figures from the commedia dell'arte (Christie's London, South Kensington 30 October 2002 lot 86).Petrus Johannes van Reysschoot (Attributed to), A fête champêtre with ladies seated by a tree and figures from the commedia dell'arte at Christie’s Van Reysschoot was much in demand for his sporting conversation pieces. This genre, which was originally introduced in England by the painter Peter Tillemans of Antwerp had become popular with the English gentry in the 18th century. Examples are The Meet and The Kill (both in the Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent). They were painted for Sir John Frederick of Southwick Park in Hampshire. They show the lord and his party before and during a hunt at his Hascombe Estate in Surrey.

Reception The director of sales and marketing at Dundurn, Margaret Bryant, stated that A Daughter's Deadly Deception had many e-book sales to places outside of Canada. Lau gave the book four of five stars. She concluded that it \\"might not be Truman Capote’s In Cold Blood, but this thorough exploration of what leads seemingly decent people to horrific actions is no tawdry crime paperback, either.\\" The book won the 2017 Arthur Ellis non-fiction award.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. History William Fenton and Robert Leroy founded Fentonville because they believed that a proposed railroad line though Michigan would run through the settlement, making Fentonville a shipping center for the surrounding area. In 1856 the Detroit, Grand Haven and Milwaukee Railway did indeed construct a line through the village, establishing the first railroad in the county. The original depot built in Fentonville was a wood framed building on the north side of the tracks. Over time, Fenton experienced a spurt of growth due to the arrival of the railroad, and the area around the depot was developed with related businesses. In about 1880, the wooden depot burned. In 1882, a new brick depot was constructed on the south side of the tracks. The brick to build the depot was reportedly shipped in from Saranac and Owosso. The new depot served as built until 1923, when it suffered a fire, destroying the roof. The roof was rebuilt to make the structure seen today. The Fenton Depot served the railroad until 1974. After that time, it was purchased by the city of Fenton, and used by the city for various offices, including the Economic Development Office. As of 2015, it served as offices for Southern Lakes Parks & Recreation. Description The Fenton Railroad Depot is a light yellow and red pressed brick structure. Originally built with a gable roof, the current hipped roof with flared eaves was added after the 1923 fire. The interior of the depot remains intact.

It is prepared primarily from roasted corn flour (a.k.a tom brown) and palm nut soup and kidney beans, or any stew as a variety and for mordernization with assorted other ingredients. Its a food that is served on special occasions and it is feared to go extinct. Aprapransa in a Pack Aprapransa as a complete meal is not a food that is commonly found on the streets of Ghana or is prepared every day in the house. It is usually served by the Akan tribe on special occasions such as marriage ceremonies, naming ceremonies, birthday celebrations, family cookouts, etc. Its name derived from the fact that it is a complete meal with its soup/stew integrated that one only needs to wipe their hand (prapra wo nsa) to eat.  Ingredients and preparation  The main ingredients are roasted corn flour (Tom brown) and palmnut or palm oil. Other ingredients include beans, vegetables such as tomatoes, onion, pepper, ginger, or garlic. It features seafood such as smoked fish, dried fish, salted fish or crabs. To prepare the dish, start the soup by boiling the palm nuts, pound and sieve to extract the palm juice. Steam the fish/meat with the ingredients for about ten minutes then pour the palm nut juice into the pot to cook for about 30 minutes. When the soup is well-cooked, some of the palm oil is scooped and some meat taken out for garnishing. A mixing spoon is washed and ready as the fried-corn flour is gradually added to the soup while it is stirred continuously to prevent it from lumping. Water is added if the texture is too thick. After about twenty minutes, the cooked kidney beans are poured into the broth and stirred to mix. In about ten minutes, after adding the beans it must be well-cooked and ready to be served. If stew is to be used instead, then the vegetables are fried in palm oil, adding seafood and group pepper. Water and corn flour are added and the dish is brought to a boil. It is simmered until cooked and served hot. Roasted corn flour can either be purchased at Ghanaian markets or made from plain corn flour in a pan.

She was a faculty member at Tulane University from 1955-1981 where she extensively researched Tinea capitis, “Ringworm of the hair.” She was instrumental in creating the Medical Mycological Society of the Americas and served as the President in 1975.  Early life  Lorraine Friedman was born on January 1, 1919 in Dawson, New Mexico. Shortly after she was born, her parents, Mathe Friedman and Alice Friedman moved their family back to Hot Springs, Arkansas, where they were originally from. Lorraine Friedman received her Bachelor of Arts from The University of Arkansas in June 1940. In 1942, after graduating from the University of Arkansas, she completed a medical technology training at Menorah Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri. She enlisted on December 14, 1942 to the United States Navy’s Medical Services Corps as a medical laboratory officer until 1946. Before obtaining a master’s in public health from the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill in 1948, she worked for one year as a diagnostic bacteriologist at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Finally, she was advised by Norman Conant, PhD, at Duke University and received her PhD in 1951. Her thesis work was titled “Comparative antigenic and immunologic studies on blastomyces dermatitidis, the cause of North American blastomycosis, and blastomyces brasiliensis, the cause of South American blastomycosis.” A portion of her research, \\"Immunological studies on the etiologic agents of North and South American blastomycosis\\" was published in 1953 in Mycopathologia. Career After graduating from Duke University, she accepted a position at the University of California Berkeley in the School of Public Health as the Chief of the Mycology Division of the Naval Biological Laboratory. She spent four years working with Charles E. Smith, PhD, the known expert on Coccidiomycosis. She worked on Coccidioides immitis, a fungal pathogen responsible for causing Valley Fever in the southwest United States. One prominent article she wrote on the work she conducted at UC Berkeley was titled “Studies on Coccidioides immitis: Morphology and sporulation capacity of forty-seven strains.” She was later recruited in 1955 to Tulane University Medical School to open a medical mycology center. She opened a medical mycology program in 1957 after receiving a National Institute of Health grant to fund her program. Most notably, this was only the third such grant to be awarded at this time. This grant was renewed annually for the 24 years she worked at Tulane University. Friedman designed her program and curriculum to allow students to create vital relationships between the graduate school and the medical school. One prominent class that first year PhD students were required to take was her medical mycology course. This course required students to rotate between diagnostic and/or clinical labs and to conduct their own individual research for a year. As her career at Tulane University went on, most of her time was spent on mentoring students and less on conducting research; however, some of her most notable research was on Tinea capitis, Ringworm of the scalp. Her research lab was foundational to the early understanding of this dermatological fungal infection. During her years as a PhD student the demand for medical mycology was high. In the late 40s and early 50s not much was known about many fungal diseases, therefore, mortality rates for invasive diseases were 50-100%. Therefore, Friedman, along with her collogues, were instrumental in our modern day understanding of several fungal diseases, some of which are easily treated with modern medicine. Mentorship While she was at Tulane University, she advised 10 PhD students and 4 master's students. These students were amongst the first generation of students to be trained with molecular-based techniques. Through her success of mentoring, many of Friedman's students went on to be prominent medical mycologists themselves, such as George Kobayashi, William Cooper, Geoffrey Land, and Thomas G. Mitchell. Judith Domer, a lifelong colleague of Friedman, said that her military training led to a mentoring style that was sometimes tough on students. However, this style proved effective since she successfully mentored a number of highly successful students. =List of graduate students= Friedman advised a number of graduate students, including: *Geoffery Land, PhD *Thomas G.

Blair proposing that a subdivision within the society be created for medical mycology which was gaining momentum at this time. In 1965, a committee composed of Lorraine Friedman, Libero Ajello, Charlotte Champbell, Milton Huppert, Hillel Levine, and Margarita Silva-Hutner met during the Second Coccidioidomycosis Symposium to organize a new Medical Mycology Division. The division opened in 1968 with Libero Ajello, PhD serving as the first president. Lorraine Friedman served as President in 1975. Several of her graduate students served as future presidents.

Despite relatively few skeletons, the poor state of preservation and damage to the bones during excavation, human remains were excavated for examination. They were subject to a visual examination and X-rayed. Age assessment was performed by investigating tooth development and measuring certain bones (including femurs and bones of the arms). The skeletons and teeth studied showed signs of deprivation during growth and development. In addition to bone injuries, people suffered from tooth decay, tartar, tooth loss and arthritis. Joint diseases were common and affected the spine (Schmorl's nodes), knees, and feet, suggesting an active lifestyle. A comparison with nearby Late Bronze Age necropolises, such as Spathes, reveals various forms of burials and a changing funerary culture.PARASKEVI TRITSAROLI AND SOPHIA KOULIDOU: Human remains from the Pigi Artemidos LBA tumulus, region of Macedonian Olympus, Pieria, National Kapodistrian university of Athens, Faculty of history and archaeology, Volume 1, May 2018, pages 12 - 21  Literature  * Eftychia Poulaki-Pandermali [Ευτυχία Πουλάκη-Παντερμαλή]: Ανασκαφή Αγίου Δημητρίου Ολύμπου.

It was filmed on location in Westchester, NY. The film had its world premiere at the Macabre Faire Film Festival in January 2017. The film takes its name from the Christian Death song on the album Only Theatre of Pain, written by Rozz Williams and Rikk Agnew. Description Romeo's Distress is about a creepy guy named James, his unrequited love for a beautiful girl named Jane, and her father's sadistic response to it all. Cast *Anthony Malchar as James Ferrose *Jeffrey Alan Solomon as Dale Matthews *Adam Stordy as Bobby Samson *Charese Scott Cooper as Samatha Washington *Dave Street as Uncle Elmo *Renee Mandel as Grandma *Stevie Grossett Jr. as Seymour the flower shop proprietor *Alex Echevarria as Dr. Myles Woodbine *Dave \\"The Voice\\" Stein as Mr. Cundelini *Kimberely A. Peterson as Jane Matthews *Richard Vaine as The Grave Digger Production Principal photography for Romeo's Distress lasted for 23 days over 15 months on a budget of $2,553.00, with roughly one to two shooting days occurring every month despite the story taking place over the course of three days. Writer/Director/Producer Jeff Frumess and Producer/Composer Nick Bohun made up the crew for the majority of production, with Jeff working as the Cinematographer and Nick the Location Sound Recordist. Some days involved Jeff running camera and sound by himself. The film was shot using the in camera Monochrome profile on the Canon 70D DSLR. This choice was made in part because Jeff found it was easier to light for black and white over color being a first time cinematographer. The Grandma is played by the director Jeff Frumess' Grandma, Renee Mandel. But her body is played by Dave Street (Uncle Elmo) in the film. Grandma's body and face were shot over a year a part. Dale's (the father) insurance office, the flower shop, and Dr Woodbine's psychiatrist office interiors were all in exactly the same room that was set dressed over and over as needed for the production. The cemetery is actually made up of four different cemeteries and one fabricated one in the director's parent's backyard. One of the cemeteries is the world-famous \\"Old Dutch\\" cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, NY - right next to the location of the covered bridge from \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\". Both Nick and Jeff were kicked out by the groundskeeper during shooting on two separate occasions. \\"Cheesecake of Love\\" is an original song that plays over James Ferrose headphones. It was a recording of a behind the scenes rehearsal featuring Anthony (James), Jeff (Director) and Nick (Producer/Sound) on Ukulele. The electrocution scene was inspired and filmed like one of the director's favorite films Phantom of the Paradise - during Beef's death on stage: Each frame was reorganized to create a disjointed/jarring effect. The entire ending was rewritten on the spot when production lost one actor and need to create a new one. Brand new scenes and inserts were then shot with this new character and inserted throughout the film so that the character didn't feel so random. For that reason almost half the film was rewritten in the assembly edit of the film. Festivals and Awards Romeo's Distress had its world premiere at the Macabre Faire Film Festival in January 2017 where it was nominated for best picture, best director, best actor, and winner of best screenplay for a feature. It was also selected by the New Jersey Horror Con and Film Festival in spring 2017 as well as the Toxic Horror Festival, where it was nominated for best feature and best character actor. The film finished its festival run by playing the 2017 Nightmares Film Festival where it was nominated for best screenplay and won the fest's spirit award - the \\"Esprit de Gore\\". Reception Romeo's Distress has received generally positive reviews. Kieran Fisher of Dread Central gave it 4 out of 5 stars and writes, \\"Romeo's Distress is the personification of a passion project, a smorgasbord of influences ranging from avant-garde cinema, Gothic literature, punk rock and more.\\" Dave J. Wilson of Diabolique Magazine said, \\"Romeo's Distress is a unique and intriguing oddity. A strange arthouse experimentation seamlessly melded together with an energetic genre-bending pastiche of creativity, the film is an engaging character study that is a darkly comical and ultimately bleak exploration of the dark side of love.\\" T. Love at Horrorfuel, gave Romeo 8 out of 10 stars and called it \\"The logical result of Edgar Allan Poe writing a contemporary dark romantic comedy\\". M. Jones of The Slaughtered Bird called it \\"80's indie kitsch meets Fritz Lang\\". Kevan Farrow of Scream Magazine UK gave it 4 out of 5 stars and said, \\"Romeo's Distress mixes more highbrow influences with an idiosyncratic, almost mischievous oddness and, like its troubled protagonist, walks its own path, unswayed by more 'respectable' trends. Atmospherically dense, gleefully oddball and relentlessly unnerving.\\" Release Romeo's Distress made its streaming premiere on Amazon Prime in August 2018. Hand-numbered, limited- edition Blu-rays with extras including the feature length microbudget filmmaking documentary Blood Visions - which details the 15 month no budget crusade to make Romeo's Distress and the struggles of trying to make a micro budget film, will be available as part of Frumess' follow-up film, Wash Away's Seed and Spark Campaign.

He earlier worked as a Minister for Transport, Roads & Buildings. Born in Chimakurthy of Prakasam district (in Andhra Pradesh) to Sidda Venkata Subbamma and Sidda Venkateswarlu, Raghava Rao grew up in a large family of eight brothers. He completed his schooling at Chimakurthy and went to Bapatla to pursue intermediate. He later graduated in Commerce from Andhra University in the year 1977. He is an acting member for Srisailam, Shirdi and Tirupathi, AryaVysya Community’s Choultries (rest houses). He is known for charitable and devotional activities. te:శిద్దా రాఘవరావు 2014 Election Raghava Rao's service to the party and Darsi constituency was recognised by N. Chandrababu Naidu after he was given the opportunity to contest the assembly elections held in May 2014. Raghava Rao's work in the constituency gave him a victory over his rival from the YSR Congress Party. Telugu Desam Party won the Darsi seat after 15 long years. Telugu Desam formed the government in the bifurcated state of Andhra Pradesh in June 2014. As Minister Raghava Rao was made the Minister for Transport, Roads & Buildings – a critical responsibility because bifurcated Andhra Pradesh had a lot of catching up to do with other states in the Country in terms of infrastructure and roads development. His primary objective was to build necessary road infrastructure that will improve domestic connectivity for industrial and social welfare. AS MINISTER REFORMING APSRTC''' The Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation's (APSRTC) turnaround story speaks volumes about the dedication of Raghava Rao to achieve the targets set by Chief Minister Nara Chandrababu Naidu. Looking nothing less than swanky airports, bus stations in Andhra Pradesh underwent amazing transformation during 2014-16. Passenger amenities such as washrooms, waiting area and others wore a new, clean and classy look. Vijayawada's Pandit Nehru Bus Station is a glaring example of how Chief Minister Nara Chandrababu Naidu's vision and Raghava Rao's hard work paid rich dividends for the citizens. For the first time ever in Andhra Pradesh, 5G Wi- Fi services were provided at the Pandit Nehru Bus Station. 84 JNNURM buses equipped with GPS service were pressed into service. An additional 30 new AC buses and 311 new services were implemented during Raghava Rao's tenure as minister. In a first of its kind initiative, APSRTC began to explore the usage of bus stations as commercial spaces which can generate revenue for the corporation. Today, the commercial spaces are generating sizeable revenue which is being used to offset the losses accrued by the corporation. AS MINISTER Raghava Rao was rewarded for his hard work for the party and people with a ministerial post. He was made the Minister for Transport, Roads & Buildings – a critical responsibility because bifurcated Andhra Pradesh had a lot of catching up to do with other states in the Country in terms of infrastructure and roads development. Raghava Rao began work with a sense of purpose and urgency. His primary objective was to build necessary road infrastructure that will improve domestic connectivity for industrial and social welfare. R & B The R&B; Department under the leadership of Raghava Rao took up roads construction in a massive scale connecting villages to towns, towns to cities and cities to other States. AP was on the road to fast development. Existing State highways were repaired, new highways were laid and CC roads were laid in thousands of villages, covering even the remotest ones. The social and economic milieu was undergoing a rapid transformation due to this brisk development. Ports, airports, tourist places and industrial hubs were being connected through 4 lanes and 6 lanes roads darting across the state. With financial support from NABARD and RDF, 5,400 km. long roads were developed by the R&B; department. A stickler for quality, Raghava Rao commissioned an Australian organisation's help to evaluate the condition of 46,404 km. of roads in the State with the help of advanced data procured on the ground. Under the leadership of Raghava Rao, a detailed project report (DPR) was designed for the 186-km Amaravati Outer Ring Road (ORR), for which, the Centre had sanctioned Rs.20,000 crore. A MoU was signed at the CII Partnership Summit between the State and Centre to this effect. Because of efficient, water-tight paperwork, Raghava Rao was instrumental in getting Rs. 75,000 crore sanctioned for the six-lane national highway from Anantapur to Amaravati. ROADS Chief Minister Nara Chandrababu Naidu has always emphasized on making roads safe for all. He issued specific instructions to officials focus on road safety more than income generated by the transport department. A Road Safety Council was set up with a fund of Rs. 10 crores. While Chandrababu Naidu acted as the Council's President, Raghava Rao was appointed as Vice- President. Observing that many deaths due to road accidents occurred because of two-wheeler riders not wearing head protection (helmet), Raghava Rao made it mandatory for all to wear helmets. Even though citizens felt inconvenienced in the beginning, they lauded and fully supported the government's initiative. Raghava Rao's vision was to decrease accidents from 20% to 15% by 2020. A study was carried out to identify accident prone areas and mark them for immediate repair. The Roads department moved swiftly to repair them, thus reducing accident rate in a big way. Andhra Pradesh did tremendous progress in 2015 when Road accidents decreased by several notches. RTA As per directions from Chief Minister Nara Chandrababu Naidu, the Transport Department under the leadership of Raghava Rao took the revolutionary step of providing 83 RTA services online, thus eliminating middlemen from the system leading to great savings for the citizens. Because of the several effective measures taken, the Transport department was able to achieve a phenomenal 40% revenue growth rate during 2015-16. Compared to Rs.1,517 Crores revenue in FY 2013-2014, AP Government collected Rs. 2,218 crores in 2015-2016.

The original course was laid out in 1893 and the club was incorporated in 1897. The golf course straddles the banks of the Des Plaines River between Cermak Road and 26th Street. Though the course has changed and expanded over the years it is still located on substantially the same plot of land as in 1893. In 1899 the club was a founding member of the Western Golf Association. Albert Seckel was Riverside's leading player during its early years, playing in numerous national tournaments. His most important win came at the 1911 Western Amateur contested at Detroit Golf Club. He also finished as runner-up in this event in 1909 and 1924. In the late 1950s the club resisted and overcame a takeover attempt by the University of Illinois at Chicago where the school sought to relocate its campus from Navy Pier to the club's property. The club was basis for the Mac Divot comic strip that was published in the 1960s and 1970s. Mac Divot was created by a member who worked for the Chicago Tribune. Many of the stories in the comic strip were based on real life characters and happenings at the club.  Golf course  The original golf course consisted of 3 holes and was expanded to 5 holes later during the 1893 season. A nine-hole course was laid out by founding members William A. Havemeyer, J.S. Driver, and Thomas C. Hannah in 1894. Between 1896 and 1897 the course was expanded and revised, but remained a nine-hole track, and became known as one of most beautiful and challenging in the west. As of 1901, the course played to a yardage of 3,217 yards with a bogey rating of 43. In the early 1900s many clubs expanded their golf courses to 18 holes but Riverside did not follow suit. This caused the club to fall off the map a bit in terms of prestige and notoriety as it remained a 9-hole course. In the late teens the club purchased additional land adjacent to its original property, on the opposite side (east) of the Des Plaines River. The club built a new clubhouse on the river bank of the newly acquired land. In 1917-1919 William Langford designed a new 18 hole course, reshaping Riverside as one of the top courses in the area. During the 1980’s the club secured an additional 25 acres of land east of the Des Plaines River and south of the rail line. Four new holes were added on this newly acquired tract which were designed by Dick Nugent and Associates. After these holes were completed 3 holes east of the clubhouse were removed and replaced by a practice facility and new 18th hole. The practice area and 18th hole were designed by Bob Lohmann. The course remained relatively unchanged during the 1990s through 2015. In 2015 Chicago based architect David Esler oversaw a renovation of the golf course. All bunkers were returned to the original Langford style with grass faces, trees were removed, tee boxes were added, and some greens were expanded.

Description Astreopora listeri may form hemispherical mounds or flattened and partially encrusting colonies. The corallites are crowded and not arranged in any particular pattern. They are immersed and have small circular openings surrounded by delicate feathery spinules, giving the colony a rough surface. This coral resembles Astreopora myriophthalma and Astreopora randalli in appearance and is usually cream, pale brown or grey. Distribution and habitat Astreopora listeri is widely distributed in the tropical Indo- Pacific region. Its range extends from Madagascar and East Africa to Indonesia and eastern Australia. It is found in several different types of shallow water reef habitat including turbid areas, at depths between . Ecology Astreopora listeri is a zooxanthellate species of coral, harbouring symbiotic dinoflagellates which provide their host with the products of photosynthesis. This coral is sometimes host to the bio-eroding demosponge Cliona orientalis which attacks various calcareous substrates including corals and weakens their structure. Status The greatest threats faced by corals are loss of habitat and global climate change. The specific threats faced by this species are unknown, but the genus is susceptible to bleaching and coral diseases.

The site was selected because of the dependable supply of water from Meadow Valley Creek. The camp, initially named Ely City, was renamed Bullionville later that year. From 1870 to 1872, nearby Pioche's mills were built at Bullionville because of its excellent water supply. The construction of a narrow gauge railroad, began in 1872, with the purpose of hauling ore between the mills and nearby mines.

In 1875, a water system between Bullionville and Pioche was completed, which supported Pioche's water requirements for milling. After 1875, Bullionville slowly declined, and the settlement's mills were moved between 1875 and 1877.

It has silvery, broadly egg-shaped to egg-shaped leaves with three small teeth crowded at the tip. The flower heads and subtending leaves form a cylindric inflorescence, topped with a tuft of smaller, more or less upright silvery or pinkish leaves. Each flowerhead contains 8–12 flowers with conspicuously red styles, that are all parallel, projected straight up, pushing against the leaf subtending the higher flowerhead. The styles end in a short white zone topped by a thick blackish pollen presenter. Flowers can usually be found from January till March, few may persist into May. It is called silver pagoda or matchstick pagoda in English and Hottentotstompie in Afrikaans.  Description  Mimetes hottentoticus is an evergreen shrub of mostly 1½–2 m (5–7 ft), occasionally up to 3 m (10 ft) high, which has upright branches that develop from a single trunk of up to 10 cm (4 in) thick, but its shape may vary from slender and sparingly branching to rounded and profusely branching, in which case it may reach a diameter of about 2 m (7 ft). The branches are 5–8 mm (0.20–0.32 in) thick and are initially covered with greyish felty hairs, but older growth has lost both its indumentum and its leaves. The leaves are set alternately olong the branches, at an upward angle or slightly overlapping. They lack stipules and leaf stalks, are egg-shaped or broadly egg-shaped in outline, 5–7½ cm (2–3 in) long and 2¾–4 cm (1.1–1.8 in) wide, with an entire margin except for three blunt teeth close together at the tip of the leaf, seldom without teeth. The surface is silvery because it is covered in dense silky hairs, and felty hairs along the margins. The inflorescence is broadly cylinder-shaped, 7–14 cm (2¾–5⅔ in) long and 7–12 cm (2¾–4¾ in) in diameter, topped by a tuft of smallish, more or less upright, egg-shaped or narrowly egg-shaped, silvery hairy leaves, sometimes tinged pink. In the axils of the higher leaves are flower heads each containing eight to twelve flowers, the subtending leaves not different from the lower leaves being silvery and flat. The outer whorl of bracts that encircle the flower heads are lance-shaped with a pointy tip, 1½–2¼ cm (0.6–0.9 in) long and ¼–½ cm (0.08–0.20 in) wide, grey felty hairy, the inner whorl narrowly lance-shaped. The bract subtending the individual flower is linear to awl-shaped and 12–16 mm (0.48–0.64 in) long, about 1 mm (0.04 in) wide and covered in very dense felty hairs. The cream coloured 4-merous perianth is 3½–3¾ cm (1.4–1.7 in) long. The lower part, that remains merged when the flower is open, is hairless, square in cross section, and about 4–5 mm (0.16–0.20 in) long. The segments in the middle part (or claws), are thread-shaped, covered in dense felty hairs. The segments in the upper part (or limbs), which enclosed the pollen presenter in the bud, are lance- shaped with a pointy tip and covered in felty hairs. The anthers are directly merged to the limbs, lack a filament, are oblong with blunt tips, the part that connects the anther lobes has a mostly minutely forked tip. From the centre of the perianth emerges style of 6½–7 cm (2.6–2.8 in) long, brilliantly red in colour with a small white tip just below the pollen presenter. The thickened part at the tip of the style called pollen presenter is about 4 mm (0.16 in) long, blackish in colour, inverted cone- to head-shaped, with a nipple-like tip that contains the sigmatic groove across the middle. The ovary is very finely silky hairy, about 3–4 mm long (0.12–0.16 in) and difficult to distinguish from the style. It is subtended by four fleshy line- to awl-shaped scales of 2–3 mm (0.08–0.12 in) long.  Taxonomy  As far as it is known, the first person to collect the silver pagoda for science was Thomas Pearson Stokoe, who came across this species in November 1921. He visited the location of his earlier find near the end of February 1922, when he collected flowering specimens. The species was described in 1923 by South African botanists Edwin Percy Phillips and John Hutchinson, who named it Mimetes hottentoticus. = Naming = The species name hottentoticus refers to the Hottentots Holland Mountains near its distribution area.  Distribution, habitat and ecology  The three known populations of the matchstick pagoda can be found neat the Kogelberg Peak, at an altitude between 1000 and 1250 m (3250–4150 ft). There, it grows in peaty seeps on acidic sandy soil poor in nutrients derived from quartzite, in a vegetation type called Kogelberg Sandstone Fynbos amongst other species like the Resionid Elegia mucronata, Brunia alopecuroides an Erica desmantha. These locations are always moist with an average annual precipitation of more than , during the winter when most rain is falling with northwesterly wind, and during the summer due to frequent mist from seawinds from the southeast. The species is pollinated by birds, flowers from January to May with a peak in February. The fruits are ripe about half a year after flowering and fall to the ground. They are collected by native ants that carry the fruits to their underground nest, where the ants bread is eaten and the seeds remain protected. The seeds germinate after an overhead fieldfire. Plants do not survive fires.  Conservation  The matchstick pagoda is considered a critically endangered species, due to its very limited distribution area of and its strongly fluctuating population. Negative impacts may arise from too high frequency wildfires, seed collection, habitat destruction and Phytophthora infection.

He first joined Ballet Hispánico as a principal dancer in 1985, leaving for Chicago a decade later to further his education and found the Luna Negra Dance Theater, for which he was artistic director. He returned to Ballet Hispánico in 2009 as artistic director, the second since the organization's founding in 1970, and has also served as CEO for the company since 2015 when a reorganization merged these artistic and administrative roles. His vision for Ballet Hispánico draws on the Latin dance traditions and educational outreach set forth by founder Tina Ramirez while responding to the more complex cultural landscape of the 21st century with a greater focus on diversity, inclusion, and community engagement.  Early life  Born in Havana, Cuba in the borough of Marianao (home of the Tropicana), Vilaro is the middle child of three brothers. His parents—Pascual Vilaro, an engineer, and Georgina Fernández, a homemaker—left Cuba with their children to seek political asylum in 1969, when Vilaro was five years old, during the second wave of refugee migration from that country. They arrived first in Miami, Florida, and a few days later, joined Vilaro’s family in New York City. The family settled in the Southwest Bronx, where Vilaro’s father translated his education degree by attending night classes while working for Brooklyn Union Gas Company, and his mother trained and worked as a cosmetician. There, Vilaro attended St. Mary Margaret Elementary School and then Fordham Preparatory School. His immigrant experience and the example of his mother’s fortitude as she established her family in a new country later provided a model for Vilaro's dedication to dance, the arts, and community work.  Dance education  While childhood memories of dancing with his mother embedded Latin dance and Caribbean music as early cultural influences, Vilaro credits an eighth-grade production of You’re a Good Man, Charlie Brown—he played Linus, and was assigned the task of creating his own choreography with a blanket for a “partner”—as the event which awakened his desire to perform and enter the arts. He attended Adelphi University in Garden City, New York, majoring in dance under the direction of Norman Walker, and studying modern dance as well as classical technique with former Ballet Russes instructors. He graduated with a Bachelor in Fine Arts. Additionally, Vilaro took class at the Martha Graham Contemporary Dance School (part of the Martha Graham Dance Company) and the Ailey School (affiliated with Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater). Soon after graduation in 1985, while attending a company class at Ballet Hispánico, founder and then-director Tina Ramirez took note of the young dancer, and invited Vilaro to join the company. This introduction initiated an ongoing mentorship by Ramirez and a decade of first- hand exposure to the management of an established dance company. Vilaro was a principal dancer, originating roles in a range of works by choreographers such as Talley Beatty, George Faison, Vincente Nebrada, Ramón Oller, and Graciela Daniele, and performing throughout the U.S. and in Latin America and Europe. He also assisted Ramirez in the development of dance education residencies, and eventually became an instructor at the company’s School of Dance, where he composed short sequences for the students. After a decade with Ballet Hispánico, Vilaro moved to Chicago to pursue educational and artistic goals.  Graduate studies and Luna Negra Dance Theater  In 1996, Vilaro enrolled at Columbia College Chicago for a Master’s in Interdisciplinary Arts. In tandem with his graduate work, he studied with master dance teacher Anna Paskevska, who offered instruction in the classical training and development of young dancers, an experience that laid the groundwork for Vilaro’s next endeavor—starting a dance company to offer Latino arts and culture to a Midwest audience. Vilaro founded Luna Negra Dance Theater with his life savings in 1999, right after graduating from Columbia College. There, Vilaro choreographed full-length dance programs, and the fledgling company initially performed with 4–5 dancers (Vilaro occasionally among them) in small, sometimes partially filled, venues. Over time, the company became more established, performing at Chicago’s NEXT Dance Festival, the Chicago Cultural Center, the Ravinia Festival, the Mexican Fine Arts Center Museum, and the Pritzker Pavilion, while eventually acquiring a permanent home at the Harris Theater for Music and Dance as one of its first resident companies. Vilaro choreographed over 20 works for Luna Negra; commissioned works from other Latino choreographers, such as Annabelle Lopez Ochoa and Miguel Mancillas; and collaborated with Peruvian singer Susana Baca, Brazilian jazz vocalist Luciana Souza, Cuban-American saxophonist Paquito D’Rivera, musicians Tiempo Libre, the Chicago Sinfonietta, and Chicago Symphony Orchestra. When Vilaro departed to take on the directorship of Ballet Hispánico, Luna Negra was a company of a dozen dancers, an eclectic repertory, and Gustavo Ramírez Sansano—a choreographer who began his work at Luna Negra—at the helm.  Leadership at Ballet Hispánico  In 2009, Vilaro became the second artistic director of Ballet Hispánico, a New York-based, American dance company founded in 1970 by Tina Ramirez who served as its first artistic director. In 2015, he also assumed CEO responsibilities. When Vilaro rejoined Ballet Hispánico, the company was poised to reassess and expand its cultural vision and community role. Steeped in Ballet Hispánico’s founding principles of education, outreach, and performance as vehicles for cultural exchange, Vilaro has adapted the company's mission for a more global and multi-faceted cultural landscape. “Culture is not static,” he says, “and our community engagement keeps us connected to the realities in our communities.” Over its history, Ballet Hispánico has performed for over 3 million people in 48 U.S. states and territories, 11 countries, and three continents. In furthering the artistic scope of the company, Vilaro has overseen expanded programming, such as: the creation of the Instituto Coreográfico, established to support and cultivate emerging Latino choreographers; participation as one of four American dance companies in the Lincoln Center at the Movies: Great American Dance series, streamed to over 600 U.S. cinemas; the opening of Ballet Hispánico’s newly renovated home in the Arnhold Center on the Upper West Side; community educational programs, such as Latin social dance classes, offered at the United Palace Theatre in Washington Heights, Manhattan; and Ballet Hispánico Communities, satellite sites for educational programs, performance, and community engagement, the first at California State University in Los Angeles, with plans to develop similar partnerships in other Latino and Chicano hubs, such as Houston and Miami.  Arts advocacy  Eduardo Vilaro at the Bronx Arts Middle School in 2018 As artistic director & CEO of Ballet Hispánico, Vilaro has used this platform to promote dance and Latino arts more broadly. His local arts advocacy activities have included participation in public awareness campaigns and other community forums, such as #CelebrateImmigrants and New Yorkers for Dance. He has also served on grants panels for the National Endowment for the Arts and the New York State Council on the Arts; advised arts organizations as a member of the advisory board of Dance/NYC and a board member of Dance/USA; undertaken speaking engagements in venues such as the Salzburg Global Seminar’s Young Cultural Innovators Forum and the National Association of Latino Arts and Culture; and served as an arts/dance spokesperson and community leader addressing the growing need for cultural diversity and dance education. Vilaro sees the arts as “a necessity,” and arts advocacy as “everyone’s responsibility.”  Philosophy  Vilaro’s philosophy of dance stems from a basic belief in the power of the arts to change lives, reflect and impact culture, and strengthen community. He considers dance to be a liberating, non-verbal language through which students, dancers, and audiences can initiate an ongoing conversation about the arts, expression, identity, and the meaning of community. In addition, Vilaro acknowledges the deep connections and contradictions inherent in Latin American history which derive from indigenous, European, and African sources and play out against a legacy of colonization, immigration, assimilation, globalization, and current hybrid identities (a phenomenon he refers to as “the identity mambo”). Addressing these factors, Vilaro has said, “For me, culture and the cultural dialogue is about inclusion. I want to make everyone feel that they can come in and be a little Latino. Ultimately, my goal is to expose [our audiences and communities] to the variety, diversity, and intersectionality of this diaspora.”  Influences  Vilaro cites the mentorship of his early teachers and Ballet Hispánico’s founder and first artistic director Tina Ramirez as seminal influences in his dance education. Choreographic influences include Alvin Ailey, Martha Graham, Nacho Duato, and Pina Bausch. In addition, he has found inspiration in dance forms beyond the realm of the standard canon, such as the Eighties New York dance scene where gay culture and voguing thrived; the break-dancing and street performances that originated in his home borough of the Bronx; and Afro-Caribbean music, dance parties, and capoeira classes that defined his childhood and teen years. Finally, Vilaro has often turned to theater, opera, music, visual arts, literature (some of his works include spoken text), even nature and wildlife as creative springboards.  Personal life  Vilaro lives in Irvington, NY with his husband, David Norfleet-Vilaro, and their son, Maximiliano.

Eitel was its chief of staff for fifteen years until 1927, after which he was called proprietor. He was persecuted during World War I for his German heritage. Eitel was an active member of a eugenics society and he and his nephew are remembered for carrying out early surgical sterilizations. Family and education Jeannette Larsen Eitel Eitel was born on a farm near Chaska, Minnesota, to John G. and Mary (Ulmer) Eitel who were immigrants from Württemberg in Germany. He attended Moravian Academy in Chaska. His father wanted him to join the family flour mill. Eitel wanted at first to be a teacher, but changed his mind and apprenticed to a local doctor. Eitel sold books door-to-door for two years to finance his education in medicine. In 1885, he entered Minnesota Hospital College in Minneapolis and graduated three years later with honors. Then he studied at the University of Berlin for a year, and after his return to the U.S. he practiced surgery for two years in Centralia, Washington. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania medical school in 1891. He married Jeannette E. Larsen (born July 6, 1875, in Mona, Iowa) in Sioux Falls in January 1908. They had no children. One of his brothers, David Eitel served as secretary of his hospital. David's son was Dr. George D. Eitel, who succeeded George. Early career Eitel returned to Minneapolis as an assistant to Dr. F. A. Dunsmoor, professor of surgery at the University of Minnesota. At Dunsmoor's recommendation, he became staff surgeon at Asbury Hospital (then in Elliot Park and today part of HealthPartners) and he served as a consulting surgeon at Northwestern Hospital. He then returned to the University of Berlin to study surgery in detail, where he specialized in appendectomies. He received his Doctor of Medicine degree in 1901, and returned to Minneapolis, dreaming of building his own hospital. He worked for Asbury, and for Saint Barnabas and City hospitals (both now Hennepin County Medical Center). Eitel was also a consulting surgeon for the Soo Line Railroad. Eitel Hospital Former entrance to Eitel Hospital The Minneapolis Journal first announced plans in 1906 and later published various renderings of his proposed hospital. Construction started in March 1911 and it opened in January 1912 with room for 100 patients. It cost $190,000 to build along with a training school for nurses. The private hospital served wealthy residents of Minneapolis. Sun porches had Navajo rugs and private rooms had brass beds and mahogany furniture. His wife Jeannette Eitel directed the nursing school. The Eitels lived in an apartment accessible from the 14th Street entrance. The hospital building is today part of an apartment complex. As the hospital prospered, it expanded. To the south, an apartment building was renamed the Eitel Apartments. Next door at 1407–1409 Willow, Eitel built the six-story Eitel Clinic in 1926. Today the clinic is the Loring Medical Building. Persecution After the U.S. entered World War I, Eitel and his wife were the subject of anti-German persecution and wild rumors. According to The Medical Fortnightly, in one 24-hour period reports emerged that: * Mrs. Eitel was interned in a camp; * Eitel and his wife were serving 25-year sentences in a federal penitentiary; * he had been caught experimenting with poison hypodermics on enlisted men; * he had been shot on the street; and * he committed suicide. And separately, that he, another surgeon, and their nurses had been shot at sunrise at Fort Snelling. The United States Department of Justice intervened on their behalf, and Eitel published a denial, pledging his loyalty to the U.S. in the Minneapolis Evening-Journal. Eugenics Minnesota's eugenics law of 1925, targeting the institutionalized intellectually disabled and insane, sought to stop the births of children who might become public dependents. Eitel lobbied the Minnesota legislature in January 1925; his letter on Eitel Hospital stationery called the \\"feeble minded, epileptic or insane\\" a \\"most unfortunate and very expensive class of citizens....\\" Mildred Thomson supervised the Minnesota Department for the Feebleminded and Epileptic and was in large measure the administrator responsible for the sterilization process, that in Minnesota was a complicated affair in which the subject or guardian must give consent. Eitel became vice president (1925–1926) of the Minnesota Eugenics Society formed by Charles Fremont Dight who promoted eugenics for most of his later life. Molly Ladd- Taylor writes that \\"the responsibilities of the [other] medical men were more professional and longer-lasting,\\" noting that of course \\"a surgeon was necessary to perform\\" the sterilizations. Eitel and his wife and surgical nurse performed sterilization operations one day each month at the Minnesota School for the Feebleminded (now the state's largest prison, the medium- security Minnesota Correctional Facility) in Faribault from 1926 until his death in 1928, amounting to 150 operations. His work was praised at the time. Eitel's nephew, Dr. George D. Eitel, succeeded him and with A. L. Herman and David Stern performed nearly a thousand sterilizations. Through 1945, 80 percent of those sterilized at the school were female. Eitel is spelled Eithel in: In actuality, the women diagnosed as \\"feeble minded\\" may have experienced disability, poverty, family violence, incest, or sexual abuse. Death Eitel died of a heart attack on February 8, 1928, while reading a newspaper in bed in his apartment at Eitel Hospital, recovering from influenza. He is buried in Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis.

In 1977 he proved a significant theorem on biholomorphic mappings between algebraic real hypersurfaces. Using his expertise on Chern-Moser invariants, he developed a theory that provides a complete set of invariants for nondegenerate real hypersurfaces under volume-preserving biholomorphic transformations.

There are currently 21 outlets island-wide that are generally found within the neighbourhood housing estates, some of which are open 24 hours a day. History Prime Supermarket was established in 1984 by Mr Tan Hong Khoon, after his fathers' pig farming business which was inherited from the elder Mr Tan's father, was forced by the government to shut down due to redevelopment plans in the Punggol area. The first grocery store was thus established as an alternative business venture in King George's Avenue. In the following years, the business was then grown and expanded into the supermarket chain that is as seen today, with their own house-brand products being sold too. Prime Group International was also subsequently established for local and overseas ventures, of which in 2016, the Mahota Commune houses were established, which is a mixed retail business that included a supermarket as well. In a nod to the healthy lifestyle that the government has been actively trying to promote, the supermarket has also ensured the overall wellness of its staff by encouraging and promoting healthy living. The original supermarket in King George's Avenue also continues to stand till this day. Discount schemes Members of the supermarket membership programme are able to enjoy discounts via \\"Fresh points\\" that they have earned while shopping with the supermarket. This scheme allows for a reduction of S$1 to be made for every 100 \\"Fresh points\\" earned, of which 1 \\"Fresh point\\" is earned for every dollar spent for a minimum of S$10 spent. Membership can be obtained for free from the supermarket by purchasing S$20 worth of products, while the annual membership is renewable for free. There is also a further discount of 3% for senior citizens (aged 60 and above), every Monday and Friday of the week, on most items in the supermarket. Online ventures The supermarket has also tapped onto online platforms to grow its business. An online shopping portal has been launched with features allowing customers to collect from the physical store after purchasing online for no additional charges if they did not opt for delivery. Additionally, the supermarket has also reached onto social media platforms like Facebook to engage and inform customers about ongoing discounts and sales in the supermarket.

He was possibly the first black player to play in both the Scottish Football League and the English Football League, featuring for Leith Athletic and Heart of Midlothian for brief spells in his home country, followed by another short period with Lincoln City in England before returning due to ill health. Career Born in Leith, Walker began his playing career with local Junior team Leith Primrose, moving on to second-tier SFL club Leith Athletic in March 1898.[A Record of pre-war Scottish League Players], John Litster / Scottish Football Historian magazine, October 2012 His performances at the end of the 1897–98 season and the outset of 1898–99 drew the attention of Heart of Midlothian, and he signed for the Tynecastle club in October 1898 for a fee quoted as £50 or £80. He made six Division One appearances for Hearts and featured in an East of Scotland Shield win over local rivals Hibernian, but his overall form did not impress the hierarchy and he was allowed to leave the club at the end of the season. Walker joined Lincoln City of the English Football League Second Division for the 1899–1900 season and made six league appearances for the Imps during the first half of the campaign before returning home to Scotland in a poor state of health. Personal life According to the 1881 census, Walker's mother Sarah was born in Leith (one of Scotland's main ports), and his father, also named John, was a dock worker born in \\"India, West\\" (presumed to be the West Indies). During his playing career he was often referred to by the nickname 'Darkie', although this term did not have the same weight as an insult as in later times. He died of consumption (tuberculosis) in August 1900, aged 22. Walker was not the first black footballer, being preceded by the likes of Robert Walker (no relation), Andrew Watson and Arthur Wharton, but he was among the first to play in the Scottish Football League, and to appear for league clubs in both Scotland and England – alongside his contemporary Willie Clarke.

Here she worked on exciton and polaron dynamics in organic semiconductors.  Research and career  After her PhD, Herz was appointed a postdoctoral research fellow at St John's College, Cambridge, in 2001. She was awarded an Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Advanced Research Fellowship in 2006. Herz became a Professor in 2010. Herz is an expert in perovskite semiconductors. She has researched the origins of the high charge-carrier mobilities in perovskite materials. She demonstrated that their high efficiency in solar cells was due to long charge-carrier diffusion lengths and non-Langevin recombination. She identified that perovskite light emission is broad and can be used in Ultrafast lasers. She recognised that the origin of this broadening is Fröhlich coupling to longitudinal optical phonons. Herz is also interested in self-assembly and nanoscale effects. She works on Biomimetics light harvesting structures made of porphyrin nanorings to explore delocalised excited states.

Map of the boundary between Afghanistan and Iran Description The border begins at the tripoint with Turkmenistan in the Harirud river before proceeding overland just to the east of the Iranian town of Taybad. The border then follows a series of short straight lines, passing through the Daryacheh-ye Namakzar and the Daqq-e Patergan salt lakes; two ‘beaks’ of Iranian territory protrude into Afghanistan along this section. The middle ‘Turkish section’ (see below) consists of a series of straight lines through a plain, with some mountains to the south, ending at Kuh Siah mountain, where the border veers sharply to the east. It cuts through Hamun Lake before turning south, where it follows the Juy-e Siksar River down to the confluence with the Helmand River. The border is then formed of a long straight line segment going southwest to the tripoint with Pakistan at the Kuh-i-Malik Salih mountain. The border traverses a generally arid, inhospitable region with few inhabitants, except in the Zabol- Zaranj area where the main border crossing is located. History The border between Persia and Afghanistan was formalised in the period 1872-1935 by a series of third party arbitrations, stemming from the Treaty of Paris (1857) in which Persia and Afghanistan agreed to refer any dispute between them to Britain for arbitration (at this time Britain controlled large parts of India, including what is now Pakistan). A series of skirmishes between Afghanistan and Persia in 1860s prompted Persian king Naser al-Din Shah Qajar to request that the British formalise the Afghan-Persia boundary. A rough delimitation was proposed in 1872 by a committee headed by Sir Frederic John Goldsmid following a line from Banda to Kuh-i-Malik Siah (a hill at the modern Afghanistan-Iran-Pakistan tripoint) via the Helmand river. Both parties eventually accepted this proposal however it was not implemented further at that time. The Goldsmid boundary proved to be inadequate, especially given the shifting of the course of the Helmand, and thus a more precise boundary was drawn up in three sections over the following decades: the northern section by General C.S. MacLean, British consul general for Khorasan and Sīstān, in 1888-91, the southern section by Colonel Sir Henry McMahon in 1903-05 and finally the middle section by Turkey’s General Fahrettin Altay in 1934-35. After each demarcation boundary pillars were erected, leading to a total of 172 pillars being erected in the non-riverine sections of the border. The boundary itself was not disputed after 1935, however disputes over the allocation of water resources in the region rumbled on for many years and were not finally resolved until 1973.

Early life and family Sheila Geraldine Mary Murphy was born at 18 Harcourt Street, Dublin on 28 December 1898. She was the eldest daughter of the five children of physician and surgeon, Dr John Joseph Murphy and Louisa Murphy (née Dickson). Career Murphy joined the civil service in Dáil Éireann in 1921 as a compiler of statistics. From February 1921 to January 1922 she was the secretariat of the provisional government in the Dáil publicity department. She became James McNeill's private secretary in 1923 while he was serving as Irish high commissioner in London. In 1926 she left London to become Joseph Walshe's private secretary in the Department of External Affairs. She remained in this position until 1946, also being the archivist of the department from 1936. She left these posts to become the secretary of Ireland's first ambassadorial department to the Holy See. It has been said that Murphy's role in the history and development of early Irish foreign policy has been overlooked. In her positions in the Department of External Affairs, she handed many highly confidential correspondence and documents, while working closely with Joseph Walshe. Along with Walshe's second in command, Seán Murphy, Murphy was privy to far more need-to-know information than many other department staff, of which she had comprehensive knowledge and was involved in the high level departmental policy making. Her involvement in such documents can be seen by her initials \\"SGM\\" on much of the sensitive Department of External Affairs material which is now held in the National Archives in Dublin. Conor Cruise O'Brien confirmed that Murphy was part of \\"a very small, tightly knit, confidential group of officials\\" who advised Éamon de Valera. In 1946 Murphy was given her first diplomatic post when Walshe was appointed ambassador to the Vatican as a second secretary in the political and treaty relations section, going on to be promoted to first secretary in 1948. Along with Walshe, Seán Murphy, and Frank Cremins, Murphy was one of the longest serving members of the department with 24 years of service. Along with the department's librarian and translator, Rosita Austin, they were the only women in senior positions in the department from 1922 to 1946, and Murphy seen as the only female \\"career diplomat\\". From 1956 to 1961 she was first secretary in Paris, and was part of the first Irish delegation to a UN general assembly in 1956. She was in charge of the international organisations section of the Department of External Affairs in 1961, holding responsibility for all international organisations bar the UN. In 1962 she was promoted to assistant secretary. By the time of her retirement on 19 February 1964, she was Ireland's highest ranking female diplomat. Later life and death Those who worked alongside Murphy and Walshe in the Department of External Affairs believed that Walshe wished to marry Murphy, but that his ill-health prevented this. Murphy died at Oak House nursing home, Orwell Road, Rathgar, Dublin on 15 January 1983. She is buried in Deans Grange Cemetery.

In culture, P. fastigiata produces olive-brown, velvety colonies. The fungus is recognizable microscopically due to the presence of distinctive, funnel-shaped cuffs (collarettes) encircling the tips of phialides that bear slimy conidia. The fungus is often implicated in soft-rot wood decay due to its ability to degrade lignin, cellulose and pectin. It has also been reported to cause blue staining of wood and wood pulp. History and taxonomy Phialophora fastigiata was originally described in 1928 as Cadophora fastigiata by Lagerberg and Melin, who erected the genus Cadophora to accommodate C. fastigiata. In 1937, Conant compared eight species of Cadophora with Phialophora verrucosa and determined that they belonged to the same genus. As such, seven species of Cadophora, including C. fastigiata were transferred to the genus Phialophora. Although later examination of the internal transcribed spacers of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes in Cadophora melinii and P. fastigiata showed morphological similarity, the colony morphology of the two species is distinctive. Growth and morphology Dried colony of Phialophora fastigiata UAMH 1420 on cellophane Macroscopically, P. fastigiata colonies reach 2.3 - 2.5 cm in diameter after being grown at 20 °C on malt extract agar for 10 days. They exhibit an olive-brown or reddish-brown velvety appearance, and grow with a border of hyaline (glassy) mycelium. Aerial mycelium form a floccose (fluffy) greyish-brown turf 1.0-6.5mm high, and produce rope-like strands towards the centre of the colony. Although isolates usually grow uniformly, slight differences in colour, numbers of conidiophores and numbers of aerial mycelium have been observed. Phialophora fastigiata are microscopically recognized by the production of light brown, flask-shaped phialides that are produced laterally on hyphae and produce funnel-shaped collarettes. In Petri dish cultures, the fungus tends to develop hyphal strands that are 3-4μm in diameter and show cell-wall thickening with age. Slimy conidia are produced in clumps at the apex of phialides, and are oval shaped (ovoid) to button shaped (ellipsoidal) with a pinched base. The conidia initially exhibit a hyaline (unpigmented) appearance, but turn light brown with age. Physiology Isolates of P. fastigiata are able to grow at temperatures ranging from 3 °C to 35 °C, with an optimum temperature range of 20 °C-25 °C and pH range between 4-9. Extracts of water and acetone from balsam fir, black spruce, white spruce and red spruce have been shown to stimulate the growth of the fungus in culture. The presence of biotin also increases the growth of this fungus and extracts of ammonium tartrate increase mycelium production. This saprophytic fungus is able to gain energy from decaying organic matter, and is able to utilize asparagine and potassium nitrate as sources of nitrogen, as well as L-arabinose as a source of carbon. Phialophora fastigiata is able to produce a variety of degradation enzymes, including pectinase, amylase, xylanase, cellulase and mannanase, which allow it to cause wood decay and post-harvest rot. Although there has been no investigation into the management of P. fastigiata, the fungus is known to be susceptible to the antimicrobial activity of ethanolic extract from Halacsya sendtneri, a flowering plant in the family Boraginaceae. The fungus is also susceptible to antimycins produced by Streptomyces species. Conversely, P. fastigiata exhibits antimicrobial activity against Gaeumannomyces graminis var tritici, a plant pathogen that causes take-all disease in wheat. Habitat and ecology Phialophora fastigiata is commonly isolated from soil and wood. The earliest reports of the fungus came from countries and regions rich in wood, such as Sweden, Norway and Canada. It was later isolated from a spruce plantation in Norway and has been found to grow on wood pulp in Sweden. It is also the most abundant species found in slime from paper mills in New Brunswick and Newfoundland, and has been isolated from wheat-field soils in Western Australia. The fungus is psychrotolerant (able to grow at low temperatures), and has been isolated from soil, straw and wood in the Ross Sea region of Antarctica. It has also been isolated from the water-saturated wood of Betula pendula trees, dialysis water, municipal drinking water, groundwater, surface water, and tap water. Commercial implications Phialophora fastigiata is a soft rot fungus that has been found to widen cavities in birch and Scots pine sapwood by increasing growth at the hyphal tip and secreting lignolytic enzymes (involved in the degradation of lignin) from the hyphal surface. The fungus can also cause cavities in wood and plants via an erosion-type attack. The ability of the fungus to degrade the wood of Populus tremuloides (trembling aspen) has been noted to limit the sale of aspen, which represents 54% of commercial timber. P. fastigiata also commonly causes blue staining of wood. It has been found to grow on wood pulp with a greyish-green tinge, causing the wood pulp to appear blue and is one of the most common species of fungi associated with discolored xylem in the stems of B. pendula. Degradation and discoloration of wood by P. fastigiata affect the production quality of pulp and paper.

Incidents  * On January 25, a TEPPCO 8-inch propane pipeline failed, near Davenport, New York. The propane ignited, destroying a trailer house, and forcing evacuations. About 5,000 barrels of propane were burned. There were no injuries. The incident resulted from a through-wall failure of the pipe material at a fitting that was attached to the top of the pipe. * On March 12, a TEPPCO pipeline spilled about 500 barrels of unleaded gasoline spilled into Moro Creek, which flows into the Sabine River near Kingsland, Arkansas. The cause was corrosion of a 1/2-inch bleeder line, that was part of a 20-inch pipeline block valve used to equalize pressure across the valve. * On April 28, a 14-inch diameter petroleum pipeline of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners ruptured, and spilled an estimated 103,000 gallons of diesel fuel into marshes, adjacent to Suisun Bay, in Northern California. The line failed from external cossorosion. The company failed to notify California authorities about the spill for 18 hours, a failure for which it was later cited. Kinder Morgan was fined $5.3 million for the spill, and agreed to enhance spill prevention, response and reporting practices.Scott Marshall, “Kinder-Morgan to pay $5.3 million for fuel spills,” Contra Costa Times, May 21, 2007, http://www.contracostatimes.com/search/ci_5950251, accessed June 16, 2014. * On May 23, a leak in a sampling tube on a pipeline in Renton, Washington spilled several thousand gallons of gasoline, which ignited. * On May 26, 2004, a Kinder Morgan pipeline at Pasadena, Texas, had a “significant event” due to a weld failure.“Texas Significant Incidents Listing,” 2003-2014, PHMSA Pipeline Safety Stakeholder Communication, U.S. DOT, http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/safety/IncDetSt_st_TX_flt_sig.html?nocache=8751, accessed June 17, 2014. * On July 20, an exploding manhole struck and severely injured an automobile passenger, most likely due to leaking gas. http://archive.boston.com/news/local/articles/2004/07/21/manhole_cover_explodes_hurting_motorist/ * On August 19, a series of explosions hit an underground natural gas storage cavern in Moss Bluff, Texas, resulting in evacuations for a 3-mile radius. The first blast, about 4 a.m., sent flames 150 to 200 feet into the air. The second explosion was seen as far as 20 miles away. Equipment failure was suspected. The cavern had just been expanded using the SMUG (solution mining under gas) process, which permits salt cavern expansion without interrupting gas storage operations. There were no injuries reported.https://www.ogj.com/general- interest/companies/article/17290997/second-moss-bluff-explosion- accesses-6-bcf-of-gas-in-cavern-feeds-larger-fire * On August 21, 2004, a natural gas explosion destroyed a home in DuBois, Pennsylvania, killing the two residents and doing $800,000 in property damage. After the accident, the National Fuel Gas Distribution Corporation (National Fuel) probed the ground near the residence for gas leaks and found combustible readings in one area adjacent to the house, and in another area directly over the failed pipe on the front lawn. National Fuel began excavating the lawn and uncovered a leaking butt-fusion joint in a 2-inch-diameter plastic gas pipe. NTSB investigators concluded that the probable cause of the leak, explosion, and fire was the fracture of the defective joint.NTSB Pipeline Accident Brief, https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/PAB0601.pdf, accessed 2018.01.10. * On September 26, vandals started up a trackhoe at a construction site in New Caney, Texas, and dug into a propylene pipeline. The escaping propylene ignited, causing nearby residents to evacuate. There were no injuries reported. 2 men were later arrested for this incident. * On September 27, 2004, near Blair, Nebraska, an ammonia pipeline failed, releasing 193,213 pounds of ammonia, resulting in the hospitalization of one individual and emergency responders evacuated houses within a one-mile circumference of the break. An estimated 1,000 fish were killed along North Creek and in a golf course pond. * On September 28, a pipeline failed in Hughes County, Oklahoma, spilling an estimated of diesel fuel. * In October, after Hurricane Ivan damaged a crude oil pipeline off the Louisiana Coast, crews from Shell Oil Company recovered 100,000 of an oil seawater mix. * On October 27, an anhydrous ammonia pipeline ruptured near Kingman, Kansas, and released approximately of anhydrous ammonia. Nobody was killed or injured due to the release. The anhydrous ammonia leak killed more than 20,000 fish along a 12.5-mile section of Smoots Creek, including some from threatened species. The pipeline had previous damage to it. The pipeline controller had misinterpreted the leak as other problems with the system operation, causing the leak to go on longer. As a result of this, and another ammonia pipeline leak the month before, the pipeline owner and its two operating companies were later fined $3.65 million. * On November 1, construction crew ruptured a high- pressure gas line in Little Rock, Arkansas, near one of the state's busiest intersections Monday, triggering a fire that melted traffic lights overhead. No one was injured. * On November 8, a NGL pipeline failed in a housing division in Ivel, Kentucky. The vapor cloud from the leak ignited, seriously burning a Kentucky State Trooper evacuating those living in the area. Eight others were injured and five houses were destroyed. The pipeline, only long, had 11 previous corrosion failures. Installed in the 1950s, the ruptured 4-inch steel transmission line belonged to Kentucky-West Virginia Gas Co., a division of Equitable Gas in Pittsburgh, but was operated by Colorado-based Mark West Hydrocarbon.Roger Alford, \\"Gas Explosion Destroys Kentucky Subdivision,\\" November 9, 2004, http://www.firehouse.com/news/10508161/gas- explosion-destroys-kentucky-subdivision.

A large gasoline spill was subsequently ignited, resulting in an explosive fireball that incinerated five workers, severely injuring four others. A Kinder Morgan worker had misread an as-built map, and had incorrectly marked the pipeline's route before the accident. CalOSHA (California Occupational Safety and Health Administration) cited Kinder Morgan for failure to accurately mark or map the pipeline location.Officials Dole Out Fines In Fatal Pipeline Explosion, May 5, 2005, http://www.ktvu.com/news/news/officials-dole-out-fines-in-fatal-pipeline- explosi/nKYpc/ , accessed June 18, 2014.

The Calnev Pipeline, owned and operated by the California-Nevada Pipeline Company, a subsidiary of Kinder-Morgan Energy Partners, is the main source of petroleum fuel products for the Las Vegas Valley, Nevada. An geyser of gasoline was discovered on the next morning, after numerous complaints of a strong gasoline odor along Interstate 15 in northern San Bernardino County, CA. * On December 15, employees were performing maintenance on a propane pipeline near Mantador, North Dakota, when a gasket on the pipeline's valve failed, causing a leak. Nearby resident were evacuated, and a rail line was shut down temporarily. There were no injuries. * On December 20, 2004, the Kinder Morgan Tejas pipeline at Pasadena, Texas, had a “significant event” due to a weld failure that caused control/relief equipment to fail.Texas Significant Incidents Listing,” 2003-2014, PHMSA Pipeline Safety Stakeholder Communication, U.S. DOT, http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/safety/IncDetSt_st_TX_flt_sig.html?nocache=8751, accessed June 17, 2014. * On December 24, as much as 5,000 gallons of crude oil spilled from a ConocoPhillips pipeline south of Laurel, Montana near the Yellowstone River. Hydrogen sulfide gas from the oil could have posed a major danger, but \\"the wind helped immensely\\" to dissipate the gas.

He presided the special court which heard the high treason case against Pervez Musharraf and one of the two judges on a three judge panel who convicted Musharraf for this crime and sentenced him to death. This was the first time in Pakistan's history that a military dictator was convicted for high treason. Early life and education Born in Dera Ismail Khan on March 16, 1961, he received his early education from Cantonment Public School, Peshawar. He got Higher Secondary School Certificate from the FG Inter College for Boys in 1977 and a Bachelor of Science degree from Islamia College, Peshawar in 1981. He did his LLB from Khyber Law College, Peshawar in 1985 and M.A. (Political Science) from the University of Peshawar in 1986. Judicial career Seth started his professional career in December 1985 when he was enrolled as an advocate in the lower courts. He was enrolled as an advocate of the high court on March 22, 1990. Subsequently, on May 24, 2008, he was enrolled as an advocate of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. His judicial career started on August 2, 2011, when he was elevated to the Peshawar High Court as an additional judge. He has also remained a banking judge, company judge and a member of subordinate Judiciary Service Tribunal, Peshawar. On 28 June 2018, he was appointed Chief Justice of Peshawar High Court. He was inducted into the special court hearing high treason case against Pervez Musharraf in October 2019 as the president of the court. On 17 December 2019, the three-member bench of this special court awarded death sentence to Musharraf in a short order. This short order was criticized by Director General of Inter-Services Public Relations of Pakistan military, General Asif Ghafoor. Ghafoor said in his statement that \\"there was pain and anguish among the rank and file of military\\" due to this punishment and that Musharraf cannot be a traitor since he served his country for 40 years and fought wars for its defense. Later, the short order was criticized by government ministers associated with Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, most prominently by Firdous Ashiq Awan and attorney general Anwar Mansoor Khan. The special court issued a 169-page long detailed order on 19 December 2019. He was widely criticized by government ministers and legislators associated with Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf for his opinionated note about giving an exemplary punishment to Musharraf. Seth wrote in paragraph 66 of the judgement that law enforcement agencies of Pakistan should arrest and hang Musharraf till death and if somehow he is able to evade this punishment and dies before the punishment then his body should be dragged and hanged for three days in D-Chowk of Islamabad in front of the Parliament building. The reasons he gave for this posthumous punishment was Musharraf's persistent and stubborn delaying tactics to avoid facing the court and ultimately the punishment. The judge also directed to bring all those to justice who was responsible to help Musharraf flee from the country. After the judgement, the Director General of Inter-Services Public Relations, General Asif Ghafoor issued veiled threats aimed at the judges who decided to punish Musharraf suggesting that they are enemy of the country and Pakistan Military knows how to defend its honour and dignity. Taking the cue from the General, three ministers belonging to Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Government appeared in a press conference and announced that government have decided to file a reference against Seth in Supreme Judicial Council for his removal from judiciary. During the conference, Firdous Ashiq Awan, Farogh Naseem, and Shehzad Akbar hurled insults at the judge. Awan described him as working for the enemy, called his verdict as a plot against armed forces and the country, Naseem said that the judge is mentally unfit and lacks mental capacity, and Akbar said that \\"whosoever wrote the Para 66 cannot be friend of the nation\\". In November 2018, Seth as part of two member bench of Peshawar High Court reversed sentences of military courts against 74 convicts, 50 of which were death sentences. That decision by Seth was used by this same government as an example in International Court of Justice (ICJ) to stress that courts in Pakistan are independent to operate without any influence from government or military. This helped Pakistan's case against Indian spy Kalbhushan Yadav as ICJ noted the verdict by Seth as the reason for their verdict to not reversing Yadav's death sentence as Seth's verdict established that decisions by military courts can be reviewed in Pakistan's superior judiciary thus Yadav is also free to file a review petition.

Wirnt took his material from the French romance Le bel inconnu of Renaud de Beaujeu, and used it with great freedom. Though extravagant and didactic, the poem is one of the best romances of the Arthurian cycle written in Germany, apart from the work of Wolfram von Eschenbach and Hartmann von Aue. A prose version was made toward the close of the fifteenth century and printed at Augsburg in 1493. Wigalois was edited by F. Pfeiffer (Leipzig, 1847). References * This work in turn cites: ** F.

It set several national records and influenced later Polish designs. Design and development ZASPL, the Aviation Association of students of the Lwów Technical University, was the oldest aviation organization in Poland. Revived after World War I, by 1926 it had workshops in Lwów which began building the glider designs of ZASPL member Wacław Czerwiński. The fourth of these, the CW IV, was an experimental two seat, high performance aircraft chiefly designed to explore thermal lift techniques. Thermal flying was still in ts infancy in 1930, having been first conclusively demonstrated in Germany in 1928. The CW IV was a wooden glider with a high, cantilever, three part wing built around two spars. A wide, rectangular centre-section occupied about one-third of the span. The outer panels were double-tapered, with ailerons which occupied the whole trailing edges. The leading edges and wingtips were covered with plywood and the rest with fabric. It had a narrow, rather flat-sided, ply covered fuselage with more rounded upper and lower surfaces forwards. The nose was covered with sheet aluminium. The wing was raised above the main fuselage on a streamlined pylon which reached ahead of it, with a fairing aft to the tail. The pilot's open cockpit was ahead of this structure, in front of a second, enclosed cockpit, fitted with dual control, at the centre of gravity under the wing. This cockpit had semi-circular openings in the pylon fairing for sideways vision and was accessed via a port-side door. A short skid under the forward fuselage as fitted with rubber shock absorbers for landings. The empennage of the CW IV was conventional, with ply covered fixed surfaces and fabric covered control surfaces. A triangular fin carried a tall, rounded, balanced rudder. The tailplane, a narrow, blunted triangle in plan, was mounted on top of the fuselage and carried split, rounded elevators. Operational history In October 1930 the CW IV flew for the first time during the Lwów group's fourth annual expedition to Bezmiechowa. It proved a success. Szczepan Grzeszczyk, flying it as a single-seater, set a new national duration record of 2:30:15 hours on October 29. On 13 November, with Zygmunt Laskowski in the rear seat, he flew for 1:2:18.2 hour and reached a height of above his starting point. As the CW IV was the first Polish two seat glider, these November flights were the first national records in those categories. In 1932 the CW IV went into the ZASPL shops for refurbishments and minor improvements, then went back to Bezmiechowa. In 1934, flown by Piotr Mynarski and A. Zalińsk, it raised the two seat national record on 19 June to 4:33 hours, then on 5 October to 9:7 hours. The CW IV was an important milestone in Polish glider development and its influence reached beyond World War II to the successful, single seat IS-B Komar.

History The word 'Carrs' comes from the Old Norse word 'Kjarr' meaning 'meadow recovered from bog' and indicates the original state and subsequent use of the area. Most of the land upon which the park lies was owned by Lord Stamford and part of the Pownall Hall estate until being sold during the period 1841 to 1859. In 1800 a cotton mill was built on the site using the River Bollin for power, by 1828 it was being used to spin and weave silk and in 1903 it was being used as a laundry, it burned down in 1928 and little remains of the building. The park began to take shape in 1925 when Henry Boddington who created Boddingtons Brewery and resident at Pownall Hall gave playing fields to the public, this is commemorated on a stone arch at Chancel Lane. In 1935 Wilmslow Urban District Council bought the land adjacent and established The Carrs Park. The park follows the River Bollin which meanders to Quarry Bank Mill and then to Styal Country Park. Quarry Bank was originally a working mill that took power from the River Bollin and is now owned by the National Trust and a tourist attraction. Facilities There is a children's play area, multi-use football area, basketball, riverside and woodland walks, open grassland and picnicking.

The momentum created from the Chicano Movement spurred a Chicano Renaissance among Chicanas and Chicanos. Political art was created by poets, writers, playwrights, and artists and used to defend against their oppression and societal marginalization. During the 1970s, Chicana feminist artists differed from their Anglo-feminist counterparts in the way they collaborated. Chicana feminist artists often utilized artistic collaborations and collectives that included men, while Anglo-feminist artists generally utilized women-only participants.  The Woman's Building (1973-1991)  The Woman's Building opened in Los Angeles, CA in 1973. In addition to housing women-owned businesses, the center held multiple art galleries and studio spaces. Women of color, including Chicanas, historically experienced racism and discrimination within the building from white feminists. Not many Chicana artists were allowed to participate in the Woman's Building's exhibitions or shows. Chicana artists Olivia Sanchez and Rosalyn Mesquite were among the few included. Additionally, the group Las Chicanas exhibited Venas de la Mujer in 1976. =Social Public Art Resource Center (SPARC)= In 1976, co-founders Judy Baca (the only Chicana), Christina Schlesinger, and Donna Deitch established the Social and Public Art Resource Center (SPARC). It consisted of studio and workshop spaces for artists. SPARC functioned as an art gallery and also kept records of murals. SPARC is still active and encourages a space for Chicana/o community collaboration in cultural and artistic campaigns. =Las Chicanas= Las Chicanas members were women only and included artists Judy Baca, Judithe Hernández, Olga Muñiz, and Josefina Quesada. In 1976, the group exhibited Venas de la Mujer in the Woman's Building. =Los Four= Muralist Judithe Hernández joined the all-male art collective in 1974 as its fifth member. The group already included Frank Romero, Beto de la Rocha, Gilbert Luján, and Carlos Almaráz. The collective was active in the 1970s through early 1980s.  Street Art  =Murals= La Ofrenda, Yreina Cervántez, Los Angeles, 1989 The Great Wall of Los Angeles, Judy Baca, Los Angeles, 1978 Murals were the preferred medium of street art used by Chicana artists during the Chicano Movement. Judy Baca led the large-scalecale project for SPARC, The Great Wall of Los Angeles. It took five summers to complete the 700 meter long mural. The mural was completed by Baca, Judithe Hernández, Olga Muñiz, Isabel Castro, Yreina Cervántez, and Patssi Valdez in addition to over 400 more artists and community youth. Located in Tujunga Flood Control Channel in the Valley Glen area of the San Fernando Valley, the mural depicts California’s erased history of marginalized people of color and minorities. In 1989, Yreina Cervántez along with assistants Claudia Escobedes, Erick Montenegro, Vladimir Morales, and Sonia Ramos began the mural, La Ofrenda, located in downtown Los Angeles. The mural, a tribute to Latina and Latino farm workers, features Dolores Huerta at the center with two women arched the history of Los Angeles and met with historians as she originally planned out the mural. The mural was halted after Carrasco refused alterations demanded from City Hall due to her depictions of formerly enslaved entrepreneur and philanthropist Biddy Mason, the internment of Japanese American citizens during World War II, and the 1943 Zoot Suit Riots. =Performance Art= Performance art was not as popularly utilized among Chicana artists but it still had its supporters. Patssi Valdez was a member of the performance group Asco from the early 1970s to the mid-1980s. Asco’s art spoke about the problems that arise from Chicanas/os unique experience residing at the intersection of racial, gender, and sexual oppression.  Photography  Laura Aguilar, known for her \\"compassionate photography,\\" which often involved using herself as the subject of her work but also individuals who lacked representation in the mainstream: Chicanas, the LBGTQ community, and women of different body types. During the 1990s, Aguilar photographed the patrons of an Eastside Los Angeles lesbian bar. Aguilar utilized her body in the desert as the subject of her photographs wherein she manipulated it to look sculpted from the landscape. In 1990, Aguilar created Three Eagles Flying, a three-panel photograph featuring herself half nude in the center panel with the flag of Mexico and the United States of opposite sides as her body is tied up by the rope and her face covered. The triptych represents the imprisonment felt by the two cultures she belongs to.  Modern Work  Though the Chicano movement has passed, Chicanas continue to use art as a way to uplift their perspectives and celebrate Chicana voices. New art forms have risen as technology has begun to play a more vital role in daily life as artists like Guadalupe Rosales use platforms like Instagram as a part of their work. Rosales uses her role as an artist and an archivist to artfully collect photos and magazines of Chicanas from the 1990s. She portrayed her own understanding of growing up Chicana in East Los Angeles, a predominantly Latino area. On her account Veteranas y Rucas, her photos depict men in baggy pants and women with teased hair making their way through a time of anti-immigrant sentiments and gang violence. What started as a way for Rosales' family to connect over their shared culture through posting images of Chicana/o history and nostalgia soon grew to an archive dedicated to not only ’90 Chicana/o youth culture but also as far back as the 1940s. Additionally, Rosales has created art installations to display the archive away from its original digital format and exhibited solo shows Echoes of a Collective Memory and Legends Never Die, A Collective Memory. Rosales is the recipient of a 2019 Gordon Parks Foundation Fellowship. She was the Los Angeles County Museum of Art’s first Instagram artist in residence in 2017. Others like poet Felicia “Fe” Montes have gained popularity for their work in Chicana art for still other forms. Montes uses spoken word and slam traditions among other mediums to relate with her Latina following about identity. She reads her poetry in unconventional places and questions women’s historically subservient and lower-serving roles than men. As she writes, she keeps the Chicano culture in Los Angeles in mind, through women's collectives like Mujeres de Maiz.  Themes  =La Virgen= Los Angeles Plaza Park, 2014 Over the years, la Virgen de Guadalupe has been used by Chicana artists to explore themes of repression and feminine strength. She has become a symbol through which artists have attempted to eradicate the stigmas facing women’s place in society and ownership of their bodies. Alma López, Margarita “Mita” Cuaron, Yolanda López and Ester Hernandez are two Chicana feminist artists who used reinterpretations of La Virgen de Guadalupe to empower Chicanas. La Virgen as a symbol of the challenges Chicanas face as a result of the unique oppression they experience religiously, culturally, and through their gender. * Alma López focuses on eradicating the stigmas surrounding women. She painted “Our Lady” in 1999, which portrays a modern Virgen de Guadalupe unclothed, supported by an unclothed “angel” with the wings of a monarch.Lopez, Alma. Our Lady. 1999. Painting. La Virgen wears nothing but flowers, but stands powerfully with her hands at her hips and her face expressing confidence and seriousness. She has reimagined the traditional icon to explore the shamelessness she believes should stem from a woman of today who does not conform to the expectation of society. Especially since La Virgen his typically clothed from head to toe, this piece of art challenges the themes the original pushes forward, including modesty and subservience. She expresses the need for ownership of the indigenous body.Surage, Chloe, \\"Art and La Virgin de Guadalupe: Towards Social Transformation\\" (2011). Undergraduate Honors Theses. 691. https://scholar.colorado.edu/honr_theses/691 Alma López also painted “Lupe and Sirena in Love” in 1999, which depicts the traditional Virgen de Guadalupe, nicknamed Lupe, lovingly embracing a mermaid.López, Alma. Lupe and Sirena in Love. 1999. Painting. This is Alma López's commentary on Catholic Church teaching regarding sexuality and gender. She portrays a sacred individual romantically embracing another woman, directly challenging commonly followed beliefs that ostracize LGBTQ individuals. Alma López pushes the boundaries that confine the common woman, depicting La Virgen de Guadalupe in modern and controversial light as she paints. \\"Our Lady of Controversy: Alma Lopez's 'Irreverent Apparition'\\" (2011) demonstrates some of the angry responses she has received for her work. \\"Irreverent Apparition\\" is mixed media and is a sacrilegious depiction of La Virgen. * Margarita “Mita” Cuaron focuses on light and rebirth when she paints La Virgen de Guadalupe. In her artwork “Virgen de Guadalupe Baby” from 1992, Cuaron toys with the idea of a symbol that never stays static. In her pieces, La Virgen has come to mean the cycle of life.Surage, Chloe, \\"Art and La Virgin de Guadalupe: Towards Social Transformation\\" (2011). Undergraduate Honors Theses. 691. https://scholar.colorado.edu/honr_theses/691 She depicts a baby surrounded by the womb, which is shaped by clouds and La Virgen's typical sunlight and green garments. Within the child's clasped hands is a light red heart.Cuaron, Margerita. La Virgen de Guadalupe Baby. 1992. Painting. The child is sheltered by the womb, which offers protection from the outside world. * Like Alma Lopez, Yolanda López also focuses on themes of sexuality and the stigmas of women when she portrays La Virgen de Guadalupe. In her piece, “Love Goddess” from 1978, Yolanda López merges the image of La Virgen with an image of Sandro Bottecelli's “The Birth of Venus” from the mid 1480s.Lopez, Yolanda. Love Goddess. 1978. Painting. She makes the commentary that Christian nature rejects the natural appearance of women's bodies by embracing the fact that at an even earlier age, the Greek mythology would embrace it without the shame and fear that has developed.Surage, Chloe, \\"Art and La Virgin de Guadalupe: Towards Social Transformation\\" (2011). Undergraduate Honors Theses. 691. https://scholar.colorado.edu/honr_theses/691 Yolanda López challenges the virginal image by eradicating the stigma and sin that often associates; she infuses a sacred religious image with sexuality so as to celebrate it rather than be ashamed. * Ester Hernández references the sacred Virgen de Guadalupe in her painting, La Ofrenda (1988).Hernández, Ester. La Ofrenda. 1988. Painting. Painting recognizes lesbian love, challenges the traditional role of la familia. It defied the reverence and holiness of La Virgen by being depicted as a tattoo on a lesbian's back. She also painted La Virgen de Guadalupe Defendiendo los Derechos de Los Xicanos (1975).Hernández, Ester. La Virgen de Guadalupe Defendiendo los Derechos de Los Xicanos. 1975. Painting. =Collective Memory/Correcting History= The idea of sharing the erased history of Chicanas/os has been popular among Chicana artists beginning in the 1970s until present day. Judy Baca and Judithe Hernández have both utilized the theme or correcting history in reference to their mural works. In contemporary art, Guadalupe Rosales uses the theme of collective memory to share Chicana/o history and nostalgia.

More generally Balakrishnan specializes in algorithmic number theory and arithmetic geometry. She is Clare Boothe Luce Assistant Professor at Boston University, and a Sloan Research Fellow. Education and career Balakrishnan was born in Mangilao, Guam to Narayana and Shizuko Balakrishnan; her father is a professor of chemistry at the University of Guam. As a junior at the Harvest Christian Academy (Guam), Balakrishnan won an honorable mention in the 2001 Karl Menger Memorial Award competition, for the best mathematical project in the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. Her project concerned elliptic coordinate systems. In the following year, she won the National High School Student Calculus Competition, given as part of the United States of America Mathematical Olympiad. Balakrishnan graduated from Harvard University in 2006, with both a magna cum laude bachelor's degree and a master's degree in mathematics. She moved to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for her doctoral studies, completing her Ph.D. in 2011. Her dissertation, Coleman integration for hyperelliptic curves: algorithms and applications, was supervised by Kiran Kedlaya. She returned to Harvard for postdoctoral studies from 2011 to 2013, and then moved to the University of Oxford from 2013 to 2016, where she was a Junior Research Fellow in Balliol College and a Titchmarsh Research Fellow in the Mathematical Institute. She became Clare Booth Luce Assistant Professor at Boston University in 2016. Balakrishnan is one of the principal investigators in the Simons Collaboration on Arithmetic Geometry, Number Theory, and Computation, a large multi-university collaboration involving Boston University, Harvard, MIT, Brown University, and Dartmouth College, with additional collaborators from other universities in the US, England, Australia, the Netherlands, and Canada.. She also serves on the board of directors of the Number Theory Foundation and the editorial board of Research in Number Theory. Contributions In 2017, Balakrishnan led a team of mathematicians in solving the \\"cursed curve\\" X_s(13). This curve is modeled by the equation :y^4+5x^4-6x^2y^2+6x^3z+26x^2yz+10xy^2z-10y^3z-32x^2z^2-40xyz^2+24y^2z^2+32xz^3-16yz^3=0 and, as a Diophantine equation, the problem is to identify all the combinations of rational numbers for the variables x, y, and z for which the equation is true. Although as an explicit equation this curve has a complicated form, it is significant in the theory of elliptic curves, as a modular curve whose solutions characterize the one remaining unsolved case of a theorem of on the Galois representations of elliptic curves without complex multiplication. Computations by and had previously identified seven solutions to the cursed curve (six corresponding to elliptic curves with complex multiplication, and one cusp), but their computational methods were unable to show that the list of solutions was complete. Following a suggestion of Oxford mathematician Minhyong Kim, Balakrishnan and her co-authors constructed a \\"Selmer variety\\" associated with the curve, such that the rational points of the curve all lie on the Selmer variety as well, and such that the number of points of intersection of the curve and the variety can be computed. Using this method, they proved that the seven known solutions to the cursed curve are the only ones possible.. This work was initially repored in 2017 arXiv preprint and was published in Annals of Mathematics in 2019 . As well as for her work in number theory, Balakrishnan is known for her work implementing number-theoretical algorithms as part of the SageMath computer algebra system.

A call for tenders for the construction of 'a small brick church at O'Connell Town', the original St. Stephen's Church, was placed in the Sydney Morning Herald, Saturday 23 November 1844. H. Knight was awarded the contract to build the church, and a Mr. Brander was the carpenter. The foundation stone was laid, on Thursday 26 December 1844, by the Right Reverend Dr. William Broughton, first Bishop of Australia, who also preached. The Reverend Dr. T. Steele, Rector of St. Peter's Cook's River, assisted in the ceremony that was attended by a large crowd composed principally of residents from the immediate neighbourhood. The church was situated on the \\"New Town Road\\", near Victoria Street, on land donated by representatives of former Governor William Bligh's widow, Elizabeth. The building was completed in nine months, at a cost of £417, and was consecrated on Tuesday 9 September 1845, by Bishop Broughton, at a service conducted by Dr. Steele, before a church \\"crowded to excess\\" with clergy, dignitaries, including Lady Gipps, wife of the Governor of New South Wales, Sir Maurice O'Connell, Lieutenant Governor of New South Wales, and his wife, Mary, a daughter of Governor Bligh, the Mayor, members of the Newtown Odd Fellows Lodge, and parishioners. The newspaper account described the church as a \\"very neat brick edifice, seventy feet long by twenty-six wide\\" with a vestry and belfry. The exterior was rather plain, the main feature being large rectangular windows, and the vestry/porch in the center of the building's three bays. The interior was \\"very neatly fitted up, all the pews being open\\". The roof, likewise, was open. Both open bench pews and open roof were recent innovations in the colony, as was the seating arrangement for the choir, in stalls facing one another, in the chancel. With the growth of population in Newtown in the 1860s it became clear that the small church had become inadequate. It had been designed so that it could be easily enlarged if necessary. This course of action, however, was rejected in favour of erecting a new church on a new site in Camperdown Cemetery. When finally replaced, the original church remained in use as the parish hall and Sunday School, until destroyed by fire on 16 September 1938. In order to build on the newly chosen site, an act of the Parliament of New South Wales was required. A petition from the parish, signed by Christopher Rolleston, William Sedgwick, William Crane, T.C. Breillat and S. C. Brown, requested an act to enable the Bishop of Sydney to convey land to trustees of the church for the erection of a church and parsonage in the Cemetery grounds. Upon presentation by Charles Windeyer, member for West Sydney, the New South Wales Legislative Assembly voted, 10 February 1871, to receive the petition and proceed with an Act. The Act, entitled The Camperdown Cemetery Trust Bill, moved through both houses of parliament quickly and by late March it had received the Governor's consent. Copies were printed by the Government Printing Office and available at 6d apiece. The Government Gazette, 31 March 1871, provided official notice of the Act. Edmund Blacket had been appointed architect on 17 February 1871 and by June had submitted plans and called for tenders for the first part of the building. Blacket agreed to provide supervision of the construction. The contract for the first stage of the stonework (walls to the height of 17 feet) was awarded to Robert Kirkham and his partner, George Dowling. The foundation stone was laid by the Governor, Somerset Lowry-Corry, 4th Earl Belmore, on 11 November 1871. The rector, the Reverend Robert Taylor conducted the first part of the service assisted by other clergy, and the Dean of Sydney preached. A scroll was read by C. Rolleston, and deposited in the cavity of the stone in a sealed bottle, which also contained copies of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Australian Churchman. The scroll was as follows: - \\"Newtown: To the glory of God, and in remembrance of the Christian Martyr St. Stephen, the foundation-stone of this Church was laid by his Excellency the Right Honorable Somerset Richard, Earl of Belmore, Governor-in-Chief of the colony of New South Wales, on the eleventh day of November, in the year of our Lord, 1871, being the thirty-fifth year in the reign of her Majesty Victoria, Queen of Great Britain and Ireland, &c.;, &c.;, &c.; The Right Reverend F. Barker, D.D., Bishop of Sydney and Metropolitan. Incumbent - The Rev. Robert Taylor, of Moore College, Liverpool, N.S.W. Trustees of Cemetery - Messrs. T.C. Breillat, S.C. Brown, W. Crane, sen., C.

Honorary Treasurers - Messrs. T.C. Breillat and S.C. Brown. Honorary Secretaries - Rev. R. Taylor and Mr. M.R. Allan. Architect E.T. Blacket, Esq. Builders - Messrs. G. Dowling and R. Kirkham.\\" It was announced that the church when completed would cost £8000, and £6000 would be needed to complete the edifice so that it could be used for divine service. £3000 had already been subscribed by the inhabitants of Newtown, and about £900 by the friends of those who had been buried in Camperdown Cemetery. The building progressed quickly and by September 1873 tenders were called for the second stage of the stonework and completion of the walls of the church, clerestory, tower and steeple. Robert Kirkham was awarded the contract for the second stage. Others involved in the construction of the church were William Curtis, roofing, W. E. Elphinstone, carpentry, and W. Watson, sittings. St. Stephen's was completed in 1874, and a meeting of the subscribers to the building fund was held on Saturday 28 March to allot and let the pews. The first service of worship held on 5 April 1874, Easter Sunday, and an official opening on 9 April. The tower and spire were completed in 1876. St. Stephen's is an English Decorated Gothic Revival church in cruciform plan with side aisles, gallery, two vestries, and porch. The building is dominated, on the north side, by the fine high stone tower and spire, which can be seen for miles. The walls of the church are sandstone, quarried from the nearby Pyrmont stone quarries. The exterior ornamentation, apart from the stone traced windows is restrained. Interior columns are of Melbourne bluestone and the roof is slate. With dimensions of , and a final construction cost of A£13,000, it was the largest and most prominent building in the area, and was widely recognized as one of Edmund Blacket's finest designs. The full amount for the cost of the building was subscribed at one time making it possible to erect it in a continuous operation without stops and starts unlike so many other churches Blacket designed. Eminent architectural historian Morton Herman calls the design of St. Stephen's, \\"a magnificent success - It is a church designed to be seen all round from every angle, and from every angle it is eminently satisfactory\\". In another of his books, Herman designates St. Stephen's as \\"one of the finest Gothic Revival buildings in Sydney.\\" Joan Kerr describes the church as 'one of [Blacket's] most successful buildings', Blacket having, by 1870 \\"completely mastered his Decorated Gothic repertoire\\" and [being] more confident in composition and less fussy in detailing than in some of his earlier designs.' The tower and spire, she notes, are one of Blacket's finest compositions. The two-manual pipe organ was built by the London firm, J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd, in 1874, at the cost of £800. Blacket designed the organ case, sending specification to Walker and Son. He also was instrumental in having the organ placed in the south transept rather than in the west gallery. The bells, a set of twelve hemispherical bells, new type of bell, manipulated by a keyboard, were ordered by Blacket from the well known foundry of Messrs. Mears and Stainbank, Whitechapel, in the East End of London. Prior to installation in St. Stephen's tower, they were exhibited in the great Sydney International Exhibition of 1879-80. Other than some minor alterations to the organ in 1895 by G.K. Sandford of Newtown, and a redesigning of the chancel by prominent Sydney architect, Burcham Clamp, in 1927 and carried out by J. M and A. Pringle, the church remains as Blacket designed it.Kirkham, 2010 =Rectory= The adjoining Rectory was built in 1910. The Sexton's Cottage was built in 1848 and the huge Moreton Bay Fig Tree (Ficus macrophylla) to its immediate south-west and some of the European oak trees (Quercus robur) in the cemetery also date from this time. =Cemetery= The Camperdown Cemetery was established in 1848 on about 13 acres of the 240 acres granted to Governor Bligh, known as the Camperdown Estate. This was the first privately owned and operated Anglican cemetery in Sydney.Brettell, 2015, 2 It was the main cemetery for Sydney from 1849 to 1867.Diesendorf, 2001 During this time it received over 15,000 interments and was the subject of a state government select committee inquiry. This inquiry was convened to address the mismanagement of a number of cemeteries within Sydney and it found that the accusations directed at the Camperdown Cemetery were founded. Sale of plots was terminated in 1867 and it closed in 1868 but a trickle of burials continued until 1920s-1940s (sources conflict on the end date), these being within family and pre-purchased plots and crypts). Following its closure, the cemetery fell into disrepair.Brettell, 2015, 3 It was reduced in size in the 1950s when Camperdown Memorial Rest Park was established,Diesendorf 2001 comprising two distinct sections: the St. Stephens Church and graveyard (within a six foot high sandstone wall) and the Camperdown Memorial Rest Park (without the wall), treated as broadly grassed open space with pockets of tree planting, and, directly south of the graveyard wall, a children's play ground area. The Church and graveyard have been managed since the 1970s by the Camperdown Cemetery Trust and the Camperdown Memorial Rest Park is managed by Marrickville Council.  Description  St Stephens Church of England is an English Decorated Gothic Revival church in cruciform plan with side aisles, gallery, two vestries, porch and tower with a stone spire on the north side. It is built from Pyrmont stone with a slate roof and stone traceried windows. Externally the church is well massed, the whole being dominated by a fine stone tower and spire. The ornament of the exterior is restrained.Lucas 1975 ;Organ The fine Walker organ with 1,100 pipes and tracker action was made in England in 1874.Frith 1977:7 ;Carillon The peal of 20 domes was made in England by the Whitechapel foundry and was installed in the church in 1880 after being used in the Great Exhibition in the Botanic Gardens in 1879. The site also contains the rectory and sexton's cottage.  Heritage listing  This building is one of Australia's best Gothic Revival churches on this scale and its unique and historic surroundings render it a building of the highest importance. The church is in a prominent position on the crest of a rise, approximately three miles south west of the city of Sydney. The spire is notable for miles. The cemetery forms a unique close to the Church; it contains numerous fine trees including a large Moreton Fig Tree. St Stephen's Anglican Church was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

It was released on June 24, 2014 and removed from app stores on July 15, 2015. In the game, the player controls a fighter and taps the screen to attack a rival. Depending on the character chosen, a different musical theme would be used. Additionally, the player can earn experience by defeating enemies similar to role-playing video games. SNK conceptualized this game as a mix of different gaming genres with music being the focus. The game received average scores by video games journalists. While the music and fighting system has been praised, the use of downloadable content (DLC) was criticized for making the complete package too expensive during the time that The Rhythm of Fighters was a paid game. Nevertheless, SNK found that the title had considerable worldwide downloads, with the DLC content being well received. Gameplay Kyo Kusanagi attacking Terry Bogard after the player uses the tap required. The game combines elements from rhythm games, fighting games and role-playing games. The player is given a character from SNK franchises such as The King of Fighters and Fatal Fury. The player can have their fighter character attack enemies by beat tapping: tapping the handheld device's touch screen in synchronization with the music. Performing different tappings, the characters can execute normal attacks, combos, special moves or their strongest techniques. Both fighters are given health bars during combat. The winning character can level up and expand their strength. The game has a total of 14 musical tracks that can be unlocked during play; certain musical themes appear as downloadable content (DLC). Players are given different themes depending on the characters they use: while using Geese Howard the theme is \\"Soy Sauce to Geese\\", Geese's most recurring theme from Fatal Fury while Kyo Kusanagi is presented with \\"Tears\\", his theme song from The King of Fighters '99. The initial cast is composed of Kyo, Athena Asamiya and Ryo Sakazaki. Additional characters like Iori Yagami and Terry Bogard can be unlocked through downloadable content. Development The SNK Playmore development team had a concept to create a new video game genre by combining fighting game elements and music genre themes together. While their games were known for story and gameplay, SNK noticed their fans also enjoyed the background music themes composed for their titles. Originally a paid game, SNK turned The Rhythm of Fighters into a free-to-play game to keep consistency with Metal Slug Defense, another free game, and to avoid issues with their fanbase. Multiple easter eggs were put in the game to please returning fans, such as how the music changes with in-game commands. On February 14, 2014, SNK trademarked the title \\"The Rhythm of Fighters\\". The game was first announced by SNK Playmore in June 2014. The first form of downloadable content became available in July under the form of four new tracks based on Fatal Fury. This was followed by eight more tracks in the same month: four tracks from The King of Fighters '97 and four tracks from Metal Slug Defense. In July, SNK added new tracks from The King of Fighters '99 and Samurai Shodown II. In September 2014 the game became free-to-play. It was removed from app stores on July 15, 2015. Reception Shortly after its release, SNK noticed that the game was being downloaded across many world regions. The DLC for Fatal Fury Special and Metal Slug Defense theme songs were also popular. Google Play Store recorded more than 1 million downloads by July 2015. In 2014, The Guardian listed it as one of the best android games for its mixture genres. While Kotaku noted they liked seeing this KOF spin- off, people were instead looking forward to another main installment in the franchise as The King of Fighters XIII had been released years ago Rhythm. Destructoid gave the game a 7 out of 10, praising its low initial price and the use of music, but noted that the game suffered from the \\"unfortunate trappings of the mobile platform\\". The same score was given by Pocket Gamer UK which stated that it was not only for SNK fans but suitable for general players. The reviewer expressed surprise with the gameplay system's entertaining modes but felt that it was not unique. Touch Arcade noted that \\"It's not the most high-effort product, and the initial buy-in only gets you about half the content, but I still had a really good time with The Rhythm of Fighters\\" and gave it a 3.5 out of 5. The reviewer felt there were some lag issues during his playthrough on his iPhone 5S which might make other ports superior in comparison. Critics in general found the price for the entire game too expensive based on the use of DLC. 148apps was harsher in the terms of music employed during most of the game, finding it unfitting. Nevertheless, the reviewer praised the fighting system based on how the player's actions create a fight similar to games developed from the franchise. In contrast to most other reviews, Hyper felt that the DLC was reasonably priced.

The facility is located adjacent to the railway line running between Sydenham railway station and St Peters railway station. It was designed by the NSW Public Works Department, which built the project from 1935 to 1941. It is also known as Sydenham Stormwater Basin and Drainage Pumping Station (DPS1). The property is owned by Sydney Water. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 November 2002.  History  With the completion of the Illawarra railway beyond Sydenham in the 1880s, the urburbanisation of the Marrickville Valley increased rapidly. It was soon found that the valley had significant drainage problems, which were partly solved by the construction of a stormwater pumping station in Carrington Road, Marrickville in 1897 (now Sewage Pumping Station 271) and three main stormwater channels, comprising the Eastern, Western and Central Channels. In the 1930s the government decided to improve the drainage system, which included an allocation of unemployment relief funds for drainage works in Marrickville Municipality. The scheme included the drainage of the northern section of the low level area north of Marrickville Road, comprising the excavation of a storage pit, the erection of a pumping station with a rising main discharging into the Eastern Channel and the construction of a system of channels discharging into the pit. The pit and pumping station were constructed by the Public Works Department in the late 1930s and transferred to the Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board in 1941. Sections of the southern and western pit walls collapsed following heavy rains and were rebuilt in the 1950s. In 1968 a concrete floor and a silt pit were installed to the base of the pit. From 2019 the area covering the stormwater drain was used to carry part of the infrastructure for the Sydney Metro City & Southwest with the construction of \\"a new aqueduct over the existing heritage-listed Sydenham Pit while retaining the existing heritage listed pump station.\\"Major Sydenham upgrade for Sydney Metro. Accessed 18 November 2019.  Description  Sydenham Storage Pit and Pumping Station consists of two distinct parts: the pit and pumping station (albeit they are integral in operation). The pit consists of a nine metre deep basin with the sides formed into batters. The batters are faced with sandstone blocks laid horizontally in courses of about 300mm. The width of the blocks range from square to over one metre in length. The blocks are dressed on four sides with the face sparrow picked. Along the top of the stone facing wall, earth batters and an open concrete drain were formed. An access ramp to the base of the pit is located along the northern wall with entry from Railway Parade. The stone walls are penetrated by channel outlets in the southeast corner and in the centre of the western edge. The boundary of the site is planted with Oleanders. The pumping station is constructed of reinforced concrete and consists of a series of fins that rise 12 metres from the base of the pit to support the pump house that has its floor level about 1.8 metres above Railway Parade. Five concrete fins interspaced with four cylindrical concrete water shafts are incorporated, with the southern facade supported by three concrete piers joined by a horizontal cross-beam in the centre. The floor of the pumphouse overhangs the end concrete fin by about a metre and is supported by four concrete brackets. The pumphouse has the approximate internal dimensions of 7.2m wide x 17m long and 5.6m ceiling height. A switch room adjoins the eastern facade of the main pump room and has the approximate internal dimensions of 4.8m x .9m. The pumphouse has a tiled gable roof which continues down at the same pitch over the switch room. The southern and northern facades have three closely spaced vertical steel framed windows that form a square in the centre of the wall. The tops of the windows are overhung by a concrete lintel. Along the western facade of the pumphouse are five vertical windows centred on the void between the concrete fins.The building was designed in a version of the Inter-War Mediterranean domestic style. The pumping station and drain are substantially intact.  Heritage listing  The Sydenham Pit and Pumping Station is of historic, aesthetic and technical significance. Historically, it is the first such infrastructure built in the SWC system and is an intact and major component of the Marrickville low level stormwater drainage infrastructure that was built in response to increasing urban expansion since the 1870s in an area prone to flooding. Its large scale and labour-intensive construction method of excavating the pit reflects the abundance of labour during the Great Depression and the type of public works undertaken to provide relief work for the unemployed. Aesthetically, the use of pitched dry packed ashlar sandstone walls to line the sides of the pit provides a pleasantly textured and coloured finish to the pit. It is a major landmark and dramatic component of the industrial landscape of Sydenham particularly as viewed from the railway. The pumping station is a very good example of a utilitarian building displaying Inter-War Mediterranean style architectural details. Technically, the pumping plant contains good working examples of 1930s pumps, particularly three Metropolitan Vickers pumps, and its original electrical mains equipment has been preserved insitu during upgrading in .

It was designed by the New South Wales Public Works Department, which built it from 1898 to 1900. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 November 2002.  History  The stack was built by the Public Works Department on the Metropolitan Water Sewerage & Drainage Board's behalf as part of the Western Suburbs Sewerage Scheme, put into service 1898-1900. The steel access door in the base of the stack opens to step-irons leading down to the penstock chamber below. The chamber is the junction of three sewer mains, the Eastern Main Branch (reticulating Marrickville, Petersham, Newtown, Leichhardt, Annandale & Camperdown), the Northern Main Branch (reticulating Marrickville, Petersham, Annandale, Leichhardt & Ashfield) and the Western Main Branch (reticulating Ashfield, Burwood, Drummoyne, Strathfield, Concord and Homebush). The Outfall Main originally led to the sewage farm at Rockdale, but from 1916 has been connected to the Southern and Western Suburbs Ocean Outfall Sewer (SWSOOS), terminating at the Long Bay treatment works at Malabar. The stack was truncated by in 2017 to meet current earthquake and wind loading codes. A large crack in the vent was also repaired at the same time. The cottages were sold by Sydney Water in 2018.  Description  A pair of Queen Anne Revival workers cottages flank the 1898 brick sewer vent stack, which is sited amongst detached late Victorian and turn of the 20th century dwellings. The cottages form part of a fairly diverse architectural character streetscape, many of which are substantially intact, although late 20th century alterations have affected a few dwellings in the immediate visual catchment. The brick stack is constructed of moulded bricks, with an overall classical proportion, detailing and entasis to the shaft. The shaft is presently fitted with steel bands as extra support fitted in the late 20th century. It appears as though a concrete band towards the capital of the shaft is a mid to late 20th century alteration but that is to be confirmed. The construction of the cottages is load bearing brick in English bond with original timber joinery including: windows, doors, turned timber verandah posts and boarded verandah ends, Marseilles pattern terracotta tiles, brick chimneys and terracottag chimney pots. Internally the cottages are also substantially intact retaining much of their original finishes and joinery. The front fence is a conservation of the original. No. 24 is the western cottage to the vent shaft. The lattice in the front garden of no. 24 is from the late 20th century. In the early 1990s the two cottages were subject to a high quality programme of conservation works including authentic colour scheme which survives today. The cottages and vent shaft are integral to the streetscape characteristics of the immediate area, and are in themselves excellent examples of their type, design and construction from that period. Both the cottages and the shaft are substantially intact and are still used for their original purposes as dwellings and vent shaft although not necessarily as workers cottages from the Water Board. This is in itself a rarity in Sydney Water's system. The vent shaft is a landmark particularly from the south west to the south eastern areas, as it is sited in an elevated position towards the southern side of the rise.  Heritage listing  A rare, if not unique, combination of Queen Anne revival brick Water Board cottages and sewer vent exhibiting excellent qualities of the brick and stonemasons craft, the likes of which are not probable to be reproduced again. Sewer Vent and Cottages was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 November 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The cottages are tangible reminders of the historical importance employees were valued at the time of its construction. The vent stack historically is strategically placed at the junction of the western main sewer branches. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The vent stack is a prominent landmark within the area surrounding the cottages. The cottages and vent stack in themselves make a high quality contribution to the residential streetscape of Premier Street. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The cottages and vent stack are classified by the National Trust of Australia (NSW) and with this group are likely to be held in high regard by members of the local community. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The cottages and sewer vent exhibit construction techniques and detailing, the quality of which is unlikely to be reproduced. The vent is a prime strategic position for the function it plays in the maintenance and operation of the sewer main. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. They are collectively as a pair, unique examples of their type of vent and cottages in Sydney Water's system and rare, if not unique in NSW. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The cottages, albeit of a high quality, are representative of the Queen Anne style of architecture around the turn of the 20th century.

It was designed and built by the New South Wales Public Works Department. It is also known as SPS 271. The property is owned by Sydney Water. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999.  History  In 1889, the newly constructed Board of Water Supply and Sewerage assumed responsibility for the water and sewerage service from the City Council. This instigated a gradual move away from the practise of combining sewerage and stormwater and led to the commencement of the BOOS which discharged into the ocean at Bondi and the South Western system which drained to a sewage farm at Botany. A series of low level sewage pumping stations were constructed to transport waste against gravity by means of a series of rising mains. The Carrington Road Pumping Station was built in the late 1890s, and handed over to the Metropolitan Board of Water Supply and Sewerage in 1900. The low level portions of Marrickville, Newtown, Erskineville, Alexandria and St Peters are still serviced by a low level sewer which discharges into the wells of Marrickville Pumping Station. The sewage is then pumped to the high level of the Eastern Branch of the SWOOS. Marrickville SPS also receives stormwater discharge from the Central stormwater channel during certain high tides in the Cooks River.  Description  The Marrickville SPS complex consists of a combined boiler house and engine room, a large chimney stack and a residence. The residence is an unadorned two- storey brick building designed in Federation Queen Anne style. Masonry is English bond and the facade is accentuated by timber filgree detailing. The pumping station/ boiler house is designed in classic Federation Romanesque style. Decorative Gothic buttresses with steep copings flank its sides, round headed windows surmounted by arches of rusticated sandstone typify the window openings, and the walls and gables are accentuated by machicolation motifs. The gables have sandstone copings with bracketed kneelers. The windows are small paned figured glass with pivotal awnings typical of the Federation style. The internal doors are round-headed diagonal-panelled double doors and are similar in style to the external doors. The building originally had a slate roof with terracotta hips, ridges and finials. Both the boiler and engine house have since been clad in terracotta tile. The gable roofs have monitors, which are centrally placed and continue approximately half the length of the roof and are fitted with fixed steel louvres. The roof truss in the engine house is a delicate hand-wrought Warren truss strengthened internally with matchboarding. The exposed rafters are rounded on the ends, and this attention to detail is typical of the quality of carpentry throughout. The internal pilasters, which correspond with the buttresses, hold the overhead crane rail. The overhead crane is a simple undertrussed steel- girder hand-operated crane typical of the early twentieth century. The chimney stack is polychromatic brickwork on a square base which changes to an octoganal shaft some three metres above the ground. It is finished with an ornate cap. The stack is a local landmark. The station is substantially intact and in good condition. The Residence building is in good condition and the fabric is substantially intact.  Heritage listing  SPS 271 displays a high level of architectural sophistication in the execution of Federation Queen Anne and Romanesque styles. It has the highest level of aesthetic significance of pumping stations within the Sydney Water sewerage system and is the most intact example of a pair of stylistically complete Federation industrial buildings. It is technologically unique (one of only three of its type), having the dual function of carrying both sewage and stormwater. It has a high level of industrial archaeological value evidenced by the Blackstone three cylinder diesel pump (steam driven until 1954) which dates from 1920, and an outstanding level of technological significance due to the manner and method in which it functioned within the SWOOS system. It had the unique capability of pumping waste from the sewage wells to either the high-level sewer or the eastern stormwater channel. It is one of the oldest SPSs still functioning, and presently discharges into the SWOOS. Sewage Pumping Station 271 was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999.

It was designed by NSW South Wales Public Works Department and built from 1909 to 1909. It is also known as The Boulevarde Sewer Vent. The property is owned by Sydney Water. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 November 2002.  History  The Northern Branch Main sewer was partly completed by 1901 and was completed before the Western Main Branch. This Branch was a siphon at the low point in Illawarra Road near Sydenham Road. The siphon is maintained by the sewage being diverted temporarily to SPS 271 for flushing purposes. This pumps it to the Eastern Branch Main Sewer. The Dobroyd Submain discharges into this Branch at Lewisham at the point where the Lewisham Vent Shaft is located. This vent was completed in 1909 and is only one of a handful of like shafts in Sydney Water system. Steel straps to the shaft were added in the mid to late twentieth century.  Description  Located some 25 metres north of Hunter Street and fronting the Boulevard is a Queen Anne revival brick and stone fence and timber entrance doors behind which is the brick and stone vent shaft. This shaft is an excellent example of the brick and stonemasons craft built in 1909. The overall height of the vent shaft is approximately 9 storeys with rubbed red and cream glazed brick decoration. The pedestal is octagonal in plan with the shaft emanating at a stone transition to circular in plan with entasis from the base. The bottom of the pedestal is coursed rock faced stone to rusticated stone to 19 courses of English bond brick, upon which is the stone transition course from octagonal to circular. The pedestal extends in a circular brick form of 36 courses in English bond to a stone coursed base of the shaft, the brick shaft being surmounted by a stone course with brick cap. It is possible there was a decorative cowl however there is no evidence of that now. Directly around the base is a reconstructed federation period domestic dwelling (using the base as part of their land use). Across the road in The Boulevard is a public school and the remaining houses surrounding the vent shaft are generally detached late Victorian and Federation period dwellings. The vent shaft is particularly noticeable on the vista from Wardell Street. The pediment above the entrance reads MBW-S&S; 1909. The entrance doors are in timber and likely to be original although the panels may be later. The structure is substantially intact and in good condition apart from the need for repointing in strategic places particularly of the fence and in areas of the shaft. Three steel bands are fitted to the upper portion of the shaft to assist in stabilising the fabric. The fence in its design and scale sits well with the adjoining streetscape.  Heritage listing  The strategic use of polychrome brick work and moulded brick details along with a considerably intact entrance fence and shaft make this structure arguably the most elaborate one of its type left in the Sydney Water system, or in NSW. The quality of workmanship and detailing is unlikely to be seen again in this type of structure. The shaft is a landmark in the area which can be seen as far as surrounding ridge tops. Lewisham Sewer Vent was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 November 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The vent shaft is an important historical element in the operation of the northern branch main and Dobroyd submain. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The sewer vent is a landmark and highly visible and well detailed element of the townscape. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The vent shaft is likely to be held in high regard by the local community as a landmark structure in the locality, and has been recognised by the National Trust of Australia (NSW). The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The vent shaft exhibits qualities of craftmanship which is highly detailed and well executed, the likes of which is difficult to consider will ever be repeated again. The vent performs an essential function in the proper operation of the sewer system. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. As part of a small collective number of like Sydney Water Vent shafts, and in the quality they have been undertaken, they are a Statewide significant piece of infrastructure. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. In terms of venting function solely, it is representative of like items in the systems.

The American electrical grid is going through one of the largest changes in its history, which is the move to smart grid technology. The smart grid allows energy customers and energy providers to more efficiently manage and generate electricity. Similar to other new technologies, the smart grid also introduces new concerns about security. Utility owners and operators (whether investor- owned, municipal, or cooperative) typically are responsible for implementing system improvements with regards to cybersecurity. Executives in the utilities industry are beginning to recognize the business impact of cybersecurity.Electric Grid Security and Resilience: Establishing a Baseline for Adversarial Threats. June 2016. ICF International. Page 2. The electric utility industry in the U.S. leads a number of initiatives to help protect the national electric grid from threats. The industry partners with the federal government, particularly the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Electric grids can be targets of military or terrorist activity. When American military leaders created their first air war plan against the Axis in 1941, Germany's electric grid was at the top of the target list.  Issue overview  The North American electrical power grid is a highly connected system. The ongoing modernization of the grid is generally referred to as the \\"smart grid\\". Reliability and efficiency are two key drivers of the development of the smart grid. Another example is the ability for the electrical system to incorporate renewable energy sources such as wind power and geothermal power. One of the key issues for electric grid security is that these ongoing improvements and modernizations have created more risk to the system. As an example, one risk specifically comes from the integration of digital communications and computer infrastructure with the existing physical infrastructure of the power grid. According to the academic journal IEEE Security & Privacy Magazine, \\"The smart grid . . . uses intelligent transmission and distribution networks to deliver electricity. This approach aims to improve the electric system's reliability, security, and efficiency through two-way communication of consumption data and dynamic optimization of electric-system operations, maintenance, and planning.\\"  Government oversight  In the U.S., the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is in charge of the cybersecurity standards for the bulk power system. The system includes systems necessary for operating the interconnected grid. Investor- owned utilities operate under a different authority, state public utility commissions. This falls outside of FERC's jurisdiction.  Cybersecurity  In 2016, members of the Russian hacker organization \\"Grizzly Steppe\\" infiltrated the computer system of a Vermont utility company, Burlington Electric, exposing the vulnerability of the nation's electric grid to attacks. The hackers did not disrupt the state's electric grid, however. Burlington Electric discovered malware code in a computer system that was not connected to the grid. As of 2018, two evolutions are taking place in the power economic sector. These evolutions could make it harder for utilities to defend from a cyber threat. First, hackers have become more sophisticated in their attempts to disrupt electric grids. \\"Attacks are more targeted, including spear phishing efforts aimed at individuals, and are shifting from corporate networks to include industrial control systems.\\" Second, the grid is becoming more and more distributed and connected. The growing \\"Internet of Things\\" world could make it so that every device could be a potential vulnerability.  Terrorist attack risk  As of 2006, over 200,000 miles of transmission lines that are 230 kV or higher existed in the United States. The main problem is that it is impossible to secure the whole system from terrorist attacks. The scenario of such a terrorist attack, however, would be minimal because it would only disrupt a small portion of the overall grid. For example, an attack that destroys a regional transmission tower would only have a temporary impact. The modern-day electric grid system is capable of restoring equipment that is damaged by natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes, ice storms, and earthquakes in a generally short period of time. This is due to the resiliency of the national grid to such events. \\"It would be difficult for even a well-organized large group of terrorists to cause the physical damage of a small- to moderate-scale tornado.\\"  Potential solutions  Today the utility industry is advancing cybersecurity with a series of initiatives. They are partnering with federal agencies. The goal is to improve sector-wide resilience to both physical and cyber threats. The industry is also working with National Institute of Standards and Technology, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies. In 2017, electric companies spent $57.2 billion on grid security. In September 2018, Brien Sheahan, chairman and CEO of the Illinois Commerce Commission and a member of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Nuclear Energy Advisory Committee, and Robert Powelson, a former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) commissioner, wrote in a published piece in Utility Dive that cyberthreats to the national power system require stronger national standards and more collaboration between levels of government. Recent to their article, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security confirmed that Russian hackers targeted the control room's of American public utilities. The electric distribution system has become more and more networked together and interconnected. Critical public services depend on the system: water delivery, financial institutions, hospitals, and public safety. To prevent disruption to the network, Sheahan and Powelson recommended national standards and collaboration between federal and state energy regulators. Some utility companies have cybersecurity-specific practices or teams. Baltimore Gas and Electric conducts regular drills with its employees. It also shares cyber- threat related information with industry and government partners. Duke Energy put together a corporate incident response team that is devoted to cybersecurity 24 hours a day. The unit works closely with government emergency management and law enforcement. Some states have cybersecurity procedures and practices: * New Jersey: Utilities are required to put together comprehensive cybersecurity plans. * Pennsylvania: Utilities must keep physical and cybersecurity, emergency response and business continuity plans. They also have to report severe cyberattacks. * Texas: The state's public utility commission conducts annual security audits. In December 2018, U.S. Senators Cory Gardner and Michael Bennet introduced legislation intended to improve grid security nation-wide. The bills would create a $90 million fund that would be distributed to states to develop energy security plans. The legislation would also require the U.S. Energy Department to identify any vulnerabilities to cyberattacks in the nation’s electrical power grid. In March 2019, Donald Trump issued an executive order that directed federal agencies to prepare for attacks involving an electromagnetic pulse. In May 2020, he issued an executive order that bans the use of grid equipment manufactured by a foreign adversary.  Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council  The Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council (ESCC) is the main liaison organization between the federal government and the electric power industry. Its mission is to coordinate efforts to prepare for, and respond to, national-level disasters or threats to critical infrastructure. The ESCC is composed of electric company CEOs and trade association leaders from all segments of the industry. Its federal government counterparts include senior administration officials from the White House, relevant cabinet agencies, federal law enforcement, and national security organizations.

The grammatical structure is simplified German but is also influenced by the structure of other component languages, for example Turkish one of the input languages. Emerging in the 1960s, Gastarbeiterdeutsch was mainly spoken by the first generation of foreign workers from Southern Europe and North Africa, and later Turkey, who immigrated to Germany. They were called ‘Gastarbeiter’ (guest workers ). Guest workers were to be a transitory workforce with short-term working agreements to meet the demand of the growing German economy. The integration of foreign workers was not planned. Following changes in immigration policies in the 1990s and in 2000, Germany now recognizes immigrants, including guest workers, as permanent residents and allows dual citizenship. Similarly to other pidgins, Gastarbeiterdeutsch is stigmatized and is connected to the stereotyping of immigrants. Gastarbeiterdeutsch is a workforce pidgin used by newcomers to communicate with their employers and German workers. Gastarbeiterdeutsch shows the typical attributes of a pidgin: the superstrate language is German, it lacks complexity, the grammatical structure is simplified, and morphological inflection is reduced while regularity is increased. Here is an example of Gastarbeiterdeutsch disregarding the variety of sentence structure common in German simplifying it to SVO. In the following sentence the speaker applies the SVO (subject/verb/object) structure, instead of the correct SOV (subject/object/verb) structure, and the article in front of the noun is missing. Gastarbeiterdeutsch: ‘Wenn Sie (subject) [missing article] brauchen (verb) Werkzeug (object), dann…’. German: ‘Wenn Sie (subject) ein Werkzeug(object) brauchen(verb), dann…’. English: ‘If you need [a] tool, then …’. The use of Gastarbeiterdeutsch is limited to the first generation of immigrants as subsequent generations of immigrants attended the German public school systems, grew up bilingual, and learned their parent's mother tongue(s) as well as German. They are therefore usually fluent in German.  Türkendeutsch  Türkendeutsch is an alteration of the superstrate German language where Turkish sounds and lexical features are mixed into the grammatical structure of German. Some Turks belonging to the second or third generation of ‘Gastarbeiter’ continue to deliberately mix Turkish and German. Here an example: ’Thomas I simdi bi vergessen et fuer ne zeitlang‘ = The sentence structure is German, in this case SVO, but the lexicon is mixed; the words in italic belong to the Turkish lexicon while the words in non-italic belong to the German lexicon. In English: ’Well, just forget Thomas for a while’. This mixed language is only used in private settings to express the speaker's connection to both cultures.

Konashenkov also stated that data gleaned from the S-400 air defense system and the position of all the aircraft at the moment of the September 17 incident, proved that an Israeli jet was using the larger Il-20 as a cover. Aftermath On 24 September 2018, defense minister Sergei Shoigu said that within two weeks, the Syrian army would receive S-300 air-defense missile systems to strengthen Syria's combat air defence capabilities. He added that the previous cancellation of the contract for S-300 delivery in 2013 had been due to Israel's request but following the downing of a Russian Ilyushin Il-20 aircraft in Syria the situation had changed.Гутенев: реакция Израиля на инцидент с Ил-20 вынудила РФ на поставки С-300 в Сирию: Председатель комиссии Госдумы по правовому обеспечению развития ОПК отметил, что теперь израильские летчики не смогут прятаться за российскими самолетами TASS, 24 September 2018.Россия передаст Сирии С-300 в течение двух недель Kommersant, 24 September 2018. The S-300 would have modern IFF systems, which will prevent the missiles from targeting Russian aircraft. He also announced a few other military measures Russia would undertake to protect Russian service members in Syria. Russian president Vladimir Putin informed Syrian president Bashar Assad of the planned delivery in a telephone conversation the same day.Путин обсудил с Асадом поставки российских комплексов С-300 в Сирию: В Кремле отметили, что президент сообщил сирийскому лидеру о дополнительных мерах по обеспечению безопасности военных РФ в республике TASS, 24 September 2018.

It first saw action in January 1942, taking part in the offensive northwest of Moscow which carved out the salient around Toropets deep in the rear of Army Group Center. The division remained on this general sector of the front, nearly the whole time in 4th Shock Army, until March 1944, when it was withdrawn for rebuilding. It was then assigned to 21st Army north of Leningrad where it participated in the offensive that drove Finland out of the war from June into August, and remained on this front until December. It was then reassigned to the 39th Army, under which it fought in East Prussia until April 1945. During that month the entire 39th Army began moving to the Far East, where it took part in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in August, where the 358th won its second battle honor, capping a distinguished record of service. Formation The division began forming in August 1941 in the Volga Military DistrictWalter S. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2006, p. 79 at Buguruslan. Its order of battle was as follows: * 1187th Rifle Regiment * 1189th Rifle Regiment * 1191st Rifle Regiment * 919th Artillery Regiment * 484th Sapper Battalion * 422nd Reconnaissance Company * 377th Signal Company The 219th Antitank Battalion would be added in early 1942.Charles C. Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From June to December 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. IX, Nafziger, 1996, p. 92 Col. Zakhar Nikitovich Usachyov was assigned to command of the division on September 9, and he continued in command until June 8, 1942, being promoted to major general on May 21.http://www.generals.dk states he held command until June 8, 1943, but this is contradicted by Commanders of Corps and Divisions in the Great Patriotic War, 19411945, the official Soviet source. After a couple of months in the Volga District the division was moved north to the Moscow area, where it was assigned to the 60th (Reserve) Army which was forming there. In late December the 358th, in common with two other rifle divisions of this Army, was transferred to the newly-formed 4th Shock Army (re-designated from 27th Army), while the headquarters became the basis of the 3rd Shock Army, both in Northwestern Front. At the start of the offensive on Toropets in January 1942, the division had 10,000 men on strength, making it nearly full-strength for this period of the war.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 92 =Toropets-Kholm Offensive= On December 18 the STAVKA of the Supreme High Command issued its Order No. 005868 to the command of Northwestern Front, spelling out the goals and objectives of this operation: In the event the operation would not begin until January 9, 1942, due to the poor road and rail network. 4th Shock, commanded by Col. Gen. Andrey Yeryomenko, deployed on a front 50 km wide, facing most of the 253rd Infantry Division; with just 10,000 men the German \\"line\\" was in fact a string of outposts, although well-fortified since the Germans had occupied this sector since October. The Army also had 790 guns of 76mm caliber or greater for support. At the outset the 358th was in second echelon with the 332nd and 334th Rifle Divisions and 21st Rifle Brigade.http://militera.lib.ru/h/isaev_av4/04.html (in Russian) Note the 358th is referred to in error as the \\"258th\\" at one point in this document. 4th Shock was to initially advance towards Andreapol. Following a 90-minute artillery preparation the leading divisions broke through the thin German defenses and advanced as much as 15 km. During the coming week the first echelon divisions surrounded and destroyed a reinforced battalion of the newly-arrived 189th Regiment of 81st Infantry Division and liberated Andreapol, seizing needed supplies. While they continued to advance on Toropets, the second echelon was directed southwestward to maintain contact with 22nd Army of Kalinin Front. Toropets was taken on January 21 with an even larger hoard of much-needed supplies, while the 358th and other second echelon units pushed on towards Velizh, cutting the rail line from Rzhev to Velikiye Luki the same day. On January 22, 4th and 3rd Shock Armies were transferred to Kalinin Front.http://militera.lib.ru/h/isaev_av4/04.html (in Russian) During the rest of January and into February the division took part in several attempts to break into and liberate Velizh, but these were stymied on its outskirts.http://militera.lib.ru/h/isaev_av4/04.html (in Russian) Finally, 4th Shock Army took up defensive lines, where it remained into the summer of 1943. General Usachyov was moved to command of the 262nd Rifle Division, and was replaced by Lt. Col. Semyon Aleksandrovich Vrublevsky on June 9. He held the post until February 9, 1943, when he was replaced by Col. Nikifor Yegorovich Lubyagin. Battles for Vitebsk On August 31, S. A. Vrublevsky returned to command of the 358th with the rank of colonel. As of October 1 the division was in 92nd Rifle Corps, on the south flank of 4th Shock Army. During the month it was transferred, with its Corps, to 43rd Army, as 4th Shock became more involved in the fighting around Nevel. On October 15, 92nd Corps struck the boundary of the German 87th and 14th Infantry Divisions in the Surazh and Ianovichi sectors with its 358th and 332nd Rifle Divisions, 145th Rifle Brigade, and 105th Separate Tank Regiment, but the assault made little progress.David M. Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2016, pp. 26, 44, 47, 55-56 A further attack by 43rd Army on December 23 penetrated the German defenses to within 2 km south of the road from Surazh to Vitebsk. The next day the 358th and 334th Rifle Divisions together succeeded in \\"biting a chunk\\" out of the defenses of 14th Infantry Division further northwest along the same road. Along with the pressure being applied by 4th Shock Army in the Gorodok area, this success forced the 3rd Panzer Army to pull its LIII Army Corps, fighting northwest of Vitebsk, back into new defenses even closer to the city. During the latter half of January 1944, the 358th was transferred back to 4th Shock Army, this time in 91st Rifle Corps, but remained in second echelon assembly areas in the Army's rear over the coming months.Glantz, Belorussia, pp. 296-97, 334-35 Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive After about six weeks in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command for rest and replenishment, the 358th was assigned to the 21st Army, which was moved at the end of April to the Karelian Isthmus, north of Leningrad, in anticipation of a final showdown with Finland. At the end of May, the division's strength was recorded as follows: 811 officers; 2,012 NCOs; 4,139 enlisted men; for a total of 6,962 personnel, including 134 sick or wounded in the divisional medical units. For equipment and transport it had: 98 trucks; 707 horses; 2,725 rifles; 2,402 sub-machine guns; 241 light machine guns; 81 heavy machine guns; 54 50mm mortars; 54 82mm mortars; 18 120mm mortars; 36 45mm antitank guns; and 211 antitank rifles. In addition, it had 44 76mm guns. The 76mm infantry guns in the rifle regiments had been replaced by ZiS-3 guns, and these also equipped the antitank battalion (12 guns), with 20 more in the artillery regiment, along with the standard 12 122mm howitzers.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", pp. 92-93 In 21st Army the division was assigned to the 97th Rifle Corps, along with the 178th and 381st Rifle Divisions.Glantz, The Battle for Leningrad 1941-1944, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2002, p. 420 In the plan for the offensive, 97th Corps was deployed on the right flank of its Army,Multi-Man Publishing, Inc., Karelia '44, Millersville, MD, 2011, p. 4 and would be handed off to 23rd Army after the crossing of the Sestra River. The 358th and 381st were in the Corps first echelon, on a front of 9.5 km.Glantz, Leningrad, pp. 421, 426. Note on the latter page the division is mis-numbered as the 385th. On the evening of June 9 the first echelon rifle corps of 21st Army fired a 15-minute artillery preparation, followed by a reconnaissance-in-force to assess the damage. The offensive proper began at 0820 hrs. on June 10, following a 140-minute artillery onslaught. 97th Corps attacked towards Kallelovo and penetrated the forward Finnish defenses, but only advanced 5 km, reaching the south bank of the Sestra by the end of the day. Meanwhile, the Finns were ordered to pull back to their second line. For the next day, the Corps was ordered to continue the advance on Kallelovo, and at 1500 hrs. the handover to 23rd Army took place. By day's end the 97th and 98th Rifle Corps reached the Termolovo- Khirelia line. On June 12, 97th Corps enveloped Termolovo from the west to northeast, but the pace of the advance was slowing, and it became clear that a regrouping would be necessary before tackling that second line. The 358th was withdrawn to the Front reserve for a brief rest and refitting.Glantz, Leningrad, pp. 427-32 On June 17, Colonel Vrublevsky left his command of the division, being replaced by Col. Pavel Filippovich Zaretsky four days later. Zaretsky had been deputy commander of the 53rd Guards Rifle Division until being wounded and hospitalized in February. Apart from a short break in early 1945, he would remain in command for the duration of the war, being promoted to the rank of major general on May 5, 1945. Between June 14–17 the two Soviet armies penetrated the second Finnish defense line and were in pursuit towards the third. The high command still considered that progress was too slow, and orders emanated from Moscow exhorting them on to Vyborg. To this end, the rested 97th Corps was again subordinated to 21st Army on the morning of the 18th and, supported by the 1st and 152nd Tank Brigades, prepared to take the lead in breaking the third line. The Corps was to penetrate between Summa and Markki at the boundary of the Finnish 4th Infantry Division and 3rd Infantry Brigade, advance along the Summa-Vyborg road to Khumola, and capture a railroad junction south of the city. 72nd Rifle Division would cover the Corps' left flank while, farther left, the 110th Rifle Corps would also attack near Summa.Glantz, Leningrad, pp. 439-40 The assault, backed by massive artillery support, began early on June 19 and gained almost immediate success. Overall, the forces of 21st Army ripped a 70 km-wide gap in the Finnish defenses from Muola to the Gulf of Finland, and advanced as much as 14 km during 18 hours of bitter fighting against determined but confused resistance. 97th Corps drove north on the Vyborg road, smashing the Finnish IV Army Corps in the process; at the end of the day 152nd Tank Brigade was attacking Autiokorpela. The plan for the next day called for 97th Corps to advance along the rail line and then envelop Vyborg's defenses from the northeast. When the advance began in the morning the Soviets soon learned that the Finns had abandoned the city overnight.Glantz, Leningrad, pp. 440, 442, 444-45 The 358th would subsequently be granted its first battle honor, \\"Leningrad\\", for its part in this victory, as well as a unit award of the Order of the Red Banner. By August the division still had an average of 1,500 men in each rifle regiment, while the rifle companies had about 110 officers and men each, which was a very good front-line strength for that period of the war. After the Finnish armistice the division remained in 21st Army in the Leningrad Front, transferring to 94th Rifle Corps in September; it would remain in this Corps for the duration. At about the same time 21st Army was moved to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command until December, when 94th Corps was reassigned to 39th Army in 3rd Belorussian Front. The 358th would remain in this Army for the duration.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 93 Battles for East Prussia In the plan for the Vistula-Oder Offensive, 39th Army was on the right flank of 3rd Belorussian Front, south of the Neman River. 94th Rifle Corps was in the first echelon with 5th Guards Rifle Corps, facing a breakthrough sector 8 km wide, with the immediate objective of destroying the enemy forces in the Pilkallen area, before advancing westward and capturing Tilsit by the end of the fifth day. The offensive began on January 12, 1945, and made immediate progress. However, on the 14th the Germans launched heavy counterattacks along the front while the Soviet advance ran into deeply echeloned defenses. 39th Army beat off as many as 15 such attacks by up to a battalion in strength, backed by 8-16 tanks apiece. The 124th Rifle Division was committed into battle from behind the 358th's right flank, broke into Pilkallen and seized the railroad station, the only significant advance of the day.Soviet General Staff, Prelude to Berlin, trans. & ed. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2016, pp. 122-23, 192 The division was ordered to speed up its attack on the morning of January 18, in the general direction of Raudonatchen. By this time it was clear that 39th Army was making the best progress among the armies of the Front, and the 1st Tank Corps was moved in to exploit. In its wake, the 94th Corps reached the line of the Inster River near Raudonatchen, advancing as much as 20 km. This advance prepared the way for elements of 43rd Army to break into Tilsit in the afternoon of January 19, while the 94th Corps advanced to the Tilsit-Insterburg railroad. On January 22 the division was on the march and took the town of Kukers, while 39th Army overall reached the Curonian Lagoon along the line of the Deime River, splitting the German defense. After hard fighting over the next day this river line was forced, and the way was open to Königsberg.Prelude to Berlin, pp. 196-97, 218, 224-26 The right-flank armies of 3rd Belorussian Front were tasked with capturing the city, and on January 27 they had reached its outskirts. 94th Corps, in the Schoenwalde area, was counterattacked twice, with heavy artillery support. Despite this, it broke through the fortified defenses north of the Alter Pregel River, took the strongpoints of Gamsau and Praddau, and on the following day reached the fortifications of the city itself, becoming involved in stubborn fighting. And here the sector remained static until early April. When the final assault began on April 6 the 94th Corps had two divisions in the first echelon and one in the second, plus considerable reinforcements. By the end of the day 39th Army advanced up to 4 km, despite counterattacks by 5th Panzer Division from the west. During the next day the Army was counterattacked 18 times, slowing its advance. By the end of April 9 the German garrison capitulated, while 39th Army was regrouping for subsequent operations into the western part of the Samland Peninsula.Prelude to Berlin, pp. 230, 232, 254-55, 262-65 Colonel Zaretsky distinguished himself on several occasions during the East Prussian campaign. On January 13 he led his troops from the front while attempting to break the enemy defenses south of Pilkallen. During a river-crossing operation he entered the small bridgehead as an inspiration to his men. During the fighting in the Samland Peninsula a German counterattack by infantry and tank-destroyers of the Marder type broke through to the division's command post. Zaretsky organized the defense, then took up an anti-tank rifle with which he knocked out one of the enemy vehicles. During further fighting in mid-February, during the siege of Königsberg, another German counterattack hit the division's defenses, and Zaretsky was again in a close quarters fight. He was wounded by grenade fragments in his back, but refused to evacuate to the base hospital and remained in command of the division.This is the account from http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=6480. Commanders of Corps and Divisions in the Great Patriotic War, 1941–1945 states that Zaretskii was replaced by Col. Aleksandr Emilianovich Kletz from February 24 to April 2, and then returned to command. Zaretsky also led one of his division's storm groups during the final battle for Königsberg in April. In recognition of his actions, he was awarded the Gold Star of a Hero of the Soviet Union on April 19 (medal no. 6177).http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=6480 Manchurian Operation and Postwar 39th Army was chosen for the invasion of Japanese-held Manchuria in large part due to its experience in East Prussia; the Japanese frontier was known to be heavily fortified. It began shipping eastwards not long after the German capitulation, and by July 1 it was in the Transbaikal Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1945, p. 189 In the plan for the offensive, the 39th was on the Front's left flank, and was facing the Greater Khingan mountains. The operation began on August 9, and after passing the mountains at Tarchu, the 358th turned due south to link up with the 124th Rifle Division which was engaged with the Japanese forces defending the Halung-Arshaan fortified area. By August 16 the division was participating in the reduction of the last enemy positions in this area. The offensive ended with the Japanese capitulation on August 20.Glantz, August Storm, the Soviet Strategic Offensive in Manchuria, Kindle edition The division was awarded its second battle honor for this offensive. The 358th ended the war with the complete title of 358th Rifle, Leningrad-Khingan, Order of the Red Banner, Order of Suvorov Division (Russian: 358-я стрелковая Ленинградско-Хинганская Краснознамённая ордена Суворова дивизия).

After growing up in his father George Meade's shipping business, he became successful in his own right in the American–Spanish trade. Meade lived in Cadiz, Spain, from 1803 to 1820, and was the U.S. naval agent there. He became quite wealthy and was one of the first American collectors of European art. Sometimes controversially outspoken, he lost favor and was imprisoned by political enemies after the Spanish government incurred large debts to him during the Peninsular War. Upon returning to Philadelphia he donated much of his art and became a trustee of St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church, where he participated in the Hogan schism. Under the Adams–Onís Treaty he unsuccessfully sought compensation from the U.S. government for the nearly $400,000 Spanish debt. The Meade claim became known for its longevity as his descendants continued to pursue it long after his death. Early life Miniature by French artist Jean-Baptiste Isabey, 1795 Meade was born on June 23, 1778, in Chester County, Pennsylvania, during the British occupation of Philadelphia.Campbell, History of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick, p. 119. He was the fourth son of George Meade, a Philadelphia merchant, and Henrietta Constantia Meade, the daughter of Barbados planter Richard Worsam. He grew up in the city attending private schools before entering his father's foreign trading company. In 1794 he served in the force that suppressed the Whiskey Rebellion.Bache, Life of General George Gordon Meade, pp. 1–2; Atzbach, Portraits in Conversation, at 49m50s. As supercargo on board his father's ships he traveled to the West Indies, and in 1795 to Europe, returning the next year after touring England and France.Frederick, \\"Meade, Richard Worsam\\". Meade then went into business on HispaniolaFrederick has \\"the island of Santo Domingo\\". for three years, returning to Philadelphia a wealthy man. While operating his own business he administered his now- bankrupt father's affairs. By 1802 Meade's home was in a fashionable neighborhood on High Street, depicted in Birch's Views of Philadelphia.De Cunzo, \\"An Historical Interpretation\\", p. 132. His voyage to Spain the next year to collect claims other merchants had against the Spanish government, which Meade estimated to be close to US$1 million (equivalent to $ million in ), was unsuccessful.Atzbach, Portraits in Conversation, at 39m37s. However, he decided to move his business to the port of Cadiz—center of Spain's trans- Atlantic trade—where his family relocated in 1804. Merchant in Cadiz At Cadiz the business prospered, with him being among the first to export merino sheep and sherry to the United States.Johnson, \\"Meade, Richard Worsam\\". Meade was additionally appointed the U.S. naval agent from 1806 to 1816.\\"The Secretary [of the Navy] carried on extensive correspondence with a varying number of such agents, who acted as purchasing agents and performed other services in the principal ports, receiving as compensation a commission on transactions.\\" Cunningham, Process of Government, p. 132. He did feud with U.S. consulate, writing to Secretary of State James Madison to call Vice- Consul Richard Hackley without \\"Capacity or Respectability\\". President Thomas Jefferson, a relative of Hackley's, referred to Meade as \\"lying, malicious and impudent\\". But the matter was happily resolved when James Leander Cathcart became consul and also the ever-wealthier Meade's business partner.Stowe, Philadelphia Gentleman, pp. 43–45; Atzbach, Portraits in Conversation, at 40m16s. During the Siege of Cadiz in the Peninsular War, Meade provided the Spanish monarchy with \\"supplies of all kinds\\" against the French invasion; in 1810 his ships brought 250,000 barrels of flour into the city. While Meade spent much of his money the government ran up a large debt. He declined Spanish citizenship as a reward. His attempts to collect on the debt backfired. In 1812 he published a pamphlet accusing Treasurer-General Victor Soret of misappropriation: Scandalous Attempt by the Regency of Spain to Ruin Richard W. Meade. According to his own account Duke Pedro de Alcántara had Meade imprisoned for three months, and in a political move he was fined two thousand ducats (about two thousand U.S. dollars)1 ducat of exchange was equal 1.01492 U.S. dollars, Torres, Exposition of the Commerce of Spanish America, p. 26. for libel.Atzbach, Portraits in Conversation, at 56m10s; Stowe, Philadelphia Gentleman, pp. 47–48. The merchant wrote six different pamphlets while in jail in 1812–1813; one of them was (\\"Pastimes of Richard Meade\\"), a scornful response to the director of military provisions' purchase of a large amount of rotten cheese.Atzbach, Portraits in Conversation, at 57m43s. Along with a series of rhyming insults, Meade calls the director the —the champion of manchego cheese.Atzbach, Portraits in Conversation, at 58m20s. In 1815 he commissioned an expensive full-length portrait by renowned court painter Vicente López y Portaña; this work only became publicly known in 2010 and may be one the artist's most important portraits. Probably paid for with credit against the government, the portrait could have been in anticipation of Cathcart naming him vice-consul,Atzbach, Portraits in Conversation, at 51m10s. which ultimately did not occur.Atzbach, Portraits in Conversation, at 58m43s. Spain's debt to Meade embroiled him in a worsening conflict in 1814. The of Cadiz (a tribunal of commerce) had appointed him to manage the bankrupt estate of James W. Glass, a broker for Hunter, Rainey & Company of London. He had calculated that $52,000 was due to John McDermot, a representative of the firm. In February the ordered him to pay it to the treasury instead of to McDermot, which he did—but after a dispute over the legitimacy of the payment, it ordered him to pay the money a second time. On appeal the Spanish Council of War involved itself, and on a pretext to avoid paying the government's huge debt, caused him to be imprisoned in the Castle of Santa Catalina on May 2, 1816.Stowe, Philadelphia Gentleman, pp. 49–51. He wrote to U.S. minister George W. Erving without success. Finally he called on Philadelphia connections like Congressman John Sergeant, and addressed a memorial (perhaps actually composed by Sergeant)Cleaves, Meade of Gettysburg, p. 5–6; affirmed by Stowe, Philadelphia Gentleman, p. 51. to President James Monroe and Congress.[Sergeant?], The Case of Richard W. Meade. The anti-Spanish faction seized the political opportunity:Stowe, Philadelphia Gentleman, p. 52 Speaker Henry Clay led the House of Representatives in resolving that \\"the imprisonment of Richard W. Meade is an act of cruel and unjustifiable oppression\\",Representative John Trimble offered a stronger proposal, to authorize the retaliatory imprisonment of a Spanish consul. Annals of Congress 32, 1699–1713. and was joined by the Senate. With Spanish–U.S. tensions running high, the king ordered him released on June 26, 1818. The Meade family had already returned to Philadelphia, while Richard moved to Madrid to collect his money.Cleaves, Meade of Gettysburg, p. 5–7. He notes that Clay imported merino sheep on Meade's ships.  Unpaid claim In 1820 a Spanish tribunal agreed that he was owed $491,153.62: for Peninsular War debt $298,879.88, for wrongful imprisonment $75,000, and $117,273.45 as agent for others.U.S. Court of Claims, Reports, p. 225; Frederick. However, the Adams–Onís Treaty, signed in 1819, would transfer all American claims against Spain to the U.S. government if it were ratified. Thus Meade returned to the United States in the late spring of 1820, moving from Philadelphia to Washington. He clandestinely lobbied the Senate and the President to make ratification dependent on payment of his claim. This earned him the ire of its negotiator John Quincy Adams: \\"There was malice and treachery in the transaction, as well as intrigue and cupidity.\\"Adams, Memoirs V, p. 272.Cleave, Meade of Gettysburg, p. 8. The treaty was ratified regardless, and Meade filed a claim for $373,879.88 with the U.S. commission set up to hear the Spanish claims.Apparently excluding the amount due to others. His claim was denied in 1822 because he had presented only the certificate of debt from the Spanish tribunal, not the original evidence of his losses (now in possession of the Spanish government). Before he could obtain the documents, the commission disbanded on June 8, 1824, dismissing Meade's case without hearing the merits. Meade spent the rest of his life lobbying the government for payment, employing such famous attorneys as Daniel Webster, Henry Clay and Rufus Choate. In 1827 a petition in his favor signed by 1100 people was submitted to Congress. The political situation however was against him: John Quincy Adams rose to the presidency in 1824 while the Meades had supported Clay, and their sympathy in Congress quickly waned.Stowe, Philadelphia Gentleman, pp. 57–58. After Meade's death in 1828 the cause was taken up by his widow, then his son Richard, then his daughter Margaret, as the claim became famous for its longevity. They petitioned every session of Congress until in 1856 it passed a joint resolution referring the matter to the newly created Court of Claims. The Court of Claims ruled that it was bound by the decision of the commission and the Spanish ruling was outside its jurisdiction;U.S. Court of Claims, Reports. The case spans 818 pages. Congress sent the case back to the Court of Claims in 1863 with the same result. The second decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court in 1870, which held that \\"an appeal to the equity of Congress\\" was the Meade heirs' only remedy. They continued to petition Congress into the 20th century.See e.g. Hackett, The Meade Claim—a concise overview in favor of a relief bill. Art collection Meade's gift to the U.S. legation: a copy of the Lansdowne portrait. Meade used his merchant wealth to purchase paintings and statues, becoming one of the first American collectors of European art. Sometimes accepting paintings to satisfy debts, he acquired works by Titian, Correggio, Veronese, Rubens, Van Dyck, Velázquez and Murillo. While in prison, Meade had sent much of his artwork to the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. This included a copy by Mariano Salvador Maella of a contemporary portrait of Christopher Columbus, now lost. Another of the important canvases was Murillo's Roman Charity. The collection arrived in April 1818 and was installed in the Academy's southwest gallery, which came to be called the Meade Gallery. A fire in 1845 destroyed the original building as well as Roman Charity.Atzbach, Portraits in Conversation, at 1h03m00s. To thank the government for negotiating his release, Meade gifted the U.S. legation in Madrid a copy of the Lansdowne portrait of George Washington. Inscribed with his name and the date December 11, 1818, it hung at the embassy until 1951. Congressman James G. Fulton of Pennsylvania saw the painting while lecturing in Spain and had it transported to America to be placed in the U.S. Capitol's Statuary Hall. Since 1962 it has hung in the Rayburn Room. The Meade family art collection was dispersed when they sold it at auction in 1853.Stowe, Philadelphia Gentleman, p. 60. Hogan schism After returning from Spain, Meade became a trustee of St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church just as its priest William Hogan was in a dispute with Bishop Henry Conwell. The trustees defied the bishop by keeping Hogan, who was excommunicated, as their priest. Meade believed that in a republic, where the people are sovereign, the trustees of a parish should have the right to appoint priests—in the same way that the Pope had granted European monarchs this right.Warren, \\"Displaced 'Pan-Americans, pp. 351–352. A pamphlet defending the trustees was published by exiled priest John Rico, whom Meade had helped escape from Spain to the United States.Warren, \\"Displaced 'Pan-Americans, p. 352. Meade became close friends with another parishioner, diplomat Manuel Torres, through whom he met the radical priest Servando Teresa de Mier. Mier quickly joined the St. Mary's controversy, while Torres tried to help Meade out with his financial problems.Bowman, \\"Manuel Torres in Philadelphia\\", p. 20. When Torres died in 1822, the funeral procession left from Meade's house, and with William Duane he was the executor of Torres' estate.Bowman, \\"Manuel Torres, a Spanish American Patriot\\", p. 53, \\"Correspondence of Duane\\", p. 111. Personal life Meade married Margaret Coates Butler in 1801. She was the daughter of Anthony Butler, a merchant of Perth Amboy, New Jersey, and Elizabeth Coates (or Coats) of Philadelphia.Stowe, Philadelphia Gentleman, p. 42. Margaret was Episcopalian though Richard was Roman Catholic, a pattern repeated in several generations of the Meade family.Meade, \\"George Meade,\\" p. 208 He was the only son to pass on the Meade family name;Meade, \\"George Meade,\\" p. 219. he and Margaret had 11 children, most of them born in Cadiz: # Henrietta Constantia (1801–1831), who married U.S. Navy officer Alexander J.

The \\"Gordon\\" middle name was in honor of James Gordon, a Scottish merchant in Spain; his daughter Catherine Gordon Prendergast was George's godmother.Stowe, Philadelphia Gentleman, p. 48. Meade was on the board of examiners of the America Classical and Military Lyceum, a Mount Airy school which George attended for two years.Stowe, Philadelphia Gentleman, p. 62. The family's diminished finances due to the failed claim may be the reason that the younger Richard and George sought a free education as military officers.Bache, Life of General George Gordon Meade, pp. 8–9. Meade died in the Washington suburb of Georgetown on June 25, 1828, at the relatively young age of 50. In his will he left everything to his widow Margaret, including properties valued at $68,251.99 when the estate was settled in 1832. He was buried in the Meade family vault at St. Mary's Church.Maitland, \\"St. Mary's Graveyard\\", p. 258. Notes Bibliography      15th Cong., 1st Sess. * 36th Cong., 1st Sess., Rep.

She was in commission in the United States Bureau of Fisheries from 1917 to 1940 and in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as US FWS Auklet from 1940 to 1950.  Construction  In 1916, the United States Congress appropriated $10,000 to the United States Bureau of Fisheries (BOF) for the construction of two fishery patrol vessels for service in the waters of Southeast Alaska.AFSC Historical Corner: Auklet and Murre, 1917 Sister Patrol Vessels Retrieved September 17, 2018 Martin C. Erismann designed the vessels as identical sister ships and patterned them after the highly seaworthy design of salmon purse seiners. Built out of Douglas fir, they had a raised deck forward of the pilot house that dropped moving aft, a raised deck house amidships which had an overhanging roof that covered the deck, and a small afterdeck at the stern. The sides extended upward to create the walls of the after cabin. Each boat had a Frisco-Standard gasoline engine and comfortable accommodations for two fishery agents and a crew of three. Construction bids for the two vessels opened in Seattle, Washington, on 5 December 1916 and the project attracted seven bids. Ultimately, the BOF signed a contract to build the vessels with the Elliott Bay Yacht and Engine Company of Seattle. Construction began immediately. After the two boats were completed and inspected, the BOF accepted both boats, USFS Auklet and , on 10 May 1917. The total cost of designing, building, and inspecting the two boats came to US$9,702.70. They were the first vessels ever constructed for fisheries enforcement duties in Alaska. afsc.noaa.gov AFSC Historical Corner - Timeline of Significant Events Operational history USFS Auklet and , from Pacific Motor Boat, June 1917.The BOF commissioned both Auklet and Murre in the summer of 1917. On 4 July 1917, a dedication ceremony took place in Seattle to mark the opening of the Government Locks, which connected Puget Sound with the Lake Washington Ship Canal and Lake Washington, and Auklet was part of a flotilla of hundreds of boats that followed the BOF steamer as she became the first large ocean-going vessel to enter the canal.afsc.noaa.gov AFSC Historical Corner: Roosevelt, Bureau's First Pribilof Tender Retrieved September 15, 2018 Auklet and Murre departed Seattle on 7 July 1917 bound for Wrangell, Territory of Alaska. After they arrived, they took up their patrol duties in the waters of Southeast Alaska. On 12 September 1918, Auklet suffered substantial damage to her deckhouse while moored at Juneau in the Territory of Alaska when the Canadian passenger liner struck her. On 25 October 1918, Princess Sophia sank with the loss of all 343 people on board after grounding on Vanderbilt Reef in Lynn Canal near Juneau; it was the worst maritime disaster in the combined history of Alaska and British Columbia. Auklet joined Murre and the BOF fishery patrol vessel in a fruitless search for survivors that lasted into November 1918. In addition to performing their primary duty of fishery patrols in the waters of Southeast Alaska, however, Auklet and Murre often engaged in other activities. They assisted the United States Department of War in inspecting active and abandoned fish traps as possible navigational obstructions, and took part in routine stream improvements, which involved the removal of impediments to salmon – such as log jams and beaver dams – as they ascended to their spawning grounds. Auklet also provided transportation to BOF personnel and hauled supplies to settlements and BOF stations in Southeast Alaska, and during a steamship strike in 1920 she transported foodstuffs from Prince Rupert, British Columbia, Canada, to merchants in Wrangell and Ketchikan, Alaska. After Murre struck a rock in Alaska's Keku Strait on 1 April 1920 and was beached to prevent her from sinking, Auklet arrived on the scene and towed Murre to Wrangell for repairs. In September 1920, Auklet and Murre conducted stream-marking, and in 1921 they began a program of annual springtime patrolling of sealing grounds near Sitka, Territory of Alaska, during fur seal migrations. In 1921 Auklet made a voyage to Seattle for repairs and overhauling with USFS Osprey in tow; Osprey was to be sold at public auction after arriving in Seattle. On her return voyage to the Territory of Alaska she towed the newly acquired BOF patrol vessel . By 1922, both Auklet and Murre had had their original engines replaced with heavier, Frisco-Standard gasoline engines that gave them additional power they needed to deal with the high winds and seas they frequently encountered in the waters of the Territory of Alaska. In February 1928, both boats had water heating systems installed at Juneau, and later in 1928 each boat had her galley enlarged to increase the comfort of crew and passengers. In 1934, Auklet took part in a Civil Works Administration project to clear log jams and other obstructions in salmon streams that were blocking the fish from reaching their spawning grounds. In 1936, she participated in the construction of a concrete fish ladder at the rapids of the Pavlof Harbor headwaters on Chichagof Island in the Alexander Archipelago of the Alaska Panhandle. In 1939, the Bureau of Fisheries was transferred from the United States Department of Commerce to the United States Department of the Interior, and on 30 June 1940, it merged with the Interior Department's Division of Biological Survey to form the new Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) as an element of the Interior Department. Via this reorganization, Auklet became part of the fleet of the new FWS as US FWS Auklet in 1940. In the late 1940s, Auklet was engaged in salmon hunting and trapping winter patrol work, and she was scheduled to conduct the FWS′s first downstream fish migration research in early 1949. She was sold in the autumn of 1950.

His main works are on the history of Tatars, Volga Bulgaria, archeology of Kazan.. Life and work M.G. Khudyakov was born in a small town of Malmyzha of Vyatka province, in an old and prosperous Russian merchant family. He graduated from the 1st Kazan Gymnasium with a gold medal (1906—1913), studied at the History and Philology Faculty of Kazan University (1913—1918). In 1918—1924 he worked in Kazan: school teacher, librarian at Kazan University History, Archeology, and Ethnography Society, from 1919 — curator of the Archaeological Department, then a head of the Historical and Archaeological Department of the Provincial Puseum, he lectured at the North-Eastern Archaeological and Ethnographic Institute. Since 1920 he also worked in the museum department of the Tatar ASSR People's Commissariat of Education. He was one of organizers and secretaries of the Scientific Society for Tatar Studies. He participated in creation of a museum in his native Malmyj. In 1920s, he published a number of historical, ethnographic, and archaeological works about history of the Turkic and Finno-Ugric peoples of the region. His book “Essays on the History of the Kazan Khanate”, published in 1923, gained a scientific prominence. Khudyakov's work was one of the first works by the Russian historians on the subject of the Kazan Khanate, which history penned by the previous generations' historians addressed exclusively the context of the Russian history. His view differed from that of previous authors by the author's sympathy to the Bulgaro-Tatar people and traced the Moscow state's policy as aggressive and colonial. He demonstrated a scientific objectivity. His work expressed his gratitude to a number of orientalists, who to some extent shared his vision: Gayaz Maksudov and G.S. Gubaidullin, N.N. Firsov, M.I. Lopatkin, S.G. Vakhidov. In 1923, a prominent Bolshevik M. Kh. Sultan-Galiev was denounced on charges of nationalism, some of the Tatar autonomy's government members refused to condemn Sultan-Galiyev, and the Tatar government was dissolved. Khudyakov left Kazan after those events. From 1925, he lived and worked in Leningrad as a research fellow at the State Public Library. In 1926—1929 he took a post-graduate course in the State Academy of History of Material Culture (GAIMK). In 1927, he joined an expedition to the Chuvashia's Middle Volga area. In the 1920s he was recording Udmurt epos. From 1929 he lectured at the Leningrad University, from 1931 he was an assistant professor at the Historical and Linguistic Institute (LILI) and at the Institute of Philosophy, Literature and History (LIFLI) in Leningrad. In 1929—1933 he was a scientific secretary and a research associate at the USSR Academy of Sciences' Study Commission on Tribal Composition of the USSR Population. From 1931, he was a lead researcher at the Institute of the Pre-Class Society (GAIMK), in 1933 he joined the Department of Early Feudalism. In 1930—32, Khudyakov was accused in “Turkic nationalism” and “Sultangalievism”, which did not extend beyond public “scalding”. In 1931, he participated in “criticism” of the arrested archaeologist S.I. Rudenko. He actively advocated in favor for the state enforcement of the Marrism. In 1936, without having to present a thesis, he was bestowed a PhD degree in the Historical Sciences and a title of an active member of the Pre-Class Society Institute (GAIMK). And on September 9, 1936, he was arrested by the Leningrad provincial department of the NKVD under the Russian SFSR Penal Code Articles 58-8 (terrorism) and 11 (hostile organization) as an “active participant in the counterrevolutionary Trotskyite-Zinoviev terrorist organization”. On December 19, 1936, a field session of the Supreme Council of the USSR Armed Forces sentenced him to death with confiscation of all his private property. On the same day, in Leningrad, he was shot to death. All works of M.G. Khudyakov were outlawed, had to be destroyed, and stripped from all libraries. In 1957, M.G. Khudyakov was rehabilitated, but his works were not reprinted. The first step in returning his works from the non-existence was a publication in 1989 of some of his works in the Tatar language (“Essays on the history of the Kazan Khanate” and some individual articles) in the youth magazine “Idel (Volga)”. A second edition of the book was printed in 1991. References *Yashin D.A.

He was born in England, but moved to Australia with the First Fleet when he was 35. He farmed many acres of land there, and he later became a magistrate. He organized flood relief during a flood which came to the area, and sided with Governor Bligh during the Rum Rebellion, temporarily losing his magistrate position after the event. He was married to Elizabeth Burleigh from 1807 until his death, and he had a total of 9 children throughout his life.  Early life  Arndell was born on 4 March 1753, in Kington, Herefordshire, England, to his mother Elizabeth and his father Anthony. He was the youngest of the 11 children in the family. He was baptized at the Kington Parish Church.  Career  In 1788, when Arndell was 35 years old, he sailed to Australia with the First Fleet as one of seven surgeons, on the Friendship. These surgeons, led by John White, acted as medical staff, who helped care for the convicts of the First Fleet. He was made in charge of the Parramatta hospital soon after arriving at Port Jackson, and began to nurture the land there in 1791. In July 1792, he requested to retire and become a settler, as he believed that he would have a better livelihood as a farmer. Arthur Phillip granted Arndell 60 acres of land to farm on around Parramatta. Arndell cleared 21 acres of land by October 1792; he was one of only three people who achieved this. The number of acres he owned increased to 630 by 1806, and 750 by 1807. Arndell settled into the Hawkesbury district, where he was a magistrate and is where he stayed for most of the rest of his life. He continued to farm in the district, and became one of the most successful farmers of the time. He primarily focused on growing grains and raising sheep. He built the first flour-grinding windmill in the district. Arndell helped organize flood relief on 23 March 1806, when a flood came to Cattai, New South Wales, rising to 18 inches in the area. In the later years of his life, Arndell became the assistant surgeon in the district. During this time, William Bligh was the governor. The Rum Rebellion started in 1808, which resulted in Bligh being overthrown. Arndell sided with the governor during this, and was his confidant throughout the event. Arndell was demoted from his magistracy, with Archibald Bell becoming the new magistrate of the area. However, Lachlan Macquarie, the next governor, was impressed by Arndell's loyalty, and succeeded in convincing the British government to have his position reinstated.  Personal life  Arndell married Elizabeth Burleigh in 1807. Arndell and Burleigh had six children: William Arndell, Elizabeth Emily Gordon, Mary Louisa White, Sarah Threlkeld, James Arndell, and Frances Hannah Gunn. He also had eight children to two other women before leaving England to migrate to Australia on the First Fleet: seven to Susanna Simon, two of whom survived to adulthood, and another to an Italian opera singer, Delicia Isabella Francesca Foscari. He fathered 14 children in total, however only half survived to adulthood. He died on 2 May 1821, in Cattai, New South Wales. Elizabeth died 22 years later, on 31 January 1843. The two of them are buried at St. Matthew's Anglican Church, in Windsor, New South Wales.

Discovery  R. viridis was first described by botanist Hugh Wilson in 1980. The epithet viridis refers to its bright green leaves. Department of Conservation surveys found a small number of plants in the early 2000s and again in March 2017. The latest survey team collected two rosettes, which are being grown in a climate-controlled glasshouse at the Dunedin Botanic Garden. Rakiura/Stewart Island  Description  The Mount Allen buttercup is a short perennial herb with leaves forming small clumps or patches. It has a stout rhizome with numerous fleshy roots. The leaves are bright green, thick and glossy (20-40mm in diameter). The flower stem is short (15-30mm tall) and barely rises above the leaves. it is covered with fine cobwebby hairs and grooved on its upper surface. A single bright yellow flower forms on each stem and is 25-30mm in diameter. The lower third of the petals are green. The seed head is light green (12 mm in diameter) with many small brown achenes. R.viridis flowers between December and March and fruits between December and May.  Habitat and ecology  New Zealand has more than 40 species of wild buttercups. Thirty-four of these are native and they usually grow in mountain regions and on some predator-free offshore islands. The Mount Allen buttercup is one of three species endemic to Rakiura/Stewart Island. It is found only in the remote Tin Range on the slopes of Mount Allen. It survives in the shady damp crevices and ledges of rocky outcrops high on the mountainside at altitudes of 700m (2,300ft). It is most closely related to R. pinguis, which is found on the Auckland and Campbell Islands, and the yellow mountain buttercup (R. sericophyllus) from the South Island. 400px  References   External links  * The Mt Allen buttercup discussed on RNZ Critter of the Week, 14 September 2018 viridis Flora of New Zealand ","title":"Ranunculus viridis"},{"id":"58513229","text":" Incumbents  On March 28, 1935, president of Poland Ignacy Mościcki designed the government under prime minister Walery Sławek, who replaced Leon Kozłowski.

Opal silica (SiO2) is a chemical compound of silicon, and is also called silicon dioxide. Silicon is considered a bioessential element and is one of the most abundant elements on Earth. The silica cycle has significant overlap with the carbon cycle (see Carbonate- Silicate cycle) and plays an important role in the sequestration of carbon through continental weathering, biogenic export and burial as oozes on geologic timescales.  Terrestrial silica cycling  Silica is an important nutrient utilized by plants, trees, and grasses in the terrestrial biosphere. Silicate is transported by rivers and can be deposited in soils in the form of various siliceous polymorphs. Plants can readily uptake silicate in the form of H4SiO4 for the formation of phytoliths. Phytoliths are tiny rigid structures found within plant cells that aid in the structural integrity of the plant. Phytoliths also serve to protect the plants from consumption by herbivores who are unable to consume and digest silica-rich plants efficiently. Silica release from phytolith degradation or dissolution is estimated to occur at a rate double that of global silicate mineral weathering. Considering biogeochemical cycling within ecosystems, the import and export of silica to and from terrestrial ecosystems is small. = Sources = Silicate minerals are abundant in rock formations all over the planet, comprising approximately 90% of the Earth's crust. The primary source of silicate to the terrestrial biosphere is weathering. An example of the chemical reaction for this weathering is: MgSiO3(s) + 2CO2(g) + H2O(l) = Mg2+(aq) + 2HCO3- (aq) + SiO2(aq) Wollastonite (CaSiO3) and enstatite (MgSiO3) are examples of silicate-based minerals. The weathering process is important for carbon sequestration on geologic timescales. The process of and rate of weathering is variable dependent upon rainfall, runoff, vegetation, lithology, and topography. = Sinks = The major sink of the terrestrial silica cycle is export to the ocean by rivers. Silica that is stored in plant matter or dissolved can be exported to the ocean by rivers. The rate of this transport is approximately 6 Tmol Si yr−1. This is the major sink of the terrestrial silica cycle, as well as the largest source of the marine silica cycle. A minor sink for terrestrial silica is silicate that is deposited in terrestrial sediments and eventually exported to the Earth's crust.  Marine silica cycling  Marine and terrestrial contributions to the silica cycle are shown, with the relative movement (flux) provided in units of Tmol Si/yr. Marine biological production primarily comes from diatoms. Estuary biological production is due to sponges. Values of flux as published by Tréguer & De La Rocha. Reservoir size of silicate rocks, as discussed in the sources section, is 1.5x1021 Tmol. Siliceous organisms in the ocean, such as diatoms and radiolaria, are the primary sink of dissolved silicic acid into opal silica. Once in the ocean, dissolved Si molecules are biologically recycled roughly 25 times before export and permanent deposition in marine sediments on the seafloor. This rapid recycling is dependent on the dissolution of silica in organic matter in the water column, followed by biological uptake in the photic zone. The estimated residence time of the silica biological reservoir is about 400 years. Opal silica is predominately undersaturated in the world's oceans. This undersaturation promotes rapid dissolution as a result of constant recycling and long residence times. The estimated turnover time of Si is 1.5x104 years. The total net inputs and outputs of silica in the ocean are 9.4 ± 4.7 Tmol Si yr−1 and 9.9 ± 7.3 Tmol Si yr−1, respectively. Biogenic silica production in the photic zone is estimated to be 240 ± 40 Tmol Si year −1. Dissolution in the surface removes roughly 135 Tmol Si year−1, while the remaining Si is exported to the deep ocean within sinking particles. In the deep ocean, another 26.2 Tmol Si Year−1 is dissolved before being deposited to the sediments as opal rain. Over 90% of the silica here is dissolved, recycled and eventually upwelled for use again in the euphotic zone. = Sources = The major sources of marine silica include rivers, groundwater flux, seafloor weathering inputs, hydrothermal vents, and atmospheric deposition (aeolian flux). Rivers are by far the largest source of silica to the marine environment, accounting for up to 90% of all the silica delivered to the ocean. A source of silica to the marine biological silica cycle is silica that has been recycled by upwelling from the deep ocean and seafloor. = Sinks = Deep seafloor deposition is the largest long-term sink of the marine silica cycle (6.3 ± 3.6 Tmol Si year−1), and is roughly balanced by the sources of silica to the ocean. The silica deposited in the deep ocean is primarily in the form of siliceous ooze, which is eventually subducted under the crust and metamorphosed in the upper mantle. Under the mantle, silicate minerals are formed in oozes and eventually uplifted to the surface. At the surface, silica can enter the cycle again through weathering. This process can take tens of millions of years. The only other major sink of silica in the ocean is burial along continental margins (3.6 ± 3.7 Tmol Si year −1), primarily in the form of siliceous sponges. Due to the high degrees of uncertainty in source and sink estimations, it's difficult to conclude if the marine silica cycle is in equilibrium. The residence time of silica in the oceans is estimated to be about 10,000 years. Silica can also be removed from the cycle by becoming chert and being permanently buried.  Anthropogenic influences  The rise in agriculture of the past 400 years has increased the exposure rocks and soils, which has resulted in increased rates of silicate weathering. In turn, the leaching of amorphous silica stocks from soils has also increased, delivering higher concentrations of dissolved silica in rivers. Conversely, increased damming has led to a reduction in silica supply to the ocean due to uptake by freshwater diatoms behind dams. The dominance of non-siliceous phytoplankton due to anthropogenic nitrogen and phosphorus loading and enhanced silica dissolution in warmer waters has the potential to limit silicon ocean sediment export in the future.  Role in climate regulation  The silica cycle plays an important role in long term global climate regulation. The global silica cycle also has large effects on the global carbon cycle through the Carbonate- Silicate Cycle. The process of silicate mineral weathering transfers atmospheric CO2 to the hydrologic cycle through the chemical reaction displayed above. Over geologic timescales, the rates of weathering change due to tectonic activity. During a time of high uplift rate, silicate weathering increases which results in high CO2 uptake rates, offsetting increased volcanic CO2 emissions associated with the geologic activity. This balance of weathering and volcanoes is part of what controls the greenhouse effect and ocean pH over geologic time scales.

Early life and education  Hernández was born in Torreon, Mexico in 1948 on a communal ranch to parents Manuel and Nicolasa Hernández. Her grandparents and father, born in the United States, were subject to the forced migration practices of Mexican Repatriation during the Great Depression. After moving to the United States in 1956 at the age of seven, she settled with her family at the Maravilla Housing Projects of East Los Angeles. Hernández started school in Los Angeles, despite knowing little English. However, she had a major desire to learn, in addition to a teacher realizing her potential, so she was able to excel in school at a young age. After graduating from Garfield High School, Hernández secured several scholarships and attended the University of California Los Angeles, earning her B.A. in History in 1970. After graduating from UCLA, Hernández was preparing to become a school teacher, working on her receiving her full certifications. However, due to the growing uproar at educational inequality, specifically for Latino students, she decided to become a lawyer as she \\"saw the need (for change)\\". She was then accepted to the UCLA School of Law, where she earned her J.D. degree in 1974.  Professional career  In 1975, Hernández was employed by the Los Angeles Center for Law and Justice and immediately became involved with her landmark case Madrigal v. Quilligan, combating the practice of involuntary sterilization of minority women at the discretion of hospital staff. While the ruling was in favor of the defendants, new measures regarding consent were implemented as a result of the case. From 1979 to 1980, Hernández served as the first Latina staff counsel to the United States Senate Judiciary Committee under Senator Ted Kennedy. Her work mostly consisted of issues involving immigration, but she also dealt with other issues such as civil rights and judicial nominations. Hernández was chosen by Senator Ted Kennedy to serve on the campaign team for his 1980 presidential run. She was hired by David Boies and initially was the Southwest campaign coordinator, helping run the campaign in many different states such as Texas, Louisiana, and Arizona. The campaign was a new experience for Hernández, being her first time working in the partisan political world. She said of the experience, it was like \\"learning on the treadmill\\". Following the election, in 1981, Hernández was hired by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF) to work as Regional Counsel in Washington D.C. She was elected president and general counsel of the organization in 1985. In 1987, she was fired by the fifteen member executive committee for being accused of mishandling a major lawsuit in Texas involving discriminatory hiring and promotion practices against Latinos. Hernández was accused of mishandling the case due to a conflict of interest in which the defendants' attorney, Vilma Martinez was a former head of MALDEF. MALDEF received $150,000 in legal fees and Martinez received $32,000, with the three plaintiffs receiving $8,000 each, resulting in criticism in MALDEF's management of the litigation. Additional criticism against MALDEF came about as their attorneys did not push for back pay or job reinstatement for the three plaintiffs. After filing her own lawsuit against MALDEF, she was reinstated through the decision of the full thirty-two member board of directors. From 1984 to 1995, Hernández successfully led MALDEF in a case against the State of Texas on the basis of discrimination against students in underfunded school districts, citing that Texas public school funding led to economic and racial disparities between school districts. This case was resolved in 1995, when the Texas Supreme Court ruled that the Texas Legislature had authority to require shared funding between school districts. Hernández led MALDEF to win a similar case in California, where urban schools were receiving less funding than suburban schools. In addition, during her time as MALDEF president, Hernández led the establishment of bilingual and multicultural programs for Latino students in Denver, Colorado, helped in the expansion of higher education programs for Latinos in South Texas, and advocated for the creation of legislature in California that allowed for undocumented students to pay the same tuition as other in-state students at any public university. In 1994, MALDEF was successful in blocking California's Proposition 187, whose legislation barred undocumented immigrants from public services including education and healthcare. In February 2004, Hernández resigned her position with MALDEF and joined the California Community Foundation (CCF) as president and CEO. Founded in 1915, CCF supports numerous non-profit organizations and public institutions through funds for health and human services, affordable housing, early childhood education, and community arts and culture. In an interview addressing the move, she states \\"Whereas MALDEF at the macro, systemic change level, CCF is about the micro, one community, one county.\\" As CEO, Hernández has helped the CCF increase its assets to over $1 billion, allowing for greater service opportunities and innovative programs to reach more Los Angelenos, especially those who are of color, low income, and immigrants. Under Hernández, the CCF began to work in other areas, besides grant making, such as civic engagement and public policy initiatives. One such program is the Immigrant Integration Initiative, which works to increase the quality of life for alienated immigrant communities by helping them increase their civic participation. In 2013, the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy awarded their NCRP Impact Award for Grantmaking Public Charity to the CCF, citing Hernández's leadership as a main reason for the CCF's great impact on the community. Through this organization, Hernández continues to advocate for Latino and immigrant rights of the Los Angeles community. In addition to her work with CCF, Hernández is a board member of several local and national organizations, including the American Automobile Association, the Automobile Club of Southern California, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Council on Foundations, Grameen America, as well as a fellow of the American Law Institute and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.  Awards and Honors  In 1998, Hernández was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters (L.H.D.) degree from Whittier College.

Articles in Red Star advocate for communist revolution to bring about women's liberation and focus on themes of violent revolution, welfare, and birth control.\\"The Genocideology of Birth Control,\\" March 1970. The Red Women's Detachment differs from traditional women's groups in its working class demographics and its revolutionary ideals, and is critical of the Women's Liberation Movement.  The Red Women's Detachment  The Red Women's Detachment was a New York City based communist women's organization made up of working class women and women on welfare. The Red Women's Detachment was a part of the Marxist–Leninist Party with a theoretical basis in Mao Tse-tung Thought (also known as Mao Zedung Thought or Maoism). In their own words, \\"The force at the core leading our cause forward is the Marxist-Leninist Party.\\" Marxism–Leninism is a communist ideology founded on the works and ideas of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin. The Red Women's Detachment's was run by a Central Committee and had a structured organizational system. The second issue of Red Star lays out this organization in the \\"Draft Constitution of the Red Women's Detachment,\\" outlining three groups: Mao Tse Tung Thought study groups, martial arts collectives, and women's armed defense groups.  Publication information  The Central Committee of the Red Women's Detachment created and published Red Star in New York City and distributed it to other women's organizations in the United States, particularly those composed of working class women sympathetic to their communist revolutionary goals, including Bread and Roses in Cambridge, MA; Female Liberation in Somerville, MA; Women's Caucus in Chicago, IL; and Radical Women in Seattle, WA. Other women's groups in the Red Women's Detachment's circle included The New Orleans Female Workers Union and The White Panther Party. Red Star consists of articles written by the Red Women's Detachment or reprinted from other sources.  Topic discussed  = Revolution = The Red Women's Detachment advocated revolution by the working class. They believed such a revolution was the only way for women to be liberated. The first issue contains a call to arms, asking women to \\"arm for proletarian revolution.\\" An article by the Women's Armed Defense Groups branch of the Red Women's Detachment titled Guns, Sisters, Guns asserts that for women to be liberated and for revolution to be successful, women need to be armed and learn combat skills. The same issue contains diagrams indicating targets on the male body in combat situations. Articles including \\"Revolutionary Women: Fight Back!!\\", \\"Women in Struggle\\", and \\"Indian Heroines in Peasant Armed Revolutionary Struggle\\", discuss women's participation in revolutions around the world. One of the countries included India, where the article discuss the involvement of Indian women in the Peasant Armed Revolutionary Struggle such as the 1967 Naxalbari Uprising, where peasants and laborers revolted against the local government and land owners. The reprinted article \\"Vietnamese Women\\" asserts that the August Revolution liberated Vietnamese women, and that \\"the Vietnamese woman has literally won equality with a weapon in her hand and through the sheer strength of her arms\\". The article \\"Open Letter to Welfare Women\\", written by the Red Women's Detachment, asserts that they \\"are following the example of our brave sister-comrades in China and Albania who fought long and hard for socialism which brought about their liberation.\\" = Welfare = In the 1960s, based on considering poverty a social problem and not an individual problem, President Johnson launched a war on poverty including welfare reform. Red Star critiques contemporary welfare rights groups and proposes a system to benefit women that emphasizes collaboration and solidarity of working class and welfare women. The Red Women's Detachment denounced parts of the welfare rights movement focused on the welfare struggle but did not consider other struggles and potential coalitions. The welfare discussion based in their revolutionary ideals argues that they \\"will never get what [they] want except by an armed revolution followed by socialism.\\" Their child care goals include educating children about politics and self defense \\"to make children revolutionary fighters.\\" The article \\"Open Letter to Welfare Women\\" opposes forced birth control based on class or welfare status. In the mid 1960s, almost all states had public funding for birth control, in some states through the welfare department. = Birth control = The first issue of Red Star includes a two-page article entitled \\"The Genocideology of Birth Control\\" and the second issue includes an \\"Open Letter to Welfare Women\\" that discusses birth control and forced sterilization to prevent working class women from reproducing. The Red Women's Detachment reports Richard Nixon July 18, 1969 address to Congress, where he explained the dangers of population growth and advocated creating the Commission on Population Growth and the American Future and an increased availability for family planning. The Red Women's Detachment critiques Malthusian notions of population control and refers to family planning efforts by the government as \\"conspiratorial schemes of racial extermination.\\" Individuals who subscribed to eugenics, including doctors, scientists, and politicians, deemed women on welfare, particularly women of color, \\"unfit\\" to reproduce. Doctors performed tubal ligations and hysterectomies on such women without their consent or knowledge. During the 1950s and 1960s, while poor women, women of color, and disabled women were coercively rendered infertile, middle and upper class white women were prevented from accessing methods of birth control that contributed to the Women's Liberation Movement's focus on birth control access. In The \\"Genocideology of Birth Control\\", the Red Women's Detachment critiques the Women's Liberation Movement for advocating the repeal of abortion laws while working class women on welfare were forcibly sterilized. = The Women's Liberation Movement = Many women's groups while Red Star's was published challenged the notion that women belong in the private sphere and should conform to stereotypical women's roles. The Red Women's Detachment considered the National Organization for Women (NOW) to be \\"bourgeois-feminist.\\" In the second issue of Red Star, they describe the Red Women's Detachment as a women's liberation group, but \\"different from the other groups in several ways.\\" They differ from traditional women's liberation groups in that their membership is working class and they advocate for revolution and socialism to achieve women's liberation. The Red Women's Detachment was critical of the women's movement, particularly because of its middle and upper class demographics. The experience of working class women was different from middle and upper classes as their economic position did not allow them to stay in the private sphere. Therefore, their struggles did not align with that of women's groups attempting to gain autonomy and fulfillment through entering the workforce. The Red Women's Detachment argues that women's oppression can not be separated from class oppression, noting \\"the task now is to overthrow the bourgeoise to bring about the dictatorship of the proletariat, not fight the male supremacy by itself as if it were not a component of class rule\\" aligning with the 1950s communist view that \\"one of the explicit purposes of bourgeois culture was to keep women down.\\" The feminist's conceptualization of women and women's issues as essential and universal served to exclude groups of people based on class, race, and sexuality.

She was in commission in the United States Bureau of Fisheries fleet from 1917 to 1940 and, as US FWS Murre in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service fleet from 1940 to 1942. Murre and her sister ship were the first vessels ever constructed for fisheries enforcement duties in Alaska.  Construction  In 1916, the United States Congress appropriated $10,000 to the United States Bureau of Fisheries (BOF) for the construction of two fishery patrol vessels for service in the waters of Southeast Alaska.AFSC Historical Corner: Auklet and Murre, 1917 Sister Patrol Vessels Retrieved September 17, 2018 Martin C. Erismann designed the vessels as identical sister ships and patterned them after the highly seaworthy design of salmon purse seiners. Built out of Douglas fir, they had a raised deck forward of the pilot house that dropped moving aft, a raised deck house amidships which had an overhanging roof that covered the deck, and a small afterdeck at the stern. The sides extended upward to create the walls of the after cabin. Each boat had a Frisco Standard gasoline engine and comfortable accommodations for two fishery agents and a crew of three. Construction bids for the two vessels opened in Seattle, Washington, on 5 December 1916 and the project attracted seven bids. Ultimately, the BOF signed a contract to build the vessels with the Elliott Bay Yacht and Engine Company of Seattle. Construction began immediately. After the two boats were completed and inspected, the BOF accepted both boats, USFS Murre and , on 10 May 1917. The total cost of designing, building, and inspecting the two boats came to US$9,702.70. They were the first vessels ever constructed for fisheries enforcement duties in Alaska. afsc.noaa.gov AFSC Historical Corner - Timeline of Significant Events Operational history The BOF commissioned both 'Murre and Auklet in the summer of 1917. Murre and Auklet departed Seattle on 7 July 1917 bound for Wrangell, Territory of Alaska. After they arrived, they took up their patrol duties in the waters of Southeast Alaska. On 25 October 1918, the Canadian passenger liner sank with the loss of all 343 people on board after grounding on Vanderbilt Reef in Lynn Canal near Juneau; it was the worst maritime disaster in the combined history of Alaska and British Columbia. Murre joined Auklet and the BOF fishery patrol vessel in a fruitless search for survivors that lasted into November 1918. In addition to performing their primary duty of fishery patrols in the waters of Southeast Alaska, Auklet and Murre often engaged in other activities. They assisted the United States Department of War in inspecting active and abandoned fish traps as possible navigational obstructions, and took part in routine stream improvements, which involved the removal of impediments to salmon – such as log jams and beaver dams – as they ascended to their spawning grounds. In 1919–1920, the BOF loaned Murre to the United States Census Bureau. On 3 December 1919, a fire broke out in her galley while she was moored at Hoonah, Alaska, with her crew sleeping on board. The crew awoke and extinguished it, but not before it caused US$600 damage to the ship and considerable property loss to the crew. While conducting census work for the United States Department of the Interior's Bureau of Education, Murre struck a rock in Alaska's Keku Strait on 1 April 1920 and was beached to prevent her from sinking. Auklet arrived on the scene and towed Murre to Wrangell for repairs, which cost more than US$1,600. Investigations into both incidents found no fault on the part of Murres captain or crew. In September 1920, Murre and Auklet conducted stream-marking. Over the winter of 1920–1921, the BOF loaned Murre to the Bureau of Education and to the United States Department of Justice. In 1921 Murre and Auklet began a program of annual springtime patrolling of sealing grounds near Sitka, Territory of Alaska, during fur seal migrations. By 1922, both Murre and Auklet had had their original engines replaced with heavier, Frisco Standard gasoline engines that gave them additional power they needed to deal with the high winds and seas they frequently encountered in the waters of the Territory of Alaska. In the spring of 1924, Murre briefly assisted the U.S. Department of War in looking for improper lighting on unattended fish traps and structures that could pose hazards to navigation in navigable waters in Alaska. In February 1928, Murre and Auklet both had water heating systems installed at Juneau, and later in 1928 each boat had her galley enlarged to increase the comfort of crew and passengers. In 1930, Murre supported a project by Dr. Willis H. Rich to tag pink salmon and study salmon migration routes in Alaska. In March 1932, she assisted B. E. Smith of Ketchikan, Alaska, in transporting approximately 300,000 Japanese seed oysters to Southeast Alaska and planting them there in the hope of establishing a new food source. In 1936, she again supported Rich's salmon project. In addition to her Southeast Alaska patrol duties, Murre occasionally patrolled in other waters of the Territory of Alaska. In the mid-1930s, she patrolled in the Katalla, Prince William Sound, and Seward areas. In 1937, Murre was on a voyage from Seattle to Alaska when her crankshaft broke. The BOF vessel rendezvoused with her and towed her into port. In 1939, the Bureau of Fisheries was transferred from the United States Department of Commerce to the U.S. Department of the Interior, and on 30 June 1940, it merged with the Interior Department's Division of Biological Survey to form the new Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) as an element of the Interior Department. Via this reorganization, Murre became part of the fleet of the new FWS as US FWS Murre in 1940. After the United States entered World War II, Murre reportedly came under United States Navy control in 1942 for war service.
