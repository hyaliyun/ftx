Space astrometry and its various applications has been his main focus in astronomy since 1976. His career has been marked by his continuous involvement in, leadership of, and profound contributions to, ESA's Hipparcos and Gaia missions over their entire duration. Contributions to Hipparcos During the early studies of ESA's Hipparcos space astrometry mission, and while still a graduate student in 1976, he was \`recruited' to the project by Erik H√∏g, and thereafter played a crucial role in various aspects of the mission definition and in the data analysis. He set out the overall principles of the astrometric data reduction aiming to combine and solve together the attitude, the system and the astrometric parameters of the stars. This crucial \`3-step procedure' was used successfully by the two consortia (NDAC and FAST) later entrusted by ESA with the Hipparcos data processing. The principle of reconstructing space astrometric positions from one-dimensional observations carried out in the innovative Hipparcos sky scanning mode was fully original (and frequently questioned outside the project), and at the very limit of available computational power even by the end of the mission in 1997. The numerical principles had to be demonstrated, together with the solution‚Äôs statistical properties. Already by the end of 1976, Lindegren had produced a set of definitive technical notes and simulations showing how to obtain a \`rigid sphere' with all astrometric parameters from a scanning satellite. Innovation, efficiency, completeness, clarity, and mathematical rigour have been the hallmarks of his many and varied fundamental contributions to space astrometry since that time. From 1990 Lennart Lindegren led the Consortium NDAC (Northern Data Analysis Consortium) sharing with FAST (led by Jean Kovalevsky) the data processing of Hipparcos.Members of the ESA's Hipparcos Science Team In addition to the overall scientific coordinating responsibilities, he developed many of the approaches and algorithms related to the mission: his innovation, insight and mathematical rigour impacted the optical and focal plane design, the instrument calibration, the scanning law, the attitude determination (and the associated \`dynamical smoothing'), the double star analysis (as observed via a signal modulated by a grid), the effects of chromaticity and thermal load fluctuations, the optimum combination of the NDAC and FAST catalogue solutions, and the link to an extragalactic reference frame. He was member of ESA's Hipparcos Science Team for the entire duration of the project (1976‚Äì1997). Erik H√∏g has written:Lennart Lindegren‚Äôs first years with Hipparcos, Contribution to the history of astrometry No. 2 \\"A new era of my life began on 1 September 1973 when I returned to Denmark with my family of five, after 15 years in Hamburg. I had obtained a tenure at the Copenhagen University where I was going to work on the construction of automatic control of the meridian circle in Brorfelde. Very soon, however, I heard of a young student at Lund Observatory who worked alone on modernizing the old meridian circle there. I went to Lund and \`found' Lennart. A few years later, Andrew Murray, my old colleague and member of the Hipparcos science team, would say: \`Erik, the best you have ever done for astronomy was to find Lennart!' and I agreed\\". Later H√∏g writes: \\"Of his numerous papers I will only mention two. He wrote a paper on \`Photoelectric astrometry',Photoelectric astrometry: a comparison of methods for precise image location a subject I had proposed, where he systematically discussed the performance of methods for precise image location from observations. It remains a classical paper. The second paper to mention is about the rigidity of the celestial coordinate system obtained by the one-dimensional observations in a scanning satellite as TYCHO/Option A/Hipparcos. The question was asked in 1976 as mentioned above, but it took years before we had the answer which was affirmative. The study was led by Lennart and contains his brilliant mathematical analysis of the simulations, but he modestly left the position as first author to another personDerivation of positions and parallaxes from simulated observations with a scanning astrometry satellite\\". Contributions to Gaia Before the Hipparcos Catalogue was published, he was the first (with Michael Perryman), to set forth a new proposal for a more ambitious mission in terms of accuracy and sensitivity, resting on the same fundamental principles as Hipparcos.Gaia: global astrometric interferometer for astrophysics This was initially Roemer, and finally Gaia, eventually selected by ESA in 2000 (for a projected launch in 2012), and actually launched in December 2013.ESA Gaia www site Again, Lennart Lindegren was instrumental in the initial design of what was in the early phase an interferometer and in the assessment of the astrometric accuracy achievable. He also led the detailed design of the overall scheme of the astrometric solution, being a block iterative adjustment determining the attitude, the calibration and the system directly from the CCD images.The astrometric core solution for the Gaia mission: overview of models, algorithms, and software implementation This Astrometric Global Iterative Solution (AGIS) is now fully operational within the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC). Lindegren was a member of the ESA Gaia Science Advisory Group before mission selection, and the Gaia Science Team since selection in 2000.Gaia People of the ESA's web site for the Gaia scientific community Within the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC), Lindegren leads the scientific implementation of the Astrometric Global Iterative Solution, a core element in the astrometric processing of the Gaia data. Between 2006‚Äì2010 he was project coordinator for the Marie Curie Research Training Network ELSA (European Leadership in Space Astrometry), aiming to develop the science of space astrometry and train the next generation of researchers in this area.ELSA official website Since 2010 he has served on the committee of the European Science Foundation's Research Networking Programme \`GREAT' (Gaia Research for European Astronomy Training). Publications Lindegren's publications include more than 90 refereed papers on astrometry, reference frames, data processing, spectroscopy and instrument design. Besides those in space astrometry, a frequently cited paper deals with solar physics and the role of convection on the line profile,The fundamental definition of radial velocity and another considers in a very general way the atmospheric limitations on small-field astrometry.Atmospheric limitations of narrow-field optical astrometry He is a co-author of the canonical paper on the IAU 2000 \`Resolutions for Astrometry, Celestial Mechanics, and Metrology in the Relativistic Framework'.The IAU 2000 Resolutions for Astrometry, Celestial Mechanics, and Metrology in the Relativistic Framework: Explanatory Supplement Crucially, the bulk of his contributions to space astrometry has been in the form of a series of unpublished technical notes for Hipparcos and Gaia, amounting to some 200 documents totalling around 3000 pages. Timely, meticulous, rigorous, and often the final word on a given topic, they have been of immense value to the development and definition of these two projects. In addition to the mathematical principles they frequently include working algorithms (often with source code when relevant). Amongst them are, for Hipparcos, the three-step astrometric reduction, optimization of the scanning law, notes on the imaging properties used for the multiple star analysis, assessment of chromatic effects, attitude developments, and many others. For Gaia, his technical notes cover the mathematical and statistical aspects of the Gaia instrument and processing (including the attitude determination and its mathematical representation with quaternions and splines), the modelling of the point/line spread functions, the CCD geometric calibrations, broad band photometry design, maximum likelihood determination of the CCD image centroiding, differential equations and optimal properties of the scanning law, along with the subtle systematic effects in astrometry caused by instrumental misalignments. All these important results that led to developments in the on-board metrology or to fundamental implementations in the processing, have appeared only in the form of technical notes, and therefore remain largely unknown outside of the Hipparcos and Gaia groups. Awards On 19 May 1999, Lindegren was awarded the ESA's Director of Science Medal for his extraordinary efforts in ESA's scientific missions. At a ceremony in Bern, Switzerland, the first four medals were presented to scientific consortia leaders of the Hipparcos mission, Catherine Turon and Jean Kovalevsky from France, Lennart Lindegren from Sweden and Erik H√∏g from Denmark.ESA's Director of Science Medal In 2009, Lindegren was elected as a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.KVA Members of Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences In 2011, he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by the Paris Observatory, in recognition of his fundamental contributions to space astrometry over more than 30 years.

Background The year 2000 brought a heightened interest in the AFL after Kurt Warner, who spent three years as quarterback of the AFL's Iowa Barnstormers, rose to fame as starting quarterback for The Greatest Show on Turf, the Super Bowl-winning offense of the then-St. Louis Rams. While many sports commentators and fans continued to ridicule the league, Warner's story gave the league positive exposure, and it brought the league a new television deal with TNN, who would televise regular season games live on Sunday afternoons. The TNN deal coincided with the league's emergence as one with a major presence on the North American continent. Major markets such as Chicago, Detroit, Dallas, and Los Angeles, each of which had lacked franchises for many years, returned to the league, it received its first and only franchise in Canada (the Toronto Phantoms), and teams in smaller markets such as Albany and Iowa were relocated. In 2001, the league peaked at 19 teams. Included in the deal for the league was the right to broadcast the ArenaCup, the championship for the newly established arenafootball2, conceived as a minor league for metropolitan areas too small to support arena football as a major sport. ArenaCups I and II were carried on TNN.

Women's football in Nigeria has been increasing in popularity for many years. The Nigerian Women's Championship is funded by the government to improve the Nigeria women's national football team. History Numerous Nigerian cities hosted women's football teams by 1960. Multiple efforts were made in the 1960s to start women's football clubs in South Africa, but they proved fleeting. The 1970s saw some growth, with new women's leagues in Nigeria and an expansion of women's football into Western African countries, including Senegal. In 1978 Christopher Akintunde Abisuga created a club, first of their kind, called the sugar babes. This club was an all-female club and one of the first all-women teams. The team had no other female teams to compete with so they had to compete with male teams throughout the country. This team had much support through sponsorships and inspired players however they only lasted a few years. One local club in Dakar played a match against an Italian club in 1974; five years later, an early match between African nations was played by the Dakar side and a team from Guinea. National team Despite a lack of support from Nigerian officials, 28 clubs played women's football in the country by 1989, and Nigeria's national team competed in the 1991 Women's World Cup. This was made possible because of a major women's tournament privately funded by a wealthy entrepreneur. The tournament had the approval of the Nigerian FA and eventually led to the formation of the first women's national team. More women began playing football in the 1990s, in countries like Nigeria and South Africa. In 1998, CAF introduced an official African Women's Championship, following two unofficial versions of the tournament earlier in the 1990s; host country Nigeria won, beginning a stretch of five consecutive titles in the event. The next year, the squad reached the quarterfinals of the 1999 Women's World Cup.Alegi, pp. 121‚Äì123. The Nigerian women's national team has won eleven African cups of nation titles most recently in 2018. They are also the only team that has reached the quarter-finals at the summer Olympics and the women's FIFA world cup. As of 2020, the Nigerian women's national team is ranked 38th according to FIFA's world ranking chart. Mercy Akide, a striker who played on the '99 women's national team, is considered the most famous name in African women's football. Her spectacular playing in the '99 world cup won her a college scholarship to a school in Tennessee. She is considered to be a symbol of Nigerian women's success in football and to have put African soccer on the global map.Peter Alegi (2 March 2010).

The classifications for the sport are 1 point player, 2 point player, 3 point player, 4 point player and 4.5 point player, the greater the player's functional ability. Classification for the sport is set by the International Wheelchair Basketball Federation. Definition Classification in wheelchair basketball plays an important role in the sport as the classification uses total points of players to determine who can be on the court. The classifications for the sport are 1 point player, 2 point player, 3 point player, 4 point player and 4.5 point player. The higher the point number, the greater the player's functional ability. With five players on the court, the total number of points may not exceed fourteen. There has been sustained criticism of the classification system as being overly complex from players, coaches and leagues. These criticisms have been documented in academic research published in 1986, 1990, 1995 and 1997. Governance Classification for the sport is set by the International Wheelchair Basketball Federation (IWBF). Going into the 2012 Summer Paralympics, the classification system dates to 2004 and was created by the IWBF Player Classification Commission. In 1999, the United States based National Wheelchair Basketball Association governed over their own wheelchair basketball classification system because they did not like the system used by the IWBF, finding it to complex. The system they use and oversea is based on a classification assigning players a maximum of three points. Historically, the IWBF has had a good and close relationship with the Federation Internationale de Basketball Association. At the same time, IWBF have striven to maintain independent governance of their support. Eligibility , people with physical disabilities are eligible to compete in this sport. To be eligible to play wheelchair basketball, competitors must have a physical limitation that prevents them from being able to \\"run, pivot, or jump at speed and with control, safety. stability, and endurance of a nondisabled player; and have a permanent physical disability in the lower limb that can be objectively verified by acknowledged medical or paramedical investigations such as measurement, X-ray, CT, MRI, and so on.\\" Lower leg amputation competitors are allowed to participate in wheelchair sport following classification rules for them based on functional mobility. History The original ISMGF classification system used at early Paralympic Games. Early classification for the sport was managed by ISMGF and was a medical classification system with three classes. The original wheelchair basketball classification system in 1966 had 5 classes: A, B, C, D, S. Each class was worth so many points. A was worth 1, B and C were worth 2. D and S were worth 3 points. A team could have a maximum of 12 points on the floor. This system was the one in place for the 1968 Summer Paralympics. Class A was for T1-T9 complete. Class B was for T1-T9 incomplete. Class C was for T10-L2 complete. Class D was for T10-L2 incomplete. Class S was for Cauda equina paralysis. During the 1970s, a debate began to take place in the physical disability sport community about the merits of a medical versus functional classification system. During this period, people had strong feelings both ways but few practical changes were made to existing classification systems. From 1969 to 1973, a classification system designed by Australian Dr. Bedwell was used. This system used some muscle testing to determine which class incomplete paraplegics should be classified in. It used a point system based on the ISMGF classification system. Class IA, IB and IC were worth 1 point. Class II for people with lesions between T1-T5 and no balance were also worth 1 point. Class III for people with lesions at T6-T10 and have fair balance were worth 1 point. Class IV was for people with lesions at T11-L3 and good trunk muscles. They were worth 2 points. Class V was for people with lesions at L4 to L5 with good leg muscles. Class IV was for people with lesions at S1-S4 with good leg muscles. Class V and IV were worth 3 points. The Daniels/Worthington muscle test was used to determine who was in class V and who was class IV. Paraplegics with 61 to 80 points on this scale were not eligible. A team could have a maximum of 11 points on the floor. During the 1960s and 1970s, ISMGF classification cheating occurred in both swimming and wheelchair basketball. Some of the medical classifications for both many sportspeople appeared arbitrary, with people of different functional levels being put into the same class. This made the results for many games and swimming races appear to be completely arbitrary. Impacted sportspeople were starting to demand that changes be made to address this. The German men and women's national wheelchair basketball teams were leading the charge in this regard, offering to test out and actually testing new systems that were being developed by Cologne based Horst Strokhkendl. This process started in 1974 with a final report being written in 1978. Despite the report being submitted to ISMGF, no changes were made for years. The wheelchair basketball classification system used during the 1980s was mostly functional, but had medical lesion based elements as a guideline. A maximum of 14 points was allowed on the floor at any time. Wheelchair basketball was the first disability sport to use a functional classification system instead of a medical classification system. Early experiments with this type of classification system in basketball began during the 1980s. In 1982, wheelchair basketball finally made the move to a functional classification system internationally. While the traditional medical system of where a spinal cord injury was located could be part of classification, it was only one advisory component. The first demonstration of the system used at the 1983 Gold Cup Championships. At the time, there were four classes for the sport. The competition demonstrated that ISMGF medical classifiers had issues with correctly placing players into classes that best represented their ability. The new system increased player confidence and reduced criticism of the classification system as it pertained to accusations that players had been incorrectly classified. The functional classification system used at the 1983 Gold Cup Championships was developed in Cologne based Horst Strokhkendl. This system is the one that has been used consistently in the international community since then. It was subsequently used at the 1984 World Games for the Disabled in England. The introduction of a functional classification system also meant that for the first time, amputee players could participate in the sport. Despite the system being in place in time for the 1984 and 1988 Summer Paralympics, a decision was made to delay its use at the Paralympic Games until 1992, where it was used for the first time. This was in part a result of conflict between broader ISMGF and the Wheelchair Basketball Subcommittee. The ISMGF was opposed in some measure to fully moving to a functional classification system for the sport. This conflict would not officially resolve itself until 1986, when the United States men and women threatened to boycott major tournaments unless the functional system was fully implemented. In 1992, the International Paralympic Committee formally took control of governance for disability sport and oversaw the classification systems as part of a review for any sport seeking IPC recognition. The debate about inclusion of competitors into able-bodied competitions was seen by some disability sport advocates like Horst Strokhkendl as a hindrance to the development of an independent classification system not based on the rules for able-bodied sport. These efforts ended by 1993 as the International Paralympic Committee tried to carve out its own identity and largely ceased efforts for inclusion of disability sport on the Olympic programme. The Games were the first ones where basketball players of different types of disabilities competed against each other, basketball players had a guaranteed right to appeal their classification. Because of issues in objectively identifying functionality that plagued the post Barcelona Games, the IPC unveiled plans to develop a new classification system in 2003. This classification system went into effect in 2007, with standards based around identifying impaired strength, limb deficiency, leg length differences, and stature. It also included ways to assess vision impairment and intellectual impairment. Sports At times, players may not easily fit into the standard full point classifications. For this reason, they can be classified in between, such as 1.5 points, 2.5 points, and 3.5 points. Classifiers are discouraged from assigning this half point classification as a competitor's initial classification. Performance wise, 4 point players can move their wheelchairs at a significantly faster speed than 1 point players. There is also a significant difference in special endurance between 2 point players, and 3 and 4 point players, with 2 point players having less special endurance. In standard endurance, there is little significant difference between the different point classifications. Across all point classes, there is little difference in ability to perform an envelope agility test. In games, 4 point players steal the ball three times more often than 1 point players. 4 point players generally have the greatest number of rebounds on the court because of competitive advantage when under the basket in terms of height, stability and strength. 4 point players turn over the ball with much greater frequency than 1 point players. 1 point and 2 point players handle the ball the least on court. With a maximum of 14 points allowed to be on the floor at any time, teams may differ their point allocation based on the situation of the game. Having three 4 point players and two 1 point players involves the lower tiered players fulfilling the role of setting screens, while the higher tiered players create shots to bring the team back in the game. On the other hand, a team may choose to allocate their points in a more balanced manner to allow for increased mobility and handling. Process Classification appeals are handled by the IWBF. During the classification process, a player is asked to propose what classification they think they should be classified as. Once classified, changes in classification can only be made if there is unanimous decision amongst those who did the classification. In most countries, classification for national competitions is done through the local national Paralympic committee. For Australian competitors in this sport, the sport and classification is managed the national sport federation with support from the Australian Paralympic Committee. There are three types of classification available for Australian competitors: Provisional, national and international. The first is for club level competitions, the second for state and national competitions, and the third for international competitions. At the Paralympic Games Only wheelchair classified athletes were eligible to compete at the 1960 Summer Paralympics in Rome in this sport. At the 1992 Summer Paralympics, wheelchair, amputee and cerebral palsy disability types were eligible to participate, with classification being run through an independent classification body, with classification being done based on functional ability. General and functional classification took place in the Paralympic Village in block 2 from 29 to 31 August. At the 2000 Summer Paralympics, 23 assessments were conducted at the Games. This resulted in 7 class changes. There were 5 protests by PPS with all 5 classifications being upheld. There were 4 classification appeals lodged for wheelchair basketball at the 2000 Summer Paralympics involving 2 athletes which resulted in 2 class changes.> For the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, the International Paralympic Committee had a zero classification at the Games policy. This policy was put into place in 2014, with the goal of avoiding last minute changes in classes that would negatively impact athlete training preparations. All competitors needed to be internationally classified with their classification status confirmed prior to the Games, with exceptions to this policy being dealt with on a case by case basis. In case there was a need for classification or reclassification at the Games despite best efforts otherwise, wheelchair basketball classification was scheduled for 4 to 6 September at Carioca Arena 1. Future Going forward, disability sport's major classification body, the International Paralympic Committee, is working on improving classification to be more of an evidence-based system as opposed to a performance-based system so as not to punish elite athletes whose performance makes them appear in a higher class alongside competitors who train less.

He was an important champion of Lutheran orthodoxy and General Superintendent of Swedish Pomerania. Life Johann Friedrich Mayer was born in Leipzig on 6 December 1650 as the son of Johann Ulrich Mayer and his wife Ursula Sophia Braun. He attended the University of Leipzig and was awarded a bachelor's degree on 21 April 1666. A master's degree in liberal arts from the Faculty of Philosophy Faculty followed on 30 January 1668. He then attended the University of Strasbourg, where he applied himself to theological studies under Balthasar Friedrich Salzmann and until 1670. On 13 February 1671, he joined the Theological Faculty of Leipzig University. On 29 January 1672, he was made Saturday preacher (assistant pastor) in Leipzig, and later that year he was appointed superintendent in Leisnig. On 29 May 1673 he obtained his licentiate and on 19 October 1674 his doctorate in Theology. On 27 November 1678, he was appointed pastor and superintendent in Grimma. However, he did not find the position in Grimma fulfilling and wished to pursue an academic career. During his work as pastor, Mayer had made a name for himself as a writer of pamphlets against Syncretists, Arminianists and Papists. By decision of the Saxon High Consistory in Dresden, he was appointed fourth professor of theology at the University of Wittenberg on 12 May 1684, where he worked alongside Abraham Calovius, Johannes Andreas Quenstedt, and Johann Deutschmann. This post entailed serving as second preacher at the Wittenberg Castle Church and administering the state scholarships. In his inaugural address he argued, with reference to Philipp Spener's ', that theology should pursue piety rather than engaging in speculation. Mayer was rector of Wittenberg University in the winter semester of 1684. The scandal of the breakdown of his marriage, ending in divorce, which was rare at that time, impaired Mayer's effectiveness in Wittenberg, and he accepted the position of senior pastor of St. James' Church, Hamburg, though he would have preferred to remain in Wittenberg. Spener had admonished Mayer in connection with his marital problems and prevented him from obtaining positions that became available in Wittenberg, which led to a deep and lasting rift between Mayer and Spener. As a champion of Lutheran orthodoxy, Mayer later became one of Spener's most troublesome opponents. In 1692‚Äì93 there was a serious controversy among the senior pastors in Hamburg concerning the admissibility of Pietist conventicles. Mayer vehemently rejected them, along with Pietism in general, while , the senior pastor at St. Nicholas', approved them, supported by Abraham Hinckelmann, senior pastor at St. Catherine's, and , senior pastor at St. Michael's. Mayer prevailed and Horb was removed from his post; after Mayer's departure, however, Winckler, who had formerly acted as mediator, became the senior minister in Hamburg. During his time in Hamburg, Mayer conducted a lively correspondence with leading figures of his time. He was active at the , was briefly professor at the University of Kiel, and was made a Senior Church Councillor (') of Holstein. In addition, in 1691 King Charles XI of Sweden made him Senior Church Councillor (') of the German territory under Swedish rule. In 1698 he was Consistorial Councillor to Anna Dorothea, Abbess of Quedlinburg and was also involved in theological affairs in Berlin. In Hamburg Mayer had advanced to the status of an important champion of Lutheran orthodoxy. Following the death of , Charles XII of Sweden, on 11 May 1701, offered Mayer Rango's post of General Superintendent of Swedish Pomerania, a position which he which he took up on 12 August. By virtue of this office he was professor of the Theological Faculty of the University of Greifswald, pastor and senior city minister at the collegiate church of St. Nicholas, Assistant Chancellor of the University, and Chairman of the Greifswald Consistory. Aided by his already voluminous library and art collection, Mayer developed extensive activity as an author in Greifswald. Mayer played an active role in the organizational work at the University and was its rector in 1701 and 1705. He concerned himself with the history of Pomerania and intended to establish a learned society. However, the events of the Great Northern War intervened. Despite his loyalty to his Swedish master, after the entry of the enemy army on 25 January 1712, he was supposed to hold a prayer service for Peter the Great and Augustus II the Strong in St. Nicholas's church, where he was supposed to pray for the permanent expulsion of his Swedish employer. This caused him such agitation that he suffered a stroke. Because of this he resigned all his offices and went to Stettin, where he died of a further stroke. On 29 May 1673 J. F. Mayer married Catharina Sabina Welsch, the daughter of Gottfried Welsch, a Leipzig Professor of Medicine. His son Johann Abraham Mayer later became a Professor of Medicine in Greifswald. The marriage was dissolved in 1686. Johann Friedrich Mayer died 30 March 1712 in Stettin. Importance As a strictly orthodox Lutheran, Mayer brooked no deviations from prescribed beliefs and, even during this period of late Orthodoxy, insisted on the sole validity of Lutheran orthodoxy. He did not realize that this obduracy deprived orthodoxy of its legitimation. It was this rigid attitude that enabled the currents of Rationalism and early Enlightenment to develop, which could not have been his intention. Book and Art Collections Mayer built up a large book and art collection. He had one of the largest private libraries of the early 18th century. His art collection included a synagogue scene, a large collection of medals and a large number of pictures, including Cranach's portraits of the Protestant Reformers of Wittenberg. In 1694, Mayer was given an eight-voice residence organ by the organ builder Arp Schnitger, and he took this with him when he moved to Greifswald. After his death, his library was sold at auction. Most of the pictures remained in the family's possession until they were auctioned at the end of the 18th century. A copy of a Rubens painting from Mayer's collection now hangs in the church of Neuenkirchen. In 1742, the organ was installed in the Gutskapelle Deyersdorf; the box and two original registers by Arp Schnitger are still intact.

It was originally published for the Nintendo 3DS in Japan as Senran Kagura: Skirting Shadows in 2011; an expanded \\"director's cut\\" version was released in 2012, and received Western releases in 2013‚Äì2014. A remake, Senran Kagura Burst Re:Newal, was released for the PlayStation 4 in 2018. Gameplay left Senran Kagura is a side- scrolling \\"beat-'em-up\\" action game. The player assumes control of one of five female ninjas. The more the game characters are damaged by enemies, the more their clothes are torn off. The information for each character's back story, major plot points, and general information on the universe of Senran Kagura is displayed in what is called the \\"novel\\", and is structured similarly to a visual novel. The novel is introduced at major plot points in the game story. The main gameplay consists of battling through the world of the story. As the game progresses, the player's character levels up and gains new moves and abilities, and in-game content such as art work, achievements, music, costumes (of which there are 180), and new characters are unlocked. The game is split into 5 chapters, with each chapter containing a number of main missions as well as optional missions. Once a story mission is complete, the mission can be played again with any of the unlocked characters. At the end of a mission the player is graded according to the player character's health, attack, and speed in completing the mission. Burst has two different routes to play through, instead of the one of the original. Plot Kept secret from the rest of the world, high school girls are secretly trained in the art of ninjitsu. Senran Kagura: Skirting Shadows revolves around the trainee shinobi of Hanz≈ç Academy; Asuka, Ikaruga, Katsuragi, Yagyuu and Hibari, as they complete missions and battle against rival ninjas. Crimson Girls on the other hand follows the students of the dark academy, Hebijo Clandestine Girls' Academy; Homura, Yomi, Hikage, Mirai and Haruka. Senran Kagura Burst includes an additional story, The Crimson Girls. Development Producer Kenichiro Takaki's original inspiration for Senran Kagura was from a desire to create something that was very easy to understand but also very deep and detailed for those who appreciate beautiful female characters.https://waypoint.vice.com/en_us/article/the-designer-behind-senran- kagura-explains-why-his-games-are-full-of-barely-clothed-women He had the idea for the game in April 2010 when he decided to develop a game for the then newly announced Nintendo 3DS. When thinking about what type of game to make for a 3D handheld, he decided that one of the things people most wanted to see in 3D were breasts. He began making Senran Kagura design document, and created a budget, characters, a plot and decided upon gameplay elements, after which he met with character designer Nan Yaegashi and scenario writer Yukinori Kitajima. The games feature character designs by Nan Yaegashi and scenario work from Yukinori Kitajima. The game was originally released in Japan for the Nintendo 3DS on September 22, 2011, as Skirting Shadows.https://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&a;=page_h_title&title;_id=20860 Senran Kagura Burst, an expanded director's cut versionhttps://gematsu.com/2018/04/senran-kagura-burst-renewal-coming-west- ps4-pc-fall containing both the Skirting Shadows story and a new story titled The Crimson Girls,http://www.siliconera.com/2013/11/08/senran-kagura-burst- will-north-america-next-week/ was published on August 30, 2012 in Japan,https://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&a;=page_h_title&title;_id=27113 and digitally through the Nintendo eShop on November 22, 2013 in North America by Xseed.

Zen United also released a European limited edition of the game on the same day, titled \\"Life & Hometown Edition\\", which includes a t-shirt and a lenticular poster.http://www.siliconera.com/2014/02/13/senran-kagura-burst-gets-life- hometown-edition-europe/ Ken Berry of North American publisher Marvelous USA stated in early May 2013 that they had considered releasing Senran Kagura Burst digitally outside Japan, but that it was a \\"scary proposition due to the subject matter and difference in attitudes between Japanese culture and the more conservative culture ... in the U.S.\\" On August 6, 2013, Xseed Games officially announced it would release the game digitally via the Nintendo eShop in Fall 2013. Reception Senran Kagura was met by a wide range of reviews, from negative to positive. Multiplayer.it appreciated the story and combat, as well as the many quests and secrets that were available to unlock, but took issue with the variable framerate and the repetitive gameplay. Metro criticised the game as sexist, but admitted the characters were a \\"likeable bunch\\". It also described the gameplay as \\"unbearably bad\\", but did appreciate the variety that the different player characters provided. GameZone's Mike Splechta gave the game a 7.5/10, stating that if one liked \\"[their] anime chicks badass with a healthy dose of jiggle physics, Senran Kagura Burst satisfies on those levels\\" but warned that there were \\"painful framerate dips\\". Gamestyle characterised both the visuals and dialogue as \\"creepy\\", but stated that the game was a \\"solid, if basic, side scrolling beat em up\\". Pocket Gamer described the game as \\"an unabashed, tongue-in-cheek romp that will have you smiling and button-mashing from start to finish\\". Hardcore Gamer appreciated the game's combat, customization options, and \\"wealth of unlockables and content\\", but warned those who would not appreciate the sexualisation of the game characters to stay away. The PC version of the remake was among the best-selling new releases of the month on Steam.

K. G. Saur Verlag GmbH & Company, p. 824 who is considered one of the most important writers on agriculture of his time. He came to prominence through his efforts to promote agricultural reforms, especially with his 1769 publication with new regimes of crop rotation,G√ºnter Rudolf Golde (1975) Catholics and Protestants: agricultural modernization in two German villages. p. 15 and his 1773 textbook on rural householders and husbandry.Thomas Robisheaux (2002) Rural Society and the Search for Order in Early Modern Germany. p. 254.  Biography  Bad Mergentheim Marktplatz. Mayer was born in Bad Mergentheim as son of an innkeeper and Schulthei√ü, the head of a municipality. His parents prepared him to become a minister at early age. He attended the Latin School in Weikersheim and the high school in √ñhringen. From 1737 to 1740 he took his theological studies at the University of Jena, where he was influenced by the philosopher Christian Wolff and the Swiss anatomist, physiologist and naturalist Albrecht von Haller. From 1741 to 1745 Mayer was Protestant pastor in Riedbach, which ended up in a legal dispute about defamation.\\"Urteil in Sachen des Pfarrers Mayer zu Riedbach contra einige der Gemeid zu Syndringen.

Martii 1745 online at books.google.com In 1745 he moved to Kupferzell, near Crailsheim, where he was pastor until his death in 1798. There in the garden of his clergy house, Mayer conducted agricultural experiments and observed farm work on nearby farms. In 1768 he published his findings for the first time in his book, entitled Lehre vom Gyps als vorzueglich guten Dung zu allen Erd-Gewaechsen auf Aeckern und Wiesen, Hopfen- und Weinbergen (Doctrine of Gypsum exquisitely as good manure to all natural plants to the fields and meadows, hops and vineyards). In this work he promoted the use of crushed gypsum as fertilization of fields, which he had found in the nearby Waldenburg Hills. He further explained these operations in the 1774 publication M. Terentius Varro, von der Landwirtschaft. The agronomists of his time where so impressed by his work, that they granted him the title \\"Gipsapostel von Kupferzell\\" (Apostle of gypsum from Kupferzell). In other writings, Mayer started describing the farmer relationships in natural farming and animal husbandry. In 1767 he started publishing the journal Beytr√§ge und Abhandlungen zur Aufnahme der Land- und Hauswirthschaft, which he would publish until 1786. In addition to spreading his knowledge through books and magazines, Mayer traveled around and advised princes and peasants. He was invited to move to Vienna, both by Emperor Maria Theresia and Archbishop Christoph Anton Migazzi, but he declined. He advised the Hohenlohe peasants among other things about the cultivation of the still unknown potato. At first he only recommended the potato to feed livestock, and later mainly for human consumption.  Work  Map of the Hohenlohe, Lehrbuch f√ºr die Land- und Hau√üwirthe, Plate I, 1773 Plate III, 1773-82. Plate VI, 1773-82. Design for farmhouse, Plate VII, 1773. Mayer is considered the most influential agricultural reformers of the late 18th Century through his many writings, in which he promoted sustainable agricultural reforms such as the use of fertilizer, new crops as potatoes, new ways of crop rotation, sophisticated agricultural devices, and advanced management methods. He also advocated free property for peasants. In the 18th Century the pressure upon agriculture had increased to feed the steady growing population, and Mayer was one of the driving forces to make this happen.\\"Lokale Geschichte aus der Zeit von 1760 - 1800\\" at heinlenews.de, accessed March 3, 2014. = Works = Mayer gained attention with his 1768 work Lehre vom Gyps als vorzueglich guten Dung zu allen Erd-Gewaechsen auf Aeckern und Wiesen, Hopfen- und Weinbergen, which promoted the use of crushed gypsum as fertilization of fields. This work also suggested new ways of crop rotation, which broke with the traditional medieval three-field systemA. G. Roeber (1998) Palatines, Liberty, and Property: : German Lutherans in Colonial British America. p. 58 from around the time of Charlemagne. The 1773 textbook on husbandry, entitled Lehrbuch f√ºr die Land- und Hau√üwirthe in der pragmatischen Geschichte der gesamten Land- und Hau√üwirthschafft des Hohenlohe Schillingsf√ºrstischen Amtes Kupferzell, described the agriculture and other customs in the Hohenlohe region of the Germany.Rosemary Lynn Hopcroft (1999) Regions, Institutions, and Agrarian Change in European History. p. 3 Mayer among others presented plans for a new farm house, the so-called \\"Pfarrer-Mayer-H√§user\\", in which the rural residential area and the barn were under one roof. The barn, located on the ground floor, would heat the living room on the first floor. The introduction of fodder and the growing of cider apples in specific German regions date back to Mayer's ideas. For better use of land Mayer suggested the farmers to plant fallow land with clover. Thereby farmers gained additional fodder, which Mayer recommended to use in the stabling of cattle. A desirable side effect of stabling was the increased accumulation of manure that could be used as fertilizer on fields. Also thanks to Mayer's proposals the cattle were sold in Hohenlohe and were profitable for the farmers. The slaughter was sold to France, especially Paris. The improved three-field system, which is still the basis for the agricultural processing, also goes back to Pastor Mayer. = Valuable fossil as a manure = The 1804 Repertory of arts, manufactures and agriculture Richard Weston reports that \\"New manure appearing as an uncommon phenomenon in the Annals of Agriculture, it cannot be an uninteresting matter to disperse the knowledge of its valuable qualities, and how it came to be known, especially as it is now making a rapid progress into every enlightened country where the farmers are not above being taught from the ingenuity, labour, and researches of others, and of all the modern improvements in agriculture no one appears to be of greater consequence...\\"Richard Weston \\"Observations on Alabaster or Gypsum as a Manure\\" in: Repertory of arts, manufactures and agriculture 1804. p. 420-6 The general description, Weston gave, started with: :Description of the best Sort, and Method of proving its Quality. :From the experiments made in America, it is found, that that which is produced near the surface of the ground has not the qualities necessary for vegetation in so powerful a manner as that which is dug deeper, on account of the sun, frosts, and atmosphere weakening its virtues, and that the lumps composed of flat shining specula are preferred to those which are formed of round particle* like sand; but that all kinds of gypsum, however different in exterior form or appearance, have a perfect resemblance in their chemical and essential qualities. To try its quality, some should be pulverized very fine; then put dry into an iron pot placed on the fire, and if it be good it will soon boil, and great quantities of the fixed air will escape by ebullition. :Method of preparing it. :The usual method of preparing it is, by first stamping it in a stamping- mill, and then grinding it in a common grist-mill; but the finer it is ground it is so much the better, nor must it be calcined, and the fresher from the quarry the qualities will be the stronger. If you have not a stamping-mill break it with a large hammer, and then sift or grind it. :The Marnier, Quantity, and Time of sowing it. :The method of putting it on the land is sowing it in the broad-cast manner, as you sow corn, and the only Care necessary is to make the distribution as equal as possible. A day inclining to rain is to be preferred for sowing it; but if the weather be very dry it ought to be moistened before it is sown, to prevent it from blowing away, and the distribution being unequal. From a variety of experiments already made, from six to eight bushels to an acre seem to be the most approved quantity for grass or clover; but when only half of the quantity has been used, its effects have been very visible, and more productive by three tons to an acre than some of the same land left unplastered. One farmer mentions that he used nine bushels... Weston further explains about experiments on various soils, its effects on grasslands, and a comparison between dung and plaster. He ends up describing the experiments with fossil as a manure has had on barley and clover, buckwheat, cabbages and turnips, clover alone, Indian corn, rye and wheat. Weston explicitly mentioned, that \\"it is to the indefatigable researches of Mr. Mayer, a German clergyman, that we are indebted for this valuable fossil as a manure; but where his residence is I have not yet been able to discover, nor have seen any of his .writings concerning it. In the year 1768 he first discovered its virtues as a manure, and its reputation soon caused it to be tried in various parts of Germany. Thence its fame spread to Switzerland and France. Near to Paris are several hills of it, named Montmartre, whence the Americans transported it to their country, and its reputation soon spread it through that continent, even to Quebec. As a proof of which, I have taken an account of the following experiments, from a book printed in that city, in French and English, but first published in various periodical works in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, &c.; and from these American publications it was introduced into England, after having made a circuit of nearly ten thousand miles.\\"  Legacy  Johann Friedrich Mayer was the first to present to the public a series of experiments upon it the relation of gypsum to agriculture, and many chemists have followed him in the 19th century. Early 19th century however a great variety of opinion remained with regard to its mode of operation, for example:John Armstrong, Jesse Buel. A Treatise on Agriculture, The Present Condition of the Art Abroad and at Home, and the Theory and Practice of Husbandry. To which is Added, a Dissertation on the Kitchen and Fruit Garden. 1840. p. 45. * The French agronomist Victor Yvart (1763-1831)SeeVictor Yvart at the French Wikipedia believed that the action of gypsum is exclusively the effect of the sulphuric acid, which enters into its composition; and founds this opinion upon the fact that the ashes of turf, which contain sulphate of iron and sulphate of alumina, have the same action upon vegetation as gypsum. * The French agronomist Charles Philibert de Lasteyrie (1759-1849), observing that plants whose roots were nearest the surface of the soil were most acted upon by plaster, concludes that gypsum takes from the atmosphere the elements of vegetable life, and transmits them directly to plants. * Louis Augustin Guillaume Bosc intimates that the septic quality of gypsum (which he takes for granted) best explains its action on vegetation; but this opinion is subverted by the experiments of Davy. * Humphry Davy found that, of two parcels of minced veal, the one mixed with gypsum, the other left by itself, and both exposed to the action of the sun, the latter was the first to exhibit symptoms of putrefaction. Davy's own belief on this subject is, that it makes part of the food of vegetables, is received into the plant, and combined with it. Davy postulated the idea of atmospheric carbon, which was dismissed by Albrecht Daniel Thaer, who postulated instead his \\"humus theory.\\"G. Terry Sharrer (2002) A Kind of Fate: Agricultural Change in Virginia, 1861-1920. p. 41 After being applied with success by Mayer in the year 1763, Gypsum soon came into general use, not only in Germany, but in France, America, Switzerland, and other countries. Sutton Thomas Wood of Oxford (1807) acknowledged, that it was cheaper than dung composts, much more convenient for carriage, and may be attained, where dung cannot be had. Its value cannot easily be ascertained, as there are few soils that will not be benefited by its application. It renews and invigorates those lands which have been exhausted by neglect and improper management, and it wonderfully improves some stubborn clays.Sutton Thomas Wood. A Treatise on Gypsum, on Its Various Uses, and on Its Application, as a Manure. F.C. and J. Rivington, 1807. p. 16-17 Another lasting contribution was Mayer's farmhouse design, presented in his 1773 textbook on agriculture and husbandry. This design; known as the so-called \\"Pfarrer-Mayer-H√§user\\", became quite popular not only in the area of Hohenlohe, but in larger parts of Germany.Peter Schiffer.

Verein f√ºr W√ºrttembergisch Franken, 2003. p. 288 Mayer is considered among the most important agricultural reformer of the late 18th century. To socially improve the situation of the rural population, Mayer advised his readers not just about to changing agricultural methods, but he was strongly committed and an outspoken advocate for change in the agrarian structure. He called for the abolition of forced labor and inveighs against hunting and pasture justices of the lord. The range of subjects treated by him is great from topics classified under the purely agricultural engineering to cultivation, fertilization, harvesting, livestock, etc. But he, again and again, focussed his writings on social ethical and diaconal questions of his town, and openly criticized that rural life would be better served with dutiful authorities and philanthropic landowner.Rolf Becker, in: Kr√ºger (ed.): Gottes Offenbarung in der Welt, 1998. pp. 78-88 Selected publications * Johann F.

It was first described and named by William Lucas Distant in 1899 in the Annals and Magazine of Natural History. Insecta transvaaliensia was self-published by Distant and appeared in twelve parts over the period 1900-1911. The series was an account of Distant's insect-collecting trips through the Transvaal. The collected parts were published as a single volume after Distant's death by Francis Edwards of London in 1924. Specimens of this species were collected in 1906 and then not found again in the field until 2001 \\"when small, localised populations were discovered during a faunal survey for the Environmental Management Programme Report for the Anglo Platinum Der Brochen Platinum project in the Groot Dwars River valley, Mpumalanga.\\" - Platypleura sylvia As a result a behavioural study was carried out in the Groot Dwars River valley in 2001 and 2002, during which researchers found that the adult life stage of the insect lasted six to eight weeks during the months of November and December, and that its distribution is extremely localised and confined to a number of valleys in Sekhukhuneland. This cicada is found in closed bushveld that includes the tree Vitex obovata, a member of the Verbenaceae, a tree also endemic to South Africa and Swaziland, and with which it has a close and exclusive relationship. A number of cicadas have evolved this affinity for a single species of tree. Researchers observed a female drilling holes in a dry twig and depositing her eggs. Males spread their wings and arch their backs when calling, a posture which is believed to amplify their call, best described as \\"zeep\\". Cicada nymphs were found down to below the soil surface attached to the roots of Vitex obovata and exuviae were found above ground on trees of the same species housing calling adults, and on other plant species when no adults were present. The duration of the larval stage is as yet undetermined, but is thought to be something of the order of six or seven years underground. P. sylvia is confined to the valley of the Groot Dwars River (24¬∞55‚Ä≤ S, 30¬∞05‚Ä≤ E), a tributary of the Steelpoort River, and occurs on the farms Helena, Der Brochen, Mareesburg and also the Didingwe River Lodge property, with a slight spill-over to neighbouring areas. The species' tragedy is its occurrence on geological formations rich in platinum. The area is actively mined by the Anglo American Platinum Corporation committed to \\"minimising its environmental impact at this operation by implementing best practice in land and environmental management\\".Sustainable Development ReportInsecta transvaaliensia - W.

It is similar to, and was inspired by, the China Girls Mathematical Olympiad. The European Girls' Mathematical Olympiad (Egmo) is an annual competition of 6 mathematical problems, for a maximum score of 7 points each, and the maximum total value of 42 points, organized in Europe for high school students, up to 20 years old, from 2012. The competition was born on the model of the China Girls' Mathematical Olympiad, to which not only teams of Chinese girls participate, but also teams from other countries. The first edition was held in Cambridge, UK, the second in Luxembourg. The third in 2014 was held in Antalya, in Turkey. 19 editions of 22 European countries took part in the editions carried out so far, for a total of 70 and 87 competitors. In addition to the European teams, teams from the US and Saudi Arabia were also invited. The competitors participate individually, even if the team is made up of four athletes. The selection process varies between countries, but it often involves the results obtained in the national Mathematical Olympiads and in other tests, which become progressively more selective. The best classified are awarded according to this criterion: * the first classified, for about 1/12 of the competitors receive a medal of gold * the following 1/6 of the general classification receive a silver medal * the subsequent 1/4 of the general classification receive a bronze medal * all those who have not received a medal but have scored the maximum points in at least one of the six problems receive an honorable mention.

He may have had only ¬£150 capital,Adlib Quarterly, No. 22 - November 1983 but he had years of experience as a sales representative in the furniture trade. Green had been in the business all his working life apart from a period spent flying during the war. His family had been in the furniture trade for generations, his grandfather having dealt in antique furniture a century earlier. Green had grown up in Nuneaton; he was proud to be an Old Edwardian having attended King Edward‚Äôs Grammar School in Nuneaton. Green chose Eastleigh because he felt at ease in a railway town, having grown up in Nuneaton, which was also a similar sized town. At first Peter sold beds in the daytime and delivered them in the evening, with his wife Norah acting as secretary and doing all the office work. He then added other furniture to his stock before later opening a small carpet shop at 54 High Street. The business grew steadily from these tiny beginnings until in 1966, with three branches,Green, now helped by his brother Reg as sales director, took a corner of huge premises in Southampton Road then occupied by the Fair Oak Dairy Company, and which had formerly been a brush factory . In Green‚Äôs first \\"Walk Around Showrooms\\" carpets and furniture were crammed into one building, the Mayor of Eastleigh came to open this important new store and the business grew steadily. Southampton Road The premises had a fascinating history as part of the town. The building had been erected in 1873 by the side of the London to Southampton railway line. At that time Eastleigh had not yet come into existence, amounting to little more than 90 houses, and the building housed the Bishopstoke Brewery. During the course of the two world wars, and by then occupied by the Fair Oak Dairy Company, the building played an important part in supplying dairy produce to military camps and installations over a wide area of Southern Command. The Bishopstoke Brewery had leased the quarter acre site for 100 years but over the next few years the brewery changed hands several times. After several changes of ownership the premises ceased to be used as a brewery. In 1886 at a cost of ¬£6,000 they were converted into a dog biscuit factory run by Dear & Co, a Millbrook firm. From 1889 however the premises lay empty until another biscuit manufacturer took the premises for a couple more years until 1895 following which the building served as a temporary school house used by the Eastleigh School Board. In the next few years the premises were also used by a dairy followed by a gear and engineering works. The longest period of occupation was from 1914 until 1966 after the building passed into the hands of the Fair Oak Dairy Produce Company owned by a London-based wholesale grocery company, managed by Mr. Johnson who also farmed at Foxhole Farm, Allington Lane, Fair Oak from where much of the dairy‚Äôs milk came. Gradually, after 1966, Green‚Äôs firm expanded into other parts of the building as they became vacant until, by 1973, the firm owned the entire freehold and was established as a pioneer of huge furniture and carpet showrooms with hundreds of rolls of broadloom carpet and vinyl, dozens of three piece suites, scores of beds, range after range of bedroom and dining room furniture and many pieces of occasional furniture. Later a special shop for curtains and dress fabrics was opened in the High Street. The whole building covered 20,000 square feet. The hall of 5,000 square feet taken over in 1966 would be used exclusively as a carpet showroom whilst the remaining 15,000 square feet would be used to display a huge collection of furniture in addition to a warehouse and workrooms. Besides offering a huge selection Peter Green was unusual in that he offered a complete service as well as keen prices. He could afford to give both owing to his low overheads as he owned the freehold and so avoided the high rents which had to be paid by similar stores and passed on to the customer. From the very start Peter Green was fully involved in the life of the town and did a great deal of charitable work, especially amongst the elderly and disabled and those down on their luck. It was hardly surprising in view of all his achievements that Peter was made the first and so far only non-political Freeman of the Borough for his contribution to the business and the charitable life of the community. In the mid 1970s Peter decided to improve his premises by stages. He began by planning a well designed showroom on the corner facing the town centre. Planning permission for this was granted in 1976 and building was about to commence when the town centre plan was introduced which stopped him from building. Peter Green was fond of Eastleigh. He saw it as a friendly red-brick town of character. He had created the largest non-food retail enterprise and was keen to see other durable stores come. He was also keen to see Eastleigh preserve its character and remain different from other towns. He had always advanced cautiously without borrowing huge sums and argued that the town should grow in the same way. When Peter Green died suddenly in 1980 his wife Norah became company chairman and Tim Maguire who joined the firm in 1972 became managing director. The company came through the recession which followed and by 1982 turnover had increased by a third, a sure sign that customers still liked the selection and trading methods at the company‚Äôs unique showrooms. Many changes were made; fitted kitchens and fitted bedrooms became big business and there was a thriving contract department which eventually served customers as far away as the Falkland Islands and Gambia. From small beginnings Peter Green had become one of the largest independent household furnishers in the South of England.Southern Evening Echo, Page 1, 19 April 1985 Turnover has risen 40 times since the move to Southampton Road but the old fashioned friendly service had remained unaltered. Chandlers Ford Plans had been announced in 1976 for an extensive covered shopping centre in Eastleigh. The Peter Green site was demanded by the council for the scheme but it was not viable for such a large business to operate from a shopping centre. At last, after eight years of uncertainty, a suitable building was found for the move. It was situated in School Lane, Chandlers Ford, a short distance from the old site and just off the main Bournemouth Road. In 1985 came the move from its long established base in Southampton Road and the grand opening of a giant new store in School Lane, Chandlers Ford presided over by chairman, Norah Green and managing director, Tim Maguire. The new premises were formerly owned by W H O‚ÄôGorman and were ideal as they offered a total floor area of 33,000 square feet and parking for 100 cars. The newly refurbished premises were easy to reach from all directions. Edge of town trading had many advantages at a time when it was becoming more and more common in Europe and the US to move stores away from town centres. Easy access and parking, lower overheads which lead to lower prices and better service were all things that Peter Green had believed in and built his business on. A noted feature of the new premises was the \\"Carousel\\" ‚Äì a coffee bar located in the centre of the showroom; like that at the previous store it soon became the meeting place for regular customers. Over 100 local families came to depend upon the thriving go ahead family business for a living. The staff would form a fine team built up over the years. They would be proud to serve the whole of Wessex from the Borough of Eastleigh for decades and looked forward to doing so indefinitely. Local footballer Manny Andruszewski worked for a time at the Chandler's Ford store too. Further expansion The company celebrated its 40 years in business in 1996 with a complete refurbishment of its Chandlers Ford store and also by opening a huge new store in Basingstoke. In the 2003 a further store was opened in Reading, and the company was the largest independent furniture retailer in the region.http://www.getreading.co.uk/business/s/2034746_new_look_for_peter_green On 8 January 2010, Norah Green died, peacefully at home, bringing the original partnership to a close. In 2011 the 'child in arms' at the opening of the first store, returned to the business and Wendy Martin, sole offspring of Peter and Norah became a Director of Peter Green. In 2010 a design studio was opened in the Reading store. In 2016 the Peter Green store commemorated 60 years of trading in Eastleigh. Events included an exhibition in Eastleigh Museum and participation in Borough celebrations.

The documentary is a follow-up of an episode in Madagascar, filmed in 1960, for Attenborough's earliest nature documentary series, Zoo Quest. In that episode, a native boy gave Attenborough a collection of large pieces of eggshell, which Attenborough temporarily pieced together with sticky tape to form a complete eggshell of the extinct elephant bird. The egg is the subject of the 2011 documentary, which is an hour long and premiered on 2 March 2011. The documentary explores the history of the elephant bird, what led to its extinction, and the role of conservation in preventing the extinction of critically endangered species. The extinction of the elephant bird is attributed to human activity. The birds were once widespread, but deforestation and the hunting of the bird's eggs led to the species' decline. Attenborough compares the factors that led to the extinction of the elephant bird with the threats facing critically endangered species in the present. Reception Attenborough and the Giant Egg was presented and written by David Attenborough John Walsh of The Independent praised the film, especially Attenborough's role as a presenter, calling it a \\"bitty but fascinating documentary.\\" Michael Deacon, a critic for The Daily Telegraph, wrote that the documentary demonstrated the \\"evolution of television presentation,\\" and commended Attenborough for his \\"rare and unteachable ability to speak as if addressing you alone, rather than an audience of millions.\\" Andrew Anthony of The Guardian was critical of the backstory of the documentary, writing that it exaggerated the mystery of the egg.

During the 1930s much of the woodland was felled. It was sold again in 1935 to Alfred Pease. During the Spanish Civil War, Ruth Pennyman of Ormesby Hall, contacted Alfred Pease to request the use of Hutton Hall to house Spanish nuns and Basque refugees. The first 20 children arrived on 1 July 1937. During World War II it was requisitioned by the military. In 1948, the hall, and the which remained of the estate, was sold to John Mathison. In 1985 it was sold to a property developer and has been converted into flats and executive housing. Architecture The two-storey red brick building has a stone dressings and slate roofs. The seven-bay south front has a slate canopy. On the east side is a conservatory which has internal arcade of arches on flute columns below a parapet.

This was the first release to feature new vocalist Vilhelm Bladin and the last release to feature founding member and third guitarist Jimmie √Ökerstr√∂m, before he was asked to leave the band in 2012. √Ökerstr√∂m was never replaced and thus left Vildhjarta without a third guitarist since his leaving. The album was a breakthrough success for the band and led to positive reviews and an expanded international fanbase. Track listing Reception The album received generally positive critical reviews. Natalie Zed of About.com gave the album 3.5/5 and said that \\"For fans of djent, this is definitely an album to pay attention to\\", describing the instrumentation as \\"dense as a forest of thorns, the songs are constructed in such a way that the listener has room to explore, to wander, and to eventually get lost and caught within the sound.\\" Nina Saeidi writing for Metal Injection was very positive about the album, and concluded that \\"M√•sstaden is stunningly beautiful and filled with a dark energy that is often hard to find in the copycat genre in which Vildhjarta are boundary pushers. This album is perfect for those in need of a fast and furious djent fix with the occasional unexpected interlude that will take you by surprise.\\" While Metal Underground were still on the whole positive about the album, they were critical that \\"for as good as the music is, Vildhjarta don't do much to step out of the shadow of their main inspiration, making comparisons to Meshuggah at times a bit too accurate\\", though they concluded the review by saying \\"‚ÄúMasstaden‚Äù is a good album from a new band that's more of a taste of what's to come, rather than a fully evolved sound.

Pierre Nobel, volume 1 R√©ception de l'Antiquit√©, Journ√©es d'√©tude du programme pluriformation Formes, langages et identit√©s dans les soci√©t√©s multiculturelles 2.1, Besan√ßon: Presses universitaires de Franche- Comt√©, 2004, , pp. 103-18, p. 104 It chronicles the life of Julius Caesar.The beginning of the text announces that there will be twelve books, dedicated to the twelve Caesars, from the birth of Julius Caesar to the death of Domitian; but the work as we have it ends with Caesar's death. Details It is primarily a compilation from the works of four Roman writers: Caesar himself, Lucan, Suetonius and Sallust.Catherine Croizy-Naquet, p. 105. It is the first biography wholly dedicated to the Roman leader in the vernacular;Spiegel, p. 118. the historical text also uses literary techniques borrowed from the romance or the chanson de geste. The anonymous compiler and translator sometimes borrowed the full texts of other works, such as Sallust's De coniuratione Catilinae or Caesar's Commentarii de Bello Gallico, for which the Faits are the first translations into French. He followed his Latin models step by step while constantly adapting the text to the civilisation of his time. In the case of the Commentarii de Bello Gallico, like other medieval writers he incorrectly attributes it not to Caesar himself but to a grammarian, Julius Celsus Constantinus.Croizy-Naquet, p. 110. In his account of the civil war, he followed not Caesar's work, but Lucan's epic poem Pharsalia. Unlike, for example, the author of the contemporary Histoire ancienne jusqu'√† C√©sar, he renders all the material in consistently styled prose.Croizy-Naquet, p. 112. Reception The Faits des Romains was the most popular of several contemporary Old French works of primarily Roman history; beginning in the 14th century, it was a popular manuscript commission,Jaroslav Folda, Crusader Art in the Holy Land, From the Third Crusade to the Fall of Acre, 1187-1291, Cambridge/New York: Cambridge University, 2005, , p. 429. and it remained popular until the end of the Middle Ages. The work was copied to more than fifty manuscripts, many illuminated.Ten illuminated manuscripts are in the holdings of the French National Library in Paris; the illustrations of three of them are reproduced in the library's Mandragore online database. Notably, around 1470, Jean Fouquet painted the miniatures of a now dismembered manuscript, of which five sheets are currently held in the Louvre.RF 4143, recto ; RF 5271, recto ; RF 29493, recto ; RF 29494, recto . The text was translated into Italian in the 13th century and into Portuguese in the 15th century, before 1466, as Vida e feitos di Julio Cesar.Maria Helena Mateus, ed., Vida e Feitos de J√∫lio C√©sar. Edi√ß√£o cr√≠tica da tradu√ß√£o portuguesa quatrocentista de 'Li fet des romains', Lisbon: Funda√ß√£o Calouste Gulbenkian, 1970, Medieval French authors who wrote about Caesar do not refer to the original Latin texts but to the Faits des Romains, and the text is thus the origin of Caesar's exceptional popularity in aristocratic circles throughout the Middle Ages. The author portrays Caesar in more or less medieval terms,Croizy-Naquet, p. 109. and focusses on the threat to liberty represented by his power, and on the fight of the Gauls under Vercingetorix for liberty from the Romans; he links the two by relating Caesar's fall to his conquest of Gaul; the text can thus be seen as an allegory of contemporary issues of the aristocratic struggle against the power of the crown.Spiegel, pp. 129, 144, 164-65, 151. Jeanette M. A. Beer in her book A Medieval Caesar criticizes the work for exaggerating the relationship between Caesar and the Mauretanian queen Euno√´, greatly expanding on their interactions than exist in historical records. She stated that Caesar is \\"transformed into a medieval chavillier\\" and that the author is clearly more interested in Caesars sexual dominance over the queen than the political dominance he held over her husband Bogud.Beer, Jeanette; A Medieval Caesar - page: 16 References Further reading * Louis-Fernand Flutre and Kornelis Sneyders de Vogel, ed.

Classification is intended to group together athletes with similar levels of physical ability to allow fair competition. Classification was created and is managed by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), which is regularly published via its IPC Athletics Classification Handbook. People with physical, vision and intellectual disabilities are eligible to compete in this sport at the Summer Paralympics. The classification for this sport was created during the 1940s and for much of its early history was a medical condition based classification system. The classification system has subsequently become a functional mobility based one, and is moving towards an evidence-based classification system. Each class has a code consisting of a letter and two digits, with the letter being either \\"T\\" or \\"F\\" (indicating track or field events) and the number representing the level of physical ability. The current IPC classifications for athletics can be grouped by impairment as follows: *T/F11‚Äì13 (visual impairment) *T/F20 (intellectual impairment) *T/F31‚Äì34 (wheelchair events for athletes with a movement disorder, including cerebral palsy) *T/F35‚Äì38 (ambulant events for athletes with a movement disorder, including cerebral palsy) *T/F40‚Äì41 (short stature, including dwarfism) *T/F42‚Äì44 (leg impairment, including amputees) *T/F45‚Äì47 (arm impairment, including amputees) *T/F51‚Äì57 (wheelchair events for athletes with a lower body impairment, including paraplegia) Definition Para-athletics classification at the Paralympic Games is the basis for determining who can compete in specific athletic sports, and within which class. It is used for the purposes of establishing fair competition. The general rules for para- athletics are based on rules intended for able-bodied competitors. The blind classifications are based on medical classification, not functional classification.

This plays a significant role in athletics races. Governance Classification is handled by the International Paralympic Committee, with classification spelled in the IPC Athletics Classification Handbook. While CP-ISRA has an interest in the sport because it is open to people with cerebral palsy, it is not governed by them. In 1983, the rules for this sport and approval for classification was done by the International Amateur Athletics Federation. At the 1992 Games, athletics classification was governed by four different sporting bodies including the IBSA, ISOD, ISMWSF and the CP-ISRA. Eligibility , people with physical, vision and intellectual disabilities are eligible to compete in this sport. History The classification for this sport was created during the 1940s and for much of its early history was a medical condition based classification system. An example of classification in this period was L2 SCI, which was for competitors who had normal functioning except for lower limb paralysis. These competitors would not compete in wheelchair races against double above the knee amputees because, while their functional disabilities were similar, their medical conditions were not. The first wheelchair races took place by 1952 at the Stoke Mandeville Hospital. By 1955, Germans had realised there was a need for classification in athletics event because it was systematically unfair to insist a double leg above the knee amputee compete against able bodied athletes in events like the shot put. In 1964, the International Sport Organization for the Disabled (ISOD) was created. They created the first formal classification system, which had 27 classes. This was reduced to 12 classes for the 1976 Summer Paralympics and was further reduced to nine classes for the 1992 Summer Paralympics. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the classification system, set up as a series of \\"handicaps\\", was seen as problematic because in an effort to clearly describe a disability and promote fairness, the number of classifications made the organisation of competitive events difficult. There were too few people in a classification to the point where an international event for people with disabilities said \\"1000 competitors = 1000 winners.\\" There were some exceptions to this in classes like double leg paralysis as a result of brain or spinal injury and single leg amputations. In 1983, classification for cerebral palsy competitors in this sport was done by the Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association (CP-ISRA). There were five cerebral palsy classifications. That year, 80 to 85% of all competitors with cerebral palsy competed in the same classification. There was separate classification for track events and field events. Class 2 competitors would compete in the 20 metre race using arm propulsion, 60 metre race using leg propulsion, 200 metre race using leg propulsion and the 3 x 60 metre shuttle relay event, which required 3 competitors from class 2 and 3 of which one had to be a class 2 competitor. In field events, competitors could compete in the medicine ball thrust, the kick ball event, the club throw event and the shot put. In 1983, Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association (CP-ISRA) set eligibility rules for classification. They defined cerebral palsy as a non-progressive brain lesion that results in impairment. People with cerebral palsy or non- progressive brain damage were eligible for classification by them. The organisation also dealt with classification for people with similar impairments. For their classification system, people with spina bifida were not eligible unless they had medical evidence of loco-motor dysfunction. People with cerebral palsy and epilepsy were eligible provided the condition did not interfere with their ability to compete. People who had strokes were eligible for classification following medical clearance. Competitors with multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy and arthrogryposis were not eligible for classification by CP-ISRA, but were eligible for classification by International Sports Organisation for the Disabled for the Games of Les Autres. During the 1980s, there were 8 classes for cerebral palsy competitors, 3 classes for competitors with visual impairments, 9 classes for competitors with ambulatory issues and six classes for Les Autres athletes. Intellectual disability athletics classifications existed by the 1984 within the context of the Special Olympics. In some cases, one intellectual disability class existed with events broken down by age in order to allow equal competition for runners. Some of these races were held in Canada and disability classes competed during able bodied events. Going into the 1992 Summer Paralympics, there was a push to move more towards a functional classification system by the International Coordinating Committee and the Technical Committee of the International Paralympic Committee. This came to a head at the November 1989 meeting of the Barcelona Olympics Organising Committee, when a discussion was started about what events and classifications should be eligible for the Games. A study by the organising committee and the Polytechnic University of Catalonia in the lead up to the meeting. It looked at the results for the 1984 and 1987 Stoke Mandeville Games, the 1984 New York Games, a 1985 Brussels competition, a 1985 Rome competition, a 1986 Puerto Rico competition, a 1987 Paris competition, the 1988 Seoul Games and a 1989 Nottingham competition. The study proposed a series of classes, based on the competitive results, for use in Barcelona. The local organising committee was insistent such a system be implemented to insure the sport at the Paralympic Games was serious and competitive, instead of recreational. The suggestions for classification were then implemented for sports such as swimming and athletics. During the late 1980s and early 1990s there was a movement away from medical classification and into functional classification systems. Following this, the 1992 Summer Paralympics had four wheelchair racing classifications, down from 7 at the 1988 Summer Paralympics. During the 1990s, there was a decision to try to fix athlete classification so that competitors could have more certainty in which classification they would compete in before attending an event. This was a big change as previously, athletes would be classified right before and during an event. In 1992, the International Paralympic Committee formally took control of governance for disability sport. The 1992 Games were the first ones where athletes of different types of disabilities competed against each other, athletes had a guaranteed right to appeal their classification. The wheelchair classifications were part of the 1994 Commonwealth Games. At the 1996 Summer Paralympics, there were 44 athletics classifications, 20 for track and 24 for field. The classifications covered four broad disability types. In 1997, there were four spinal injury related classifications for wheelchair track athletes. They were T1 for tetraplegics, T2 for competitors with partial mobility in their trunk and arms, T3 for competitors who had use of their trunk halfway down and good arms, and T4 for able-bodied athletes from the waist and things, which also included double amputees. A classification system from F1 to F7 existing at the time for wheelchair competitors in field events. A classification system also existed for blind athletes from B1 to B3. Going into the 2000 Summer Paralympics, there were concerns raised by members of the cerebral palsy community about the need to maintain a multiple functional classification system inside this sport specifically for this class of athletes given the large range of functional ability inside the community with cerebral palsy and other motor functional disabilities. Several classes in this sport were included in the 2002 Commonwealth Games. The new classification system made T1 equivalent to <C6 neurological impairment level and 1A for medical classification, T2 equivalent to CYB neurological impairment level, and 1B and 1C for medical classification, T3 equivalent to C7-T7 neurological impairment level, and 1c, 2 and 3 for medical classification, and T4 equivalent to T8-S2 neurological impairment level and 3, 4, 5 and 6 for medical classification. In 2005, athletics had fifty different races for the 100 metre race when gender and classification events were totaled. These include seven wheelchair classifications, six les autres classes, nine amputee classes, eight cerebral palsy classes, and three blinded classes. Because of issues in objectively identifying functionality that plagued the post Barcelona Games, the IPC unveiled plans to develop a new classification system in 2003. This classification system went into effect in 2007, and defined ten different disability types that were eligible to participate on the Paralympic level. It required that classification be sport specific, and served two roles. The first was that it determined eligibility to participate in the sport and that it created specific groups of sportspeople who were eligible to participate and in which class. The IPC left it up to International Federations to develop their own classification systems within this framework, with the specification that their classification systems use an evidence based approach developed through research. Functional classifications continued to be used in the 2010s. In 2010, the IPC announced that they would release a new IPC Athletics Classification handbook that specifically dealt with physical impairments. This classification guide would be put into effect following the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Paralympics. Athletes needed to be at least 18 years old to compete in the T40/F40 and T41/F41 classes. This was to prevent still growing children from competing in this class despite otherwise not having a disability. The debate about inclusion of competitors into able-bodied competitions was seen by some disability sport advocates like Horst Strokhkendl as a hindrance to the development of an independent classification system not based on the rules for able-bodied sport. Classes There are four classifications for wheelchair athletes with cerebral palsy and similar movement disorders: T31, T32, T33 and T34. There are also four classes for wheelchair athletes with other impairments, such as spinal cord injury. They include T51, T52, T53 and T54. The T54 classification currently in use is comparable to but broader than the early L2 SCI classification. Like L2 SCI, it includes competitors with normal functioning except for lower limb paralysis; unlike SCI L2, it also includes bilateral leg amputees. If a racer's abdominal muscles are paralysed, they may be classified as a T53. Events for wheelchair class athletes range from 100 metre races to the marathon. In athletics, bilateral below the elbow amputations have a minimal impact on functional ability to run distances. As a result, athletic classifications differ from swimming because of the differences in body use requirements impacting performance. Levels of classification There are levels of classification available: Provisional, National and International. The first is for athletes who do not have access to a full classification panel; it is a temporary indication of class, used only in lower levels of competition. The second can be used in all domestic competitions. To compete internationally, an International-level classification is required. At the Paralympic Games Wheelchair racing was one of the foundation sports at the original 1960 Summer Paralympics. Only wheelchair classified athletes were eligible to compete at the 1960 Summer Paralympics in Rome in this sport. This continued at the 1964 Summer Paralympics in Tokyo and 1968 Summer Paralympics in Tel Aviv. As demonstration sports, amputee and visually impaired classifications were allowed to compete in athletics for the first at time at 1972 Summer Paralympics. Competitors with cerebral palsy classifications were allowed to compete at the Paralympics for the first time at the 1984 Summer Paralympics. At the 1992 Summer Paralympics, all disability types were eligible to participate, with classification being run through all the major classifying bodies, with classification being done based on disability type. General and functional classification took place in the Paralympic Village in block 2 from 29 to 31 August. At the 1996 Paralympic Games, on the spot classification required sporting equipment available for classifiers to use to assess field competitors' classification. At the 1996 Summer Paralympics, classification was important because if on the spot classifications resulted in changes to a competitor's classification, it impacted the competition schedule. Consequently, on the spot classification or re-classification, was viewed as a negative aspect for these Games and the Paralympic movement overall. At the 2000 Summer Paralympics, 215 assessments were conducted at the Games. This resulted in 30 class changes. 3 of these were protested by a national Paralympic committee and 9 by PNS. 8 of these were upheld and 4 were denied. There were 28 classification appeals lodged for athletics at the 2000 Summer Paralympics involving 18 athletes which resulted in 10 class changes. For the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, the International Paralympic Committee had a zero classification at the Games policy. This policy was put into place in 2014, with the goal of avoiding last minute changes in classes that would negatively impact athlete training preparations. All competitors needed to be internationally classified with their classification status confirmed prior to the Games, with exceptions to this policy being dealt with on a case by case basis. In case there was a need for classification or reclassification at the Games despite best efforts otherwise, athletics classification was scheduled for September 4 and September 5 at Olympic Stadium. For sportspeople with physical or intellectual disabilities going through classification or reclassification in Rio, their in competition observation event is their first appearance in competition at the Games. Future Disability sport's major classification body, the International Paralympic Committee, is working on improving classification to be more of an evidence-based system as opposed to a performance based system so as not to punish elite athletes whose performance makes them appear in a higher class alongside competitors who train less.

The classes are prefixed with \\"S\\" for freestyle, butterfly and backstroke events, \\"SB\\" for breaststroke and \\"SM\\" for individual medley events. Swimmers with physical disabilities are divided into ten classes based on their degree of functional disability. Those with visual impairments are placed in three additional classes: S11, S12 and S13. One more class, S14, is reserved for swimmers with intellectual disabilities. A final class, S15, is for athletes with hearing loss. Swimming was one of the first organised sports for people with disabilities, and was contested at the first Summer Paralympics in 1960. Both the rules for the sport and approval of classifications were the responsibility of the F√©d√©ration International de Natation Amateur (FINA) until 1992, when the International Paralympic Committee took over the governance of classification. As of 2012, people with visual, physical and intellectual disabilities are eligible to compete in the sport. The classification system was originally based on medical criteria, but has since moved to one largely based on functional disability to make para-swimming more competitive. The sport is moving towards an evidence-based classification system. Definition Para-swimming classification is based on a system in which functional criteria are assessed. Athletes who have different physical disabilities may compete in the same class so long as their functional impairments are similar. In swimming, amputations of the arms below the elbow have a significant impact on functional ability. As a result, swimming classifications differ from athletics classifications. Swimmers are divided into ten classes based on degree of functional disability: S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, S9 and S10. The most severely affected are in class S1; these swimmers normally use wheelchairs outside of the pool. Classes are prefixed with the letter \\"S\\" for freestyle, butterfly and backstroke events, while those prefixed with \\"SB\\" are for breaststroke, and those with \\"SM\\" for individual medley events. This is because different strokes require the use of different muscle groups. In the case of the breaststroke, for example, the hand and the hip play a crucial role. Because of this, a swimmer may compete in one class for one stroke and a different class for another. It also means that swimmers with cerebral palsy, spinal cord injuries and limb deficiencies may compete against each other. For the individual medley, the class assigned is the mean average of the classes assigned for each individual stroke (rounded to the nearest whole number with .5 rounding up). There are three additional classes, S11, S12 and S13, for visually impaired swimmers. The lower number indicates a greater degree of impairment: class S11 swimmers are blind or nearly blind, and compete in blacked-out goggles. They each have a \\"tapper\\" who uses a pole or \\"bonker\\" to warn the swimmer that they are approaching the end of the pool. The visual classifications are based on medical classification, and not on functional mobility. One more class, S14, is for intellectually disabled swimmers. This class was not contested at the 2004 and the 2008 Summer Paralympics after the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) dropped all intellectual disability events following the basketball ID controversy at the 2000 Summer Paralympics, but was restored for the 2012 Summer Paralympics. The general rules for Paralympic swimming are based on those intended for able-bodied competitors. The rules regarding strokes, turns and the length of time that swimmers may remain under water are similar to those for the Olympic Games. Events take place in a standard 50m pool. Swimmers may dive in or start in the water. Swimmers may not use any assistive technology while competing. A final class, S15, is for athletes with hearing loss. =Gallery= File:Wheelchair_rugby_profile_classification_C5.svgVisualisation of functional mobility for a S1 competitor File:Wheelchair_rugby_profile_classification_C5-6.svgVisualisation of functional mobility for a S2 competitor File:B1 class.pngVisualisation of functional vision for a S11 competitor File:B2 class.pngVisualisation of functional vision for a S12 competitor File:B3 class.pngVisualisation of functional vision for a S13 competitor File:S15 class.pngVisualisation of functional hearing for a S15 competitor Governance Swimming was one of the eight sports contested in the first Paralympics, the 1960 Summer Paralympics in Rome. Both the rules for the sport and for the approval of swimmers' classifications were set by the F√©d√©ration International de Natation Amateur (FINA). In 1992, the IPC formally became the governing body for disability swimming. Four different sporting bodies, the International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA), International Sports Federation of the Disabled (ISOD), International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports Federation (ISMWSF) and the Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association (CP-ISRA), assisted the IPC in governing swimming at the 1992 Summer Paralympics. The IPC Classification Code and IPC Swimming govern the classification process. Classification of swimmers is performed by classifiers that are recognised by the IPC. History The original ISMGF classification system used at early Paralympic Games The earliest classification system for para-swimming was created during the 1940s. At this time, swimmers were classified based on their medical conditions. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the classification system was set up as a series of \\"handicaps\\". In an effort to clearly describe disabilities and promote fairness, the number of classifications ballooned. This made organizing competitive events difficult as there were too few people in each classification; international events for people with disabilities were said to have as many winners as competitors. At the 1988 Summer Paralympics in Seoul, the number of eligible classes was so great that 60 gold medals were awarded in one swimming event. During the 1960s and 1970s, classification involved being examined in a supine position on an examination table, where multiple medical classifiers would often stand around the player, poke and prod their muscles with their hands and with pins. The system had no built-in privacy safeguards and players being classified were not ensured privacy during medical classification nor with their medical records. During the 1960s and 1970s, ISMGF classification cheating occurred in both swimming and wheelchair basketball. Some of the medical classifications appeared arbitrary, with people of different functional levels being put into the same class. This made the results for many games and swimming races appear to be completely arbitrary. Impacted sportspeople were starting to demand that changes be made to address this. In 1974, the Disabled of the German State of North Rhine-Westphalia (BSNW) developed a swimming classification system that stayed in use until 1982. This system had seven classifications. There was a CP class for athletes with hemispasticity who would also compete in the same class against competitors who were single arm above the elbow amputees, had double-arm dysmelia type ectromelia, had single arm paralysis or had a fixed shoulder joint. There was an intellectual disability class called Class J, and a Class H for people with severe disabilities. BSNW classification events included swimming races from 50 to 1500 metres. The system was later expanded to include nine classes before it was discontinued. The BSNW system did not gain international support, and only was used inside Germany. It was discarded because of a need to have athletes classified for international competitions. In 1983, classification for swimmers with cerebral palsy was governed by CP- ISRA. There were five cerebral palsy classifications. Class 1 competitors could compete in the 25 metre freestyle event with flotation devices with or without flotation devices. Class 2 competitors could compete in the same events, but only against class 2 competitors. That year, 80 to 85 per cent of all competitors with cerebral palsy competed in the same classification in international competitions. Classification for swimming relied on a points system to assess the severity of physical disability without considering athlete functionality specifically as it applied to the ability to swim a particular stroke. This caused problems because certain types of disability had a greater negative impact on swimming than others, and the point system did not directly address functional ability. To address this, in 1990 point consideration was eliminated for disability types that did not impact performance. The IPC decided to reduce the number of classifications, and to try to fix classification so that competitors could have more certainty in which classification they would compete in before attending an event. This was a major change, as previously, athletes would be classified immediately before, and even during, an event. As a result, the number of swimming classifications dropped from 31 at Seoul in 1988 to 10 at the 1992 Summer Paralympics in Barcelona. Going into the 1992 Summer Paralympics, the International Coordinating Committee and the Technical Committee of the IPC push for a move towards a functional classification system. This came to a head at the November 1989 meeting of the Barcelona Olympics Organising Committee (Comite Organitzador Olimpic Barcelona - COOB), when a discussion started about what events and classifications should be eligible for the Games. A study by the organising committee and the Polytechnic University of Catalonia in the lead-up to the meeting looked at the results of recent international competitions. It proposed a series of classes, based on the competitive results, for use in Barcelona. COOB insisted that such a system be implemented to ensure the sport at the Paralympic Games was serious and competitive, instead of recreational. The suggestions were implemented for sports such as swimming and athletics. The Games were the first ones where swimmers of different types of disabilities competed against each other, swimmers had a guaranteed right to appeal their classification. The move to functional classification coincided with the rise of sports science. The first detailed international swimming sport science project was conducted at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. This was followed by a similar project at the 1992 Summer Paralympics in Barcelona. These studies provided an increasingly detailed understanding of the factors involved in high performance swimming. Henceforth sports science became the driver of both performance and classification. Ahead of the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney, changes were made in classification for the breaststroke, bringing the total number of functional classifications down from ten that had competed in Atlantathe to nine. Swimmers who had been classified as SB10 at the 1996 Summer Paralympics in Atlanta opted not to compete in Sydney. Several former SB8 and SB9 swimmers moved down a class to compete, and made the finals in their classifications. The IPC's Olympian aspiration to become an premier elite international sporting competition still fell short. In Sydney, 561 gold medals were awarded in 18 sports, compared with 300 in 28 sports at the 2000 Summer Olympics. Classification process During the classification process, classifiers evaluate factors including whether a swimmer's physical limitations require him or her to start in the water, and how the swimmer enters the water in competition. A two-person panel that includes at least one person with a medical background handles classification at international competitions. Classifiers are required to be familiar with the type of disability they are classifying, whether physical, visual or intellectual. Classification by national sports bodies mirrors the international classification process, conducted by nationally recognised IPC classifiers. For Australian competitors, for example, classification is managed by the national sport federation, Swimming Australia, with support from the Australian Paralympic Committee. There are three types of classification available for Australian competitors: provisional, national and international. The first is for club- level competitions, the second for state and national competitions, and the third for international competitions. Internationally, all classification is handled in English but athletes are allowed to have an interpreter present during the process. Swimmers are required to disclose any medications they regularly use, and provide detailed records of their medical history if a classifier deems them relevant. They are allowed to have someone familiar with their swimming limitations present during the process. The process includes a physical assessment, observation assessment, and a functional assessment that may include performance in the pool. Swimmers with visual impairment do not require the functional and observational components of assessment. If a swimmer intentionally misrepresents his or her disability, he or she is barred from the classification process for a minimum of two years, and is unable to compete. If swimmers do not agree with their classifications, they can appeal through the IPC Board of Appeal on Classification, which is the body recognised by IPC Swimming. Formal processes exist for how to do this in both non-competition and competition periods. Classification assessment took roughly 30 to 45 minutes at the 1996 Summer Paralympics. Classification for blind swimmers only lasted about 15 minutes. Classification at the Paralympics All disability types were eligible to participate at the 1992 Summer Paralympics. The IPC oversaw classification based on functional disability. General and functional classification took place in the Paralympic Village, with functional swimming classification taking place on the same dates at the Piscines Bernat Picronell. The process became a contentious issue at the Paralympics because of on-the-spot reclassifications that resulted in changes to the competition schedule. On-the-spot classification or re- classification was viewed as a negative aspect of the 1996 Summer Paralympics, and the Paralympic movement overall. At the 2000 Summer Paralympics, 54 assessments were conducted, resulting in 13 class changes. There was one Paralympic New Status (PNS) protest and two Paralympic Permanent Status (PPS) protests by a national Paralympic committee, with one classification upheld and two denied. Six classification appeals were lodged for swimming at the 2000 Summer Paralympics involving four athletes, resulting in two class changes. For the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, the IPC had a zero classification at the Games policy. This policy was put into place in 2014, with the goal of avoiding last minute changes in classes that would negatively impact athlete training preparations. All competitors needed to be internationally classified with their classification status confirmed prior to the Games, with exceptions to this policy being dealt with on a case by case basis. In case there was a need for classification or reclassification at the Games despite best efforts otherwise, swimming classification was scheduled to take place at the Olympic Aquatics Stadium, with visually impaired swimmers getting classified from September 4 to 6 and all other swimmers being classified from September 3 to 5. For sportspeople with physical or intellectual disabilities going through classification or reclassification in Rio de Janeiro, their in-competition observation event is their first appearance in competition at the Games. Future Disability sport's major classification body, the IPC, is working on improving classification to be more of an evidence-based system, as opposed to a performance-based system, so as not to punish elite athletes whose performance makes them appear in a higher class compared to competitors who train less.

At age 14, he was the youngest competitor at the 2014 Winter Paralympic Games from any country. Para- snowboarding classification is the classification system for para- snowboarding. The sport originally called Adaptive Snowboard is now practiced by hundreds of athletes around the world. The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) defines three classes: SB-LL for athletes with a physical impairment affecting one or both legs (with SB-LL1 and SB-LL2 for more- and less-severe impairment), and SB-UL for athletes with a physical impairment affecting one or both arms who compete standing. The sport made its official Winter Paralympic debut in the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi, Russia. Eligibility Classifications exist for deaf competitors, blind competitors, people with physical disabilities and those with intellectual disabilities. The IPC eligibility rules provide for athletes with a physical impairment such as limb loss or limb deficiency, spinal cord injury, nerve damage, or cerebral palsy. , athletes with other impairments, such as visual impairments, are not eligible. The IPC defined two competition classes in 2014: * SB-LL for athletes with a physical impairment affecting one or both legs. Athletes may use a prosthesis or modified equipment to compete. * SB-UL for athletes with a physical impairment affecting one or both arms who compete standing. For the 2018 Winter Paralympics in PyeongChang, South Korea, the IPC divided the SB-LL category in twain: * SB-LL1 for athletes with significant impairment to one leg, such as amputation above the knee, or \\"a significant combined impairment in two legs\\", affecting their balance, their board-control and their ability to navigate uneven terrain. * SB-LL2 for athletes with impairment to one or both legs \\"with less activity limitation\\", such as below-knee amputation. * SB-UL for athletes upper limb impairments, affecting balance. There were no events for female athletes in the category SB-UL in the 2018 games. The World Snowboard Federation (WSF) has a more elaborate classification system, with classes SB1 to SB12 for snowboarders with limb disabilities: * SB1 for athletes with severe disabilities in both lower limbs * SB2 for athletes with severe disabilities in one lower limb * SB3 for athletes with moderate disabilities in both lower limbs * SB4 for athletes with moderate disabilities in one lower limbs * SB5 for athletes with disabilities in both upper limbs * SB6 for athletes with disabilities in one upper limb * SB9 for athletes with disabilities in one upper and one lower limb * SB10 sitting class for athletes with disabilities in both lower limbs and trunk * SB11 sitting class for athletes with disabilities in both lower limbs and partial trunk function * SB12 sitting class for athletes with disabilities in lower limbs and good trunk function The WSF also defines three visual impairment class, B1, B2 and B3, identical to those used by the International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA) for other sports for visually impaired athletes. Governance The sport widely called Adaptive Snowboarding held its first official competition at the 2000 USASA Nationals in Waterville Valley NH, USA. The USASA governed adaptive snowboarding competitions in North America through 2008, after which the World Snowboard Federation accepted international governance beginning in 2009. It is now practiced by hundreds of athletes around the world, and governed by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). The IPC and the WSF signed a memorandum of understanding in July 2009 under which the WSF would continue to govern the sport until 2014, after which the situation would be reassessed. Both organisations would continue their efforts to develop the sport. IPC Alpine Skiing governs snowboarding as well as alpine skiing, and the two share a common set of regulations. In explaining the change of the name of the sport, the WSF stated that: For Australian competitors in this sport, the sport and classification is managed the national sport federation with support from the Australian Paralympic Committee. There are three types of classification available for Australian competitors: Provisional, national and international. The first is for club level competitions, the second for state and national competitions, and the third for international competitions. At the Paralympic Games After initially rejecting the sport in August 2011, the International Paralympic Committee changed its mind and added Para- snowboarding to the Alpine Skiing programme on 2 May 2012. The President of the Sochi 2014 Olympic Organizing Committee, Dmitry Chernyshenko, welcomed the addition of the new sport, saying: The sport made its official Winter Paralympic debut in the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi, Russia. There were men's and women's standing snowboard cross. Only events in the SB-LL class were offered. The events were run in a time-trial format (one rider on course at a time), and. unlike some other Paralympic events, results were calculated without factors that adjust times based on disability classification. Each athlete got three runs over a course of jumps, bumps and turns. Times from the best two were added together for their final total. Both events were run on 14 March 2014. The women's event was won by Bibian Mentel-Spee from the Netherlands in a time of 1 minute 57.43 seconds. France's Cecile Hernandez Ep Cervellon came second with a time of 2 minutes 07.31 seconds. America's Amy Purdy came third in 2 minutes 14.29 seconds. The men's event was a clean sweep for the United States. Evan Strong won in 1 minute 43.61 seconds, followed by Michael Shea with a time of 1:44.18 and Keith Gabel with a time of 1:47.10. Future The snowboarding cross events at Sochi were a success, with tickets for para-snowboarding events being among the first to sell out. In April 2014 the IPC announced plans to add slalom to the events at 2018 Winter Paralympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Consideration was also given to having the snowboard cross event run with pairs of athletes competing against each other rather than as a time trial. There were still no plans to add non-standing or visually impaired events. , visually impaired events were not, considered for medal events at WSF Para-Snowboard competitions due to the small numbers of internationally competitive athletes.

Para-Nordic skiing classification is the classification system for para-Nordic skiing which includes the biathlon and cross country events. The classifications for Para-Nordic skiing mirrors the classifications for Para-Alpine skiing with some exceptions. A functional mobility and medical classification is in use, with skiers being divided into three groups: standing skiers, sit skiers and visually impaired skiers. International classification is governed by International Paralympic Committee, Nordic Skiing (IPC-NS). Other classification is handled by national bodies. Before the IPC-NS took over classification, a number of organizations handled classification based on the type of disability. The first classification system for the sport was developed in Scandinavia and was a medical system for skiers with amputations. At the time, other types of disability were not eligible for classification. In developing a system for use at the first Winter Paralympics, organisers wanted to get away from a medical classification system and use a functional system, but they ended up with a system based on equipment utilised by the skier instead. As the 1970s progressed, equipment improvements made it possible for skiers with spinal cord injuries to participate and a classification system developed for these skiers. By the 1990s, there were over ten Nordic skiing classes and a percentage system was developed to allow skiers with different disabilities inside one of three groups to compete against each other. The skiers time at the end of the race would be multiplied against a percentage to determine a time that allowed for fair cross classification comparisons. While the actual percentages change from time to time, this system to calculate a winner is still in use. Despite repeated efforts to move to a true functional mobility based classification dating back to the 1970s, medical assessment still took place during the classification process in the 2010s. There are different events and equipment for different Para-Nordic skiing classes. For sit-skiers, they use sit-skis with two skis, unlike Para-Alpine Skiing where sit skiers use one ski. Blind skiers use a guide, with the position of the guide relative to the skier depending on the class of the skier. In the United States, Para-Nordic skiing has events for people with intellectual disability that are run through Special Olympics. The classification process for blind Para-Nordic skiing is handled internationally by the International Blind Sports Association and is a medical assessment. While National Paralympic Committees can classify their skiers for national competitions, this classification is subject to change at international competitions. These classifications have been used at the Winter Paralympics. Intellectual disability skiers were allowed to compete in full medal events at the 1998 Winter Paralympics but were subsequently removed because of cheating problems at the 2000 Summer Olympics. Definition Para-Nordic skiing has two events, the biathlon and cross-country skiing. The classifications for Para-Nordic skiing at the same as classifications for Para-Alpine skiing. Classifications are based on functional mobility. For amputees, this is based on their mobility with the use of an assistive device. Classification for competitors with cerebral palsy is difficult because the levels of spasticity can change as the race progresses. People with cerebral palsy in classifications from CP1 to CP8 are covered by skiing classifications. Skiers from CP5 to CP8 compete standing up with the use of equipment. Since 1995, the classes area LW2, LW3, LW4, LW5/7, LW6, LW8, and LW9. There are three sit-ski classifications: LW10, LW11 and LW12, with LW10 being divided into LW10 and LW10.5, and LW11 being divided into LW11 and LW11.5. The sport also has three classifications for blind skiers, B1, B2, and B3. These are based solely on medical classification. Research done at the Central Institute on Employment Abilities of the Handicapped in Moscow has found differences in functional capabilities based on differences in visual acuity. This plays a significant role in skiing. Governance Para-Nordic skiing is governed by the International Paralympic Committee, Nordic Skiing. The United States Deaf Ski and Snowboard Association is in charge of deaf classification for competitors in the United States. In the United States, the sport is governed by Disabled Sports USA for skiers with functional mobility, and governed by the United States Association of Blind Athletes (USABA) for skiers with vision impairment, while Special Olympics governs the sport and classification for people with intellectual disabilities. Disabled Sports USA developed its own classification system for sit skiing that is not used internationally. They use a three group classification system, with Group 1 skiers including T5 to T10 spinal cord injuries, Group 2 including all other skiers with disabilities below T10 and Group 3 including all spinal cord disabilities above T10. In the sport's early history, the International Sports Organization for the Disabled (ISOD), founded in 1964, governed the sport. In 1980, there were two governing bodies handling classification, ISOD and the International Stoke Mandeville Games Committee (ISMGC), which later became the International Stoke Mandeville Games Federation (ISMGF), and still later the International Stoke Mandeville Wheelchair Sports Federation (ISMWSF). ISMGC was in charge of classification for athletes with spinal cord related disabilities. In 1981, the International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA) was created, and took over governance for skiers with visual impairments. In 2003, ISMWSF merged with ISOD, and changed its name to the International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports Federation (IWAS) in 2004. While the Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association (CP-ISRA) has an interest in the sport because it is open to people with cerebral palsy, it is not governed by them. In 1983, both the rules for this sport, and classification, was done by the CP-ISRA. By 1984, there were four organisations governing classification for the sport: ISOD, ISMGF, IBSA and CP-ISRA. Eligibility Currently, people with physical disabilities and vision impairment are eligible for classification. In 1983, Cerebral Palsy-International Sports and Recreation Association (CP-ISRA) set the eligibility rules for classification for this sport for people with cerebral palsy. They defined cerebral palsy as a non-progressive brain legion that results in impairment. People with cerebral palsy or non-progressive brain damage were eligible for classification by them. The organisation also dealt with classification for people with similar impairments. For their classification system, people with spina bifida were not eligible unless they also had evidence of upper motor neuron dysfunction, caused by associated hydrocephalus. People with cerebral palsy and epilepsy were eligible provided the condition did not interfere with their ability to compete. People who had strokes were eligible for classification following medical clearance. Competitors with multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy and arthrogryposis were not eligible for classification by CP-ISRA, but were eligible for classification by International Sports Organisation for the Disabled for the Games of Les Autres. History Classification for winter sport started out as a medical one before moving to a functional system. The earliest classification systems for the sport were developed in Scandinavia. The original classification system was for people with amputations, with classification based on the type of amputation as determined by a medical expert. Other classes of disability were not eligible to be classified and compete early in the sport's history. Olena Iurkovska of Ukraine competing on cross-country sit-skis at the 2010 Winter Paralympics. Going into the first winter Paralympic Games, the 1976 Winter Paralympics, the organisers had a difference of opinion with Paralympic Games founder Ludwig Guttmann, because they wanted a functional classification, not medical classification system, from the onset. They largely succeeded, although the system that was developed in √ñrnsk√∂ldsvik, Sweden, that ended up being used was based on equipment utilised by the skier instead of a true functional classification system. During the 1970s, equipment was first being developed for skiers with spinal injuries and a classification system had yet to become fully developed for the sport. In 1983, classification for cerebral palsy competitors in this sport was done by the Cerebral Palsy-International Sports and Recreation Association. The classification used the classification system designed for track events. In 1983, there were five cerebral palsy classifications. During the 1980s, there were three sit-ski classes and seven other classes. During the 1980s, while not formally part of the para-skiing classification system, intellectual disability Nordic skiing classes did exist as part of the Special Olympics movement. The sport was one sports people with disabilities were more likely to play during the 1990s. Prior to 1988, the classification assessment process generally involved a medical exam to determine the classification. The change in winter disability sport classification towards a more formal functional classification system happened more quickly as a result of changes being made in wheelchair basketball classification that started in 1983. Prior to the 1988 Games, sit skiing was not included on the Paralympic programme. Norway worked to change this by added sit skiing classifications to the World Championships in 1986. Functional classification testing was developed in 1989 for Nordic sit skiing, with the same system still being used for the 1998 Winter Paralympics. The tests included hand, arm and shoulder coordination, a sitting balance in the sagittal plane test, a stability sagittal plane test, a sitting balance test in the frontal planes, and a functional sitting ability test of the frontal and sagittal planes with an examination of sideways displacement. By the 1990s, an integrated classification approach was tried in Nordic skiing had been developed using a percentage system that would allow for multiple classes to compete against each other in the same event using a formula to create a time finish that would enable fair comparisons for skiers of different functional ability. In 1997/1998, this was defined as 84% for LW10, 93% for LW11 and 100% for LW12. Their finishing time would then be multiplied against this percentage to determine where they finished. A variant of this system was still in place for the 2010 Winter Paralympics. The Canadian Paralympic Committee explains how this works with the following example: \\"Athlete A is classified as LW6 with a factor of 91% finishes the race in 1 minute, their final race time is 54.6 seconds. Athlete B is classified as LW5 with a factor of 79% finishes the race in 1 minute and 2 seconds, their final race time is 48.98 seconds. Athlete B wins. Therefore, the athlete who completed the race fastest may not be the winner and gold medalist.\\" For the 2008 to 2010 ski seasons, the following percentages were used: Anna Burmistrova of Russia celebrating winning the gold medal during the Women's 3km Pursuit Standing Biathlon at the 2010 Vancouver Winter Paralympics { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" + - !Class !Classic !Free ---- B1 87% 85% ---- B2 98% 98% ---- B3 100% 100% ---- LW2 91‚Äì93%* 86‚Äì91%* ---- LW3 87‚Äì94%* 80‚Äì96%* ---- LW4 96% 96% ---- LW5/7 79% 87% ---- LW6 91% 96% ---- LW8 92% 97% ---- LW9 85‚Äì95% 82‚Äì96% ---- } { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" + - !Class !Classic ---- LW10 86% ---- LW10,5 91% ---- LW11 94% ---- LW11,5 98% ---- LW12 100% ---- } The move from a medical classification to a functional classification system continued during the 1990s. There were conversations about whether or not less-disabled wintersport athletes should be competing in disability winter sport and if they should instead be competing against able bodied competitors. At the same time, there were people including IPC first vice president Jens Bromann who entertained discussions about whether or not blind classifications should be combined into a single class like is done in some other disabilities sports. The debate about inclusion of competitors into able-bodied competitions was seen by some disability sport advocates like Horst Strokhkendl as a hindrance to the development of an independent classification system not based on the rules for able-bodied sport. These efforts ended by 1993 as the International Paralympic Committee tried to carve out its own identity and largely ceased efforts for inclusion of disability sport on the Olympic programme. Nonetheless, in 2006, skiers with amputation still had a medical component to their classification assessment. The International Sports Federation for Persons with Intellectual Disability was given the task of re- evaluating the classification system for skiers with intellectual disabilities to prevent future abuses following the Spanish basketball team cheating scandal at the 2000 Summer Paralympics using a more reliable system that can be verified to classify competitors. Sport Skiers with physical disabilities may compete on the same team as people with vision impairment in team events. This is the case in cross country relay events, where there needs to be one sit skier, one standing skier and one vision impaired skier. At the 2010 Winter Paralympics, the men's relay, named the 1 x 4 km + 2 x 5 km relay, a sit skier led off with a leg, with the standing skier going second on a leg and the vision impaired skier going last on a leg. On the women's side, the event is called the 3 x 2.5 km event. Skiing in the same order, all three skiers ski . Sit skiers sit in a chair with two skis attached to it. Classification percentages for national competitions are not necessarily the same ones used for international competitions. In the biathlon, sit skiers and standing skiers shot at a target that had a bullseye large while vision impairment classifications shot at a bullseye that was large. Vision impaired skiers have a sound system that helps them sight for shooting portions in the biathlon. The guide for B1 skiers generally skis behind the skier in order to maximize the ability of the skier to hear the guide. The guide tells the skier things like when weight should be shifted, elements coming up on the course, and how to position themselves to maximize the diagonal run of the course. Guides for B2 and B3 skiers often position themselves differently as the skiers have some vision, which means the things a guide assists with will be different from what is required of a skier who has almost no sight. Process For skiers with a visual impairment, their classification is handled by the International Blind Sports Association. They are tested based on medical classification by an Ophthalmologist. In the 1990s, the classification assessment process for Nordic skiing had several components. One component was a test that looked at the ability of the skier to go up and down a hill. Another was a neurological test. In Canada, classification for blind skiers is handled by Canadian Blind Sports Association. Canadians seeking classification start the process by getting in touch with the organisation. Para-Nordic skiing classification is handled by Canada Cross Country. For Australian competitors in this sport, the sport and classification is managed the national sport federation with support from the Australian Paralympic Committee. There are three types of classification available for Australian competitors: Provisional, national and international. The first is for club level competitions, the second for state and national competitions, and the third for international competitions. While a skier is first classified by their national Paralympic committee, their international classification may take place during their first World Cup event. A competitor may challenge their own classification or that of their fellow competitors. At the Paralympic Games The 1976 Winter Paralympics were the first time classifications other than spinal cord injury classifications competed at the Paralympic Games. At these Games, there were only two classifications for this sport. The 1976 Winter Paralympics were the first time classifications other than spinal cord injury classifications competed at the Paralympic Games. The only event open to a classification for people with spinal paralysis at the 1980 Winter Paralympics was the cross country event . It was one of only two events in the whole Games for people with spinal paralysis. Women's 2.4km Pursuit Sitting Biathlon ceremony on Day 2 of the 2010 Vancouver Winter Paralympics at Whistler Paralympic Park on 13 March 2010, with Olena Iurkovska of Ukraine (gold), Maria Iovleva of Russia (silver), and Lyudmyla Pavlenko of Ukraine (bronze). At the 1998 Winter Paralympics, skiers with intellectual disabilities were eligible to compete as full medal participants in the cross country event despite early initial opposition by the Nagano Organising Committee. The local organizers believed it would be too difficult to separate intellectual disability skiers into different classes. At the same time, there were few eligible skiers from Japan who would have been eligible to compete in these events. At the 1992 Winter Paralympics, all disability types were eligible to participate, with classification being run through the International Paralympic Committee, with classification being done based on blind, amputee and sitting disability type. The biathlon was open to men with vision impairment classifications for the first time at the 1992 Games. At the 1992 Games, intellectual disability skiers competed in a demonstration event. At the 1992 Games, LW1 to LW9 competed in the short distances in a combined event, with LW 10 and 11 competing in their own short distance event. Blind skiers all skied the short distances in a combined event. The 10 km event was open to LW1 to LW9, and H to D. The relay event was open to LW1 to LW9 in one event, and LWX and LWXI in another event, and blind skiing in a third event. The biathlon was open to women in blind classes for the first time at the 1994 Winter Paralympics. Historically, Nordic skiing was the only skiing discipline open to competitors with intellectual disabilities, but their inclusion was suspended following the 2000 Summer Paralympics cheating scandal and they were not eligible to compete at the 2002 Winter Paralympics. At the 2002 Games, the cross country event had three groups of skiers: vision impaired, standing and sitting. In 2002, for the Winter Paralympics, the Games Classifiers were Birgitta Blomquist, Anne Lannem and Ted Fay. The Games Classifiers for vision impairment classifications were Roman Tolmatschev, Johan Wirsching and Axel Bolsinger. Classifications for skiers with intellectual disabilities were not included at these Games because of cheating that took place at the Sydney Summer Paralympics two years earlier. Future Going forward, disability sport's major classification body, the International Paralympic Committee, is working on improving classification to be more of an evidence-based system as opposed to a performance-based system so as not to punish elite athletes whose performance makes them appear in a higher class alongside competitors who train less.

Para-archery classification is the classification system for para-archery used to create a level playing field for archers with a different range of disabilities. Governance in the sport is through the International Archery Federation. Early classification systems for the sport were created during the 1940s and based on medical classification. This has subsequently changed to a functional mobility classification with the exception of blind archery. Definition and participation Para-archery classification at the Paralympic Games is the basis for determining who can compete in the sport, and within which class. It is used for the purposes of establishing fair competition. Entry is eligible to male and female athletes with a physical disability. The blind classifications are based on medical classification, no functional classification. People with cerebral palsy are eligible to compete in archery. The Cerebral Palsy-International Sports and Recreation Association (CP-ISRA) classes of CP3, CP4, CP5, CP6, CP7 and CP8 have counterparts with the classification system used by the World Archery Federation. Governance Governance in the sport is through the International Archery Federation (also known as the World Archery Federation or F√©d√©ration International de Tir √† l‚ÄôArc ‚Äì FITA) and is overseen by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). The IPC transferred its governance to FITA in 2009 as part of the IPC's program to move governance to sport-specific bodies. FITA sets the rules for competition in the World Archery Book: the most recent version effective as of 1 April 2012. In 1983, the rules for this sport and approval for classification was done by the Federation Internationale de Tir Al'Arc. History The classification for this sport was created during the 1940s and for much of its early history was a medical condition based classification system. In 1964, the International Sport Organization for the Disabled (ISOD) was created. They created the first formal classification system, which had 27. This was reduced to 12 classifications for the 1976 Summer Paralympics and was further reduced to nine classifications for the 1992 Summer Paralympics. In 1983, classification for cerebral palsy competitors in this sport was undertaken by the Cerebral Palsy-International Sports and Recreation Association (CP-ISRA). The classification was based upon the system designed for field athletics events. There were five cerebral palsy classifications for its competitors. Class 1 and Class 2 competitors could compete in the division 1, class 1 and class 2 events. They defined cerebral palsy as a non- progressive brain lesion that results in impairment. People with cerebral palsy or non-progressive brain damage were eligible for classification by them. The organisation also dealt with classification for people with similar impairments. For their classification system, people with spina bifida were not eligible unless they had medical evidence of loco-motor dysfunction. People with cerebral palsy and epilepsy were eligible provided the condition did not interfere with their ability to compete. People who had strokes were eligible for classification following medical clearance. Competitors with multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy and arthrogryposis were not eligible for classification by CP-ISRA, but were eligible for classification by International Sports Organisation for the Disabled for the Games of Les Autres. By the early 1990s, the archery classification had moved away from medical based ones to a functional classification system. Going into the 2000 Summer Paralympics, there were concerns raised by members of the cerebral palsy community about the need to maintain a multiple functional classification system inside this sport specifically for this class of athletes given the large range of functional ability inside the community with cerebral palsy and other motor functional disabilities. Because of issues in objectively identifying functionality that plagued the post Barcelona Games, the IPC unveiled plans to develop a new classification system in 2003. This classification system went into effect in 2007, and defined ten different disability types that were eligible to participate on the Paralympic level. It required that classification be sport specific, and served two roles. The first was that it determined eligibility to participate in the sport and that it created specific groups of sportspeople who were eligible to participate and in which class. The IPC left it up to International Federations to develop their own classification systems within this framework, with the specification that their classification systems use an evidence based approach developed through research. Eligibility , people with physical disabilities are eligible to compete in this sport. Male and female athletes with a physical disability (as defined by the IPC) can compete in the following divisions: recurve (or classic) bow, compound bow and visually impaired (VI). Within these divisions are open, standing and wheelchair classes with events for individuals and teams. The distance from the target and number of arrows shot is the same for para-archery athletes as for able-bodied competitors except for the Visually Impaired (VI) division. Athletes must have a current disability classification card or their results will not qualify for World Records, titles or any other rankings. Classes There are three divisions in Para-Archery: Recurve Bow, Compound Bow and Visually Impaired. Within these divisions, athletes are classified by their impairment(s) as follows: * ARW1 (also known as W1). Archery Wheelchair 1. Impairment in the arms and legs. Athletes compete from a wheelchair and have ‚Äúlimited function in lower and upper limbs, and usually trunk eg those with high level spinal cord injuries, or high multiple limb amputations‚Äù. * ARW2 (also known as W2). Archery Wheelchair 2. Impairment in the legs. Athletes compete from a wheelchair and have ‚Äúsignificantly limited lower limb function with little or no upper limb impairment eg athletes with paraplegia, diplegia or double leg amputation below the knee.‚Äù * ARST (also known as ST). Archery Standing. Athletes may compete standing or in a wheelchair, but have limited impairment. Assistive devices must be authorized by an international classifier and listed on the athlete's classification card. Assistive devices can include: * Wheelchair * Chair/Stool * Block * Permitted body support * Prosthesis * Release aid * Bow bandage * Bow arm splint * String arm wrist splint * Assistant Visually impaired athletes in the VI division must wear a blindfold for vision impairment equality. Process For a para-archery athlete to compete at the Paralympic Games, international classification by an International Classification Panel is required. The International Classification Panel will allocate a class to the athlete and rule which (if any) assistive equipment the athlete may use. Their ruling overrides all prior classifications including those of a national basis. Athletes must be classified according to their disability and level of impairment. The classification process normally involves a physical assessment to authenticate the disability and evaluate the degree of limitation. The athlete will be observed in competition action. Results will place the athlete in one of the three classes (see Classes): this evaluation cannot be used for sports outside of Archery. Whilst athletes may be deemed to have a disability or impairment, this does not guarantee classification. Athletes may be deemed ineligible to compete based on any of the following findings: * their disability does not affect the physical movements required in archery * their primary impairment is not a physical disability. Athletes may need to undergo the classification process more than once if their impairment is of a progressive nature. For Australian competitors in this sport, the sport is not supported by the Australian Paralympic Committee. There are three types of classification available for Australian competitors: Provisional, national and international. The first is for club level competitions, the second for state and national competitions, and the third for international competitions. At the Paralympic Games Only wheelchair classified athletes were eligible to compete at the 1960 Summer Paralympics in Rome in this sport. This continued at the 1964 Summer Paralympics in Tokyo and 1968 Summer Paralympics in Tel Aviv. Competitors with cerebral palsy classifications were allowed to compete at the Paralympics for the first time at the 1984 Summer Paralympics. At the 1992 Summer Paralympics, amputee and wheelchair disability types were eligible to participate, with classification being run through the IPC, with classification including standing, sitting and open. At the 2000 Summer Paralympics, 10 assessments were conducted at the Games. This resulted in 0 class changes. 88 male and 52 female para-archery athletes from across the world will compete at the 2012 Summer Paralympic Games. Competition is being held at The Royal Artillery Barracks from the 30 August to 5 September, with nine medal events in standing and seated classes held. A maximum of three athletes per country will compete in individual events. For each team event, a maximum of one team with three athletes per country is allowed. For the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, the International Paralympic Committee had a zero classification at the Games policy. This policy was put into place in 2014, with the goal of avoiding last minute changes in classes that would negatively impact athlete training preparations. All competitors needed to be internationally classified with their classification status confirmed prior to the Games, with exceptions to this policy being dealt with on a case by case basis. In case there was a need for classification or reclassification at the Games despite best efforts otherwise, archery classification was scheduled for 7 September and 8 September at Sambodromo. For sportspeople with physical or intellectual disabilities going through classification or reclassification in Rio, their in competition observation event is their first appearance in competition at the Games. Prominent athletes Some prominent para-archery athletes have competed and won medals in both able-bodied and paralympic competition. The first paraplegic athlete to compete in able-bodied competition the Olympic Games was a para-archer named Neroli Fairhall of New Zealand. Future Going forward, disability sport's major classification body, the International Paralympic Committee, is working on improving classification to be more of an evidence-based system as opposed to a performance-based system so as not to punish elite athletes whose performance makes them appear in a higher class alongside competitors who train less.

The first was that it determined eligibility to participate in the sport and that it created specific groups of sportspeople who were eligible to participate and in which class. The IPC left it up to International Federations to develop their own classification systems within this framework, with the specification that their classification systems use an evidence based approach developed through research. Classes Classification for paralympic powerlifters is based on the bodyweight of athletes. This means that athletes with different physical impairments compete in the same events. In 1983, there were five cerebral palsy classifications. Process For Australian competitors in this sport, the sport and classification is managed by the Australian Paralympic Committee. There are three types of classification available for Australian competitors: Provisional, national and international. The first is for club level competitions, the second for state and national competitions, and the third for international competitions. At the Paralympic Games The sport was introduced to the Paralympics at the 1964 Summer Paralympics for men and at the 2000 Summer Paralympics for women. Only wheelchair classified athletes were eligible to compete at the 1964 Summer Paralympics in Tokyo in this sport. This continued at the 1968 Summer Paralympics in Tel Aviv. Competitors with cerebral palsy classifications were allowed to compete at the Paralympics for the first time at the 1984 Summer Paralympics. At the 1992 Summer Paralympics, all disability types were eligible to participate, with classification being run through the International Paralympic Committee and the International Blind Sports Association, with classification being done based on blindness and or weight. At the 2000 Summer Paralympics, 44 assessments were conducted at the Games. This resulted in 1 class change, which was PPS protested by a national Paralympic committee and the classification was upheld. For the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, the International Paralympic Committee had a zero classification at the Games policy. This policy was put into place in 2014, with the goal of avoiding last minute changes in classes that would negatively impact athlete training preparations.

People with physical disabilities as defined by the International Paralympic Committee are eligible to compete. Definition Shooting classification at the Paralympic Games is the basis for determining who can compete in the sport and within which class. Classification is used to establish fair competition. Entry is eligible to male and female athletes with a physical disability. There are three classifications for Paralympic shooting, with the classification system being based on functional ability.

IPC Shooting sets out sport rules (including classification rules and guidelines) in their document IPC Shooting Classification Rules and Regulations May 2012. The National Federation for the sport in Australia is the Australian Paralympic Committee, who fund the Australian Paralympic Shooting program. History There were originally five classifications in international competitions. In 1983, classification for shooters with cerebral palsy was done by the Cerebral Palsy-International Sports and Recreation Association. The classification used the classification system designed for field athletics events. In 1983, there were five cerebral palsy classifications for its competitors. Class 2 competitors could compete in co-ed division 1 Class 1 and Class 2 events with the use of assistance including a sling, trigger aid and support stand. In 1983, Cerebral Palsy- International Sports and Recreation Association (CP-ISRA) set the eligibility rules for classification for this sport. They defined cerebral palsy as a non- progressive brain legion that results in impairment. People with cerebral palsy or non-progressive brain damage were eligible for classification by them. The organization also dealt with classification for people with similar impairments. For their classification system, people with spina bifida were not eligible unless they had medical evidence of loco-motor dysfunction. People with cerebral palsy and epilepsy were eligible provided the condition did not interfere with their ability to compete. People who had strokes were eligible for classification following medical clearance. Competitors with multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy and arthrogryposis were not eligible for classification by CP-ISRA, but were eligible for classification by International Sports Organisation for the Disabled for the Games of Les Autres. By the early 1990s, the shooting classification system had moved away from medical based system to a functional classification system. Because of issues in objectively identifying functionality that plagued the post Barcelona Games, the IPC unveiled plans to develop a new classification system in 2003.

The IPC left it up to International Federations to develop their own classification systems within this framework, with the specification that their classification systems use an evidence based approach developed through research. , there were three classifications. Eligibility Male and female athletes with a physical disability (as defined by the IPC) can compete. There are competitions for men, women and mixed in standing and wheelchair disciplines, with rifle and pistol events. , people with visual disabilities are eligible to compete in this sport. Classes There are two broad classes within Paralympic Shooting: * SH1: Using a rifle or pistol, athletes are able to support their firearm without assistance. * SH2: Using a rifle only, athletes support their firearm with the assistance of a shooting stand. Within these two classes, athletes are further sub-classified as follows: * SH1 sub-classes. These subclasses are used to determine height of backrests permitted. If competitors compete standing they must only be supported by ordinary prosthesis/orthosis. Arm prosthesis must not have fixed elbows or grip the rifle. Shooting chairs are allowed in rifle prone events. All competitors classed within SH1 compete in the SH1 class, regardless of their sub-classification. :* SH1A: Athletes may compete sitting or standing. Torso strength and function is normal. No backrest permitted. :* SH1B: Athletes compete sitting. Severe impairment to lower limbs but normal function in pelvis (m.quadratus lumborum). Low backrest permitted. :* SH1C. Athletes compete sitting. No function in the lower limbs, or severe impairment in lower limbs coupled with impairment in the torso. High backrest permitted. * SH2 Sub classes. These sub-classes are used to determine the height of backrests permitted and spring flexibility. With exception to an IPC certified shooting stand (which is either used on a table or tripod) no other devices are allowed to support the rifle. All competitors classed within SH2 compete in the SH2 class, regardless of their sub-classification. :* SH2A. Athletes compete sitting or standing. Severe impairment to both upper limbs or non- function to one upper limb. Normal torso strength and function. No backrest permitted. :* SH2B. Athletes compete sitting. Severe impairment or non- function to lower limbs. Normal pelvis control. Low backrest permitted. :* SH2C. Athletes compete sitting. Severe impairment or non-function in lower limbs. Impairment or non-function in torso. High backrest permitted. Process For a Paralympic shooting athlete to compete at the Paralympic Games, international classification by an International Classification Panel is required. The International Classification Panel will allocate a class to the athlete and if any assistive equipment (such as a shooting stand) the athlete may use. Their ruling overrides all prior classifications including those of a national basis. Athletes must be classified according to their disability and level of impairment. The classification process normally involves a physical assessment to authenticate the disability and evaluate the degree of limitation, plus a technical assessment where the athlete will be observed in non-competition action. Results will place the athlete in one of the two classes (see Classes): this evaluation cannot be used for sports outside of Shooting. In the event that an athlete is deemed ineligible, they will be given an assessment of Sport Class Not Eligible (NE). As with other Paralympic sports, athletes may need to undergo the classification process more than once if their impairment is of a progressive nature. For Australian shooters, the sport and classification is managed the national sport federation with support from the Australian Paralympic Committee. Three types of classification are available for Australian competitors: Provisional, national and international. The first is for club level competitions, the second for state and national competitions and the third for international competitions. At the Paralympic Games The sport first appeared on the Paralympic programme at the 1976 Summer Paralympics. Competitors with cerebral palsy classifications were allowed to compete at the Paralympics for the first time at the 1984 Summer Paralympics. At the 1992 Summer Paralympics, amputee and wheelchair disability types were eligible to participate, with classification being run through the International Paralympic Committee, with classification being done based on functional disability type. At the 1996 Summer Paralympics, classification for this sport was done at the venue because classification assessment required watching a competitor play the sport. At the 2000 Summer Paralympics, 7 assessments were conducted at the Games. This resulted in 0 class changes after a PPS classification was challenged by a classifier and was upheld. At the 2012 Summer Paralympics 100 male and 40 female athletes from all over the world competed in Shooting. The 2012 Paralympic Shooting competition was held at The Royal Artillery Barracks from 30 August to 5 September, with 9 medal events in standing and seated classes held. A maximum of five athletes per country were allowed to compete in a shooting class, while a maximum of three athletes per country were allowed to compete in a single event. For the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, the International Paralympic Committee had a zero classification at the Games policy.

In 1992, the International Paralympic Committee formally took control of governance for disability sport. Wheelchair rugby had been governed by IWAS since 1992, close to the sport's inception. IWAS had also managed the classification side of the sport. In 2010, the International Wheelchair Rugby Federation formally separated from IWAS and took over management of classification of their sport themselves. Process Wheelchair rugby classification includes looking at practiced activities, and may include observing their warm up routine, the ability during throwing drills, their ability to catch a ball and their ability to maneuver their wheelchair. Classification may also include a test where competitors are asked to bench press in order to demonstrate their upper arm strength and how much upper arm mobility they possess.

Getting classified  A standard bench press form used to for functional classification for wheelchair sportspeople. In most countries, classification for national competitions is done through the local national Paralympic committee. One of the standard means of assessing functional classification is the bench test. Using the Adapted Research Council (MRC) measurements, muscle strength is tested using the bench press for a variety of spinal cord related injuries with a muscle being assessed on a scale of 1 to 5 for people with cerebral. A 1 is for no functional movement of the muscle or where there is no motor coordination. A 2 is for normal muscle movement range not exceeding 25% or where the movement can only take place with great difficult and, even then, very slowly. A 3 is where normal muscle movement range does not exceed 50%. A 4 is when normal muscle movement range does not exceed 75% and or there is slight in-coordination of muscle movement. A 5 is for normal muscle movement. Wheelchair fencing classification has 6 test for functionality during classification, along with a bench test. Each test gives 0 to 3 points. A 0 is for no function. A 1 is for minimum movement. A 2 is for fair movement but weak execution. A 3 is for normal execution. The first test is an extension of the dorsal musculature. The second test is for lateral balance of the upper limbs. The third test measures trunk extension of the lumbar muscles. The fourth test measures lateral balance while holding a weapon. The fifth test measures the trunk movement in a position between that recorded in tests one and three, and tests two and four. The sixth test measures the trunk extension involving the lumbar and dorsal muscles while leaning forward at a 45 degree angle. In addition, a bench test is required to be performed.

These included acknowledging one-armed riders were not required to hold the reins in both arms, riders with hearing loss were given visual signals instead of audio signals at the start of and during an event, and blind riders, when they reached a marker, were given an auditory signal. When the sport was undergoing growth in 1995, a classification system was established in order to provide a level playing field for competitors. The system developed at the time was called \\"Functional Profile System for Grading\\" and was largely created by Christine Meaden, who had IPEC classifier status. By 1999, there were four classifications for competitors and 120 accredited equestrian classifiers around the world. At the New York hosted Empire State Games for the Physically Challenged, para-equestrian competition was broken into hearing and vision impaired classifications, amputee classifications, Les Autres, cerebral palsy and spinal cord disabilities. At the 1996 Summer Paralympics, classification was done at the venue because classification assessment required watching a competitor play the sport. At the 2000 Summer Paralympics, 6 assessments were conducted at the Games. This resulted in 1 class change. Because of issues in objectively identifying functionality that plagued the post Barcelona Games, the IPC unveiled plans to develop a new classification system in 2003. This classification system went into effect in 2007, and defined ten different disability types that were eligible to participate on the Paralympic level. It required that classification be sport specific, and served two roles. The first was that it determined eligibility to participate in the sport and that it created specific groups of sportspeople who were eligible to participate and in which class. The IPC left it up to International Federations, in this case FEI, to develop their own classification systems within this framework, with the specification that their classification systems use an evidence based approach developed through research. The fourth edition of FEI's classification system guide was published in January 2015. Going forward, disability sport's major classification body, the International Paralympic Committee, is working on improving classification to be more of an evidence-based system as opposed to a performance-based system so as not to punish elite athletes whose performance makes them appear in a higher class alongside competitors who train less.  Classification process  The purpose of classification to identify the level of functional disability of a rider, completely independent of their skill level. This is because demonstration of skill is the purpose of competition. Steps are taken before and during the classification process to avoid this. Part of the process involves observing the competitor riding and doing a bench press. For this reason, classifiers do not observe a rider on their horse prior to the bench press to avoid assessing skill at functionality. During classification, classifiers look at several things including a rider's mobility, strength and coordination. This is done during a bench press, during training and in competition. After riders are classified, they are giving both a classification and a profile. This profile a number 1 to 39 for para-dressage and 1 to 32 for para-driving. This profile impacts what adaptive equipment riders can use. Each rider's classification has a status. The available statuses for classification include New, Review, Reviewed Fixe Date - Paralympic Games, and Confirmed. The status of a rider's classification affects their ability to protest their classification.  Classification governance  Internationally, classification is handled by FEI. Classification at the national level is handled by different organizations. For example, Australian para-equestrian sport and classification is managed by the national sport federation with support from the Australian Paralympic Committee. There are three types of classification available for Australian competitors: Provisional, national and international. The first is for club level competitions, the second for state and national competitions, and the third for international competitions.  Criticism  The classification system in para-equestrian has been criticized by some riders as not fully taking into account disabilities that have fluctuations in a person's regular functional abilities. This criticism specifically related to multiple sclerosis.  Diagrams  The images below are examples derived from FEI's guide.

It is based on functional ability and is broken down into three specific classifications. This system is governed by Federation Internationale de Societes d'Aviron. Eligible competitors have a physical or visual disability. Definition Adaptive rowing has three broad classifications based on a rowers functional ability. These classifications are PR1 (previously AS) for arms and shoulders, PR2 (previously TA) for trunk and arm mobility, PR3 (previously LTA) for legs, trunk and arms mobility. There was also previously a mixed boat classification called LTAIDMix4+ which included rowers with intellectual disabilities. Governance The sport is governed by the Federation Internationale de Societes d'Aviron (FISA). Eligibility , people with visual and physical disabilities are eligible to compete in this sport. British Rowing defines two types of rowers with disabilities: * Para- Rowers - are eligible for the Paralympics. These are \\"rowers who have successfully been through the classification process and have been assigned a sport class.\\" * Adaptive Rowers - are not eligible for the Paralympics, but are eligible for all British Rowing competitions except for the British Rowing Championships. These are \\"rowers who have been through the classification process and have been confirmed as meeting a minimal disability. History Adaptive rowing was taking place in France by 1971, with two classes of rowers initially participating: people with visual disabilities and people recovering from polio. People recovering from polio in France used boats with pontoons in order to increase their stability. Other changes were made to the boat with the development of a hinge-system to prevent rowers from tiring as easily. Blind rowers used the same boats during the 1970s and 1980s as their able- bodied counterparts but were guided on the course by a referee. Blind rowers were also encouraged to be in boats with sighted rowers, with the blind rowers serving as the stroke and the cox paying special attention to help the blinder rower. Classification was not something developed in France in this era as there was a focus on integrating rowers into the regular rowing community. Adaptive rowing in the Netherlands began in 1979 with the founding of Stichting Roeivalidatie. There was not an emphasis on classification early on, but rather in integrating adaptive rowing with regular rowing inside of rowing clubs. Attempts were then made to customise equipment to suit an individual rower's specific needs as they related to their disability. Adaptive rowing in the United States began in 1981 with the catamaran being the boat first used by rowers with a disability. By 1991, a classification system was in place for domestic competitions, but it was still under development. Many rowers also competed against their able-bodied counterparts during this period. Adaptive rowing racing began in Australia in 1988. The first FISA recognised adaptive rowing World Cup event took place in 1991 and held in the Netherlands. Early governance of the sport in Australia was done by the Rowing Council with supporting from the Australian Rowing Association. Early classifications were limited because of the limited number of rowers. In many of the earliest races inside Australia, there were two classes: fixed seats and sliding seats. In 1991 in Great Britain, adaptive rowing was not a large concern. Rowing clubs endeavored to fully integrate rowers with disabilities into regular club races. By 1991, an international classification system was attempting to be developed. These classes were: * Q1: Laesion at C4-C6 * Q2: C7-T1 * P1: T2-T9 * P2: T10-L4 * A1: A single amputation * A2: A double amputation * A3: Respiratory problems. This early system, called the Functional Classification System was not internationally agreed upon in part because it was not seen as entirely fair as it did not consider rower functionality and correct times based on that. At this time, there was also discussion about whether or not classifications should be created for rowers with intellectual disabilities. In 1992, the International Paralympic Committee formally took control of governance for disability sport. Classes thumb Athletes are classified as follows: PR3 (previously LTA). Legs, Trunks and Arms. Athletes are able to use a sliding seat and have function in their legs, trunks and arms to row. They may have a visual or physical impairment. Visually impaired athletes will wear blindfolds for vision impairment equality. The three categories of vision impairment used in FISA sport classification for adaptive rowing are B1, B2, and B3, which within PR3 (LTA) adaptive rowing are respectively known as PR3-B1, PR3-B2, PR3-B3. PR2 (previously TA). Trunks and Arms. Athletes row with only their trunks and arm functional. They are unable to use a sliding seat due to impairment in the legs. PR1 (previously AS). Arms and Shoulders. Athletes row with only their arms and shoulders, as they do not have the use of their trunks or legs. Rules allow for a rower to compete in a higher functional class than they are currently classified. Rowers may not compete in lower classifications than they have been classified. In the Coxed Four, the maximum number of vision impaired rowers in a boat is two. Process For Australian competitors in this sport, the sport and classification is managed the national sport federation with support from the Australian Paralympic Committee. There are three types of classification available for Australian competitors: Provisional, national and international. The first is for club level competitions, the second for state and national competitions, and the third for international competitions. For the 2008 Summer Paralympics, classification assignment for this class was handled by FISA. For the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, the International Paralympic Committee had a zero classification at the Games policy. This policy was put into place in 2014, with the goal of avoiding last minute changes in classes that would negatively impact athlete training preparations. All competitors needed to be internationally classified with their classification status confirmed prior to the Games, with exceptions to this policy being dealt with on a case by case basis. In case there was a need for classification or reclassification at the Games despite best efforts otherwise, rowing classification was scheduled forSeptember 8 at Lagoa Stadium, and September 4 to 6 for visually impaired rowers. Future Going forward, disability sport's major classification body, the International Paralympic Committee, is working on improving classification to be more of an evidence-based system as opposed to a performance-based system so as not to punish elite athletes whose performance makes them appear in a higher class alongside competitors who train less.

All the ambulant classes (PTS2-PTS5) compete in their own medal event and the three visual impaired classes (PTVI1, PTVI2 and PTVI3) compete into the PTVI medal event. Classification system from 2014 The ITU revised the Paratriathlon classification system in preparation for the sport's debut at the 2016 Summer Paralympics. The ITU formed a Paratriathlon Classification Research Group to develop an evidence- based and sports specific classification system, drawing on work in swimming, cycling and athletics. The result of the research was a classification system which was implemented during the 2014 season. There were five classes, PT1 to PT4 was for athletes with various mobility impairments with PT1 for the most impaired and PT4 for the least impaired. PT5 was for visually impaired athletes. * PT1 - Athletes with mobility impairments such as muscle power, limb deficiency, hypertonia, ataxia or athetosis that render them incapable of safely running or pedalling a bicycle. They must have a classification assessment score of up to 640,0 points. Athletes must use a recumbent handcycle during the cycling stage and a racing wheelchair for the running phase of the race. * PT2 - Athletes with mobility impairments such as muscle power, limb deficiency, hypertonia, ataxia or athetosis that have a classification assessment score of up to 454,9 points. Amputees may use approved prostheses or supportive devices during the running and cycling stages. * PT3 - Athletes with mobility impairments such as muscle power, limb deficiency, hypertonia, ataxia or athetosis that have a classification assessment score from 455,0 to 494,9 points. Athletes may use approved prostheses or supportive devices during the running and cycling stages. * PT4 - Athletes with mobility impairments such as muscle power, limb deficiency, hypertonia, ataxia or athetosis that have a classification assessment score from 495,0 to 557,0 points. Athletes may use approved prostheses or supportive devices during the running and cycling stages. * PT5 - Athletes with a visual impairment. All qualifying levels of visual impairment, IBSA/IPC defined sub- classes B1, B2, and B3, are grouped together in this classification. Athletes must have a sighted guide of the same gender and nationality during the entire race and use a tandem bicycle during the cycling stage. Pre-2014 classification system Until the 2014 season the ITU classified paratriathletes into 6 classes: * TRI 1 - Wheelchair user: Includes Paraplegic, Quadriplegic, Polio, Double Leg Amputee and disabilities that prevent the safe use of a conventional bicycle. Must use hand cycle on bike course and racing wheelchair on the run. * TRI 2 - Severe leg impairment,including above knee amputees. Must ride bicycle and run with above knee prosthesis or run using crutches. * TRI 3 - Les Autres: Includes athletes with Multiple Sclerosis, Muscular Dystrophy, Cerebral Palsy, double leg amputee or paralysis in multiple limbs. Must ride a bicycle or tricycle and run. May use braces or prosthesis. * TRI 4 - Arm impairment: Includes paralysis, above elbow amputees and below elbow amputees, or impairment in both upper limbs. Must ride a bike. May use prosthesis, brace or sling on the bike and/or run. * TRI 5 - Moderate leg impairment: Includes below-knee amputees. Must ride a bicycle and may run with prosthesis. * TRI 6a - Visual impairment, total blindness or may be able to perceive light but not recognise the shape of a hand at any distance or direction. Competes with a guide of the same gender and uses a tandem bicycle. * TRI 6b - Visual Impairment: Includes visual acuity of less than 6/60 vision or visual field less than 40 degrees with best corrective vision. One guide of the same gender is mandatory throughout the race. This classification system was used at National, Continental and World Paratriathlon Championships until the end of the 2013 season. Levels of Classification As in many other sports, there are three levels of paratriathlon classification available: Provisional, National and International. The first is for athletes who do not have access to a full classification panel; it is a temporary indication of class, generally used only in lower levels of competition. The second can be used in all domestic competitions. To compete internationally, an International-level classification is required. Many disabled triathletes compete entirely in age- group races, without going through the classification process. Ironman triathlon classification The Ironman World Championship includes several divisions for paratriathletes: * Handcycle - Physically challenged athletes who are paraplegic, quadriplegic or double above-the-knee amputees, and race using a hand cranked cycle on the bike segment and a racing chair for the run. These athletes would be classified TRI-1 in ITU races. * Lower Extremity - This includes single below-the-knee amputees, in which a standard bicycle is used, and run with prosthesis or crutches. These athletes would be classified TRI-5 in ITU races. * Wheelchair One - This division consists of single above- the-knee amputees who ride a standard bicycle, but use a racing chair on the run. There is no ITU equivalent of this division. * Wheelchair Two - This division consists of athletes who have double below-the-knee or a double above-the-knee amputation. These athletes ride a standard bicycle and use a racing chair on the run. There is no ITU equivalent of this division. * Upper Extremity - This is an athlete who has one arm amputated above or below the elbow, in which they will use prosthesis on the bike. These athletes would be classified TRI-4 in ITU races. * Visually Impaired - This is for athletes who are legally blind, 20/200 with best-corrected vision, requiring a guide throughout the race. If a guide is needed, they may use a tandem bike and may be tethered during the swim and the run. These athletes would be classified TRI-6 in ITU races. These Ironman Triathlon divisions were developed by the World Triathlon Corporation; they are separate from the classification system used by the ITU and International Paralympic Committee.  At the Paralympic Games  For the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, the International Paralympic Committee had a zero classification at the Games policy. This policy was put into place in 2014, with the goal of avoiding last minute changes in classes that would negatively impact athlete training preparations. All competitors needed to be internationally classified with their classification status confirmed prior to the Games, with exceptions to this policy being dealt with on a case by case basis. In case there was a need for classification or reclassification at the Games despite best efforts otherwise, paratriathlon classification was scheduled to take place at Fort Copacabana from September 4‚Äì6 for vision impaired competitors, and September 5‚Äì6 for all others. For sportspeople with physical or intellectual disabilities going through classification or reclassification in Rio, their in-competition observation event is their first appearance in competition at the Games.

Because of issues in objectively identifying functionality that plagued the post Barcelona Games, the IPC unveiled plans to develop a new classification system in 2003. This classification system went into effect in 2007, and defined ten different disability types that were eligible to participate on the Paralympic level. It required that classification be sport specific, and served two roles. The first was that it determined eligibility to participate in the sport and that it created specific groups of sportspeople who were eligible to participate and in which class. The IPC left it up to International Federations to develop their own classification systems within this framework, with the specification that their classification systems use an evidence based approach developed through research. Eligibility People with physical disabilities are eligible to compete in this sport. In competitions that are non-sanctioned, such as national cup and league matches, people without disabilities may compete. Process At the 1996 Summer Paralympics, on the spot classification required that classifiers have access to medical equipment like Snellen charts, reflex hammers, and goniometers to properly classify competitors.

All four classes are eligible to compete at the Paralympic Games. Definition Boccia classification at the Paralympic Games is the basis for determining who can compete in the sport, and within which class. It is used for the purposes of establishing fair competition. Entry is eligible to athletes with cerebral palsy or severe disabilities (such as muscular dystrophy, brain or spinal injury). There are four boccia classifications based upon functional ability. This sport has rules that were designed specifically with people with disabilities in mind. Governance In 1983, the rules for this sport and approval for classification was done by the Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association (CP-ISRA). This remained the case in 2012. History In 1983 CP-ISRA was responsible for the classification of competitors in Boccia. Their classification followed the system designed for field athletics events and originally used five cerebral palsy classes for competitors. Class 1 competitors could compete in co-ed team events which included three competitors from class 1 and class 2, with one required to be a class 1 competitor. They could also compete in the individual events. By the early 1990s, boccia classification had moved away from medical based system to a functional classification system.

Eligibility , people with physical disabilities are eligible to compete in this sport. The level of physical impairment must be significant, such as brain injury or total body impaired function (as in the case of cerebral palsy). In 1983, CP- ISRA set the eligibility rules for classification for this sport. They defined cerebral palsy as a non-progressive brain legion that results in impairment. People with cerebral palsy or non-progressive brain damage were eligible for classification by them. The organisation also dealt with classification for people with similar impairments. For their classification system, people with spina bifida were not eligible unless they had medical evidence of loco-motor dysfunction. People with cerebral palsy and epilepsy were eligible provided the condition did not interfere with their ability to compete. People who had strokes were eligible for classification following medical clearance. Competitors with multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy and arthrogryposis were not eligible for classification by CP-ISRA, but were eligible for classification by International Sports Organisation for the Disabled for the Games of Les Autres. Classes There are four classes in Boccia. Athletes are grouped according to their impairment as follows: * BC1. Athletes who have Cerebral Palsy. They either kick or throw the ball. They may request the use of an assistant, providing the assistant remains outside of the athlete's box. * BC2. Athletes who have Cerebral Palsy but are able to better throw the ball than BC1 players. They are not allowed the use of an assistant. * BC3. Athletes with a severe physical disability (Cerebral Palsy or other) that prevents them from throwing or kicking the ball three metres. They require assistive equipment such as a ramp. An assistant is also allowed within the athlete's box, however they are not allowed to observe gameplay. * BC4. Athletes who have a significant physical disability (non Cerebral Palsy) that makes it difficult for them to throw the ball. No assistants or assistive devices may be used. These classes have some parallels with the cerebral palsy sport classification system used by CP-ISRA for the CP1 and CP2 classes. Process For a boccia athlete to compete at the Paralympic Games, international classification by an International Classification Panel is required. The International Classification Panel will allocate a class to the athlete and rule which (if any) assistive equipment the athlete may use. Their ruling overrides all prior classifications including those of a national basis. Athletes must be classified according to their disability and level of impairment. The classification process normally involves a physical assessment to authenticate the disability and evaluate the degree of limitation. The athlete will be observed in competition action. Results will place the athlete in one of the four classes (see Classes): this evaluation cannot be used for sports outside of Boccia. For Australian competitors in this sport, the sport and classification is managed by the Australian Paralympic Committee. There are three types of classification available for Australian competitors: Provisional, national and international. The first is for club level competitions, the second for state and national competitions, and the third for international competitions.

Among the features of the Maegly House that are often included in Prairie School-style dwellings are decorative corner brackets and ornamental friezes, above and below the second-floor windows. One narrow frieze positioned just below the eaves encircles the entire house except where interrupted at the corners by the decorative brackets. The interior is noteworthy for its use of high-quality Honduran mahogany. Every room in the house has multiple windows, and every ground-floor room opens to a porch or terrace. Downtown Portland and Mount Hood can be seen from the living room, dining room and kitchen.

Leap believe that young people are best placed to resolve their own conflicts. They work with young people who are at risk of exclusion from school, struggling with low aspirations or low self-esteem and those who are already involved in the criminal justice system, helping them make the most of their talent and potential and re-enter education, volunteering or employment. History LEAP Confronting Conflict originally started in 1985 as a theatre project by The Leaveners, a Quaker arts charity, before developing into an independent organisation in 1999. LEAP ('Leaveners Experiments in Arts for Peace') initiated work with unemployed and homeless young people to help them deal with conflict through theatre projects in schools and prisons. In 1987 LEAP received support of the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust and the Quaker Peace Committee; in the following year the charity received three years of funding from the Department for Education and Science. Published in 1992, Leap‚Äôs first training manual entitled ‚ÄúPlaying with Fire‚Äù sold out and was subsequently published by the New Society Press in the United States of America. This was followed by a handbook for young people entitled Fireworks! in 1993 In 1999, Leap Confronting Conflict became an independent registered charity and launched the Young Mediators Network (YMN) whilst Leap‚Äôs Quarrel Shop became the first Leap project to gain formal OCN accreditation. 2002 saw Leap expand their outreach to Glasgow as they launched their first gang project in the city. The organisation‚Äôs conference ‚ÄúGangs! What Gangs?‚Äù delivered in 2003 was marked by a major piece in The Guardian. The Institute for Public Policy Research recommended Leap‚Äôs work in educational institutions in 2006 as Leap published it manual, ‚ÄúWorking with Gangs and Young People‚Äù. The following year saw the charities expansion as Leap recruited regional staff in Yorkshire and the South West following which the Department for Children, School and families awarded the charity Pathfinder status At the 2009 Charity Awards, Leap had the honour of being the Overall winner as well as winning the Children and Youth Category. In 2012 Leap won a National Partners Award from the National Council for Voluntary Youth Services (NCVYS) for involving young people in the planning and decision making processes of their work. In 2013 Leap launched the first Lighting the Fire ‚Äì The Leap Annual Excellence awards to recognise the achievements of young people and professionals managing conflict in our communities. Leap were also runners up for Britain's Most Innovative Charity in the Third Sector Britain's Most Admired Charity Awards. As of 2014 Leap works with over 1,200 young people and 880 of the professionals working with them. Mission & Values Leap give young people the skills to manage conflict in their own lives, reduce violence in their communities, and help lead our society. Leap believes that conflict is inevitable in the lives of young people; but that when managed creatively it can be an opportunity for personal development. Leap has developed innovative and accessible models for understanding and managing conflict. Activities and Programs Leap works nationally with young people and adults, helping them to understand and manage the everyday conflict in their lives, and supporting them to become role models and leaders of positive change. Leap has innovated many programs in conflict resolution which include Peerlink, a national peer mediation and youth conflict resolution network and support project; Quarrel Shop, a training course for 16- to 21-year-olds in peer mediation and conflict resolution and Working with Gangs, a course based on training and research in the area of gangs and territorialism in communities around the UK. Leap works across a range of issues including leadership, challenging behaviour, peer mediation, identity and prejudice, preventing knife crime and group offending. Leap has developed programmes as part of partnerships with domestic abuse charity SafeLives and the Addressing Sexual Bullying Across Europe (ASBAE) project around sexual violence and sexual bullying.

Historical Background The area was previously a defensive Pa, built by Te Kawerau sub-tribes, occupied until as recently as 1827. NgƒÅti PƒÅoa ceded the land to the Crown on 5 January 1854, which was subsequently granted to an Austrian, Captain Martin Krippner, in 1860. In the 1870s, Major de Grut took over the land until it was sold to the Eaves family in 1919. Features A series of pedestrian walkways have been constructed through the reserve, as well as a wooden look out point over Orewa Beach that was built in 1997. The reserve includes kauri trees as old as 300 years. In addition, the bush contains native trees such as Totara, Matai, Kahikatea, Puriri, Rata, Karaka, Rimu, Rewarewa, Nikau and Taraire. A number of these trees can be identified by labels along the walkway. Several small streams feed the Nukumea Stream, which marks the reserve's southern boundary.

Bengal was at times an important centre influencing stone sculpture in the Indian subcontinent, especially in the post-Gupta and medieval periods. Terracotta reliefs are a particular local characteristic of Hindu temples (with figures) and mosques (without figures) in recent centuries. Jagroto Chowrongi The earliest sculptures in Bangladesh discovered so far date back to the 3rd century BC. Since ancient times, sculptures have been serving as a substantial manifestation of the profound heritage of Bangladeshi culture and history.  Historic significance  Sculptures have been a key of source of rendering the historic identity of the ancient Bangladesh. Even though the art of sculptures in Bangladesh began almost 2500 years ago, it mostly flourished during the Gupta, Pala and Sena dynasty all of which belong to the early Middle Ages (1‚Äì1200 CE). = Gupta Sculptures = The Gupta rulers were devoted Vaishnavas, and early Gupta sculptures are found to be mostly representations of Vishnu or any of his incarnations. The earliest example of this seems to be the Vishnu from Machmoil Bagmara in the district of Rajshahi carved in grey sandstone. The image shows a broken form of the god in a strict frontally standing pose. Though modelling and iconic features betray its early Gupta style, its aesthetic attainment is so negligible that it may be stylistically placed in a point of transition between the Kusana and the Gupta phases. The image is preserved with quite a number of other Vishnus of the Gupta period in the Varendra Research Museum. The Gupta sculptures of Bangladesh are mostly icons and their forms were determined by the characteristics of the gods as prescribed by the priests of Central India. = Pala Sculptures = During more than four hundred years of Pala rule (8th‚Äì12th century AD), many centres of sculptural art flourished simultaneously in different regions of the extensive empire of Bangladesh. The products of these centres were not only varied but also numerous. Thousands of sculptures of this period have been discovered and they now form part of the collections of a number of museums in Bangladesh. Many of them have also found their ways into a number of museums in Europe and America. Most of these sculptures have been found through the excavations in Somapura Mahavihara. Pala sculpture derives its origins from the late Gupta style, but later on deviated from it. = Sena sculptures = A large number of sculptures representing Hindu gods and goddesses belong to the phase of artistic activity initiated under the Sena rulers (c 1097‚Äì1223 AD). From the artistic point of view, Sena sculpture is a continuation of the Pala style in vogue till the late 11th century AD. The slender body form of the late Pala period sculpture is retained in the Sena period, but the modelling quality shows a marked deterioration.  Materials  Most of the ancient sculptures discovered in Bangladesh are made of terracotta, bronze, black stone etc. The earliest sculptures were made of terracotta dating back as early as 3rd century BC. The trend of using bronze for sculptures started from the 7th century. The black stone sculptures also originated from that period. = Terracotta = The history of terracotta sculpture in Bangladesh starts from the Mauryan age (324‚Äì187 BC). It is believed that in pre-Mauryan times it was the Matrika (Mother-Goddess) statues that dominated. From the presentation and aesthetic standard of the Mauryan sculpture it can be inferred that the art had a long and continuous heritage. These sculptures became much more elegant, refined, well-shaped and worldly in the 2nd and 1st centuries BC. = Bronze = The trend of using bronze in sculptures started in the 7th century CE mainly from the Chittagong region. As the region was dominated by believers of Buddhism, most of these earliest bronze sculptures were depictions of Gautam Buddha. However, later on sculptures depicting the Hindu deities were also made with bronze. = Black stone = Stone sculptures so far discovered from Bangladesh that are assignable to the first three centuries of the Common era are few. These sculptures in general represent a style, which is, in the development of the art in North India, recognised as related to the Kusanas. The centre of the art was Mathura, where evolved during the period the images of the deities worshipped by the followers of the three major religions of the time, namely, Brahmanism, Buddhism and Jainism.  Religious depictions  The Bangladeshi sculptures, especially those belonging to the ancient and early Middle Ages mostly depict the Hindu deities and the deities worshiped by the Buddhists, especially Gautam Buddha. Thus, these sculptures can be divided in two major categories considering their religious significance. = Hindu Sculptures = Sculptures depicting the Hindu deity fall in this category. The beginning of the art of Hindu sculptures is believed to be from the Gupta period. Most of these sculptures depicts the Hindu deity called Vishnu. Many of them also depict the deities namely Durga, Brahma, Ganesha and others. Mahishamardini figure from Sarsabaz, Bogra, now in the Mahasthangarh Museum is the most magnificent early image of the deity not only from Bangladesh but from the Indian Subcontinent. = Buddhist sculptures = These sculptures mostly depict the Gautam Buddha and Buddhist believes. The oldest Buddhist sculptures in Bangladesh are believed to be the belongings of the ancient kingdom of Pundravardhana. These sculptures are discovered from the archaeological sites, most of which situated in the Rajshahi and Rangpur region of the country.  Modern Sculptures  Sculptures, created after the independence of Bangladesh can be referred as modern sculptures. Most of these sculptures depict the gallant struggle of Bangladeshis during the Bangladesh liberation war. Some notable sculptures depicting the liberation war are Aparajeyo Bangla, Shabash Bangladesh, Jagroto Chowrongi, Pataka Ekattor by Rupam Roy, Imran Hossain Piplu and Muhammad Ziaul Huq Shimul etc. Nitun Kundu, Shyamal Choudhury, Mrinal Haque are some of the notable modern sculptors.

Description The district consists of support and administration buildings built in the monument in the 1920s and 1930s. These structures are notable examples of the National Park Service Rustic style, designed to fit with their environment. The earliest trails and structures were built by Errol M. Halliday while the location was still under the administration of the U.S. Forest Service. The Old Cave Trail was built in 1921-22. The stone storage building was built in the 1920s, together with a frame custodian's residence that no longer exists. A stone confort station (Building 126) was built in 1928. The structures are scatted on a steep landscape. The most significant building is the superintendent's residence, of rubble stone construction with a log-framed roof, covered with green shingles. The bridge is a single span built in 1935, using rubble stone. The 1935 Comfort Station restroom (presently named Last Chance restroom) is built on a ledge on the mountainside, and has a nearly flat concrete roof faced with stone. The 1928 comfort station is larger and built with a shingled roof. It is no longer used as a restroom. The rubble storage building is covered with a flat concrete roof. There are also two cold cellars on the site, both built about 1930. The trail climbs the cliffs for between one and , its vertical climb of supported by stone retaining walls. History The National Park Service took over the monument in 1933. Monument facilities were expanded using labor provided by the Works Progress Administration, with another comfort station (Building 127) in 1939. The unnamed stream that flows through the American Fork Canyon (and becomes the American Fork river at the mouth of the canyon) was diverted and a new bridge was built in the 1930s. The Superintendent's Residence was completed in 1941. The Timpanogos Cave Historic District was placed on the NRHP on October 13, 1982.

The Government of India imposes mandatory education at least up to the basic level. For this public schools are made free of fees, and provided with free textbooks and school lunch. The first formal education was started in 1894 by two British Christian Missionaries at Aizawl. They taught only two select students whom they could trust for further teaching and their own evangelism. The first government school was started in 1897 at Aizawl. The first middle school opened in 1906, and secondary school in 1944. The first higher education institute Pachhunga University College was started in 1958. The first university Mizoram University was established in 2001 by the University Grants Commission of India. The general pattern of education is simply a progression from primary to secondary education. Only after secondary level students are able to pursue their lines of career opportunities or preferences. Industrial Training Institute for craftsmanship training courses (tailoring, mechanic, electrician, cooking, etc.) was started in Aizawl by the state government in 1964 (Mizoram was then under Assam state). Education on technical and vocational courses started only after 1980s. There are now various opportunities including engineering, veterinary, business management, technology, nursing, pharmacy, and other career oriented courses. The College of Veterinary Sciences and Animal Husbandry, Selesih was opened in 1997 as one of the constituent colleges of the Central Agricultural University. National Institute of Electronics and Information Technology, Aizawl was started by the Indian Ministry of Communications and Information Technology in 2000. The Government of Mizoram established The Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts of India University, Mizoram in 2006. National Institute of Technology Mizoram was established in 2010 by the Ministry of Human Resources Development, Government of India. In spite of relatively late education system, as of the latest census in 2011, Mizoram is the second highest in literacy rate (91.58%) among the Indian states. History Before the land of the Mizos was annexed to the British Empire in 1890, Mizos were without written language and were totally illiterate. Most of knowledge was disseminated at Zawlbuk, the traditional school. In 1894 two English missionaries of Arthington Aborigines Mission Dr. (Rev) J.H. Lorrain and Rev. F.W. Savidge arrived at Aizawl. They immediately worked on creating Mizo alphabets based on Roman script. After a stay of only two and half months, they started the first school on 1 April 1894. Their first and only pupils were Suaka and Thangphunga. The two teachers were surprised that their students mastered the new alphabets in a week. The first textbook Mizo Zir Tir Bu (A Lushai Primer) was released on 22 October 1895 and became the first book in Mizo language. A Welsh missionary Rev. D.E. Jones from the Calvinistic Methodist Mission then took up the education under government recognition in 1898. He organised classes for about thirty students at the verandah of his residence. He was assisted by Khasi couple Rai Bhajur and his wife. A new government school was opened in Lunglei in 1897, and Bengali script was used for teaching. In 1901 the government honoured Lalluava, the Chief of Khawngb√¢wk, for his deed towards the British by establishing primary school in his village. By 1903 there were schools in fifteen villages. In 1903 the British administration started promoting education by waiving forced labour (called kuli) for those who passed class IV (primary school), in addition to scholarship for meritorious students and grants to existing schools. The first scholarship was given to 8 students with the amount of INR 3 each per month for 2 years. The first systematic examination called Lower Primary Exam was conducted on 25 June 1903, with 19 candidates (2 girl among 17 boys). Eleven of them passed. Sir Bamfield Fuller, Assam Chief Commissioner, visited Mizoram (then Lushai Hills) in February 1904, and was so impressed with the mission schools that he immediately issued an order for dissolution of all government schools. He also presented Gold Medal to Chhuahkhama (among boys) and Saii (among girls). In 1904 the entire educational administration was charged under the mission, and Rev. Edwind Rowlands became the first Honorary Inspector of Schools from 1 April. The first middle school (was called upper primary) came up in 1906 in Aizawl. The first high school named Mizo High School was opened in February 1944 at Zarkawt. There were 56 students in class VII, under the headmaster Rev David Evan Jones. By 1941 Census of India Lushai had attained highest literacy rate (36%) in India. Till the late 1952 the church managed elementary education through Honorary Inspector of Schools. On 25 April 1952 Lushai Hills became Mizo District Council under the Government of Assam. A post of Deputy Inspector was created by the government. In 1953 the designation of Honorary Inspector was changed to Secretary, Education Management Committee. Under this administration all primary and middle scholarship examinations were coordinated. In 1953 the first teachers' training institute Basic Training Centre was opened. On 15 August 1958 Pachhunga University College (then Aijal College) was inaugurated to become the first institute of higher education. In 1961 Education Officer became the administrative authority of education in the Mizo District Council. After Mizoram became Union Territory (in 1972) a separate Directorate of Education was created in 1973 under a separate ministry. Mizoram Board of School Education was established in 1976. Within a hundred years of education, Mizoram remains at the top list of highest literacy rate in India. School education Nuchhungi English Medium School students at Hnahthial The office of school education for Mizoram was started in 1973. It became a separate Directorate of School Education in 1989 and is located at McDonald Hill, Zarkawt, Aizawl. The department looks after elementary, secondary, higher education, language development, adult education and physical education within the state. The directorate administers the entire state and divides into 4 (four) education districts, namely (1) Chhimtuipui district, (2) Lunglei district,(3) Aizawl East district, and (4) Aizawl West district. The structure of education in the state is based on the national level pattern with 12 years of schooling (10+2+3), consisting of eight years of elementary education, that is, five years of primary and three years of middle school education for the age groups of 6-11 and 11‚Äì14 years, respectively, followed by secondary and higher secondary education of two years each besides two years of pre-primary education. The entry age in class 1 is 5+. Pre-primary classes form age group 3 to 4. The higher secondary school certificate enables pupils to pursue studies either in universities or in colleges for higher education in general academic streams and in technical and professional course. =SCERT= The Mizoram State Council of Educational Research & Training was started in January 1980. It is an academic wing of the Directorate of School Education and is located at Chaltlang since its establishment. SCERT is responsible for qualitative improvement of school education from primary to higher secondary schools, non-formal education and teacher education. It is also responsible for successful implementation of various education projects sponsored by central government, UNICEF as well as state government. =District Institute of Education and Training (DIET)= The DIET in Mizoram was first established on 1 September 1973 at Chaltlang. It is a centre of training for school teachers which is mandatory for incumbent employees. It was then established at Lunglei and subsequently at all the other district capitals i.e. Saiha, Lawngtlai, Kolasib, Champhai, Serchhip and Mamit in 2005. Mizoram Board of School Education Mizoram Board of School Education is an autonomous academic body under the purview of the Department of Education, Government of Mizoram, India. It is an authority on conducting state level examinations of schools. The Mizoram State Board of School Examination evaluates students' progress by conducting two board examinations-one at the end of class 10 and the other at the end of class 12. Higher and technical education Higher education under the Government of Mizoram is administered by the Directorate of Higher and Technical Education. It became the Department of Higher & Technical Education in 1989, with its head office at MacDonald Hill, Zarkawt.

There are 20 colleges, 2 deficit colleges including one Aizawl Law College, two training colleges (B.Ed. Training College and Hindi Training College) and two polytechnics under its jurisdiction. Right to education The Government of Mizoram adopted the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, and based on it has enacted its own Mizoram Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules, 2011. The rules demand compulsory schooling for children aged between 6 and 14 years, special training for children in need of special development, provision of free textbooks and writing materials, free uniforms for BPL children. SSA in Mizoram Mizoram state education department started implementing Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan from the financial year 2000-2001. Funds were utilised for various activities, such as conducting household survey, training of teachers, preparation of district plan, purchase of vehicles, etc. At the initial stage, when only Saiha district was selected for starting pre-project activities, there was no society constituted for this programme and no district committee was formed either. As a result, District Education Officer (DEO), Saiha and supporting staff in consultation with Directorate of School Education, carried out the pre-project activities. \\"The Mizoram Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan Raja Mission Rules 2001\\" was passed by the Mizoram Legislative Assembly and the same was published in the Mizoram Gazette on 1 August 2001. In the same year the Mizoram Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan mission was registered under the societies registration (extension to Mizoram) Act 1976 (Mizoram Act No. 3 of 1977).

The main industry at Solikamsk was salt production, which Mikhail tried at first, but then switched to copper mining. In 1731 he managed to build his own factory, the Troitsky Copper Smelting Plant.

Ulegyria is identified by its characteristic \\"mushroom-shaped\\" gyri, in which scarring causes shrinkage and atrophy in the deep sulcal regions while the surface gyri are spared. This condition is most often caused by hypoxic- ischemic brain injury in the perinatal period. The effects of ulegyria can range in severity, although it is most commonly associated with cerebral palsy, mental retardation and epilepsy. N.C. Bresler was the first to view ulegyria in 1899 and described this abnormal morphology in the brain as ‚Äúmushroom-gyri.\\" Although ulegyria was first identified in 1899, there is still limited information known or reported about the condition. Gyrus vs. sulcus Anatomy Arteries supplying the brain The physical features of ulegyria consist of small radial scars which occupy the cortical sulci. Overall, the physical structure of affected areas in the brain is described as a ‚Äúmushroom‚Äù-like shape in which the gyri are unusually large and the sulci become wider deeper in the cortex. N.C. Bresler, the first person to view a brain with ulegyria in 1899, coined the phrase mushroom gyri. He also named the disorder, basing it off the Latin root ule, meaning scar. This mushroom- like structure is the result of the lower parts of the ulegyria-affected area being more prone to deterioration, while the upper gyri are usually spared. However, the entire affected area shrinks and presents brown coloration as a result of ulegyria. In addition, ‚Äúislands‚Äù of neurons that are relatively unaffected can exist between ulegyria affected neurons. Ulegyria can develop bilaterally or unilaterally, though the former is more commonly diagnosed. Ulegyria can affect many parts of the brain including the cerebral cortex, parasagittal areas and posterior regions of the brain, such as the parietal and occipital lobes. These areas are situated either near artery rich regions or near a major cerebral artery. For instance, specifically in neonatal children, ulegyria-affected areas are found near the posterior cerebral artery or near the artery rich region between the middle and posterior regions of the brain, often referred to as watershed regions. Neurons affected by ulegyria exhibit properties that differ from normally functioning neurons. For instance, ulegyria affected neurons experience gliosis in which glial cells, specifically astrocytes, build up near and around neurons. Ulegyria affected neurons also display decreases in their white matter content, showing signs of sclerosis, which is characterized by the deterioration of myelin in neurons. However, in regions of grey matter, large dense aggregates of myelin are present. Ulegyria affected neurons also display metabolic disorders which could be linked to the disease phenylketonuria and disruptions in the urea cycle. Hypoglycemia and hypoxia are also thought to accompany the symptoms of ulegyria-affected neurons as well. Causes Microphotograph of HE stained section of human brain tissue upon acute ischemic stroke Ulegyria develops as a result of a brain injury called cerebral ischemia surrounding the time of an infant‚Äôs birth. Oftentimes, fetal hypoxic-ischemic brain injuries occur as a result of a pregnancy complications such as placental abruption, cord accident, or cardiovascular stress due to a difficult delivery. A lack of oxygen to the brain contributes to the formation of lesions usually near the three main cerebral arteries, located near the parietal lobe and occipital lobes of the brain. The cause of perinatal brain injuries includes: :1. cerebral ischemia :2. cerebral hemorrhage :3. ascending intrauterine infections. Some risk factors for perinatal brain injuries include: low birth weight, preterm birth, poor perinatal cardiorespiratory fitness, and artificial ventilation. =Cerebral ischemia= Cerebral ischemia occurs when the brain is not receiving adequate oxygen to continue normal functions. When this occurs, the body makes restoring oxygenated blood flow to life-sustaining organs a priority. The brain alters the diameter of major blood vessels to redistribute blood to key organs such as the brain, heart, and adrenal glands. If sympathetic nervous system activation does not produce any improvement, oxygen levels will continue to fall and disruptions to metabolism, other cellular processes, and overall functioning will ensue. Another serious result of inefficient blood flow is that cells do not receive adequate amounts of glucose. An immediate effect of low intracellular glucose is reduced ATP production in the cell. This effectively inactivates the Na-K pump, leading to the uptake of calcium ions by the cell. Continued influx of calcium serves to constitutively activate downstream effectors, including lipases, proteases, and endonucleases, whose actions eventually destroy the cell skeleton. Intracellular calcium concentrations are increased further due to the opening of glutamate-regulated ion channels. Ischemia causes anoxic cell depolarizations and it is this increase in membrane potential at the presynaptic cell that triggers the release of glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter. Glucose deprivation in the brain for any amount of time has the potential to pose serious consequences, and the amount of time the brain spends under these anoxic conditions is directly related to accumulation of irreversible damage to protein biosynthesis pathways. Protein synthesis all over the body is severely inhibited and essentially comes to a standstill while the brain is suffering from acute oxygen deprivation. Once oxygen sufficiently saturates the tissues again, protein biosynthesis returns to normal in non-vulnerable areas but remains at below normal levels in other areas. Insufficient protein synthesis in the brain is especially troubling in the fetal brain given the amount of growth and development that normally occurs. Areas particularly vulnerable to the damaging effects of hypoxic episodes include: the superior brainstem, the cerebellum, white matter and subcortical structures supplied by the branches of deep and superficial penetrating blood vessels. Vulnerable areas where protein synthesis is interrupted usually indicate impending cell death in neurons. When oxygen levels return, oxygen radicals, nitric oxide and an imbalance of neurotransmitters cause further damage and lead to cellular death through apoptosis. Neuron cell death is responsible for gliosis and results in the mushroom appearance of areas and is characteristic of ulegyria. =Cerebral hemorrhage= A cerebral hemorrhage is the result of immature blood vessels of a brain lesion bursting. The germinal matrix is a part of the brain that normally disappears as the fetal brain develops but during this process it is not unusual for changes in vessel volume to cause a vessel to burst. According to recent microscopic studies, the most common location for a cerebral hemorrhage is where the medullary veins drain to the terminal vein in the sub- ependymal region. It has been hypothesized that because pre-term babies don‚Äôt have fully developed sympathetic nervous systems, they cannot react as well to low oxygen saturation levels caused by the cerebral hemorrhage. Although babies born at full-term are still susceptible to this, they are likely to respond better and thus, tend to have better outcomes in response to low- oxygen events. =Ascending intrauterine infections= Recent research has found a connection between intrauterine infections and inflammation in the mother and an increased likelihood of perinatal brain damage in the fetus. This study suggested that intrauterine infections in the mother could affect glial cells and toll-like receptors (TLRs) which are important in moderating the inflammatory response in the fetal brain. When glial cells and TLRs are negatively affected they are not able to react to developing inflammation in the brain as well. The connection between ascending intrauterine infections and perinatal brain damage is a developing research theory but a more detailed explanation of the connection is not yet known. Signs and symptoms Ulegyria was found in about 1/3 of patients with defects caused by circulatory disease in the perinatal period. Most clinical observations of the condition report mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and seizures as the main defects. However, milder cases have been reported in which patients that exhibit ulegyria develop relatively normally. The main movement disorders associated with ulegyria that are classified as cerebral palsy are choreoathetosis, dystonia, and ataxia. It is suspected that ulegyria leads to epilepsy because malformation of the cortex obstructs the differentiation of neurons, glial cells, and synapses. Parietal-occipital lobe epilepsy, which is often synonymous with posterior cortex epilepsy (PCE), is the form of the disease seen in most cases involving ulegyria. This type of epilepsy is very rare, making up about 5% of all reports of epilepsy. This form of the disease involves symptoms that would be expected from damage to the parietal and occipital lobes: seizures with visual hallucinations, visuospatial dysfunction, tingling, numbness, pain, and a burning sensation. In addition to ulegyria, tumors and cortical dysplasia constitute the major causes of PCE. Most of the epilepsy seen in conjunction with ulegyria is classified as medically refractory, meaning it is not responsive to treatment. Patients usually present symptoms of epilepsy at an early age. The severity of epilepsy has been shown to depend on this age of onset as well as the quantity of cortical lesions; earlier onset of epilepsy and a larger extent of lesions tends to mean more severe seizures. Similar conditions Child presenting with seizures likely due to polymicrogyria (seen at arrow). Ulegyria is often confused with a similar distortion of the cortex known as polymicrogyria. Polymicrogyria is characterized by excessive folding of the surface gyri and a thickening of the cerebral cortex, rather than the sulcal scarring that is typical of ulegyria. In addition to morphological differences, the period in which polmicrogyria and ulegyria emerge is also different. Polymicrogyria typically forms while the embryo's central nervous system is maturing. Ulegyria is acquired later in development during the perinatal period after neuronal migration has already occurred. It is also suspected that polymicrogyra is genetically linked, whereas ulegyria is caused by environmental factors‚Äînamely lack of oxygen. Polymicrogyria can lead to similar conditions that are linked to ulegyria such as mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and epilepsy. It has been observed that patients with polymicrogyria are not receptive to epilepsy surgery. However, responses of patients with ulegyria to similar surgeries are still not fully known, which makes distinction of these two disorders significant. In vivo neuroimaging techniques, namely MRI, have been instrumental in making this distinction. An MRI image of ulegyria is identified by mushroom shaped gyri, deformities in white matter, and localization mainly in the posterior cerebral region. Polymicrogyria is typically recognized by a scalloped appearance at the bordering region between grey and white matter. Although these distinctions have been made with many patients, there is still some difficulty in defining distinct boundaries between these two similar conditions. Detection Primarily, the main method of detecting ulegyria is through the use of MRI screening for epilepsy. Normally an MRI of an ulegyria affected region will reveal groups of deteriorated neurons with gliosis present. In addition, unaffected gyri are also present in especially bilateral watershed regions indicating delayed effects of perinatal hypoxic damage. However, there are three main criteria for diagnosing ulegyria using MRI in addition to the features mentioned above: :1.The presence of a poorly demarcated lesion :2. Atrophy and thinning of the cortex resulting in the characteristic ‚Äúmushroom‚Äù like shape of ulegyria. :3. Presence of white matter signal abnormalities as a result of FLAIR signaling (fluid attenuated inversion recovery). Another sign of ulegyria that is visible on an MRI scan is the presence of a widened subarachnoid space, signifying cortex atrophy. FLAIR signaling can help visualize the depths of the parietal-occipital sulci, which also allows ulegyria-affected gyri to be identified. Though there is still confusion in differentiating ulegyria and polymicrogyria in patients, MRI allows for the proper identification in the majority of the cases. In addition, most of the current research regarding ulegyria is focused on improving this identification. Furthermore, MRI can diagnose whether ulegyria presence is unilateral or bilateral. Electroencephalography, EEG, can also be used to screen for ulegyria, though MRI is still preferred. This is mainly done for epilepsy patients as abnormalities in EEG recordings indicate the presence of ulegyria in the area of the brain being tested. For example, when EEG tests in epileptic patients show deviations in the frontal and central-parietal regions, ulegyria can be considered to be present in that area. Treatment Presently, there is no well-defined treatment for ulegyria mainly because of the irreversible ischaemic damage done to neurons of an affected area. However, conditions associated with ulegyria, such as epilepsy and cerebral palsy, can be treated using the appropriate treatment. For instance, seizures caused by epilepsy, due to the presence of ulegyria in the occipital lobe, can be controlled using antiepileptic drugs in some patients. In other patients, such as those who suffer from ulegyria in the posterior cortex, drugs are not effective and surgery of the area causing epilepsy is needed. These treatments treat only the conditions but have no effect on the condition of ulegyria itself.

Having started his career as a youth at Celta Vigo, Pogba played briefly for Quimper in France before following his more famous brother Paul to the United Kingdom, where he played for Wrexham and Crewe Alexandra. After four years in the English leagues, he moved to Italian Serie B side Pescara in 2014, but returned to England with Crawley Town only a few months later. After short spells at Scotland's Partick Thistle and in the Netherlands at Sparta Rotterdam, he joined Tours in September 2018. During the 2019‚Äì20 season, he played in Spain for both Manchego and Lorca. Pogba has also played five times for the Guinea national team since his debut in 2013. Club career =Early career= After growing up in Paris, Pogba joined the youth system at Spanish side Celta Vigo along with his twin brother Florentin. The pair left the club in 2009, with Pogba stating his time there was difficult due to language barriers, living abroad and being away from his family. He returned to France to join fourth division side Quimper, scoring twice in the league during one season at the club. While at the club, he lived with Algerian international Riyad Mahrez. =Wrexham= In September 2010, Pogba joined Conference National side Wrexham after a successful trial spell in August 2010. Pogba made his Wrexham debut seven days later, coming on as a substitute for Curtis Obeng in the 75th minutes, in a 0‚Äì0 draw against Fleetwood Town. It took until 3 January 2011 for Pogba to score his first Wrexham goal, in a 2‚Äì0 win over Bath City. Pogba then scored two goals in two games against Cambridge United and Mansfield Town. His fourth goal later came on 22 February 2011, in a 1‚Äì0 win over Wimbledon. His scoring form in January soon led Pogba to sign a new contract, keeping him at the club until 2012. Pogba made 29 appearance and scored four times in his first season at Wrexham. In the 2011‚Äì12 season, Pogba played in the first two games, but was then dropped for two matches, due to an off-the- pitch issue. He returned to the first team against Alfreton Town and scored his first goal of the season in a 4‚Äì1 win. By the end of December, Pogba had scored a further six times (against Grimsby Town, Hayes & Yeading United, Luton Town, Lincoln City. and two against Gateshead) in 22 appearances.

On his return, Pogba scored in a 4‚Äì1 win over Hayes & Yeading United on 18 February 2012. He later added three more goals (against Ebbsfleet United, Darlington and Braintree Town). He was voted the club's young player of the year during the 2011‚Äì12 season. Out of contract at the end of the year, Pogba was offered a new two-year deal by the club, which he rejected in a bid to play football at a higher level. Wrexham boss Andy Morrell criticised Pogba's handling of the situation, describing him as \\"disrespectful\\" to the club after not informing them of his intention to leave until 48-hours before the start of the club's pre-season. =Crewe Alexandra= After leaving Wrexham, Pogba signed for Crewe Alexandra on 7 July 2012 on a two-year deal. After scoring eight goals in 11 pre-season friendly matches, Pogba was given the number 9 shirt ahead of the new season. Pogba quickly made an impact when he scored twice on his debut against Hartlepool in a League Cup first round tie on 11 August. A week later, he scored on his league debut, notching a 78th minute consolation in a 2‚Äì1 defeat to Notts County, which Pogba scored two weeks later, in a 5‚Äì1 loss against Brentford. However, Pogba suffered a knee injury that kept him out of action for the most of September. He made his first team return, coming on as a substitute for A-Jay Leitch-Smith in the 62nd minute, in a 1‚Äì0 loss against Milton Keynes Dons on 29 September 2012. By the end of December, Pogba scored four more league goals in 20 appearances (against Doncaster Rovers, Colchester United, Sheffield United and Oldham Athletic), while scoring two more goals in separate cup competitions against Wycombe Wanderers and Doncaster Rovers. After two months without scoring, Pogba ended his goal drought when he scored in a 2‚Äì1 loss against Bournemouth on 12 February 2013. Pogba later added four more goals - one each against Portsmouth, and Colchester United and a brace against MK Dons. However, Pogba suffered a torn thigh that sidelined him for the rest of the season, resulting him having an operation. Despite missing out for the Football League Trophy Final and the club's promotion to League One, Pogba made 41 appearance and scoring 16 times (making him the club's top scorer of the 2012‚Äì13 season) in all competitions. Ahead of the 2013‚Äì14 season, the club‚Äôs head physio Rob Sharp expected Pogba to be fit for the start of pre-season friendlies. Pogba was included in five pre-season matches still in shirt number 9. However, he sustained a medial ligament injury to his right knee during a 2‚Äì0 defeat to a Manchester United XI. It was announced that he would be out for at least three months. By the end of October, Pogba returned to light training under supervision from the club's head physio and conditioning coach. While regaining his fitness, Pogba signed a contract extension with the club, keeping him at the club until 2015. By the end of December, he returned to full training to maintain his fitness.

Despite an injury-hit 2013‚Äì14 season, he made 22 appearances and scored five times. Ahead of the 2014‚Äì15 season, manager Steve Davis was determined that Pogba could play as a central striker, but Pogba wanted to leave Crewe despite the club's attempt to persuade him to stay. Crewe accepted a bid from Pescara. Pogba later explained in The Guardian that he wanted to leave Crewe to step up to new challenges. =Pescara and Crawley Town= Pogba signed for Serie B team Pescara in July 2014, joining his brother Paul of Juventus in Italy for an undisclosed fee. He made his Pescara debut on 28 September 2014, coming on as a substitute for Matteo Politano in the 84th minute, in a 2‚Äì1 loss against Catania.

Pogba signed for League One team Crawley Town on 4 February 2015 after his release by Pescara. Three days after signing for the club, he made his Crawley Town debut, in a 2‚Äì1 loss against Yeovil Town.

Campaign Caroline Lucas and Adrian Ramsay campaigned for re-election together and shared materials such as a website and leaflets promoting them both together.

Background King John's attempt to force John de Gray's election as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1205 was the beginning of the king's long quarrel with Pope Innocent III. Traditionally English kings had broad powers over the English Church, and this had survived the Becket controversy during John's father's reign. John, however, reigned concurrently with Innocent III, who was one of the foremost exponents of the concept of papal monarchy.Turner King John p. 109 After Hubert Walter's death in July 1205, the selection of a successor was hindered by doubts about what the proper procedure should be, something that commonly happened with elections to Canterbury. King John postponed a decision while delegations from the bishops of England and the monks of the cathedral chapter went to Rome to seek guidance from the pope. The bishops of the province of Canterbury claimed the right to a say in who was elected, as whoever was chosen would be their superior,Harding England in the Thirteenth Century p. 266 but according to canon law the monks of the cathedral chapter had the right to elect the new archbishop. The king also had a say in the election,Lyon Constitutional and Legal History pp. 306‚Äì307 as the archbishop was a major tenant-in-chief and was traditionally one of the principal royal advisors.Huscroft Ruling England pp. 195‚Äì196 While the delegations from the various parties were in Rome, the monks of Canterbury secretly elected one of their own, Reginald, as archbishop, and subsequently sent him to Rome to join the delegation. When King John discovered that Reginald had been elected without any royal input he forced the monks to elect de Gray as archbishop.Warren King John pp. 160-162 Some stories have Reginald's election taking place before the despatch of the first delegation to the papal curia. Another source, Gervase of Canterbury, has the king telling the chapter they could choose their own nominee after six months, while the king secretly sent envoys to Rome to secure de Gray's election.Jones King John and Magna Carta pp. 35‚Äì37 A further story, from Roger of Wendover, states that the monks elected Reginald before Walter was even buried, and that only a few members of the cathedral chapter ‚Äì the younger ones ‚Äì participated in the election. Wendover wrote in the 1230s and was not a monk of Canterbury, therefore it is unlikely he has recorded a true account.Knowles \\"Canterbury Election\\" English Historical Review pp. 212‚Äì215 De Gray was postulated, or nominated, to Canterbury on 11 December 1205, which presented Innocent with two candidates for the office. In an effort to reach a compromise,Lyon Constitutional and Legal History p. 240 the pope quashed both nominations on about 30 March 1206;Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 232 Innocent's reason for invalidating de Gray's candidacy was that any election was invalid if an earlier one was still under appeal to the papacy.Turner King John p. 116 The monks then elected Stephen Langton, with Innocent's approval. John did not accept Langton's candidacy however, and Innocent's consecration of Langton in 1207 led to an eight-year struggle between John and the pope over the rights of the king to secure the election of his choice as archbishop. John refused to allow Langton to enter England and exiled the Canterbury monks. Innocent placed an interdict on England in 1207, which John countered by confiscating the income and estates of any clergy who enforced it. Innocent went on to excommunicate John in 1209, in a dispute that led to the exile of many of the English clergy and John's imposition of heavy financial demands on the church in England; by 1209 de Gray and Peter des Roches, the Bishop of Winchester, were the only English bishops not in exile or dead. But it was not until 1213, when Innocent began to support John's deposition, that the king became concerned and reached a settlement with the papacy.Huscroft Ruling England pp. 196‚Äì197 Citations References   Episcopacy in Anglicanism History of Canterbury Medieval Kent 13th-century elections 13th-century Catholicism 1205 in England ","title":"Canterbury election of 1205"},{"id":"36584844","text":"3B / B√¶rums Verk IF (3B/BVIF) is a basketball club which was founded in 2002 by BLNO coach P√•l Berg. 3B is a combination of EB-85, B√¶rums Verk IF and Sandvika BBK.

Biography =Origin and early life= Vatatzes was of low birth, hailing from the region around Adrianople and Didymoteichon. He likely entered military service under Emperor Manuel I Komnenos (), but details of his early life are otherwise unknown. He apparently reached sufficient prominence to be married, around 1187, to an unnamed daughter of Isaac Angelos Doukas, uncle to the emperor Isaac II Angelos (). Married to a cousin of the emperor, Vatatzes suddenly became a member of the senior aristocracy: he was awarded the rank of sebastos, and the path to senior military commands opened to him. =Ousting of Theodore Mankaphas= His first office after the marriage was likely as military governor (doux) of the small province of Mylasa and Melanoudion, which he is known to have held in August 1189. From there he was promoted to \\"Grand Domestic of the East\\" and governor of the extensive Thracesian Theme. In this capacity he had to deal with the usurper Theodore Mankaphas. Mankaphas had launched a rebellion , when he proclaimed himself as emperor in Philadelphia. The revolt was short-lived, as Isaac II besieged the city and forced Mankaphas to submit, but the latter was pardoned and allowed to continue as governor of the city.. In , however, Basil Vatatzes was sent against Theodore Mankaphas, who had rebelled once more. This time Vataztes effectively ended the rebellion and forced the usurper to flee to the court of the Seljuk Turks at Iconium. =Bulgarian rebellion= Soon after he was appointed Domestic of the West (as with his contemporary and co-commander, Alexios Gidos, it is unclear if he was a real Grand Domestic or simply Domestic), based at Adrianople. His primary task was to confront the ongoing Bulgarian rebellion in the northern Balkans. In 1193 he refused any military support to the rebellion of his brother-in-law Constantine Angelos Doukas, a cousin to the emperor and commander of the Byzantine armies in Philippopolis. Doukas proclaimed himself emperor and marched his troops onto Adrianople, but he was betrayed by his followers and surrendered to Isaac II Angelos for a pardon in return. In 1194 Isaac II ordered Vatatzes and Gidos to campaign against the Bulgarians. The Byzantines were defeated, and Vatatzes was killed, at the Battle of Arcadiopolis. Family He was likely the father of John III Doukas Vatatzes, the future Emperor of Nicaea, as well as of John's two older brothers, the sebastokrator Isaac Doukas Vatatzes, and anonymous middle son, whose daughter married the protovestiarios Alexios Raoul.

TECT is partnered with the Global Connection Partnership Network, Overseas Council International, and the European Baptist Mission. These organizations provide short term and long term supportive staff to the college. For the 2012-13 school year, the campus has 37 Sierra Leonean staff and faculty members, with 4 American staff and faculty members in lecturer or administrative support roles. The College is one of the leading Tertiary Institution in Sierra Leone, the college administration ensures that students are always well dressed and are decent and presentable.

All the lecture rooms in the Campus are air- conditioned with ultra modern facility and free internet access and a well stocked computer lab. History In 1957, an Inter-Missions Bible School Committee was formed by four Christian denominations in Sierra Leone: The Missionary Church of Africa (MCA), United Brethren in Christ (UBC), and the American Wesleyan Methodist Church (AWM) now called the Wesleyan Church of Sierra Leone.TECT Strategic Plan 2006-2011 This committee formed from the identified need for training pastors and administrators for the Christian churches of Sierra Leone. During the transition from colonial rule which was finalized in 1961, the committee requested from British government to obtain land for a campus. The British government granted the land and buildings of a former military barracks located on the Jui Peninsula 10 miles east of Freetown, Sierra Leone‚Äôs capital city. On October 12, 1964, the Sierra Leone Bible College was founded and begun offering both diploma and bachelor‚Äôs level degrees. The campus was initially led and run by western missionaries, predominantly from the United States. The missionaries, and their sending denominations, provided funding for all the operations of the campus. During this time, the enrolment year to year varied between ten and thirty students. In 1979, the Baptist Convention of Sierra Leone was added as a proprietary body. In 1998, the Countess of Huntington Connexion was added as a proprietary body and the Missionary Church of Africa (MCA) withdrew its proprietorship. In 1999, the campus officially changed its name to The Evangelical College of Theology (TECT). During the Civil War When the civil war escalated in the 1990s, the western missionary leadership of the college gathered several alumni who were then in positions of church leadership in Sierra Leone. The missionaries informed the Sierra Leoneans that they were withdrawing both their personnel and financial support of the campus and handed full leadership to the Sierra Leoneans. This presented a challenge to the new national leadership. Enrolment and tuition of ten to thirty students each year did not financially provide for the needs and upkeep of the campus. As a result, additional programs were initiated and the enrolment was grown from thirty to over 200 students each semester at the main campus in Jui outside of Freetown.

It depicts the true life story of Scottish criminal Paul Ferris. Due to the film's sympathetic portrayal of Ferris, Strathclyde Police refused to help the filmmakers make the film in Glasgow, Ferris's native city. The production team had to film in London instead due to the lack of support from the legal authorities in Glasgow. Plot In 1990, Paul Ferris (Martin Compston) is jailed at Barlinnie Prison in Glasgow. In his cell, he reflects on his childhood. One night, young Paul's father puts him to bed after he is awoken by a fight in a van outside. He tells young Paul how to survive in the world; To always beware of strangers, to always be loyal, and to be a \\"lion\\" and avoid following others in his actions. The next morning, whilst walking his dog, Paul witnesses an armed robbery at a local off-licence by the Banks brothers, infamous local hooligans of a crime family, who afterwards harass young Paul and murder his dog. During his teenage years, Paul is making his way to a party, when his father spies him carrying a knife, and convinces him to drop it. Later, the Banks brothers crash the party, threatening Paul and wrecking the house. In a fit of rage, Paul goes back to retrieve the knife, and returns to the house to find two of the Banks brothers sexually assaulting his girlfriend. He stabs both of them (albeit not killing them) and flees to his older sister's house, where she berates him for the violence, as their older brother is serving life in prison for murder. Paul tells her he enjoyed the violence, as it made him feel in control. In prison, Paul arranges for one of the Banks brothers in prison to be killed, and fights his associate and friend Bob in order to be thrown into solitary confinement as an alibi. The prison warden lectures him about his overconfident attitude, and tells him he'll be imprisoned again after he leaves three days later. Paul is released and is taken home by childhood friends Jimmy and Johnny, refusing an invitation to a party thrown for Paul by Glasgow godfather Arthur Thompson. Paul recalls his father telling him to steer clear of Thompson, calling him \\"The Devil incarnate.\\" Paul struggles to reconnect with his wife Anne Marie, who argues with him out of fear of him being imprisoned or killed. Later, Paul goes to the local pub to meet with Arthur Thompson, and encounters his obnoxious, cocaine-addicted son Junior \\"Fat Boy\\" Thompson. When Paul meets with Arthur, the godfather praises Paul for the hit in prison, and gives him a job. At this point, Paul recalls his childhood, when he had witnessed Arthur executing a man at gunpoint; and later, young Paul and his friends had taken the dead man's money from his wallet, money the police eventually confiscate when they interview young Paul and his parents about the murder. Later, Paul's father tells him to never tell anyone else secrets such as whatever he had seen that day. Paul and Anne Marie attend a Hogmanay party held by Arthur and his wife Rita. To Junior's scorn, he talks to Paul in private about how Junior was scammed for ¬£50,000 worth of drugs, and tasks Paul with retrieving the drug money. Later that night, while on her way home, a car bombing kills Arthur's mother and leaves Arthur hospitalised. Arthur orders Paul and associate Tam to find the culprits. They are informed that the Banks brothers were responsible for the attack. Notorious gangster Tam \\"The Licensee\\" McGraw (John Hannah) makes it clear that Paul and his associate have his support in their retaliation. Meanwhile, Anne Marie becomes pregnant, at which Paul is overjoyed. While Paul and Junior are on a job, an attempt on the sighted Banks brothers' lives goes awry when Junior says he has come unarmed; however Paul later sees that Junior was, in fact, armed. Junior later reveals to Arthur his jealousy of Arthur praising Paul, sparking his rivalry. Later that night, Arthur gives the green light to a home invasion massacre of the Banks family. Junior's rivalry with Paul escalates when he attempts to kill the Banks' mother and one of the brothers' wife, at which Paul intervenes and holds Junior at gunpoint. During a debt collection job, Tam and Paul witnesses Junior slash a father's face in front of his children, which shocks and disturbs Paul due to Anne Marie's pregnancy. Paul expresses to Anne Marie his wish to leave Glasgow as a result of the slashing incident, saying that he has become what he had always hated, and that he wishes to turn his back on crime. Junior is later seen to be secretly working with McGraw to assassinate Arthur, and to have Paul imprisoned. While Paul is serving an eighteen month sentence for possessing a weapon, McGraw has Paul framed for sanctioning a hit attempt on Arthur. As a result, Paul vilifies the Thompsons. After serving his sentence and meeting his young son, Paul is told by Anne Marie that she no longer loves him. In an effort to draw out Paul, Junior has Paul's father beaten up in an alley. McGraw tells Paul he supports him in his wish for vengeance on Junior. Paul goes looking for Junior, but cannot find him. Later, Junior, while on a cocaine binge, is brutally executed outside Arthur's home and the getaway driver is overheard shouting the name 'Paul' to the masked assailant. Paul is arrested and remanded in custody for Junior's murder. With Paul in jail, Arthur sanctions the murder of Jimmy, Johnny, and associates Bobby and Joe, in joint effort with McGraw. Paul learns of McGraw's betrayal, and threatens him, saying that he will take revenge when he is released. Paul is eventually acquitted of Junior's murder, and makes a public statement of how he resents Arthur and explains how he was being framed as a police informant. Final scenes show McGraw escaping assassination and boarding a flight to Tenerife, but despairs as he notices Tam and Bob sitting behind him on the plane. The film closes with text stating the current fates of the depicted real-life characters: Anne Marie and Paul have since separated; after many attempts on his life, Arthur \\"The Godfather\\" Thompson died of natural causes at 61; Junior Thompson's murder remains unsolved; Rita Thompson never got over Arthur and Junior's deaths and died of a broken heart; Tam \\"The Licensee\\" McGraw died aged 55 (of a heart attack); Bobby and Joe's murders remain unsolved; Paul Ferris still lives in Glasgow, and has since turned his back on crime.

It was his first play to be staged at the Maly Theatre, where it premiered on 20 August 1853. Background The Poor Bride, his second large play, caused Ostrovsky much trouble. Later he wrote: \\"I've had an iron-like creative prowess when I was learning how to write, but still, after having worked for a year and a half on The Poor Bride (my second one) I came to detest it so much I didn't want to see it on stage. I agreed to stage it only responding to the continuous actors' requests, two years after it was finished.\\" The plot has been changed thrice. The target of Ostrovsky's satire was Saint Petersburg's 'romantic poseurs'. Merich (Zorich in the rough version) was \\"a parody on Lermontov's heroes, Grushnitsky, trying to act Pechorin,\\" according to the scholar Vladimir Lakshin. His name came from Lermontov's Meri (with a typically Lermontov-like surname ending, like in Vulich, Zvezdich or Kazbich). In one of the play's versions Marya Andreyevna was holding Lermontov's book in hand. \\"The charisma of a disappointed romantic hero which became a clich√© in the Russian literature of the 1840s was waiting for a literary backlash,\\" Lakshin wrote. Another biographer, S.V. Maksimov, insisted the play's characters were portraits of the real people who surrounded the author, rather than mere schemes. The Nezabudkins had similarities with the Korsh family (three brothers and five sisters were all known in the artistic circles), Benevolensky's prototype was professor Krylov, one of the Korsh sisters' husband and the main reason for Ostrovsky's leaving the university (who failed the latter at the exam, allegedly waiting for a bribe). The liaison between Khorkov and Marya Andreyevna served as a parallel to the unhappy relations between one of the Korsh sisters, Antonina, and Apollon Grigoryev, according to Lakshin. For V.A. Grigoriev (Apollon's grandson), though, Marya Andreyevna looked more like Zinaida Korsh whom the author himself fancied. The singer, folklorist and later senior state official Terty Filippov was a prototype for the Milashin character. \\"Benevolensky, Dobrotvorsky and Merich were all the real people Ostrovsky was meeting in the Korsh's house, or elsewhere. But in reality there was no such marriage as the one described in the play,\\" V.A.Grigoryev argued. History Ostrovsky first mentioned The Poor Bride in a letter to Mikhail Pogodin in the summer of 1850. On October 31 that year he recited fragments of it in his editor's home. In the summer of 1851 the play was finished but the author continued to make changes to the text. On November 3 he informed Pogodin: \\"The comedy is lagging behind a bit for I've heard Pisemsky's comedy [The Hyppochondriac] and found it necessary to embellish my own a bit so as not to blush for it.\\"A.N.Ostrovsky's letters to Pogodin. The Lenin's Library collection, 1939, vol. IV, p. 12. In December the play was submitted to censors. On 19 February the permission for the magazine publication was received and the play appeared in the February issue of Moskvityanin. In 1859 The Poor Bride was re-issued as part of The Works by A.N.Ostrovsky in two volumes (published by Count Grigory Kushelev-Bezborodko), again after harsh authorial editing. This version of the text is considered to be the final one and it was in this form that the play would be reproduced in numerous collections and anthologies in the years to come. It took half a year for censors to give the permission for the stage production. In September 1852 The Poor Bride was pronounced eligible for the Maly Theatre stage, much to the credit of censor Gederstern who interpreted it as romantic drama and ignored its social undercurrents. Two roles, those of Dunya and Pasha, though, had to be cancelled and re-appeared in the text only in October 1861. Angered by the cuts, Ostrovsky asked Verstovsky to delay the production of the Bride and wait for his next play, Stay in Your Own Sled, which he was working upon. The Poor Bride was premi√®red in Maly Theater on August 20, 1853, with Agrafena Saburova as Nezabudkina, Ekaterina Vasilyeva (Marya Andreyevna), Nikolai Cherkasov (Merich), Sergey Vasilyev (Milashin), Sergey Shumsky (Dobrotvorsky), Prov Sadovsky (Benevolensky), Kornely Poltavtsev (Khorkov) and Sophia Akimova (Khorkova). On October 12, 1863, the play was performed in the Alexandrinsky Theatre, as a benefit for actress Maria Chitau (Maria Andreyevna). The permission for the play to be performed at the Russian public theatres came only on 3 May 1893, the characters of Dunya and Pasha again excised. Reception On March 20, 1852, Aleksey Pisemsky wrote to Ostrovsky: \\"I've read the comedy of yours with the greatest of pleasure and found it not just equal but even superior to It's a Family Affair-We'll Settle It Ourselves. Its humour is more subtle and soulful while the characters are so vivid they even visit me in dreams.\\"The Unpublished letters to A.N.Ostrovsky.

Ivan Turgenev opined that the play failed to meet the expectations which were too high after the Family Affair, but found \\"its general colour very true\\" and \\"the second act beautiful from the first word to the last.\\"Turgenev, I.S. Some words on the new Ostrovsky's comedy The Poor Bride. Sovremennik, 1852, No.4. In 1879, re-issuing his article, Turgenev revised his initial assessment and called the play \\"one of this dramatist's best\\". Nikolai Chernyshevsky found the play \\"very good\\" even if lacking \\"the sense of revelation\\" which had been brought by the Family Affair.Chernyshevsky, N.G. Poverty is no Vice, Sovremennik, 1854, V. The comprehensive analysis of the play was provided by Nikolai Dobrolyubov in his 1859 essay. Having described in full the difficult situation Marya Andreyevna, the \\"poor bride\\", found herself in, the critic poised the question: \\"What this hapless creature suffers all these insults for, what keeps her in this mire?\\" - and gave the answer: \\"It is obvious, what: she is a poor bride, she has nothing to do other than sit there waiting or go seeking for the right kind of fianc√©e... Modern liberals scorn this, but one would like to know - what is there left in our society to do for a young girl who fails to marry?\\" According to Dobrolyubov, in his play Ostrovsky gave \\"the direct answer\\" to the most important question of the day: \\"why in our families a woman finds herself in a slave-like situation and why does samodurstvo [petty tyranny] hits her particularly hard.\\" External links *English Translation of the play by John Laurence Seymour and George Rapall Noyes (1933) (archive.org) References 1852 plays Plays by Alexander Ostrovsky ","title":"The Poor Bride"},{"id":"36585062","text":"William Jackson (Jack) Schull (17 March 1922 ‚Äì 20 June 2017) was an American geneticist and Professor Emeritus of Human Genetics at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. He worked for the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission in Japan, was one of the founding members of the Department of Human Genetics at the University of Michigan, and was the founding director of the Center for Demographic and Population Genetics at the University of Texas at Houston. His scientific contributions include studies on the effects of ionizing radiation on human health, the role of heredity and the interaction of heredity and environment in the etiology of chronic disease, the effects of inbreeding in human populations, the mechanisms of adaptations to hypoxic conditions, and the genetic epidemiology of populations burdened by chronic diseases associated with low socio-economic status. Early life, military service, and education Schull was born in Louisiana, Missouri, the first son and second child of Eugene Schull, a shoe cutter, and Edna Gertrude Davenport. Among his distant relatives there were at least three geneticists, George H. Shull, the discoverer or hybrid vigor, A. Franklin Shull, a geneticist at the University of Michigan, and Franklin Shull‚Äôs daughter, Elizabeth ‚ÄúTibby‚Äù Buckley Shull Russell, a past president of the Genetics Society of America. In the mid-1920s, the Schull family moved to St. Louis, Missouri and later to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Schull started his academic studies at Marquette University in Milwaukee in 1939. In December 1942 he enlisted in the army and served as surgical technician with the 37th Infantry Division in the South Pacific until December 1945. Schull received a Bronze Star for medical services in the fight to recover Baguio on the island of Luzon, Philippines in 1945 during World War II. Schull created a device for oxygen tanks that allowed for twice the normal oxygen capacity in order to help treat more wounds and save the lives of severely wounded soldiers. After the war, he finished his bachelor's degree in Zoology at Marquette in 1946, and then went on to obtain a master's degree in Zoology in 1947. On 7 September 1946, Schull married Victoria (Vicky) Margaret Novak at Saint John the Divine Catholic Church in Milwaukee. They were inseparable for 63 years, until her death on Tuesday, October 13, 2009 at the age of 87. In 1949, he completed his Ph.D. degree at the Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. On that degree‚Äôs completion, Schull had an offer at McGill University, but he turned it down and accepted an offer to go to Japan and work with the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission. He served as its Chair of the Department of Genetics from 1949 to 1951. Scientific Contributions Schull‚Äôs research dealt with many subjects in human genetics and his 1954 textbook ‚ÄúHuman Heredity‚Äù (coauthored with James V. Neel) was the first genetics textbook to rely almost solely on examples from human populations.Neel, J. V. and Schull, W. J. (1954) Human Heredity. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. Chief among his earliest scientific interests are a large group of studies on human consanguinity (inbreeding) that spanned half a century of research and a wide geographical range.Schull, W. J. and Neel, J. V. (1965) The Effects of Inbreeding on Japanese Children. New York: Harper and Row. His first study, in 1953, concerned the effects of Christianity on the degree of inbreeding in Nagasaki.Schull, W. J. (1953) The effect of Christianity on consanguinity in Nagasaki. American Anthropologist 55:74‚Äì88. For his studies in Japan, information concerning thousands of people and entire communities was obtained on such items as birth date, birthplace, education, occupation, religion, date of marriage, previous marriages, consanguinity, number of persons in the household, size of the house, diet, income, land holdings, attitudes toward reproduction, and a pregnancy-by-pregnancy listing of the reproductive performances of the husband and wife in this and previous unions. These data were regularly compared, where possible, with the existing records of various government agencies, such as the Koseki-ka (the office of custody of the koseki), the Hokensho (the public health office), the Zeimusho (the tax office), and the Nogyo and Gyogyo Kumiai (the agricultural and fishing cooperatives). In some of the studies in Japan, Schull and his co-authors discovered in excess of 15% of consanguineous marriages, some involve inbred husbands, inbred wives, or both. The negative effects of parental consanguinity and inbreeding were studied in relationship with socioeconomic status and variability. Another area of very active research concerned the effects of ionizing radiation in the exposed populations of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In 1981, Schull and colleagues summarized thirty-four years of study on the genetic effects of the atomic bomb,Schull, W. J., Otake, M. and Neel, J. V. (1981) A reappraisal of the genetic effects of the atomic bombs: Summary of a thirty four year study. Science 213:1220-1227. followed by a series of papers on the causes of mortality of A-bomb survivors. Schull has revisited the subject periodically, and readjusted its conclusions whenever new or revised data became available. In 2003, Schull published a synopsis on the children of atomic bomb survivors.Schull, W. J. (2003) The children of atomic bomb survivors: a synopsis. J. Radiol. Prot. 23:369-384. Schull was one of the first researchers to concentrate on the interface between stress and morbidity. In particular, he studied socioeconomic stress, suppressed hostility, racism, and smoking on the well being of African-American populations in and around Detroit.Harburg, E., Erfurt, J. C., Chape, C. M., Hauenstein, L. S., Schull, W. J. and Schork, M. A. (1973) Socio ecological stress, smoking, skin color, and Black White blood pressure: Detroit. J. Chron. Dis. 26:595-611. In the pregenomic era, Schull advanced many methodological innovations in genetics from the field of epidemiological statistics, through practical measures of obesity, to the methodology of paternity exclusion. Of particular interest, at the time was the publication in 1967 of an entire volume of the American Journal of Human Genetics dedicated to the promotion of use of computers in the field human genetics. In the 1980s, Schull and colleagues pioneered a survey and an in-depth study on obesity, diabetes, gallbladder disease, hypertension, and other cardiovascular and metabolic afflictions among Mexican-Americans in Starr County, Texas.Hanis, C. L., Ferrell, R. E., Barton, S. A., Aguilar, L., Garza Ibarra, A., Tulloch, B. R., Garcia, C. A., and Schull, W. J. (1983) Diabetes among Mexican Americans in Starr County, Texas. Am. J. Epidemiol. 118:659-672. Other studies concern the genetics of the Aymara tribe in Chile and Bolivia, radiation carcinogenesis in humans, mutations, the genetics and epidemiology of chronic diseases, acheiropodia in Brazil, the adaptation of human populations to high altitudes, the measurement of Darwinian fitness in humans, the genetic structure of human populations, the genetics of night vision, circadian heart rate rhythmicity, the genetics of mental retardation, and cancer risks. Public service Schull held many administrative positions in the sciences, including Vice Chairman and Chief of the Department of Epidemiology and Statistics of the Radiation Effects Research Foundation in Hiroshima (1978‚Äì1980, 1996‚Äì1997), Director of the Radiation Effects Research Foundation (1986‚Äì1987, 1990‚Äì1991), Director of the Center for Demographic and Population Genetics at The University of Texas Health Science Center (1972‚Äì1995), Director of the Medical Genetics Center of The University of Texas Health Science Center (1981‚Äì1994), and Director of the Human Genetics Center of University of Texas Health Science Center (1995‚Äì1998). Schull was a member of the Board of Directors and Secretary of the American Society of Human Genetics from 1958 to 1961 and was its President in 1970. Dr. Schull‚Äôs scientific work was recognized by a great number of honors and awards. Among these honors are the Order of the Sacred Treasure, Third Class, given by the Emperor of Japan in 1992 and the Silvio O. Conte Environmental Health Award in 1991. In 2004, A conversation with Schull was published in the section Voices of the journal Epidemiology.Sever, L. E. (2004) A conversation with Jack Schull. Epidemiology 15:118-122. Schull served on the editorial boards of fifteen academic journal. He served on the editorial boards of Acta Anthropogenetica, International Journal of Human Genetics, and International Journal of Radiation Medicine. Selected publications Schull authored, co- authored and edited 15 books, and has published in excess of 400 peer-reviewed original articles, invited articles, book chapters, book reviews, and scientific abstracts.

Monster is an extremely outgoing Organic that is endlessly fascinated by the little things in life. Monster is driven to make everyone happy, and the need to explore the \\"shiny thing.\\" But because of Monster's fascination with the world, he is very gullible. Unlike Robot, Monster feels like everything goes his way, although it does not, making him a very good friend to have around. *Marf (Curtis Armstrong, Jeff Bennett in \\"Speak, Marf, Speak\\") is a pet of Robot and Monster. He is a block of metal that acts like a dog, and only says \\"marf\\". *Ogo (Jonathan Slavin) is the third wheel of Robot and Monster's friendship. He has a big obsession for Robot and Monster, which creeps out and annoys them to no end. He constantly tries to involve himself in the duo's doings, and just cannot seem to grasp that he is not part of the team. Ogo has been known to survive near death experiences. In \\"Ogo's Cool\\", Ogo acts like Robot & Monster and Robot & Monster acts like Ogo because of Robot's cool ray. In \\"Ogo's Birthday\\" Monster still cherishes Ogo as one of his friends, though Robot does not. He is allergic to bacon which makes him drowsy/nauseous. *Perry (Maurice LaMarche) is a robot co-worker of Robot and Monster's. He always has a smile on his face, but it's due to a function problem, as revealed in \\"Come On, Get Happy\\". He seems to get hurt a lot, and when something is thrown, it almost always hits him. He always feels miserable and the only thing that makes him genuinely happy is Robot's misfortunes. He is shaped like a sewage pipe, colored in orange with a yellow \\"2\\". =Recurring= *J.D. (Megan Hilty) is a cool, rebellious biker chick whose best friend is her equally hip robotic bike Spitfire. Robot, Monster and nearly every guy at the Makin' Bacon have a huge crush on her. *Spitfire (Cree Summer) is JD's equally hip robotic bike. They are inseparable best friends and regulars at the local bacon joint, Makin' Bacon. JD can be hot-headed at times while Spitfire is more rational and willing to avoid fights. Spitfire can be bossy, as stated in \\"Biker Girls\\". Robot has shown slight interest in Spitfire before. *Gart Default (Maurice LaMarche) is Robot's arrogant, overbearing older brother. He is a narcissist and is always taunting Robot. He runs their family's Blinking Light factory. He is gold-tinted, is shinier than Robot, has six wheels for feet, while Robot has four, and has actual hands as opposed to Robot's claws. *Nessie (Rhea Perlman) is the six-tentacled owner and manager of the Makin' Bacon. *Punch Morley (Fred Tatasciore) was once a Pole-O player and then he retired. He is now the handyman at the Blinking light factory. He has had short-term memory loss ever since he hit his head with a pole from a Pole-O game. *Crikey (Nolan North) is a sadistic robot who speaks in a Cockney accent. He also has an identical cousin named Blimey and usually torments Robot & Monster and gets beaten up by J.D. and Spitfire in a few episodes. *Mr. Wheelie (Kurtwood Smith) is Robot and Monster's irate and sarcastic landlord with a big blue spiky head and bicycle wheels for feet. He threatens to kick Robot and Monster out of their apartment if he finds their pet Marf, since pets are not allowed. *Master Grabmirist (Ping Wu) is a Sensei who meets up with Robot & Monster whenever they need help, however his methods tend to fail quickly. *Hal Worth-a-ton (Nolan North) is a Texan-accented salesman who lies about his products on the tube. *Pendulum Depot (Nolan North) is a Mechanical who owns the Solid Light Factory and is the main rival to the Defaults and their Blinking Light Factory. He plans on stealing the Default's Blinking Light Formula, and make them out of business. He usually carries around a rocket umbrella for show. *Arpa Default (April Winchell) is Gart and Robot's mother whose arrogance Gart takes after. Despite her preference in Gart, it has been shown on few occasions that Arpa still loves her other son, Robot, by keeping a picture of him in her chest compartment. *Grandma Default (April Winchell) is Gart and Robot's grandmother and Arpa's mother, a cranky family member who speaks computer binary (says only \\"one\\" and \\"zero\\") and hates Organics. *Gizmo Default (Alan Tudyk) is Robot's crazy cousin who talks to imaginary people and is considered an embarrassment to the Default family. *Uncle Kuffley Krumholtz (Nolan North) is Monster's loud-mouth uncle who is a police officer and a teacher of the Traffic Walking School. *Globitha Krumholtz (Cree Summer) is Monster's hyperactive child sister who has a large (and annoying) affection towards Robot (Much to Monster's jealousy). Still, Monster shows her his affection/empathy. Robot does not want her to help him with inventions because she ruins everything she touches. *Lev Krumholtz (Bill Fagerbakke) is Monster's dad whose horns are bigger than him. His horns make him talented but are revealed to be false in \\"Hornica\\". *Lucy (Jennifer Cody) is a Mechanical who is Robot's long-time rival. To outsmart Robot in a contest to make a two-color blinking light, she befriended Ogo so she can use his brain as a processor chip to power the blinking light in \\"Ogo's Friend\\". She always denies Robot's existence, saying that she has no idea who he is. *The Prince of Scamtown (Fred Tatasciore) is a Mechanical who is of royal descent. He is generous despite his name. In \\"The Prince of Scamtown\\", Robot does not believe he is an actual prince although Monster does. *Loudmouth (Maurice LaMarche) is a tiny but very angry Mechanical who is one of Robot and Monster's co-workers at the Blinking Lights Factory. *Snap Winsome (Jeff Bennett) is an Organic and the host of various shows such as That's Amazing! and Ow! That Hurts!. *Dame Lady Madame (Ruth Williamson) is a prestigious female Mechanical of high-society. *Bea Holder (Harriet Sansom Harris) is a cycloptic Organic who is a trendsetter. *Howly (Maurice LaMarche) is a cyber monkey that flies into rage when having photos taken. Monster befriended it in \\"The Dark Night\\". *Lil' Lugnuts (Nolan North) is an Organic and was Monster's idol until Robot found that Lil' Lugnuts was actually a criminal. *Katie (Carol Ann Susi) is a mechanical lady, and the owner of Narf. She finds Robot and Monster to be annoying, and thinks Marf is a stupid name. *The Organic Pole-O Players are a series of players who seem to dislike Robot, Monster, and Punch Morley.

She was the co-founder and founding investor in Net-a-Porter and among the first professional investors to see the value in luxury e-commerce. Since 1992, Busquets has invested ¬£50 million in fashion-tech companies in the United Kingdom and the United States, with her backings generating an estimated 10,000 jobs. Busquets opened a boutique named Cabus in Caracas, Venezuela in 1990. Busquets would visit fashion shows in Europe and use DHL to send her customers sketches, Polaroids and detailed descriptions of garments and the boutique thrived. With returns from technology stocks that she sold prior to the 2000 \\"dot-com\\" crash, she became a co-founder and founding investor in Net-a-Porter after meeting founder Natalie Massenet. She recalls becoming an investor because she was one of the few to believe in tech companies enough to invest in them during their early stages. Busquets also had a belief Net-a-Porter would be successful having previously sold luxury fashion to clients via photographs through her boutique, Cabus in the pre-internet age. Net-a-Porter's sale to Compagnie Financi√®re Richemont in 2010 netted Busquets over 16 times her initial investment. In 2012, Busquets founded Cabus Venture, a dedicated investment vehicle to finance entrepreneurs within luxury and fashion, based upon the potential of their content, community and commerce offerings. Busquets is an avid follower of wellbeing having meditated from an early age and she was an early investor in New Age pioneer Deepak Chopra in the 1980s and credits her success in business to her mindful approach. Busquets is known as a vocal proponent of sustainability, focussing on impact investment and sustainable businesses. Busquets' current portfolio includes Moda Operandi, Farfetch, Lyst, The Business of Fashion, Cult Beauty, FLOWERBX and Tagwalk. Early life and education Busquets was born in Venezuela is dyslexic and partly deaf. She was educated in Venezuela, England, Canada and the United States, and she majored in science and arts before studying marketing and advertising at the University of Miami. After graduating from the University of Miami, she initially wanted to be an artist and received a scholarship to Parsons at age 17, but changed direction after the death of her brother, returning to her native country. Expected to work in the family's metallurgic businesses, she forged her own path, setting up a fashion boutique called Cabus in 1990, with business ties to brands like Chanel, Thierry Mugler and Ala√Øa. Career =Early career= In 1990, Busquets opened a high fashion boutique in Caracas, Venezuela called Cabus.\\" Following a 10-year ban on foreign imports, it became the first store in Venezuela to stock Europe's top designers and rapidly developed an international client base. The ambience echoed Chanel's store in Paris; the clothes came from more than 50 designers. The client√®le quickly became international, and Busquets provided a service to match. Busquets would visit shows in Europe and use DHL to send her customers sketches, Polaroids and detailed descriptions of garments she thought they would like. \\"That's why I knew Net-a-Porter would succeed. I had already been providing an analogue version of what Natalie wanted to do.\\" Her success was such that it propelled her interest in e-commerce and the Internet. In 1997, at the beginning of the dot-com bubble, Busquets started to build her small private stock-portfolio of Internet investments. She also co-founded two private online start-ups during the Internet bubble, an experience that taught her the importance of being a responsible investor and only partnering with other responsible investors. =Net-a-Porter= Busquets was a co-founder investor and an original board director of Net-a-Porter, investing an initial ¬£250,000 in 2000 against the opinion of her advisers. While backing Net-a- Porter, Busquets personally vouched for its creditworthiness to designers with whom she had long-standing relationships. Over a five-year period, she increased her stake to ¬£5.9 million. In 2003, realising the importance of securing a strategic partner for the company, she temporarily gave up her pre- emptive investor rights in order to let Richemont Group become a co-investor. She gained her rights back once Richemont had invested in the company. For seven years, Busquets and Richemont remained controlling co-investors, each with a 30% shareholding and both playing a pivotal role in growing the value of the company. In 2010, Busquets exercised her controlling rights and was instrumental in the successful sale of Net-a-Porter to Richemont Group for ¬£350 million. Busquets retained a 2.3% shareholding in the business until the Yoox Net-a-Porter merger in 2015. Busquet‚Äôs initial investment of ¬£250,000 was returned 100 times, and her ¬£5.9 million investment was returned 16 times. =CoutureLab= In 2006, Busquets founded CoutureLab as a \\"laboratory of ideas\\" and a brand focused on supporting craftsmanship and heritage. CoutureLab is an e-commerce gift website, which sells rare products from around the world, made by craftsmen, artists, designers and brands. Busquets's aim is to offer a selection of products, to support top creative talents and to educate consumers about the stories behind the products. In April 2012, CoutureLab launched its gifting service GiftLab, increasing CoutureLab's range of products and establishing several key distribution partnerships online. As of September 2016, CoutureLab evolved into an investment vehicle ‚Äì now subsumed into carmenbusquets.com ‚Äì for disruptive startups in fashion and luxury. In September 2018, the CoutureLab Coalition, a new platform to support Latin American artisans and independent designers, was launched at Urban Zen in New York, at a cocktail reception hosted by Donna Karan. The initiative, made up of both people and businesses including Busquets, Livia Firth, Donna Karan, Petra Nƒõmcov√° and Lucy Siegle, aims to foster sustainable practices and improve the lives of artisans and creatives in Latin America. Funds In 2019, Busquets joined the advisory board of venture capital fund Fernbrook Capital Management LLC which focuses on direct to consumer and tech brands, the majority of which are female founded and have a social good stance in their ethos. Busquets also sits on the advisory boards of multiple venture capital funds including Felix Capital , Imaginary Ventures, Susa Capital and Kindred. Philanthropy Busquets is known as a vocal proponent of sustainability and for her charitable work, notably with Bhutan for Life, Glasswing International and the Oslo Freedom Foundation, through which she has supported victims of repression in Venezuela. Busquets is a goodwill ambassador to the United Nations and Fashion 4 Development, and a World Wildlife Fund council member. Busquets also works closely with non-profit organisation NEST that focuses on improving homeworking and preserving traditional craftmanship, as well as non-profit organisation PACUNAM. Awards and events In May 2011, Busquets won the Individual Outstanding Achievement at the Luxury Briefing Awards. The award recognized her vision to invest in selling fashion online in the early days of the Internet, her substantial value addition to Net-a-Porter culminating in its successful sale, and the creation of CoutureLab, with its focus on craftsmanship. In 2012, Busquets was a member of the jury at the 16th annual Luxury Briefing Awards. On 11 November 2011, Busquets spoke at the International Herald Tribune Luxury Business Conference in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Busquets discussed how her Latin American background has equipped her with the skills required to achieve commercial success and her views on the union of sustainability, community and luxury. On 19 March 2012 in Paris, Busquets and other notable figures from the luxury trade industry discussed the tension between global brands and luxury labels. On 25 September 2018, Carmen was honoured for her humanitarian work and contributions to sustainability, and received the F4D award during Fashion 4 Development's 8th Annual Official First Ladies Luncheon for \\"recalibrating the fashion industry to the benefit of people and planet\\". Busquets has been a member of the Panel of Experts for the LVMH Prize since 2017. Media In July 2008, The New York Times quoted Busquets who was discussing Net-a-porter at Paris Fashion Week: \\"I never invested in Net-a-Porter with the thought that I would be one of the major investors. I was quite open to being one of the minor investors. But since nobody believed in Internet companies after 2000, it turned out that I had to be the major investor, because I was the only one to believe in it.\\" In August 2012, Wallpaper magazine published an article by Imran Amed, founder and editor of The Business of Fashion, reviewing London's growing technology and fashion scenes. Amed identifies Busquets as being among a handful of investors who: \\"cashed in during the UK's Internet 1.0 wave and are now actively investing in the next generation of start-ups.\\" In September 2012, The New York Times published \\"Fashion's New Order\\", a select list of 37 individuals including designers, retailers, editors and stylists who have \\"changed the way we see fashion in the 21st century\\". In May 2013, Vogue profiled Busquets in an article written by Elisabetta Tudor regarding her investment in pre-owned fashion marketplace BuyMyWardrobe. In September 2013, The Business of Fashion featured Busquets in the BoF 500: a list of the 500 most influential names in the global fashion industry. This new list was described as \\"an innovative, multi-channel initiative, exploring the people shaping the global fashion industry, curated by the editors of BoF and powered by social media.\\" In September 2016, The New York Times International profiled Busquets and identified that Busquets is often referred to \\"as the fairy godmother of fashion e-commerce\\". In February 2020, ¬°Hola! profiled Busquets who is quoted as saying she would like to eradicate the problem of fashion waste and make fashion brands produce only what is necessary. Busquets describes that with problems like climate change and waste of objects and food, \\"we [humankind] need to move forward as soon as possible towards a more circular economy, where we value everything we have.\\" References Venezuelan businesspeople Venezuelan women in business ","title":"Carmen Busquets"},{"id":"36585337","text":"Hough Mill, Swannington Hough windmill, Swannington, Leicestershire is a tower windmill built in the late 18th century on the boundary between Swannington, Leicestershire and Thringstone. The mill served a coal mining community, the structure is surrounded by the remains of ancient shallow coal mines and local maps show many footpaths, -tracks made by the miners who walked between them. The mill and surrounding area is owned by the Swannington Heritage Trust. Previous Mills At least five mills were built on high ground to the north of Swannington and were operated by three local milling families, the Griffins, Chesters and the Kerbys. The earliest structures were post mills -a more primitive, less stable but far cheaper design where the entire mill body must be rotated to face the wind. Over the years all succumbed to fire, storm or decay, the last killing its owner when it collapsed in the early 1800s. Dismantled and reassembled nearby, the mill operated until 1895 when the components were sold. Present Mill John Griffin built the present structure, replacing a nearby post mill and purchasing land from the Enclosure Commissioners in 1804. The mill was operated by his tenant, James Kerby who paid an annual rent of ¬£30. In 1877, it was sold to John Hough, steward to the Beaumonts of Coleorton, for ¬£1,175, the Kerby family continuing until replaced by the last commercial tenant, Walter Chester. The mill closed early in the 20th century by which time the technology was obsolete. The derelict mill was listed in the 1980s and compulsory purchased by North West Leicestershire District Council who sold it to Swannington Heritage Trust in 1994. The Trust refurbished the mill with the aid of a ¬£70,883 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund. It was opened by Mr David Taylor, MP, on 26 March 2000 and attracted 1,600 visitors during the first year. Inside the mill is a poster advertising the sale of a mill on Thringstone common by auction at the New Inn at Peggs Green. Both properties were part of Thringstone Civil Parish until its abolition in April 1936, Hough Mill being part of 70 acres transferred to Swannington whilst the New Inn was part of 98 acres transferred to Coleorton. Gorse Field and Califat Spinney The Trust also owns the adjacent 6 acre gorse field, part of an unfarmed ancient common with evidence of hundreds of bell pits for coal mining dating back to 1204. This is being turned into a nature reserve. The replica ginn engine (see photo, left) was funded by the National Forest company. Next to the Gorse Field is Califat Spinney which includes two engine houses from the coal mine that operated from 1855-1873. One of the mine shafts was called the Alabama shaft. Whilst the date is uncertain, it was practice at the time to name shafts after contemporary events, the CSS Alabama was sunk by the US Navy off the coast of Cherbourg, France in 1864. A horse-drawn tramway carried coal from the Califat mine to the bottom of the Swannington Incline where the winding engine pulled the trucks to the top of the incline to continue its journey along the Leicester and Swannington Railway. In 1863 water entered the Califat mine from a disused mine at Limby Hall. The mine flooded in 11 minutes and three miners were killed.

Earlier observers, like James Wray in 1966, misclassified this as a likely 12.0v magnitude planetary nebula, but later spectroscopic investigations revealed this as a diffuse nebulae. RCW 88 was then to be identified by the infrared satellite IRAS as an HII region. Deep red images reveal that the inner nebula is divided into two parts by a central dark lane, and there is evidence of a larger halo of fainter nebulosity extending perhaps out to 10 arcmin. The RCW catalogue states the HŒ± image size is 3'√ó2. RCW 88 is located about 3300 parsecs (10,000 light years) from us, though other estimates place this at a closer 1800¬±300 pc. or 1800¬±200 pc. Assuming the former distance and the diameter as 5'-6' across, finds by simple trigonometry the true size subtends a minimum of 5¬±1 parsecs (16¬±3 light-years.) This small emission nebula shows a mean radial velocity of ‚àí18 km.s‚àí1, and is also a faint radio source that was identified by Lloyd Higgs in 1971. Due to the large distance from us, astronomers have made few studies into the nature of RCW 88.

Biography Pacholski was educated at Pelplin and Wejherowo, and studied for the priesthood at Leuven, Belgium.Father Waclaw Kruszka, History of the American Poles, volume 4, p. 123. After emigration to the United States, he completed his studies at Saint Thomas Seminary in Saint Paul, Minnesota, where he was ordained to the priesthood on June 18, 1886. Just one month after his ordination, Reverend Pacholski was called upon to organize Holy Cross Parish in Minneapolis. He served as pastor at Holy Cross until 1894.Holy Cross Parish Jubilee Book (Minneapolis: 1961) He was then transferred to the Diocese of Winona and installed as pastor of Saint Stanislaus Kostka Parish, in Winona, Minnesota. This growing parish had experienced a good deal of turmoil in recent years, and it is clear that Reverend Pacholski was expected to bring some needed order. This he accomplished.William L. Crozier devotes an entire chapter, \\"Conflict in an Ethnic Church,\\" of his Gathering a People: A History of the Diocese of Winona (Winona: 1989) to the crisis at Saint Stanislaus: pp. 183-204. Winona was already becoming known by this time as the \\"Kashubian Capital of America;\\" although not of Kashubian birth himself, he had studied in the Kashubian region and quickly bonded with his new flock. As pastor of Saint Stanislaus Kostka, Reverend Pacholski oversaw the completion and dedication of the 1895 church, and of the parish school constructed in 1905. He was instrumental in the establishment of Saint Casimir's, a daughter parish of Saint Stanislaus Kostka, on Winona's West End, and celebrated the first Holy Mass at Saint Casimir's on Christmas Day 1905.Saint Casimir Parish Golden Jubilee Book (Winona: 1955) Father Pacholski held the office of Consultor to the Most Reverend Joseph B. Cotter, first Bishop of Winona, which was a very unusual honor for a Polish-born priest serving in an American diocese. He was elevated to the rank of Monsignor by Pope Benedict XV on August 17, 1918. He was admired and loved by his parishioners as a stern shepherd who always cared deeply for his beloved flock; in his role as pastor of Saint Stanislaus Kostka he was also regarded as the leader of Winona's Kaszubian Polish community.Leo M.

History As an informal body with no strictly defined powers, the conference met until 1950, when its activities were paralyzed by internment of most bishops. The State Agency for Religious Affairs started to organize conferences of capitular vicars-general, the first of which was convened on the 15 February 1951. The policy was released in March 1968, and efforts were undertaken to resume the episcopal conference, but because of the invasion by Warsaw Pact troops during August 1968, the conference failed to resume its activities. As the role of bishops increased due to returning of some internees to their duties as ordinaries of dioceses in this period, the communist r√©gime aiming at \\"normalization\\" in the 1970s sought to prevent a functional episcopal conference that would mean a closer collaboration of the bishops. =Re-establishment in 1990= As a legal person within the meaning of the Code of Canon Law of 1983, the body was established under the name of Bishops' Conference of Czechoslovakia only in the spring of 1990 (according to some sources, on April 17, others May 14). Its first chairman was elected Cardinal Franti≈°ek Tom√°≈°ek. It consisted of two independently acting Bishops' Colleges: the Bohemian-Moravian (Chairman :cs:Francis Radkovsk√Ω) and the Slovak (Chairman Eduard Kojnok). The Bishops' Conference of Czechoslovakia also became an associate member of the Ecumenical Council of Churches in Czechoslovakia, where the bishops' conference at the discretion of Cardinal Tomasek was represented primarily by the former Vicar General of Archdiocese of Prague Anton√≠n Li≈°ka.

An impairment qualifies as prolonged if it is expected to or has lasted at least 12 months. The DTC is required in order to qualify for the Registered Disability Savings Plan , the working income tax benefit, and the child disability benefit. Families using a Henson trust, the Canada Disability Child Benefit other estate planning methods for children with Disabilities are not excluded from the DTC. While the credit is valuable, many have found qualifying for it challenging. Eligibility The individual must be \\"markedly restricted\\" in at least one of the following categories: speaking, hearing, walking, elimination (bowel or bladder functions), feeding, dressing, performing the mental functions of everyday life, life-sustaining therapy to support vital function and the recently introduced cumulative effects of significant restrictions. The degree of disability must be approved by Canada Revenue Agency before it can be used, and this process requires the completion and submission of a form. The T2201 Disability Tax Credit Certificate form must be completed by a qualified professional related to the impairment such as a medical doctor, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, psychologist, audiologist, or optometrist, in order to qualify as having a severe and prolonged impairment. The practitioner must certify on the T2201 form that the impairment meets specific conditions within the set category. The conditions vary depending on impairment. A document released by the Canadian Psychological Association (CPA) in response to suggestions they made to the House of Commons Sub-Committee on the Status of Persons with Disabilities, attempts to assist medical professionals with deciphering what qualifies as being markedly restricted in the \\"mental functions necessary for everyday life\\". In 2005, the CRA introduced a new category of eligibility, \\"cumulative effect of significant restrictions\\". This category is useful for individuals who are disabled but not restricted enough to qualify as being markedly restricted. Since this was introduced in 2005, an applicant may only be able to recapture funds since that point. Benefits An applicant can file for the disability amount, back 10 years, due to the Tax Payer Relief Provisions in the Income Tax Act. The DTC amounts to C$7,687 (According to line 316) is a refundable tax credit and if an individual has enough taxable income, this would result tax savings of 1,153.05, and if filed for the full 10-year period the possible tax savings are excess of 11,000. The DTC can be found on line 316 (for self) and line 318 (transferred to a supporting relative). If the medical practitioner charges to complete the T2201 form, applicants can claim this as a medical expense on line 330 of his/her tax return. In addition to lowering taxes, qualifying for tax credits can also be a requirement for applying for other money-saving vehicles such as the Registered Disability Savings Plan. Transferring credits If the person with the impairment does not have a taxable income, he/she can transfer credits to a supporting relative such as a parent, grandparent, child, sibling, grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew. The disability amount can be transferred in either its entirety or as the remainder of what the dependent was unable to claim himself or herself. Association of Canadian Disability Benefit Professionals (ACDBP) An Association of Canadian Disability Benefit Professionals was created to represent and serve a network of organizations that assist clients in registering for the disability tax credit, registered disability savings plan and other disability tax benefits. It was created by the twelve founding organizations specializing in this field. They are all committed to ACDBP Code of Conduct. The Association advocates on behalf of its members for policy and program efficiency at the federal and provincial level.

Properties * No power of two is a pernicious number. This is trivially true, because powers of two in binary form are represented as a one followed by zeros. So each power of two has a Hamming weight of one, and one is not considered to be a prime. * Every number of the form with , including every Fermat number, is a pernicious number.

It can be regarded as the birth of the German and Austrian bishops' conferences. History The hastily called meeting began on 21 October 1848, just three weeks after the Cologne Archbishop Johannes von Geissel had issued the invitations. It ended unexpectedly after lengthy deliberations on 16 November. Twenty-five diocesan bishops or their representatives, and selected theological advisers, participated. However, no laymen participated. The venue was the W√ºrzburg seminary, for the last three days of the Franciscan monastery of W√ºrzburg. It was hosted by the Bishop of W√ºrzburg . The bishops had a strict work discipline with eight hours of daily conferences. The liturgical high point was a Pontifical Mass in the W√ºrzburg Cathedral under the direction of the Primate Germaniae of Archbishop Cardinal Friedrich Johannes Jacob Celestin von Schwarzenberg. A noteworthy sign was the charitable feeding of 300 poor citizens of W√ºrzburg. The bishops worked at the tables serving the poor. The shortness of the advance notice, the high number of participants and the long duration of the meeting are evidence of the urgency of the issues at hand. The end of the ecclesiastical order with their spiritual territories was less than 50 years ago and the reorganization of the German dioceses only 25 years. Since 18 May 1848, in the Frankfurt Parliament there was a controversial discussion about the future government and constitutional order in Germany and the bishops didn't want to be bystanders only. They formulated policy statements on the relationship between church and state, the church school inspection, the legal status of the clergy and on issues of societal and social order. They adopted three memoranda: one to all the faithful, one to the government and one to the clergy. However, the intended official national synod did not follow, because for it a papal authorization was required, and the Curia was afraid of national church tendencies, because the Bavarian bishops in the Freising Bishops' Conference and the bishops of the Habsburg monarchy in the Episcopal Conference of Austria went their own ways.

Career Del Carretto learnt fencing at Club Scherma Rapallo under Roberto Cirillo. Her first international significant result was a team gold in the 2002 Junior European Championships in Conegliano. In 2003, she took a bronze medal in the individual event and a silver medal in the team event at the Junior European Championships in Porec. The same year, she earned a team bronze medal in the Senior European Championships in Bourges. In 2004, she came away with a silver medal in the Junior World Championships in Plovdiv after being defeated in the final by Romania's Ana Maria Br√¢nzƒÉ. In her senior career, she proved a reliable team member and contributed to Italy's several podium placings. In 2009, along with Cristiana Cascioli, Nathalie Moellhausen, and Francesca Quondamcarlo, she earned an historical gold medal for Italy in the World Championships in Antalya. The following season, she climbed her first podium in the Fencing World Cup with a third place in the Doha Grand Prix, followed by another bronze at Luxemburg. In the 2010‚Äì11 season, Del Carretto won the Havana Grand Prix and earned a bronze medal in Nanjing. These placings allowed her to finish the year No.3 in world rankings, a career best as of 2014, despite her 2nd-round elimination at the World Championships in Catania by the hands of Ana Maria Br√¢nzƒÉ, who eventually won the bronze medal. In the team event, Italy were stopped in the semi-final by China, but defeated Germany to earn a bronze medal. Del Carretto competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in the Women's √©p√©e, but was defeated in the second round by reigning Olympic champion Britta Heidemann. Poor performances in the World Cup, her best placing being a quarter-final in Havana, caused a drop to No.27 in world rankings. 2012‚Äì13 was also a meagre year despite a bronze medal in the Xuzhou Grand Prix. Del Carretto then transferred to C.S. Aeronautica Militare, with Andrea Candiani as new coach, and moved from Legnano to Milan. During the 2013‚Äì14 season, Del Carretto dislocated her weapon shoulder during a training camp and stayed incapacitated for a month. She arrived with a No.44 ranking to the European Championships. She was seeded fourth out of pools and received a bye in the table of 32. She then defeated Poland's Magdalena Piekarska, teammate Francesca Quondamcarlo, and World No.1 Emese Sz√°sz to reach the semi- finals. She disposed 15‚Äì13 of host France's Jos√©phine Jacques-Andr√©-Coquin in the semi-final, then beat 15‚Äì12 another Frenchwoman, Marie-Florence Candassamy, to come away with Italy's first European individual gold medal since Elisa Uga at Plovdiv in 1998. In the team event, Del Carretto's Italy were overcome 24‚Äì29 in the semi-final by Romania, who eventually won the gold medal. Italy met 2013 European champions Estonia in the match for the third place and won 45‚Äì42.

In the semifinals of women's individual √©p√©e, she lost to German Britta Heidemann after a timekeeping error extended bout time. The situation arose at the end of the one-minute overtime (sudden death) with the match tied 5-5. Without the extension, Shin would have won the tied bout on the basis of priority, which is randomly awarded to one fencer prior to the overtime period. With one whole second showing on the official clock, Heidemann made two rapid attacks in succession, both halted by double-touches. The clock in the arena continued to show \\"00:01\\", because it could not display decimal fractions of a second. The referee then called \\"halt\\" to the bout. At this point, the timekeeper (a Games volunteer) restarted the clock, inadvertently expiring all the remaining time, reportedly 0.02 seconds. This action caused the arena clock to show \\"00:00\\", giving Shin reason to celebrate. However, the error was noted and since an overtime minute had to be fenced in its entirety, the referee applied FIE rule t.32-3, which states that in the event of a failure of the clock or an error by the timekeeper, the referee must estimate how much time is left. The timekeeper, with the referee's permission, reset the clock to show \\"00:01\\", one whole second being the minimum unit of time possible. Following the resumption of the bout, Heidemann scored a single touch just as the full second expired. The result was partly due to the failure of the referee to stop both fencers restarting closer than the specified distance, Heidemann's \\"crowding\\" to hurry her attack, and Shin trying to avoid retreating across her end line. The South Koreans immediately appealed the decision, stating that 0.02s had already elapsed and the final touch occurred after the end of the bout. In accordance with fencing bylaws, Shin could not leave the piste while the officials deliberated the situation. Sobbing profusely, she sat alone for over an hour awaiting their decision.\\"Fencing rules dictate that if you protest an official's decision, you cannot leave the piste until there is a final ruling.\\" Ultimately, the judges gave the victory to Heidemann. An hour later, Shin returned for the bronze medal match but lost to her Chinese opponent despite loud encouragement from the cheering crowd.South Korea protests after fencer Shin loses Olympic semifinal, saying match was over Later, the International Fencing Federation offered her a \\"special medal\\" after her semi-final defeat. She rejected the offer, saying \\"It does not make me feel better because it's not an Olympic medal. I don't accept the result because I believe it was a mistake.\\" Shin won a silver medal in Women's team √©p√©e competition five days later.

Early life Nguyen was born in Munich, West Germany, in 1987 to a German mother and a Central Vietnamese father. He has one sister. Sporting career Nguyen began gymnastics at the age of four, and at seven years of age, joined TSV Unterhaching. Since 1995, he has trained at the regional training center in Munich. Since 1997, Nguyen was part of the squad perspective, where Andreas Hirsch and Jens Milbradt were his coaches. He rose quickly from the D- to B-squad. Since 2002, he has started for the Junior National Team. =2005‚Äì2007= In 2005, Nguyen was the German junior champion on parallel bars, runner-up on rings and third in the vault.

This movie tells the coming-of-age stories of a group of high school basketball team players who come to terms with their sexualities at a young age in 1957, and later in a 1962 reunion.  Plot synopsis  NOTE: This film has character names. However, names of real-life performers are used in this article. The story is set in Herbert Hoover High School in Heartland Heights, Iowa. It features seven former high school basketball players, part of the class of 1957, and it then shows their five-year reunion in 1962. The movie switches scenes between high school and the reunion. In 1962, Rick Chase is now an actor in California. Aaron Lawrence becomes a reverend primarily to repress his homosexuality and his love for Chase. Tony Donovan is unhappily married with a wife and children, and Kurt Young cruises around with men and women. Scott Lyons has turned to drink. Kristian Brooks and Lucas James are secret lovers. In one scene, Chase and Lyons perform fellatio on each other in 1957 and anal penetration in 1962. In another, sexually frustrated married men Donovan and Young make love to each other in both years in the same basement, filled with pictures of naked women (In 1962, they are blindfolded though). In another scene, lovers Brooks and James engage in a threesome with Lawrence, who later leaves the two alone to let them penetrate each other. In another, after the basketball team loses often, the coach (Preston Richie) \\"locks up seven players in the locker room\\", where they create an orgy. Later, they win the basketball game. In the final scene, set in 1962, best friends Chase and Lawrence admit their feelings for each other and then have sex.  Production  The movie was inspired by writer and director Jerry Douglas's own childhood in Iowa in the 1950s. It was produced by Scott Masters.Escoffier 2009, p. 284. Retrieved July 30, 2012, at Google Books. The basement sex scene filled with naked pictures of women was inspired by Douglas's real-life sexual fantasies and his basement room that was filled with pictures of movie stars, including actors James Dean, Farley Granger and Montgomery Clift who sparked those fantasies.Escoffier 2009, pp. 128-129\\\\.

Keeneye Reeves from TLA Video called its story \\"incredibly hot and romantic\\" with all four stars. Frank Lee from Rad Video praised the performances, the writing and the story setting with five stars. Giacomo Tramontagna from The Guide found the sex scenes \\"beautifully orchestrated\\", the movie an \\"instant classic\\" and \\"the best story-driven gay video in years\\" with four stars. Tramontagna said that Rick Chase in this video appears to resemble actor Farley Granger. Moreover, he found Chase's story with Scott Lyons more convincing than with Aaron Lawrence as \\"best friends\\". Butch Harris from ManNet praised the movie with its coming-of-age tales as an \\"excellent period piece\\". Jeremy Spencer from GayVideoDad (part of the defunct Gay Chicago Magazine) called it the \\"best\\" and praised its acting, sexual performances, story and directing. Jeffrey Escoffier from his book Bigger Than Life called it \\"a historical allegory illustrating the significance of gay liberation.\\" Escoffier compared the misery of closetedness among small-town boys in the 1950s and \\"sexual happiness\\" among them at their reunion in the 1960s.Escoffier 2009, p. 285.

Fares Fair was a public policy advocated by the Labour Party administration of the Greater London Council (GLC), then led by Ken Livingstone. The policy of low public transport fares was implemented in 1981, but was later ruled to be illegal in the courts and rescinded the following year. The Fares Fair policy had widespread support among Labour London members, who viewed it as a moderate and mainstream policy; no one had ever considered the legality of the move. In the 1979 GLC election, the political moderate Andrew McIntosh led Labour to victory, but the following day he was voted out by the party members and replaced by Livingstone. Proceeding with the Fares Fair policy which they had promised in their electoral manifesto, they reduced London Transport fares by 32 percent in October 1981. The legality of the Fares Fair policy was subsequently challenged by Dennis Barkway, Conservative leader of the Bromley London Borough Council. Taking the GLC to court, Barkway argued that the citizens of the London Borough of Bromley were having to pay extra taxes for the London Underground, which did not serve the borough. Background In the 1970s, Sheffield City Council's leader, David Blunket (later to become an MP and Home secretary), had implemented a very successful subsidy system for the City's bus service. The fares were very attractive and the frequency of service on all routes provided a bus every five minutes or so (except Sundays). A typical journey cost between to 5 pence (an average fare in other towns and cities was around 40 to 50 pence). A consequence of the low fares and good frequency of service was that most residents chose to travel into Sheffield by bus rather than use their car, even though public car parking was similarly cheap (primarily in order to compete). A further consequence was that unimpeded by cars, the buses were able to move around relatively freely. It was this model that London's Labour controlled council wished to emulate. In 1979, the incumbent Labour government of James Callaghan lost the United Kingdom general election, to be replaced by a Conservative government under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher. The 1979 Conservative manifesto had stated that \\"Any future government which sets out honestly to reduce inflation and taxation will have to make substantial economies, and there should be no doubt about our intention to do so.\\" The party had also stated that it did not want to implement unpopular spending cuts to the National Health Service, social security and defence, and so the funding cuts instead fell primarily on housing, education and social services, programmes which were primarily provided not by central government but by local authorities. Thatcher's newly appointed Secretary of State for the Environment, Michael Heseltine, was charged with decreasing local government spending; problematically for Heseltine, there was a tradition of local autonomy in England which he was hesitant to rein in under centralised control, something that would have angered traditional Conservative supporters.Carvel 1984. pp. 110-111. The government at the time stated that their policy was that all public transport should be able to operate without any subsidy (this was never achieved in practice). Central to Heseltine's reforms was the Grant Related Expenditure Assessment (GREA), an educated estimate of how much each individual council had to spend to provide an average standard of service. Under Heseltine's new system, if a local council spent at GRE, its ratepayers would have to pay no more than the standard, national-average rate. Alternately, if a council spent more than its GRE, the local ratepayers would have to pay an increasing percentage of the financial burden. This, he hoped, would influence local authorities to keep their spending at the GRE.Carvel 1984. p. 112. Initiation Labour's 1981 GLC manifesto commitment was to subsidise fares on all London Buses, London Underground and British Rail services in Greater London. This would cause a reduction in fares of approximately a third and cause a corresponding increase in the transport costs of the GLC. The funding for the change was planned to come from a 5% increase in local government rates. The subsidy to British Rail was blocked by central government, which restricted the policy to the buses and the London Underground. Because the rate demand for 1981 had already been issued some seven months earlier, the GLC attempted to raise the funding for the scheme up until April 1982 by issuing a supplementary rate demand for the extra money. This had the unintended consequence that it gave London ratepayers full visibility of how much the scheme was costing them. Once the fares fair scheme was up and running, people travelling around London enjoyed fare reductions of about one third on buses and the London Underground, though the better off rate payers were expected to pay more than the savings in extra rates. This was as the GLC council intended, the better off subsidising the transport costs of the poorer residents of London. An additional benefit was a simplification of the fare system. Up until fares fair, fares were charged according to distance travelled. The fairs fare scheme introduced a zoned fare system similar to that employed by many cities and towns and this vastly simplified the fare system. There were two central zones, the city zone and west end zone (occupying roughly the interior of the Circle line as was),This was mostly the case, but the west end zone was extended a little south to include Waterloo main line station and the city zone extended quite a bit eastward to include Liverpool Street, Fenchurch Street and Broad Street main line stations. surrounded by five annular zones radiating outwards (zones 2 to 6). The outer zone (zone 6) was subdivided into 3 subzones designated 6a, 6b and 6c. This functioned as three zones for underground and national rail journeys, but was treated as a single zone for journeys by bus. Legal challenge Late in 1981, the conservative London Borough of Bromley under the leadership of Dennis Barkway instigated a legal challenge of the \\"fares fair\\" policy in the courts. The challenge hinged on three factors. *That Bromley ratepayers were being required to subsidise the London Underground when Bromley had no service within its borders (or indeed anywhere near). *That the more affluent ratepayers were not only having to subsidise the poorer residents but were also subsidising users of the buses and underground who travelled into London from outside of its borders and were able to fully benefit from the fare reductions but without having to subsidise them in any way. Consequent on this, an allegation was made that Ken Livingstone was not acting in the best interests of the Ratepayers that he represented. *That the subsidy was not in accordance with government policy on transport having to be self financing. In addition, Bromley Council also initiated a legal challenge against London Transport itself, that it had no right to reduce its fares on the back of such an unlawful subsidy scheme. The court's decision was that the GLC's fares fair policy was unlawful for all the reasons given by Bromley and had to be discontinued. That the supplementary rate demands issued by the GLC were void and no ratepayer had to pay them (the GLC were required to refund any ratepayer who had already paid). London Transport were similarly instructed that their reduction of the fares was unlawful (as it was dependent on an unlawful subsidy), and the fares had to be restored to a level where the buses and underground were self funding. As a direct result, the fares on both the buses and underground were raised to a level that was significantly higher than fares pre-reduction. This was because London Transport had to recover the shortfall in income resulting from the fare reduction which it had expected to receive from the GLC but was no longer going to receive. Legacy Although the fares charged under the fares fair scheme rose to higher than their pre- scheme level, London's transport retained the zoned fare scheme. The two central zones, the city zone and the west end zone were amalgamated into a single zone (now designated zone 1). The outer zone 6 lost its sub-zones to become a simple zone 6.Three more zones have since been added to the scheme for rail journeys only. Zones 7, 8 and 9 were added to North West and North East London and zones 7 and 8 to South East London. There are not actually any rail stations in the South Eastern zone 7 nor in the North Eastern zones 7 and 8. These extra zones were not part of the original zoned fair scheme.

Her first studio album, also titled Kelmti Horra, was released worldwide by Harmonia Mundi in 2012 to critical acclaim. Her second album, Ensen, was released by Partisan Records in 2017, also to considerable acclaim. In 2015 she performed at the Nobel Peace Prize Ceremony. Mathlouthi is often referred to as the \\"Voice of Tunisian Revolution\\" due to her song \\"Kelmti Horra\\". Early life and career Emel Mathlouthi started singing and acting at 8 years old in a suburb of her hometown Tunis. She wrote her first song when she was 10 years old. She discovered her strong vocal capacities when she was 15, encouraged by her entourage and inspired by great pop singers of the 90's. She found a strong refuge in heavy metal a bit later and gothic music and formed her first metal band at a university in Tunis when she was 19. A few years later deeply moved by the voice and ideas of Joan Baez after her bandmate played \\"The Boxer\\" for her, she quit the band and began writing political songs, discovering her frustration by the lack of opportunities and the apathy of her compatriots, such as \\"Ya Tounes Ya Meskina\\" (\\"Poor Tunisia\\"). In 2006 she was a finalist in the Prix RMC Moyen-Orient Musique competition. She decided to move to Paris, France in 2008 when the Tunisian government banned her songs from radio and TV. Although banned from Tunisian airwaves, bootlegs of her live performances in France circulated on the internet in Tunisia. After the death of Mohamed Bouazizi she dedicated an Arabic version of the Joan Baez song \\"Here's To You\\" to him. She was recorded on the Avenue Habib Bourguiba singing \\"Kelmti Horra\\" to protesters and it became a viral video. She has given concerts in Egypt and Iraq, and performed in Canada at the Vancouver Folk Music Festival and the Festival du Monde Arabe de Montr√©al. At the beginning of July 2012, she gave a groundbreaking concert in Baghdad, Iraq. On 28 July she gave a concert at the Sfinks Festival in Belgium, where she received a standing ovation for her cover of the Leonard Cohen song \\"Hallelujah\\".

This community is a progeny of the Agbon Kingdom. Local history has it that it is the first son of Agbon whose traditional seat of leadership is Isiokolo. The previous king of the community, now deceased, HRH Chamberlain Oyibocha Orovwuje, Ogurimerime I, used this community as his centre of leadership bypassing the ancient satellite of Isiokolo. Origins/Background The traditions of the origins and migrations of Okpara as one of the Urhobo groups is still shrouded in obscurity and uncertainty. However, Okpara claim descent from one progenitor called Agbon who is said to have migrated from Benin at a point in time to settle in Agbon town. Predicated upon this belief of common descent from Agbon, is the worship of Isiokoru fetish by Agbon people, even till today. When Agbon people finally got to Isiokolo, they made contact with Benin to make an earth fetish for them. The Oba sent a messenger to Agbon town, which convened a meeting of all Agbon children. The messenger buried the head of an Orhokpor boy in a place. On that spot, he planted an Iroko and Oghriki tree. He then proclaimed that from then on Agbon would be subject to the Oba. He gave a horse tail symbolizing authority to the eldest man called Okarorho. Automatically all the children of Agbon regarded this fetish as their god of war. They worshipped it from time to time. Moreover, the common traditions of origins and migrations shared by Okpara people is fundamental in explaining their relations in the pre-colonial era. This, for instance, had served as a unifying factor among them. In any critical moment of decision between them, they often evoke the memory of their common origins by the saying -we are all one-. Agbon people have a long migrational history, their various traditions and accounts of origins and migrations subsist. According to one of the accounts, a man called Ukonorhoro, who migrated from Udo in Benin, gave birth to Agbon. Agbon migrated through Kwale, probably from Erhowa, settled at Ehwen and Erhivwi or Irri in present Isoko division of Delta State. From there he moved down to Utokori, close to Ughwerun; then to Olomu and through the present Ughelli territory of Ekuigbo to found Otorho r' Agbon now known as Isiokolo. The Okpara people further migrated from Agbon to their present position due to local instinct and avoidance of competition. On arrival on this new land via migration, Okpara also birthed few sons which would become sub-sections of the present community. They include: Eregbe, Erhi, and Etorogba. Erhi, in turn, gave birth to Osia, Isaba Uvwiaghoa, Onoriaro and Okei among others. Okpara was already dead at the time of migration from Isiokolo. Thus Osia and others led Okparas to a new settlement. Osia planted an Oghriki tree near the present site of Okpara hospital on reaching Okpara. The essence of this was to allow their people to make love, for the presence of the tree symbolizes that, that place was a settlement. It was a taboo among them, for people to make love in the bush. One of Osia's descendants must be the chief priest of the Oto Shrine because it was Osia who planted the Oghriki tree. As the population grew, both due to the birth of new immigrants like Esume, the people of Okpara began to spread out. Esume who was Osia's in-law founded Osia street, but because he was an in-law, the street was named after Osia. Omovwiona founded Urhu- iniovwona, one of Isaba's children founded Urhu-Egbo; Ogene founded Urhu- Ogene, Ononaro founded Imodje street; the descendants of Eregbe founded Eregbe quarter, and Ete-ogba children founded Ogba quarter. Some Okpara people also moved away to found new settlements like Ovu, Okpara water-side, Okurekpo, Otumara Ogba village, Obi village, Adarode, Okurofo, Aghwariore, Ugbegbe, Ugbuwherhe, Okarunoh, Onude, Agborhoro among others. Today Okpara is a thriving sub-clan in Agbon Kingdom with numerous villages and streets. Geography Okpara Inland is bounded in the east by Kokori /Isiokolo, in the south by Ekrebuo/Orhoakpo, in the West by Ovu-inland. It is watered by Omue stream, which also runs across Kokori. Its thick forest had a substantial wildlife reserve. It has about 196 km2 land space and its topography is very much okay for agricultural and pedestrian usage. The topography of Okpara Inland allows for the cultivation of such crops as yams, cassava, Okra, pepper, maize, melon, red-beans (locally called Isha) among others. Apart from tilling the soil they also exploited the palm trees, which grow in their bush for the production of soap, food and palm kernel as well as brooms. They had ponds they harvested often annually. The community owned the major ponds. These were either harvested every three years or more years. The community has two network roads linked at the main junction, one of the roads lead to Isiokolo, another to Ovu and the last leads to the interior of the community. The road leading to Ovu is intercepted at another junction popularly called the Eregbe Junction which leads to Eregbe street, Okpara Boys College and to/fro Ovu community. Other roads in the community are linked together via internal networking. This community experience the rainy season, which begins in June and ends in early November; and the dry season, which begins in late November and ends in late may and also the northeast trade wind. During this season, deciduous plants and trees shed their leaves and the burning of bush usually marked it. These three seasons influenced the agricultural routine of pre-colonial Okpara people. For instance, during the rains, less farm work was done. The men turned to fishing in the streams and rivers. The People The people of Okpara Inland are extremely vast and wide at large. Due to the polygamous nature of its ancestors, the people are distributed upon every facet of earth. The people of this community are known to speak the Urhobo language fluently. They are mainly pastoral and prefer to live within the reach of their immediate or extended family. The people are majorly sustenance farmers though some still do commercial farming. The historical antecedent of trading in this community was majorly by Barter. Agricultural products like food-crops e.g. water yams could be exchanged for Okra. Although with time, cowries, came to be adopted as the medium of exchange before the advent of the present legal tender of naira. Okpara market day was held every four days. It was called Edewor and nobody was expected to go to farm on that day. Most farmers harvested their crops during harvest period, on a day to the market with a view to taking them to the market place the following day. There was also hawking in the streets on ordinary days. Kokori traders patronized Okpara Market. While many Okpara people patronized Kokori Central Market. The major religion of the people in this community is Christianity. Although traditional religion thrived before the advent of Catholicism. The people also place much value on education and scholarship as they have produced notable people in diverse areas of erudite scholarship. Community Activities The people of this community are known for their very entertaining festivals which display a wide array of attires, dances, drama, etc. Among the notable festivals are the Edjenu festival which is held once every 20 years, the Eni festival which is held once every 25 years, the Okekere festival, etc. The community is also known to engage in age group fraternities such as social clubs, mutual friends, and other common purpose gatherings. The hospitality of the people is second to none. A guest is treated with respect and also entertained by the diurnal and nocturnal nature of the community. People of all age group engage in drinking, partying and other forms of social gathering around the community. These serve as an attractive force to tourists and community members in diaspora. One of such times of rampant activity is usually festivals and Christian holidays like Christmas. New Years are also celebrated with unified hospitality.  Education  The people of this community are known to be well educated and to have embraced western education wholeheartedly. Some of the schools in this community include: * Okpara Boys Secondary School * Agbon Girls College * Ejaife Primary School *Eregbe Primary School Notable people * HRH Chamberlain Oyibocha Orovwuje (Former King of Agbon Kingdom) * Professor Onigu Otite.

It was built by the Utah Light and Railway Company under the direction of E.H. Harriman, a director of the Union Pacific Railroad. It was one of the first powerplants in Utah designed to feed an electrical grid rather than as a source of power of a single locality. History Work had begun on an intake structure in Weber Canyon in the early 1900s at the Devil's Gate location under the direction of C.K. Bannister, an engineer from Ogden. Bannister's plan for a hydroelectric station was contested by the Union Pacific, whose line ran through the canyon. Bannister died shortly after, and his business associates sold the property rights to the Utah Light and Railway Company. Work continued on a penstock to feed the power plant until Harriman acquired sixty percent of the UL&R.; With Harriman's ownership Union Pacific opposition to the plant ceased, on the condition that a retaining wall be built to protect the railroad grade. The powerhouse was built in 1909-1910, along with three residences for plant operators. Harriman died in 1914 and the UL&P; became the locally owned Utah Light and Traction Company, which leased the station to the Utah Power and Light Company. The dam was rebuilt in 1916-1917 to better accommodate flood flows. Another operator's residence was built in 1922, together with some utility structures in ensuing years. The plant was upgraded from 2.5 MW to 3.5MW in 1948. Automation allowed a reduction in staff in the 1960s, and two of the residences were demolished. The remaining two were damaged by flood in 1982. A fire in 1983 resulted in renovations and alterations to the powerhouse. Description Weber Dam Water is fed to the powerplant from a low dam about upstream. Overflow is controlled by two tainter gates between concrete piers. A wide fish ladder climbs the north side of the dam. On the south side a large sluice gate allows the small reservoir to be drained. The intake structure is between the sluice gate and the south buttress wall, housed in a small wood frame intake house. A one-story wood- frame watchman's house is just downstream from the intake house, and is joined to the intake house. The power plant intake conduit is a diameter reinforced concrete pipe for the first , transitioning to a welded steel pipe. This replaced of concrete pipe and of wood stave pipe in 1949. The conduit is buried along most of its length. It crosses the river on a -span riveted steel Howe truss bridge made by the American Bridge Company downstream from the dam. Total head is about to . Since the conduit has been altered and is partly buried under the rail line it is not included in the historic district designation. The powerhouse is a rectangular brick building with a gabled concrete roof supported by riveted steel Fink trusses. The end walls are five bays wide with stepped parapets at the gables. Original window openings have been bricked in. Side elevations are three bays wide, also with infilled window openings. The structure sits on a concrete foundation that incorporates outflow works. The main room in the powerhouse accommodates a Pelton wheel turbine and a 2300 volt generator made by Western Electric, together with a small 125VDC exciter generator. The main generator was rewound during upgrade work in the 1940s. The turbine room is served by a 20-ton traveling crane made by the Whiting Foundry Equipment Company. Three other rooms house batteries, a workshop, and a third room formerly housed switchgear. The operator's camp once had four houses. Two remain, a one-story brick house and a 1922 wood cottage. Both houses retain landscaping and garden areas with outdoor fireplaces. There are several outbuildings associated with the property. The Davis and Weber Canal Company maintains a diversion dam just downstream from the powerhouse that is not part of the historic district. The powerhouse and associated structures were placed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 20, 1989. It is visible from Interstate 84 in Weber Canyon, between the lanes of the highway, whose westbound lanes pass just to the north.
