Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Kelley was raised on Kelleys Island after the death of his father in 1823. Inheriting a fortune of real estate as well as ownership of most of Kelleys Island from his family, Kelley held interests in limestone and lumber on the island. Upon selling these interests in 1845 and returning to Cleveland, he worked as an investor and manager of real estate properties in both Cleveland and throughout Ohio. Through his will, Kelley left funds for acquiring land for a fire proof art gallery and an art school that would help found the Cleveland Museum of Art in 1916. He is considered to be one of the founders of the museum along with John Huntington, Hinman Hurlbut, and Jeptha Wade II. Biography Horace A. Kelley was born on July 18, 1819 in Cleveland, Ohio, United States, as the only child of mother Betsey Gould Kelley and father Joseph Reynolds Kelley. Kelley's father, a successful businessman, left a fortune mostly made up of real estate in Cleveland to Horace after his death in 1823. Kelley was then raised by his uncle Thomas M. Kelley on Kelleys Island, Ohio. His uncle worked as a merchant involved in trade through Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, and later in the banking and real estate businesses. Kelley also had another uncle, Alfred Kelley, who was a banker and prominent figure in Ohio's politics of the first half of the 19th century. Kelley was known to have attended a Cleveland classical preparatory school established by Franklin Thomas Backus upon Backus leaving Yale College in 1836. Upon the death of his uncle, ownership of much of Kelleys Island was passed down to him. He sold his interests in limestone and lumber on the island in 1845, and returned to Cleveland. In Cleveland, he increased his wealth by investing in and managing real estate both in the city and off the shore of Lake Erie on the Isle of St. George (present-day North Bass Island). There, he was described as a man of \\"habitual reserve\\" by the Cleveland Plain Dealer. Kelley married Fannie Miles, who was from Elyria, Ohio. They did not have any children, and lived between their Cleveland residence on Wilson Avenue and a home in California. He died on December 4, 1890 in Cleveland, and is buried at Lake View Cemetery. Philanthropy The Cleveland Museum of Art displays its founders names on a plaque in the Ames Family Atrium Kelley's interest in art originated from his wife's passion for art. He made his first trip to Europe in 1868 for health reasons, where he was first exposed to art museums. He made four more trips to Europe and collected artwork that would later become part of the Cleveland Museum of Art. Eight days before his death, Kelley signed a will that would leave a majority of his estate for an art gallery. Through his will, an excess of half a million dollars was bequeathed to acquire land for a fire proof art gallery and an art school, part of which would help to establish the Cleveland Museum of Art. He viewed the art gallery as a place that would attract gifts of artwork and sums of money, suggesting to name the gallery the \\"National Gallery of Fine Arts\\". He conditioned that \\"no work of art unless of acknowledged merit\\" be admitted into the gallery. He named three trustees to his estate: his cousin Alfred S. Kelley, judge James M. Jones, and Henry C. Ranney, a lawyer and trustee of the estates of Cleveland Museum of Art founders Hinman Hurlbut and John Huntington. After Kelley's death, these trustees helped to establish a nonprofit corporation that incorporated the funds of his estate and was named the Cleveland Museum of Art, in 1899. The corporation was formed for the purpose of \\"promoting the fine arts\\" and establishing and maintaining an art museum. The corporation faced legal difficulties due to the John Huntington Art and Polytechnic Trust, another corporation formed through the will of John Huntington, which had also independently provided funds for the purpose of establishing an art museum. In 1913, the two corporations finally reached an agreement to establish a single art museum in cooperation. Under the agreement, the name of the Kelley corporation was changed to the Horace Kelley Art Foundation, while a separate corporation responsible for the establishing the museum was formed and named the Cleveland Museum of Art. This new corporation, under the combined resources of the Kelley and Huntington estates, commenced the construction of the museum in May 1913, and formally opened it to the public on June 6, 1916. Kelley is considered one of the founders of the Cleveland Museum of Art, along with John Huntington, Hinman Hurlbut, and Jeptha Wade II.

In the Integrated Defence Staff, the CDS is the Chairman, Joint Commanders and Staff Committee and here the CDS has an operational role. As the service head of the armed forces, the Chief of Defence Staff is assisted by the three chiefs of staff of the army, navy and air force. The first and current CDS is General Bipin Rawat, taking over on 1 January 2020. The position was first officially suggested in 1999 following the Kargil War through the recommendations of the Kargil Review Committee. Although a long-talked-about position in India, the official call was made public by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his Independence Day speech on at Red Fort, New Delhi. On 24 December 2019, the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) formally announced the creation of the position, a four-star general, a tri-service chief, that shall lead the defence forces. It is considered that the Chief of Defence Staff is a critical position in today's era of hybrid warfare, and will help increase coordination, tri-service effectiveness and integrate overall combat capabilities of Indian armed forces. The Defence Secretary, a civil servant, remains as the main defence adviser, whilst the CDS has been sanctioned the role of being the main military adviser, acting as the single-point military adviser to the government and Prime Minister. India was the only large democracy which did not have a single point military advisor; with all P5 countries having one. History General K. V. Krishna Rao advanced creation of the post of Chief of Defence Staff in June 1982. However, officially, it was only following the Kargil Review Committee's recommendation in 1999 that the Group of Ministers (GoM) officially proposed the creation of the post of CDS in 2001. Following committees, including the Naresh Chandra task force in 2012 and the Lieutenant General D. B. Shekatkar Committee in 2016, also proposed their own versions of a CDS. The process of consulting all parties involved began in 2006. In 2017, the Cabinet Committee on Security started the process of making the final decision related to the creation of a post for the CDS. The post of Chairman of the Chief of Staff Committee (Chairman-COSC) had been formed as a precursor to the post of CDS, responsible for the national military strategy. The matter had opposition over the years on various fronts. After the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971, Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Pratap Chandra Lal, had threatened to quit if the post of CDS was created. There were also fears that such a post would be too powerful. In 2001 the government was on the brink of making the then Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral, Sushil Kumar, the CDS. A date had been fixed including other formalities. However, due to turf wars, among other reasons, the idea was scrapped. Following the Prime Minister's announcement, a committee was announced on 23 August 2019 under the National Security Advisor, consisting of the Cabinet Secretary, the Defence Secretary and the Chairman of the Chief of Staff Committee (C-COSC) among others, to make final the powers of the CDS. The committee was to submit its report within six weeks. By November 2019, government sources reported the committee had largely completed its tasks and would release an official charter and enabling framework for the post of CDS by mid-December. On 24 December, the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) formally established the post of Chief of Defence Staff, a four-star general, a tri-service Chief, that shall lead the defence forces as well as play the role of head of the Department of Military Affairs. Description of the post CDS General Bipin Rawat with COAS General Manoj Mukund Naravane, CNS Admiral Karambir Singh and CAS Air Chief Marshal R.K.S. Bhadauria in New Delhi on 1 January 2020. The CDS is a four-star officer selected from among the serving officers of the Indian Armed Forces. While being \\"first among equals\\" among the service chiefs, the CDS would be a single-point military advisor the CDS will not hold any military command. The holder of the post would also be the head of all tri-service command structures, assisted by a deputy, the Vice Chief of the Defence Staff to replace the post of Chief of Integrated Defence Staff. The CDS would head a newly-created Department of Military Affairs (DMA), under the Ministry of Defence, as its secretary. Apart from heading the DMA, the CDS will also be the Permanent Chairperson of the Chiefs of Staff Committee (PC-CoSC). He will also be the Principal Military Adviser to the Minister of Defence. As the Permanent Chairman of Chiefs of Staff Committee, CDS will perform the following functions: * The Chief of Defence Staff is described by officials as the \\"first among equals\\" among service chiefs. * The CDS will be tasked with trimming weapons procurement procedures and integrating operations of the Indian armed forces- Army, Air Force and Navy. * Apart from being the military advisor for the government, the CDS will also head the Department of Military Affairs. * The CDS will have the authority to direct the service chiefs of Army, Navy and Air Force and will also have the authority to create theatre commands as and when needed. * Command tri-service agencies, organisations, and commands including those related to cyber and space. * CDS will be member of Defence Acquisition Council chaired by the Minister of Defence and Defence Planning Committee chaired by the National Security Advisor. * Function as the Military Advisor to the Nuclear Command Authority. * Bring about jointness and ensure optimal utilisation of infrastructure in the three Services. * Implement Five-Year Defence Capital Acquisition Plan (DCAP), and Two-Year roll-on Annual Acquisition Plans (AAP), as a follow up of Integrated Capability Development Plan (ICDP). * Bring about reforms in the functioning of three services aimed at augmenting combat capabilities of the Armed Forces by reducing wasteful expenditure. *Assign inter-Services prioritisation to capital acquisition proposals. The CDS's salary and perquisites will be same as the service chiefs. The CDS will come under the Right to Information Act. Uniform and insignia Rank insignia of CDS While the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) wears the appropriately coloured uniform of their parent service, the gold-wreathed tri-service emblem of the Indian Armed Forces (the Naval anchor, crossed Army swords and Air Force eagle, all surmounted by the national emblem of India) is used in place of service insignia and unit emblems. The wreathed tri-service emblem is also substituted for service cap badges, uniform button and belt badge service insignia, shoulder flashes and the shoulder rank badges of a four-star officer with The four-star gorget patches similar to that used by a service chief. While the car pennant is that of the officer's parent service, the tri-service emblem is substituted for the rank stars. Appointees  Reforms  Among the first reforms proposed by the new CDS was the creation of an Air Defence Command. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the CDS emphasised the need to minimise costly defence imports, give a chance to domestic production even with only 70% of the general staff qualitative requirements, and not 'misrepresent operational requirements'. In February 2020, the CDS announced the creation of joint military commands and theatre commands; and that the that the process of theaterisation will be complete in three years. Each command will have units from Army, Navy and Air-force working in synchronisation with each other.

History The Cootamundra Jazz Band had its beginnings in 1947 when John Ansell moved into the town and formed a trio with Eric Costelloe on trumpet and John Costelloe on drums, later trombone, with Don Le Soeur on drums, and as \\"The Modernists\\" played at dances and functions. Influenced by recordings of Graeme Bell's band, they turned to New Orleans Dixieland style traditional jazz, and in 1951 adopted the name \\"Cootamundra Jazz Band\\" (in 1954 John Costelloe would join Bell's band for a tour of Korea and Japan). Lloyd Jansson (later bandmaster for the Ballina Shire Concert Band) replaced Eric on trumpet and Jack Malone joined on tuba. In 1952 Greg Gibson arrived from Melbourne and joined on clarinet and Kevin McArthur took over as drummer. In 1952 in Leeton they played at the Jazz Convention to popular acclaim, and gained further notice in Hobart in 1953 then 1954 in Sydney and in 1955 when the Convention was held at \\"Coota\\". Malone retired in 1956 and the band gained a bassist in Bob Cowle. Laurie Gooding replaced Gibson on clarinet around 1960. The group disbanded when Ansell moved to Wagga Wagga in 1960 and (with wife Shirley Ansell on piano, John Costelloe on trombone, David Kennedy on saxes and clarinet, Graeme Callander on tuba and George Ceeley on drums) founded the Riverina Jazz Band, still going strong in 1995 with virtually the same lineup.

The company, formed in 1863, was founded by Nathan H. Whitten, T.C. Page, T. B. Flanders, Richard Pattee, and S. S. Chase, after the Holyoke Water Power Company's machine shop had been sold off. Stephen Holman, the company's treasurer, president, and largest shareholder during different times in its first decade, is credited as its founder, though the nature of his early involvement is not well documented. Holman would purchase the Company's foundry works in Worcester in April 1873, a second manufacturing branch which remained open for several decades. The best known among turbines manufactured by the Company was the Hercules turbine; a design developed by engineer John B. McCormick, who improved upon the Francis turbine, it was the first true mixed flow turbine of a high efficiency. With a maximum efficiency of 87%, a considerable improvement over previous designs of the era, the turbine would become ubiquitous in mills in the United States, as well as Europe. The central location of the company, and its design improvements for various papermaking machinery such as Fourdrinier machines, contributed to the paper making and textile economy of Massachusetts and more specifically the paper industry of the Berkshires, granting ready-access to machinery that often had to be shipped great distances from other manufacturers. In addition to turbines and papermaking machinery, the company was also known to have produced a wide variety of cast parts and custom orders. Among those known were Thomas Edison's personal elevator at his Orange, New Jersey laboratory, as well as doors for the US Capitol Building. With a changing market steering away from 19th century water-turbine factories, the business went into decline and entered bankruptcy in 1948, when it was bought by Irwin Sagalyn, who closed its foundry and changed the business's focus. At the end of 1950 the company auctioned off all of its remaining tools for the purposes of manufacturing turbines, papermaking tools and other mechanical machinery, choosing to focus entirely on its precision roll and filter business in the paper and textile industries. Citing the shrinking of an American industrial base, changes in technology and its specialization in those industries, Irwin's son, owner James Sagalyn, dissolved the company in August 2017, leaving one competitor working on the same technology, Badger Roll and Machine of Green Bay, Wisconsin to handle remaining customers, many in the Greater Springfield area.

Early life He was born on 30 October 1912 at Breslau, then part of Germany (now Wroclaw in Poland). As a young man he fled the rise of Hitler, studying comparative literature at Montpellier and Toulouse and then English literature at Cambridge. A German Jew he sought refuge from the impending holocaust then showing its initial signs in Europe by opting to leave and settle in Santiniketan. On contacting Rabindranath Tagore he was asked to get in touch with Amiya Chakravarty and Charles Freer Andrews, who were in London at that time. Aronson reached Santiniketan in November 1937. Santiniketan Santiniketan provided shelter to Aronson during a troubled period the world around. In one of his letters to Martin Kämpchen he wrote, “The hospitality I received there goes beyond all praise. It is something I shall never forget and for which I shall be forever grateful.” He plunged into his teaching career, preparing students for the BA examination of the University of Calcutta. He was a voracious reader and tried to understand the Eastern mind. He played the piano and listened to music with Satyajit Ray, then an art student at Visva Bharati. He contributed book reviews and articles for Santiniketan's official journals, Visva Bharati Quarterly and Visva Bharati News. In time, he emerged as one of the most prolific writers from Santiniketan of that period. With the outbreak of World War II, Aronson suddenly became an “enemy alien” for the British colonial rulers in India. He was sent to an internment camp first at Fort William and then to Ahmednagar. With the repeated intervention of Tagore, he was able to return after two months. However, it was a traumatic experience for him. Tagore had a vast collection of newspaper clippings that had been collected during his foreign tours. He asked Aronson to put them in order. With many months of dedication and hard work, he classified the newspaper articles and correspondence, and laid the foundations of the archives at Santiniketan. With the wealth of information, he had, Aronson wrote a book Rabindranath Through Western Eyes. It was published in 1943, after Tagore's death. It became an iconic book that has been mentioned and quoted till the present times. Tagore's impact outside India was seen in a totally unromantic, unsentimental and critically sober manner. It obviously did not go down well with the Santiniketan intelligentia. In 1944, he wrote The Story of a Conscience, a book on Tagore's friend, Romain Rolland. Jointly with Krishna Kripalani he edited Rolland and Tagore, a collection of letters and essays. In 2000, Visva Bharati published Dear Mr. Tagore, a collection of letters from well known writers, scholars and public figures in Europe and America. It was a major archival contribution of Aronson. In 1946, he wrote, Europe looks at India, a study in Cultural Relations. This book on Europe's cultural response to India opened Aronson's horizon beyond Tagore. Israel Aronson worked in the University of Dhaka for two years before immigrating to Palestine. He took up different teaching assignments. After establishment of Israel he joined the English department at Tel Aviv University and finally settled in Haifa. He continued writing – Music and the Novel, two books on Shakespeare, one on twentieth century diaries and three volumes of his autobiography. Awards Visva Bharati University conferred on him its highest award, Desikottama (D Litt), in 1993. At the request of the vice-chancellor, Martin Kämpchen went and delivered the Insignia of Desikottama at his home on the slopes of Mountain Carmel, overlooking Haifa.

Speaking about it, producer Ved Raj said, \\"Namah was actually slated to be a one-hour weekend show and it was written in that format. Then 12 days before the telecast, a decision was taken to make it a weekday show.\\" Approximately, ₹30 lakhs are spent per episode for production of this series. Also, 20 VFX agencies are roped in for this series. Speaking about his training for his role of Shiva, Vikkas Manaktala said, \\"Martial arts training and working out in the gym helped me get the desired physique for the role. To play Shiva, your expressions and attitude have to be calm. That was really difficult for me. I started meditating and that helped me get the right expressions for the role.\\" realised that maintaining a calm and composed demeanour on screen was the bigger challenge. \\"To play Shiva, your expressions and attitude have to be calm. That was really difficult for me. I started meditating and that helped me get the right expressions for the role In order to increase the ratings of the show, makers introduced many changes in the storyline owing to which actors Vikkas Manaktala, Chhavi Pandey and Sara Khan quit the show. Manaktala and Pandey were replaced by Tarun Khanna and Rachana Parulkar. Speaking about introduction of changes in the show Producer Ved Raj said, “We tried to blend mythology with fantasy, which hasn’t managed to strike a chord with the audience. Also, mythological shows mostly focus on just one God, but in our show, we tried to highlight the bond and friendship between Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu. We have reworked the storyline and are focusing on Lord Vishnu (played by Savi Thakur). The track of Shiva will be reduced considerably, hence the decision to release Vikkas. We decided to rope in Tarun, as has played Shiva earlier and wanted someone who will be instantly accepted by the audience.” In October 2019, the series was renamed from Namah to Namah Lakshmi Narayan, the new iteration focusing mainly on Lord Vishnu and Lord Lakshmi and sidelining the story of Lord Shiva.

History = Immigration = The economy of Okinawa plummeted following its incorporation into Japan after 1879. As a result of worsening conditions, many Okinawans wished to move elsewhere for a better life. Previously, Japan had prohibited emigratIon from Okinawa Prefecture, but this decision was later reversed in the late 1890s. In 1899, the first group of Okinawan migrants were formed, numbering 26 people. Led by emigration activist Kyuzo Toyama, these laborers arrived in Hawaii on January 8, 1900. Subsequent waves of migrants came to Hawaii in the following years, with the second group, also led by Kyuzo, arriving in 1903. This group had 40 people. Okinawa's declining economy was the main contributor of emigration, but other factors included the recession caused by the Russo-Japanese War and draft dodging. = Settlement = While many Okinawans wanted to return home after making enough money in Hawaii, many also stayed behind and permanently settled. This caused the formation of the Okinawan community of Hawaii. By 1908, over 8,500 Hawaii residents were of Okinawan descent. Okinawans in Hawaii faced discrimination by the local Japanese community, who saw them as backwards due to cultural and linguistic differences. Common insults included \\"pig-eater\\", and many customs such as the hachiji (Okinawan female tattoos) were made fun of.  Identity  Because Okinawa used to be an independent country from Japan, many Okinawan migrants viewed themselves as a distinct group from the Yamato Japanese, or Naichi. The attitude of being a distinct group persists today among Hawaii Okinawans. There are numerous cultural organizations for the Okinawans in Hawaii, the largest one being the Hawaii United Okinawa Association. As of 2020, it enrolls over 40,000 people across 50 different member clubs, each pertaining to a specific region in Okinawa.

Originally from Kermit, Texas, Batchelor enlisted in the Army at age 16 and was deployed to the Korean Peninsula at the outbreak of the Korean War. He was made a prisoner of war (POW) in late 1950 after his company was overrun by Chinese forces. While interned at the Pyok-Dong POW camp, he evangelized a communist worldview to fellow prisoners and penned a letter calling for the United States to withdraw from the Korean Peninsula. According to Batchelor, his actions were the result of brainwashing. Repatriated to the United States at the end of the war, he was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment, though ultimately served less than five. Early life and education Claude Batchelor was born in Kermit, Texas, the second of his poor parents' eight children. He dropped out of high school at age 16 and lied about his age to enlist in the United States Army. Military service =Enlistment= Batchelor began his military career in 1948 and was posted to Japan with the 1st Cavalry Division Band, where he was a trumpet player. =Capture during the Korean War= Deployed to the Korean Peninsula with the 1st Cavalry Division following the outbreak of the Korean War, Batchelor was reassigned from divisional band duties to the 8th Cavalry Regiment. He participated in combat action against the Korean People's Army (KPA) from July to October 1950. Batchelor was part of a group of 15 soldiers detached from his company who, on the evening of October 31, 1950, were tasked with making contact with a remote outpost. While en route to their objective, the main portion of Batchelor's company was overrun by the People's Volunteer Army. The detachment was soon joined by the company's remnants, bringing their total strength to 30 personnel. After several skirmishes with Chinese patrols operating in the area, the American troops were attacked by a superior Chinese force near Unsan on November 5. After a two-hour firefight, the Americans surrendered. According to Batchelor's later testimony, he and his compatriots thought the Chinese would execute them but were surprised when a Chinese officer instead greeted each American prisoner by shaking hands, before ordering the group moved to a nearby house where they were fed and given cigarettes. =Conduct as a POW= Batchelor was ultimately interned at the Pyok-Dong prisoner of war (POW) camp. While there, he volunteered to serve on a \\"peace committee\\" formed by camp officials and composed of other POWs. While serving on the committee, Batchelor urged American POWs to sign a letter requesting the United States withdraw from the Korean Peninsula and to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. Batchelor also penned a letter to Kermit's newspaper, the Winkler County News, in which he denounced capitalism and American biological warfare; he led lectures to fellow POWs in which he described the injustices of Jim Crow laws and the trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. During his later court martial, some POWs testified that Batchelor had reported on them for transgressions of camp rules to the Chinese guards, though others stated that Batchelor had used his friendliness with camp officials to secure extra provisions for American prisoners. In 2010 William Smith, who was interned with Batchelor, reported that he was frequently seen within the compound carrying a copy of The Communist Manifesto. At the conclusion of hostilities, Batchelor was among 21 American POWs who refused repatriation to the United States during Operation Big Switch. However, along with Edward Dickenson, Batchelor later changed his mind and was transferred back to the United States. According to Bert Cumby, who later interrogated Batchelor, he decided to leave as Chinese officials had decided to demote him from leading the defectors in favor of another prisoner. Batchelor himself, however, said he had decided to leave after reading an article about communism by Whittaker Chambers which appeared in a copy of the Reader's Digest he had acquired while a POW. Upon return to the United States, Batchelor was promptly charged with collaboration. Court martial and imprisonment Batchelor's court martial was convened on August 30, 1954, at Fort Sam Houston in Texas. Joel Westbrook, a civilian attorney from San Antonio and officer in the Texas National Guard, represented Batchelor. During the trial, one member of the tribunal – Edward R. Schowalter Jr. – recused himself on the grounds that, prior to the trial, he had \\"formulated the opinion ... that the accused is a traitor\\". Westbrook's defense of Batchelor was based on acknowledgment of the soldier's collaboration but claim that it was involuntary and the result of brainwashing. Psychiatrist Leon Freedman testified for the defense, stating that Batchelor suffered from \\"induced political psychosis\\" and had been led to believe that he was \\"a potential savior of humanity\\". Batchelor was convicted on September 30 of several charges of communicating with the enemy without proper authority and of promoting disloyalty and disaffection among the civilian populace of the United States. He was sentenced to dishonorable discharge and life imprisonment, the sentence later cut to 20 years by order of Gen. Isaac D. White. In 1957 the sentence was further reduced, to ten years. He was confined at Federal Correctional Institution, Texarkana, and paroled after serving less than five years. Later life After being paroled, Batchelor settled in San Antonio, Texas, and went to work, first, for an accountant and, next, as a clerk for Remco Corporation, a manufacturer of air conditioner parts. In November 1960 Batchelor was charged with manslaughter over his role in a traffic accident that resulted in the death of another motorist. The following year he was fined $500 in the matter. Personal life In 1949, while posted to Japan, Batchelor wed Japanese citizen Kyoto Araki in a Shinto ceremony. They were divorced on December 20, 1961, and he married 20-year-old Evelyn Butcher of East Union, Indiana, in a civil ceremony in San Antonio later that afternoon.

It tells the creation myth of vampires, the story of the curse of Caine, his exile in the Land of Nod, and his words to his descendants, as well as prophecies covering the eventual fate of the vampire race. A Book of Nod was actually printed for use as a prop in the game and for inspiration for story-tellers. Outline The book is divided into three main sections: *The Chronicle of Caine: Outlining the events of Caine's exile, through to the great flood of the Bible. These events include the murder of his brother, defiance of God's angels, encounters with Lilith, siring of other vampires and the founding of the first city. *The Chronicle of Shadows: A collection of various noddist lore, offering advice and commandments, some attributed to Caine & others to the Clan founders. Unlike The Chronicle of Caine, these fragments do not form a cohesive story. *The Chronicle of Secrets: This section offers various portents and omens of the coming end times, known to vampires as Gehenna. While the signs of the end of days are conflicting several strong themes come through, the most important being the final generations of vampires, shortage of blood due to over crowding of hunting grounds and the awakening of the Antediluvians, the most ancient of vampires. The Book of Nod came with commentary by several Kindred scholars, including the Malkavian Aristotle de Laurent and his childe, Beckett. Supposedly the book was not meant to be widely distributed, but was stolen by a competing scholar Ayisha, who wished it available to all.  Noddism  In the World of Darkness studying and searching on the Book of Nod is known as Noddism, with the Scholars being called Noddists. Officially the Camarilla denies the existence of the ancients, believing them long extinct, its Archons hunting and destroying Noddist lore. Unofficially many Camarilla elders fear and prepare for the coming armageddon. In contrast, the Sabbat actively seeks Noddist lore in hopes of forestalling the return of the Antediluvians, viewing itself as an army set against them. A complete version of the book is unknown, though parts of it in various languages are known to exist. Fragments are widely distributed and well protected, as the secrets they contain may provide clues to the origin and fate of the kindred. Finding a complete version of the Book of Nod is comparable to finding the Rosetta Stone or the Holy Grail. Related works * White Wolf released several books containing supposed scripture from the Book of Nod. The Erciyes Fragments was included for the Vampire: The Dark Ages, along with a backstory detailing the Fragments' discovery and passing into the hands of the Giovanni. * Revelations of the Dark Mother depicted the story of the first vampires from the point of view of Lilith, Adam's first wife. She was mentioned in the first book as the being who first awakened Caine to his true potential. *These books were produced with the intention that individual Storytellers could provide information from them to their players, as the stories required. * Several other Vampire: The Masquerade books contained passages of the Book of Nod. These often conflicted with each other and Storytellers were encouraged to add to the chaos, simulating the problems the Noddist scholars must face. * The Book of Nod was allegedly the inspiration that led the Byzantine priest Procopius to write the Book of the Shining Blood, the main scripture of the Cainite Heresy.

But later analysis showed that the gamma spectrometry dates the date was minimum age and the tooth is substantially older. Endostructural features and quantiﬁed crown tissue proportions and semilandmark-based geometric morphometric analyses of the enamel-dentine junction aligns it closely with Neanderthals and shows that it is distinct from the fossil and extant modern human pattern.

USA Network has a longstanding history with sports, dating back to its existence as the Madison Square Garden Network. The 2007 Masters was also the final event for USA Sports, which was dissolved into parent NBC Sports after the tournament. All future sports telecasts on USA would use NBC's graphics and personalities. History As the immediate forerunner for the USA Network, UA-Columbia, served as the cable syndicated arm of MSG Network in New York, PRISM channel in Philadelphia, and whatever pay/cable outlets were around in 1979. =Early years as the Madison Square Garden Network= Manhattan Cable (subsequently referred to as the MSG Network) debuted in the spring of 1969 and did all home events from the Madison Square Garden: New York Knicks basketball, New York Rangers hockey, college basketball, horse shows, Golden Gloves boxing, tennis, the Westminster Dog Show, ice capades, professional wrestling, etc. The first reference to the channel as “MSG Network” was sometime around 1971–72, although the name did not become official until 1977. The first televised events were NHL and NBA playoffs in the spring of 1969; in those playoffs Marty Glickman did play-by- play for the Knicks broadcasts while Win Elliott did play-by-play for the Rangers. Meanwhile, HBO began simulcasting some MSG games in 1972 beginning with the Rangers/Vancouver Canucks game on November 8, 1972 (the first ever program televised on HBO, to a few subscribers in Wilkes-Barre, PA). 1974–75 marked the only year in which HBO used MSG announcers for their feed. Because HBO is a premium cable service, this created a burden on announcers to fill in dead airtime on HBO while commercials aired on MSG Network. HBO did not broadcast Knicks or Rangers games after the 1976–77 season. When the MSG/HBO marriage ended in 1977, Madison Square Garden proceeded to seek a new partner to launch a national network to show off its events. So for several years, beginning with the 1977–78 season, all MSG home events (such as those involving the Knicks, Rangers, etc.) were then televised on a fledgling network that would eventually become known as the USA Network. This channel, which debuted on September 22, 1977, was basically a continuation of the existing MSG Network. The key difference however, was that it was now nationally syndicated via satellite rather than terrestrially. It was also the first cable channel to be supported by advertising revenues. By this time (as previously alluded to), the channel was officially called the “Madison Square Garden Network” or MSG Network. 1979 In , the National Hockey League replaced their syndicated coverage package The NHL Network with a package on USA. As previously mentioned, the USA Network was for a time, called UA- Columbia. As the immediate forerunner for the USA Network, UA-Columbia, served as the cable syndicated arm of not only MSG Network in New York, but also PRISM channel in Philadelphia, and whatever pay/cable outlets were around in 1979. In 1979, 22 Major League Baseball teams (all but the Atlanta Braves, Houston Astros, New York Mets, and St. Louis Cardinals) participated in a one- year cable deal with United Artists Television and Columbia Pictures Television, then-owners of the USA Network. The deal involved the airing of a Thursday night Game of the Week in markets at least 50 miles (80 km) from a major league park. The deal earned Major League Baseball less than $500,000, but led to a new two-year contract for 40–45 games per season. The program ran through the 1983 season. =1980s= During USA's first three seasons (1980-1982) broadcasting college football, they broadcast several games (they in essence, cherry picked games from regional and national syndicators like Raycom, Mizlou, and Katz) a week. These broadcasts were shown on a tape delayed basis as much as two days later. USA's telecast of the 1981 Liberty Bowl was the first college bowl game to be exclusively broadcast on cable television. Mazda SportsLook with host Roy Firestone debuted in 1981 on USA Network. It was created by the advertising agency Foote, Cone and Belding to advertise one of its clients, Mazda cars. Mazda SportsLook would soon move to ESPN a year later, where it would subsequently be rechristened as Up Close. By around 1982, USA Network also carried games from the North American Soccer League, usually on Wednesday nights. USA aired college basketball games from the Big East Conference leading up to their coverage of the 1983 Big East Tournament. USA also had rights to games from the Big Ten, ACC, and the old Metro Conference. Regular season college basketball games aired on Thursday nights or Saturdays under the title of College Basketball... followed by the corresponding year during the season such as College Basketball '87. The games were subject to local blackouts. By this time, USA was airing games involving the Southeastern Conference (such as the Mississippi and Mississippi State) and games featuring UTEP and Wyoming. USA also aired the National Invitation Tournament including the finals. For USA's final four seasons (1983-1986) with college football, they narrowed their coverage to only one game a week. Initially, the games were selected from virtually every conference. However, in the later years, USA would frequently (but not exclusively) air games involving Pittsburgh, Penn State, Notre Dame, Boston College and Maryland. More to the point, by 1984, USA primarily aired games from the Big Eight Conference. When the USA Network signed a three-year (running through the 1981-82 season), $1.5 million deal, it marked the first time that the NBA had a cable television partner. USA would extend their deal with a two-year contract (along with another cable partner in the form of ESPN) worth a total of $11 million. USA typically aired approximately 35-40 regular season NBA doubleheaders on Thursday nights. Besides regular season and playoff action, USA also broadcast the NBA Draft. USA (as well as ESPN) was ultimately succeeded by TBS, who paid $20 million for two years beginning in the season. From 1982 to 1984, USA Network broadcast the UNO Twin 125sFeb 14, 1982 - The 1979— Daytona 500 was a classic race, and it happened to be the first one televised live, start to finish, by The network could hardly ... and made a deal with the USA cable network to furnish the qualifiers for cablecasting Fri day night. doing this, in effect, satisfies the inter ...Feb 16, 1984 - The trucks which pulled Into Daytona International Speedway last week were all not necessarily those containing the cars of the NASCAR drivers ...

USA also aired the Atlanta ARCA race in 1985 and televised several NASCAR Busch Series races in the late 1980s. The USA Network began first and second round Masters coverage in 1982, Ratings For Each Round of The Masters Since '82 (First/Second Rounds Since '99) which was also produced by the CBS production team. This was the first ever cable coverage for one of the golf majors. Initially, the USA Network provided Thursday and Friday coverage for 2 hours live each day along with a prime time replay. Beginning in July 1982, USA Network broadcast professional ten-pin bowling matches from the PBA Tour every Thursday night. Tuesday Night Fights aired from October 1, 1982 through August 25, 1998 on the USA Network; at one time it was the longest continually-running boxing show on television. On January 24, 1984, Al Albert, working for USA network, called what Syracuse fans call the greatest basketball game in the Carrier Dome ever. Syracuse faced Boston College, and the teams were tied 73-73 after a missed free throw by Boston College's Martin Clark. Sean Kerins passed the rebound to Pearl Washington who took three steps and made a half court shot to win the game. Albert's call lives in infamy as The Greatest Play By Play Call in the Carrier Dome ever: \\"Washington, two seconds, OHHHH! 'The Pearl' hits it ..at midcourt.\\" Syracuse University basketball fans call that the greatest nine words in Syracuse history. Beginning in 1984, USA started its stints the longtime cable home of the US Open, which moved to ESPN2 and the Tennis Channel as of 2009. After the 1984-85 season, the NHL Board of Governors chose to have USA and ESPN submit sealed bids. ESPN won by bidding nearly $25 million for three years, about twice as much as USA had been paying. The contract called for ESPN to air up to 33 regular season games each season as well as the NHL All-Star game and the Stanley Cup playoffs. After the USA Network lost the rights to the NHL to ESPN, they largely abandoned sports after the early 1990s as the channel shifted almost exclusively to scripted entertainment. =1990s= USA Network carried most of the World League of American Football games on Saturday and Monday nights in the 1991 season and again on Saturday nights for the 1992 season. Diana Nyad served as the network's host for pregame and halftime. The network premiered the helmet cam to TV audiences. ABC Sports broadcast some games in both seasons, mostly on Sunday afternoons. ABC showed the 1991 World Bowl, while USA carried the game in 1992. The reported cost of the contracts varied – the L.A. Times said that ABC had paid $28m for two years, and USA $25m. For the 1992 season the WLAF charged each network less for broadcasting rights; The New York Times reported that ABC's annual fee went down from $12m to $3m, and USA's from $14m to $10m. The ABC coverage's average ratings fell from 1991 to 1992, from around 2.1 to 1.7, and USA's from 1.2 to 1.1. Both networks asked the WLAF to expand into two major U.S. markets for 1993. From 1994–2001 (before ESPN, ESPN2 and ESPN Classic took over), USA was the American cable home of the French Open. =2000s= In early 2006, it was announced that USA was outbid by Golf Channel for its early-round PGA Tour rights, with USA's final season being 2006. NBC/Universal, parent company of USA Network, traded away the network's Friday Ryder Cup coverage through 2012 to ESPN for the rights to sign Al Michaels. However, USA did renew its Masters contract for an additional year. USA would televise the 2007 Masters before being outbid by ESPN for future coverage. The Ryder Cup contract, which stipulated cable coverage air on USA, was still controlled by NBC even after it granted ESPN the rights to Friday cable coverage (normally the only day of the event covered on cable). However, in 2010, rain on Friday pushed the singles matches to Monday, necessitating that they air on cable. With NBC having granted only Friday rights to ESPN, the singles matches aired on USA, which would be the final golf telecast for the network. Four months later, NBC merged with Golf Channel, making Golf Channel NBC's primary cable outlet for golf. Beginning in 2006, USA carried some coverage of top level hockey by cooperating with NBC's coverage of ice hockey at the Winter Olympics in 2006, 2010 and 2014; these games were mostly daytime contests that would not preempt the network's increasingly popular prime time programs. =2010s= As part of a 2011 contract renewal, Comcast's properties earned exclusive national rights for all Stanley Cup playoffs through 2021. Because NBC and NBC Sports Network could not carry all of the games on those two outlets alone, other Comcast properties would need to be used; USA was initially not used, due to the risk of preempting its popular prime time lineup, and the company instead used CNBC and NHL Network as the overflow channels for the first four years of the contract. In 2015, Comcast announced that USA would carry some games in the first two rounds of the Stanley Cup Playoffs, mainly on Tuesday and Wednesday nights, returning the NHL to USA for the first time since 1985. On January 26, 2016, NASCAR announced that the Cheez-It 355 at the Glen from Watkins Glen International would air on USA Network due to NBC and NBCSN's commitments to the Summer Olympics. =2020s= In September 2020, it was that USA would carry the September 19 college football game between the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and University of South Florida Bulls. https://www.onefootdown.com/2020/9/1/21417062/notre-dame-football-announces- home-kickoff-times-for-the-2020-season-usa-network-nbc-clemson-usf-nd It will be the first Notre Dame football game broadcast on USA, whose parent company NBC has owned rights to every Fighting Irish home game since 1991.

Based around a dysfunctional mixed family, it stars Melani Olivares, Iván Massagué, Yolanda Ramos, Nao Albet, Georgina Amorós, Leïti Sène and Nonna Cardoner. The first season premiered on Catalan broadcaster TV3 on 22 January 2018. The second and final season premiered on the same channel on 14 January 2019, ending in April that year. The first season is also available to stream on Netflix. Reviews criticised the show's tone of comedy and characterisation, but gave praise to certain performances. Within Spain, Ramos's character Victòria became particularly popular; she won a Best Actress award for the role. Synopsis Trying to organise her mixed family, single mother Àngela (Olivares) gets notice that they are being evicted because of her ex's unpaid debts against the home. She must turn to her wealthy father Eduardo (Simón Andreu), who kicked her out as a teenager, for help. However, Eduardo soon dies, having left both Àngela's family and his new wife out of his will. In the second season, Àngela's absent ex-husband appears, bringing his own family trouble.

They then chose to do black comedy in the form of the dysfunctional family drama, with Freixas saying that \\"the series explains how there is an emotional bond between the characters that is indestructible, despite the fact that they argue\\", with Mercadé adding that they wanted the show to represent how the only thing needed for parenting is love. Freixas has said that a hard part of developing the first season was getting the tone right, saying that \\"it was difficult [...] to find a direct reference\\" for it. In anticipation of the premiere of the second season, Freixas also said that this season had been difficult to create. Speaking at a network event, he said that there is a hard-to-achieve balance with having a new season \\"evolve and avoid repeating itself in certain aspects, except for those that have worked well\\", but added that he felt the challenge had been more easily overcome because the show knew its tone and the actors were by then familiar with their characters. In addition to this, after the character of Victòria became popular in season one, she was given more comedy but also more storyline and background in season two. Tomàs Delclós writes that the show is focussed by strong female figures, who each are the heads of unconventional families in a matriarchal role. It was announced that the show would not continue a week after the final episode of season two aired. Freixas had originally said that he wanted \\"about\\" three seasons in the show, and told Ara that this would be \\"the perfect duration\\". After being a success in Catalonia, Netflix bought distribution rights for the first season, but did not pick up the second season, which had not performed as well; Ara wrote that original network TV3 had to absorb all production costs because of this, and may have found it too expensive to continue. After Welcome to the Family, Freixas created a three-part Spanish period family dramedy as a Netflix original for Christmas 2019, and actors Georgina Amorós and Leïti Sène were added to the cast of Netflix's Spanish-language original Élite. =Casting and characterisation= In an interview, Melani Olivares said that the show was the first work that she had done in Catalan, though she is from Barcelona; she says she was never given the opportunity before. The season one cast list was released while the show was filming, with the cast for season two being announced shortly before it was broadcast. Within Spain, Victòria was a popular character in season one, with memorable speech. For season two, the character was made bigger by giving her more comedic moments. Sergio Navarro wrote that this didn't spoil the effect, but \\"takes the power and multiplies it\\", saying that the character becomes more \\"exaggerated, dramatic and whining,\\" to the effect of making all her lines and actions humorous. Some of the season two cast, Santi Millán and Paula Malia, were sought by the creators and hired \\"because they have a very Welcome to the Family spirit\\". Malia spoke about her casting, saying that she felt welcomed to the production and was happy to be back with the Catalan network. =Filming= It was filmed in Sant Pere de Vilamajor of Vallès Oriental, and finished recording of the first season on 20 December 2017. Olivares and Ramos have said that the filming conditions were hard, but made worth it by the good environment on set. Broadcast Welcome to the Family began showing on 22 January 2018 on Catalan channel TV3. It replaced Merlí in its slot on the network when this show ended. The second season started on 14 January 2019, and finished airing on TV3 in April 2019. Though Netflix bought distribution rights for the first season, it did not buy the second season. The first season was released on Netflix worldwide on 27 July 2018, having 13 episodes of 52 minutes. The first episode of the show was the most-watched premiere on TV3 in over ten years, being viewed by 794,000 people for a 25.1% share of the TV audience in its time slot – it notably received over 100,000 more viewers than the series finale of Merlí a week before, which had also been that show's most-watched episode. The first season had an average of 483,000 viewers and a 16.5% share per episode, with all episodes having over 350,000 viewers; the second season's viewing figures were not as high, premiering at 470,000 viewers and a 17.8% share, averaging 365,000 viewers and a 13.2% share per episode. Ara reports that this is below-average for this slot in general, with the last two episodes having less than 300,000 viewers. Reception Yolanda Ramos was seen as a star of the show, winning a Best Actress award for her role =Critical response= Ramos has described the show as more of an American style than Catalan or Spanish. It has also been described as \\"between Modern Family, Weeds and Shameless.\\" Writing for The Daily Dot, Kahron Spearman says that the first season is \\"occasionally tedious\\" but \\"ultimately heartening\\". In his review of the first episode, Sorokach says that it has a \\"Weekend at Bernie's vibe\\". The character of Raül Dorado has been likened to Saul Goodman of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul. Spearman congratulates Netflix for picking up the show as it contributes to \\"telling international stories from places Americans don't consider\\"; Jonathon Wilson of Ready Steady Cut says that it is \\"another solid piece of overseas programming\\" to be picked up by Netflix, giving it 3.5 out of 5 stars. However, both Spearman and Wilson suggest that the characters do not get a lot of depth. Spearman acknowledges that despite this, the characters are very diverse, though also finds the shift in the middle of the season trying to add more depth to be unsuccessful. Both Spearman and Wilson also note that the different tones of dark comedy and awkward teenage gags in the show do not work well together. Both reviewers, and Josh Sorokach of Decider, give positive notes to how the show steps outside what a normal family is defined as. Reviewing for the Argentine newspaper Clarín, Pablo Raimondi is critical of the show. He suggests that Netflix picked it up after Merlí became popular on the streaming service, but that it will not repeat that success. Raimondi says that the main characters overact, the rest of the characters are caricatures, and that there are too many coincidences. The show has been placed within a context of the Catalan independence movement, and the 2017 declaration of independence and its aftermath in particular. Wilson writes that while using eviction as the story starter is not original, it feels regionally appropriate due to unrest in Catalonia at the time the show was set. Rebecca Patton for Bustle begins her review with a paragraph outlining the situation in Catalonia at the time, though says \\"it's unclear from the trailer whether [the show] will touch on all of this political unrest\\". Wilson criticises the lack of originality in Àngela's character, and that the actors playing her sons are visibly too old to pass as her children; he describes Ivan Massagué's Nando as an \\"unofficial David Spade stand-in\\", while Sorokach writes that \\"in terms of a sleeper star, Georgina Amorós' Alex, the spirited teenage daughter of Victoria, is a tour de force\\" for her unique energy, wit, and one-liners. Raimondi gives rare praise in his review to Nao Albet, saying that \\"only a few one-liners from the analytical Fran [...] stand out among the cast\\". In Catalonia's leading newspaper, La Vanguardia, Francesc Puig affirms that Yolanda Ramos' Victòria is the scene stealer through both seasons, which he says is \\"in part because of her mixing of Catalan and Spanish\\". The director of the TV3 network, Vicent Sanchis, says that the show is different in that it captured an audience of young people who do not usually watch traditional television, which he believes was due to its dark humour, and added that this contributed to its overall success. The dubbing of the show has been strongly criticised. For the English version, Wilson writes that \\"[u]nless you're militantly opposed to reading your television, subtitles are the route you should take\\", with Raimondi noting in his negative review that \\"the dub in Spanish doesn't help\\". In 2019, James Tapper for The Observer suggested that, with subtitle augmentation, the show could be used to help learn the Catalan language. Reviewing season two for El País, Delclós suggests that the necessary suspension of disbelief is harder to cover up with comedy, and worries that the more dramatic story elements are \\"hard tests\\" for the show's \\"cast of comedians\\". =Awards and nominations= The show was nominated for two awards at the 2018 : Best Fiction Series and Best Actress for Yolanda Ramos; Ramos won.

Biography =Provenance. early years and family= Charlotte was the fourth of the fourteen children of the prosperous banker John Thornton (1764–1835) by his marriage to his second wife, born Maria Elisabeth Grupen. John Thornton's ancestors were from England, where he still had family connections. His wife came originally from Celle where her father's work involved, among other things, international finance between Hamburg and England. Charlotte's education came largely from governesses: she learned English, French, dancing, piano playing and the social accomplishments appropriate to her expected station in life. She herself would later recall that through her childhood she was spared from the sight of poverty and deprivation, unaware that more than half of her fellow Hamburg citizens lived on the edge of subsistence. Hamburg was annexed by the French in 1810, becoming the administrative capital of a new department called Bouches-de-l'Elbe. Charlotte's family fell under suspicion because of her father's family and business connections to England, but they avoided deportation by handing over a large amount of money. In March 1813 the French withdrew from the city which was now occupied instead by the Russians. The Russian army of occupation was commanded by Colonel von Tettenborn, an aristocrat from the Rhineland who had been serving with he Russian army since 1812. The colonel had an adjutant called Lachmann who was billeted in Hamburg with the Thorntons. Still aged only fifteen, Charlotte fell in love with Lachmann and the two became engaged. Shortly after this John Thornton decided his daughter's fiancé was a bounder (\\"Hallodri\\"). According to one source the engagement was broken off. Almost immediately the Russian army withdrew from Hamburg, and the French occupation returned. By now the trade war between Napoleon and the British was intensifying, greatly damaging Hamburg's mercantile trade, and meaning that John Thornton's English connections placed him under greater suspicion than ever. The family fled to London where they undertook an extended stayed with relatives. Charlotte blossomed. At the end of Summer in 1814, with Napoleon \\"safely out of the way\\", the Thorntons returned. Their wealth had been destroyed by Napoleon's trade wars, and they could no longer afford to live in Hamburg. They settled in Lübeck. On 18 August 1814, aged still not quite seventeen, Charlotte Thornton married the Hamburg estate agent Christian Paulsen, in compliance with her father's wishes. Twenty years older than she was, Paulsen was rather a dull fellow after all the admirers whose company she had enjoyed in London, but he was able to provide her with a relatively comfortable life. Although relatively little is known of him, he seems to have been a kindly and tolerant man with a strong social conscience: Charlotte was much changed by the marriage. Elisabeth, the couple's daughter, was born on 1 October 1815. Charlotte was an attentive and loving mother. She homeschooled Elisabeth herself, at the same time substantially expanding her own educational horizons. Like her mother, Elisabeth married young. In 1832, Elisabeth Paulsen married a pharmacist from Oldesloe called Julius Lorentzen. Charlotte Paulsen frequently discussed the issues that concerned them both with her new son in law. Conservative leaders who imposed a return to their version of the old order at Vienna in 1814 and 1815 had not been able to bury the ideas of enlightenment humanity and rationalism which French revolutionary armies and the administrative genius of Napoleon had disseminated across Europe during the preceding 25 years. The 1830s might have been the age of Biedermeier, but this was also the decade of the \\"Vormärz\\". Régime change in Paris in 1830 was followed by a wave of protests across Germany. Julius Lorentzen instilled in Charlotte Paulsen a new awareness of democratic thoughts and ideas. Their discussions covered Theology, Philosophy and contemporary developments. But then Lorentzen died young, in 1837. Christian and Charlotte Paulsen now adopted a daughter, Marie Paulsen, and Charlotte engaged in her second daughter's education with the intensity that she had applied to the education of Elisabeth. Outside the house, politically conscious women were being caught up in civil protests and the programmes for liberal reform that were now emerging, together with demands for democratic rights for citizens, including women. Elisabeth Paulsen also felt under pressure that she, too, should be \\"doing more\\". Later she decided to set up the \\"Weiblichen Verein für Armen- und Krankenpflege\\" (\\"Women's Association for the Care of the Poor and Sick\\") which had been set up in Hamburg by the formidably energetic Amalie Sieveking in 1832, as a response to the Cholera epidemic of that year. However, Sieveking rejected her approaches, finding Paulsen too much of a \\"free thinker\\". It grated with Sieveking that even if Paulsen's motives were honorable, humanist and rational, they seemed not to be overwhelmingly Christian. =Social engagement= In the end, Charlotte Paulsen joined the Hamburg based women's association, \\"Zur Brudertreue an der Elbe\\". Soon after that, in 1848, she also joined the \\"Deutschkatholische Gemeinde\\" (\\"German Catholic Community\\"). This was a non-denominational association. Members sought to practice their Christianity according to basic democratic principles, applying complete equality of voting power for all members, especially through the participation of women, and without the constraints imposed by association with one or other of the different church denominations. Others involved included Bertha Ronge, the three sisters Goldschmidt sisters and Emilie Wüstenfeld, with whom Paulsen developed a particularly close friendship and working relationship. After the perceived failure in Germany of the 1848 revolution the women decided that their priority should be the creation of a new liberated generation through education. Back in 1840 the educational philosopher and pioneer Friedrich Fröbel had coined the word \\"Kindergarten\\" (loosely a \\"garden for cultivating children like plants in a garden\\"), and called upon women in Germany to take inspiration from his experimental \\"play and activity\\" establishment in Bad Blankenburg and set up similar institutions across Germany. Charlotte Paulsen was far from unique in responding to these promptings. The Kindergarten movement was backed particularly strongly both by those advocating democratic structures for Germany and among middle-class women who saw the education of very young children as hugely important. During this period many so-called \\"Bewahrschulen\\" (loosely, \\"looking after schools\\") and \\"Kindertagesheime\\" (\\"Children's Day Homes\\") were established. Additionally, in March 1849 Charlotte Paulsen founded the \\"Weiblichen Verein für Armen- und Krankenpflege\\" (\\"Women's Association for the Care of the Poor and Sick\\"). Prosperity had returned to Hamburg and she was able to collect money from well-to-do city folk with which she was able to pay for impoverished couples to get married, look after the sick and newly married by providing them with soup and finding them jobs. However, she had somehow made a particular enemy of Amalie Sieveking who thought her an immoral unbeliever, and shared the opinion. At a time when there was no blanket schooling obligation in Hamburg, Paulsen and her colleagues set about creating a school of their own, in order to give poor children the chance of going to school after they were too old for Kindergarten. They taught children in groups of more than twenty at a time, but they were banned from this activity shortly afterwards because they had not obtained a teaching permit. However, based on a law dating back to 1732, it was established that homeschooling required no permit, as long as no more than twelve children were taught at a time. The women now pursued their educational project with smaller groups, using suitably sized rooms in the homes of the more relatively well-to-to backers. They continued to attract hostility from the authorities because they did not expressly each religion as part of the curriculum, but responded by insisting on the importance of inter- denominational \\"confessional independence\\", able to accommodate children from Catholic, Protestant and Jewish families. After further wrangling, they managed to find and recruit a qualified teacher with the necessary teaching permit and in 1856 opened a \\"proper\\" school, centrally located in Hamburg, which at the outset welcomed sixty pupils. Charlotte Paulsen now devoted her life unstintingly to her association for the care of the poor and sick, while campaigning with increasing urgency for religious and political freedom, and advocating women's emancipation. After her husband died her financial resources became exhausted. For some time she lived with the children in the care centre, before moving into a little apartment of her own in Hamburg- Mundsburg. Dressed in simple clothes, she became a familiar sight on the city streets, helping the poor and others in need. After she died in 1862 she was buried in a simple coffin in the St. Gertrude church yard. Charlotte Paulsen's ambition that pre-school children and school-age children should be educated in a single establishment was realised only after her death: the institution opened on 3 November 1866, bearing the name \\"Paulsenstift\\" as a tribute to Charlotte Paulsen. It was subsequently destroyed by bombing in 1943 and then reconfigured and relaunched in 1945 as the Charlotte-Paulsen-Gymnasium (secondary school).

It is made from a frozen moose steak, or other meat, that is roasted at a low temperature.  Preparation  The tjälknöl is cooked in the oven from a solid-frozen state at only 75–100 °C for 12 hours until the core temperature reach 75 °C. After cooking the meat is allowed to rest in the fridge for 5 hours submerged in brine inside a covered tight container, for example a freeze bag, together with other spices such as garlic, cranberries, bay leafs, and lingon berries. The meat needs to be turned a couple of times so that it is evenly soaked. The tjälknöl is served cold in thin slices with, for example, a potato gratiné or on the Christmas table. The dish has some similarities to roast beef, but is cooked at a lower temperature and for a longer time which makes the meat very tender.  Etymology  The name comes from the words \\"tjäle\\" and \\"knul\\". \\"Tjäle\\" means tjaele, or when something is frozen solid, in this case the steak. The word \\"knul\\" is a Norrland dialect word meaning \\"lump\\", with \\"knöl\\" being the standard Swedish equivalent.  History  The dish was created by Ragnhild Nilsson (1926–2006) from Hundberget outside Torpshammar, Sweden in the 1970s. Ragnhild was married to a moose-hunter and had asked her husband to thaw a moose steak while she was at work. Her husband initially forgot about it, but then panicked and put the solid-frozen steak in the oven to thaw at a very low temperature. He then left the house and forgot about the oven. The next day when Ragnhild came home from work she immediately understood what had happened and how long the steak had been left in the oven. She initially contemplated to use it as dog food, but as it was such fine meat she instead tried to save the tasteless steak by soaking it in brine for a couple of hours. Later when the couple tried the steak they found it both tender and good. Ragnhild improved the recipe over the years, until 1982 when her husband surreptitiously admitted it to a competition held by ICA-kuriren where they looked for new provincial dishes. Ragnhild's tjälknöl won the competition as Medelpad's new provincial dish.

At the 2016 census, the area had a population of 108. History The Wardandi people inhabited the Ludlow area before European settlement. A school, Ludlow School (originally known as Ludlow Bridge School), existed in the area as early as 1866, but initially operated intermittently due to low patronage. A pine plantation was first set up at Ludlow in 1909,with a nursery being developed in 1916. After the passage of the Forestry Act (1918), Conservator of Forests Charles Lane Poole set up a small forestry settlement in the area, along with the Ludlow Forestry School, the first such institution in Western Australia, which operated from 1921 to 1927. During the 1920s the area was also part of the Group Settlement Scheme for dairy production, and a general store and district office were built, as well as a new school building for children in the Ludlow area. The first thinnings were harvested from the pine plantation in 1936/37 and by the early 1940s timber from Ludlow was being used to make cases and crates for food storage during World War II. During the post-war housing boom, Ludlow was used to supply plywood for the housing industry. European immigrants (\\"New Australians\\") began working in the Ludlow pine plantation and by the mid-1950s a sawmill and planer mill, along with workers' cottages that formed the main Ludlow forestry settlement, had been constructed. The settlement was divided by the Ludlow River; the north side, where most of the cottages were built, is in the area of the Shire of Capel. By the early 1970s the sawmill had been closed and plantings were discontinued in the pine plantation in 1973; the planer mill was closed a few years later. The Tuart Forest National Park was declared in the area in 1987 and The Ludlow Forestry Mill and Settlement was registered on the State Register of Heritage Places in 2006. In 2016 the Department of Parks and Wildlife, which rented out the cottages, evicted the occupants, citing maintenance issues, age, and housing conditions; the cottages have since been abandoned.

He lobbied for the start of Project HARP to investigate this concept in the 1960s, using paired ex-US Navy 16\\"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun barrels welded end-to-end. Three of these 16\\"/100 (406 mm) guns were emplaced, one in Quebec, Canada, another in Barbados, and the third near Yuma, Arizona. HARP was later cancelled, and Bull turned to military designs, eventually developing the GC-45 howitzer. Some years later, Bull interested Saddam Hussein in funding Project Babylon. The objective of this project is not certain, but one possibility is that it was intended to develop a gun capable of firing an object into orbit, from whence it could then drop onto any place on the Earth.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. History Tourism on Isle Royale began in the late 1800s as steamship companies advertised the area. Around 1900, fisherman Gus Mattson began boarding guests at his fishing station located on Minong Island in Tobin Harbor. Over the next decade, a number of cottages and guest houses were constructed on and around Minong Island. In 1906, Mattson sold his Minong Island resort to three men from Calumet, Michigan, who renamed it the Tobin's Harbor Summer Resort (and later the \\"Minong Lodge\\"). Gradually, other resorts were established, and small summer communities began to grow around the area, which continued into the late 1920s. However, the rise of the automobile led to diminishing travel by steamship, and Isle Royale became harder to reach. Visits to the island began to decline. Local resort owners advocated for the establishment of a national park on the island, hoping that would increase tourism. In 1936, the federal government began to purchase private property on Isle Royale, for the purpose of creating a national park. The National Park Service took over operation of some resorts in the area. However, as tourism on the island changed, these were gradually closed, and many buildings removed. Some of the remaining structures have deteriorated and are overgrown, although some are still occupied by children of the original owners under a life lease. Description The camps in the Tobin Harbor Historic District are typically a small collection of single story frame structures. These include a main residence, one or two guest cabins, a privy, and occasionally other buildings. The residences are seasonal, with unfinished interiors, wood stove heating, and usually no power or plumbing. They are generally small frame buildings with lap or shiplap siding and gabled or hipped roofs covered with asphalt roll or asphalt shingle. They commonly have deep, full width front porch, often enclosed, with a view of the water. Windows in the structures are double hung units, either six over sixes, or one over one, two, six or eights. The buildings have concrete block, stone or log pier foundations, or directly are set directly on stone. There are 13 groups of buildings in the district: 12 private camps and a fishery. These are: *Mattson Fishery, consisting of two residences, a privy, fish house, dock, and a number of storage buildings.

Biography  Born into the Russian nobility, Barannikov was educated at a military gymnasium (secondary school) in Orlov, and at the First Pavlovsk Military School in St Petersburg. In 1876, he faked suicide, leaving a note for the principal, to join the revolutionary movement, as a propagandist in the Rostov-on-Don area. In 1877, he joined the Zemlya i volya (\\"Land and Freedom\\") party. He settled in the Nizhny Novgorod region, trying to recruit local farmers. Returning to St Petersburg, he was one of the first to advocate that the revolutionaries should use terrorist tactics. He was one of the organisers of the assassination of the chief of the gendarmes, General Nikolay Mezentsov, who was stabbed to death by Sergey Kravchinsky. Barannikov was one of the participants in the founding conference of Narodnaya Volya in Lipetsk conference, in June 1879, and was appointed to its executive committee. In 1880, he took part in an attempts to kill the Tsar by placing a mine under the Moscow-Kursk railway, and by dynamiting the Kamenny Bridge in St Petersburg. Arrested in January 1881, he was a defendant at the Trial of the 20 in March 1882. He died of tuberculosis in the Aleyevsky Ravelin, in the Peter and Paul Fortress.  Personality  According to Praskovya Ivanovskaya, who ran Narodnaya Volya's secret printing press: \\"In radical circles, he was justifiably known as a 'knight without fear or reproach', the most devoted soldier of the revolution ...(with) enviable tact in all matters, and, particularly, an unfailingly gentlemanly attitude to women.\\"  Marriage  Barannikov married a fellow revolutionary, Maria Ovennikova, who was about six years older than he was. She also was a founding member of the executive. She was assigned the task of running a safe house in St Petersburg. In 1882, she fled abroad to act as Narodnaya Volya's representative in Paris.

O'Brien (1890–1958) was an American politician who served as mayor of Revere, Massachusetts. Early life O'Brien was born in 1890 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He served in the armed forces during World War I. Prior to entering politics he worked as a conductor the Bay State Street Railway and served as president and business agent of the railway's Carmen's Union. Politics In 1920, O'Brien was named Revere's assistant commissioner of public works. He was fired by mayor John E. Walsh in November 1925. The following month the Revere city council granted him a permit to open a gas station. In 1929, O'Brien was elected city treasurer. During his tenure, O'Brien, a Democrat, clashed with the city's Republican mayor Andrew A. Casassa. In 1934, O'Brien challenged Casassa in the city's first nonpartisan election. He topped the ticket in the four-way primary election which also included former state senator Conde Brodbine and state representative Thomas F. Carroll. Crime was the main issue during the campaign, specifically the unsolved murders of two well-known Revere men. In the general election, O'Brien defeated Casassa 7,564 votes to 5,552. O'Brien was inaugurated on January 7, 1935. Immediately after taking office, O'Brien removed the entire board of health, fired most of the welfare department, and dismissed nine police officers who had recently been hired by the outgoing mayor. He also requested investigators from the state welfare department to look into everyone who was receiving public aid. On July 15, 1935, O'Brien was beaten unconscious in his living room by former New England middleweight boxing champion Bob Jasse. Jasse had been fired from his job as a special officer at Suffolk Downs earlier that day and blamed O'Brien. O'Brien suffered a concussion, facial contusions, and a broken nose. Jasse claimed that O'Brien had struck him first after O'Brien accused him of spreading rumors that he had stole $12,000 while serving as city treasurer to use on his mayoral campaign. Jasse was found not guilty of assault and battery with intent to murder, but was convicted on the lesser charge of assault and battery. He was sentenced to 18 months in the Deer Island House of Correction. Investigations and conviction On October 14, 1935, the Massachusetts Division of Accounts reported a cash shortage of $13,277.04 in the accounts of the city treasurer during the period O'Brien held that office. On January 27, 1936, O'Brien claimed that the shortage was only $107.63, as $12,401.51 in unaccounted money had been found sitting in a tin box in the treasurer's safe and another $749.90 was due to bad checks that the city was now trying to collect. He denied embezzling the money, but admitted to rarely balancing or auditing the accounts and relying on his personal secretary, who didn't have any bookkeeping experience. Nonetheless, O'Brien was reelected in 1936. On October 30, 1937, O'Brien appointed his personal secretary, Josephine M. Farrell, to the position of city auditor. She was the first woman to ever hold this position. On November 23, 1937, gambler and racketeer Louis Gaeta was murdered. O'Brien controversially ordered that the flags on public buildings be lowered to half staff in honor of Gaeta. Following the murder, Governor Charles F. Hurley issued what The Boston Globe called \\"the most drastic order against crime ever issued by a Governor of Massachusetts\\" into illegal activities in Revere. A team of police officers hand-picked by Boston Police Department Captain James T. Sheehan were tasked with \\"cleaning up\\" the city over the heads of local police. They were permitted to arrest without question and allowed to investigate in neighboring Boston and Chelsea, if necessary. O'Brien promised full cooperation, to which Sheehan replied \\"Revere can take care of the drunks\\". On January 12, 1938, Massachusetts Attorney General Paul A. Dever requested that the Massachusetts General Court grant the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court power to remove a mayor from office for cause, stating that \\"glaring misfeasance, malfeasance, and nonfeasance\\" made O'Brien's removal \\"absolutely necessary\\". The legislature decided against enacting such a law. On May 27, 1938, a grand jury indicted O'Brien on charges of larceny and embezzlement of $15,635.43 from the city of Revere. O'Brien proclaimed his innocence and on June 12 announced his campaign for reelection. He was defeated in a landslide by city tax collector Laurence J. Gillis. On May 4, 1939, O'Brien was found guilty of embezzling $13,277.04 from the city of Revere during his tenure as city treasurer. He was found not guilty of embezzlement and larceny for $2,368.29 in tax payments that O'Brien's successor as treasurer could not find records for. On June 23 he was sentenced to three to five years in Charlestown State Prison. O'Brien appealed his conviction and on March 13, 1940, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court overturned the verdict, ruling that there was not enough evidence for a jury to convict O'Brien. Later life and death In 1948, O'Brien returned to city government as a building inspector. He retired a few years later. O'Brien died on March 4, 1958 at the Veterans' Administration Hospital in Jamaica Plain.

The film is based on the 2013 South Korean film of the same name directed by Lee Hwan-kyung. The film revolves around Lito (Aga Muhlach), a mentally challenged man who was wrongfully accused of killing the daughter of Secretary Yulo (Tirso Cruz III) as well as his attempt to maintain relations with his own daughter Yesha (Xia Vigor) through the help of his fellow inmates. Distributed and produced by Viva Films, the film premiered on December 25, 2019 as one of the eight official entries to the 2019 Metro Manila Film Festival. Plot Joselito “Lito” Gopez is a mentally impaired man with the intellect of a six-year-old. He lives in a run-down house in Marikina River along with his daughter Yesha. One day, he gets into a physical altercation with the Defense Secretary Yulo, who has just purchased the last Sailor Moon backpack for his daughter, a gift Lito was saving up to buy for Yesha. Soon after, Secretary Yulo's daughter dies in a freak accident, in which she slips because of the wet pavement and suffers a fatal blow in the head while taking Lito to a store that sells the same backpack. When Lito tries to resuscitate her, a bystander mistakenly thinks he is molesting her. Lito is falsely accused of the kidnapping, murder and rape of a minor. Police quickly take advantage of his disability and force him to confess to the crimes while ignoring exonerating evidence. Lito is imprisoned and assigned to Cell No. 7, the harshest cell in a maximum security prison. The other men in the cell led by gang leader Soliman “Boss Sol” with Mambo, Choy, Bong, and Tatang Celso initially don't take kindly to Lito after reading in his file that he murdered and molested a child. When Lito saves Boss Sol from being fatally stabbed by a rival gang leader, Boss Sol repays the favor by smuggling Yesha into Cell No. 7. The cell's inmates slowly befriend Lito and believe he is a good man who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. They help him rehearse what to say at his trial. Eventually, even the warden Johnny, who is initially harsh to Lito but softens up when the latter saves him from an arson attack, realizes that Lito was merely cornered into making a false confession. He takes custody of Yesha and allows her to visit her father every now and then. Secretary Yulo, however, threatens to harm Yesha if Lito doesn't confess his \\"crime\\" during his trial. Lito ultimately chooses to sacrifice himself by pleading guilty and getting the death sentence. His execution date of December 23 coincides with Yesha's birthday. Before the date, Boss Sol and fellow inmates work on a hot air balloon and force Lito and Yesha to board to try and let them escape, but ultimately failed because of a rope connected to the hot air balloon caught in a barbed wire, later on in the film Lito was executed. Years after Lito's execution, Yesha, who has been formally adopted by Johnny, has become a lawyer. She gathers her father's former inmates, all of whom have been released, to testify at her late father's retrial, which results in his acquittal. She then imagine her father dancing with their signature dance.

The film is an adaptation of the 2013 South Korean film of the same name. The original film was directed by Lee Hwan-kyung. The film being a Philippine adaptation of a South Korean film is set in the Philippines. The protagonists' residence is situated somewhere along the Marikina River. Several other aspects of the film were changed from the source material including the names of the characters. The prison which served as the main setting of the Philippine adaptation was filmed in a sound stage in Cainta, Rizal. Aga Muhlach's character is the counterpart of Yong-gu of the original Korean film while Bela Padilla's character was the counterpart of Yong-gu's daughter Ye-seung. Among the challenge of posed by the adaptation process is how a faithful depiction of Philippine prisons would affect the film's plot. In the original South Korean film, the prisons were closed confinements with metal doors while in the Philippines prisons are less restrictive with metal railings instead which would pose problem on how the lead character's fellow inmates would hide his daughter from the jail wardens. The Philippine film also had less focus on the trial portion compared to its South Korean counterpart. Nadine Lustre was supposed to play Padilla's role but withdrew from the film project citing a need to take a break after her stints with two 2019 films, Ulan and Indak. Marketing A teaser was released in November 2019 for Miracle in Cell No. 7 which had at least 7 million online views in 24 hours. The full trailer for the film was released in December 2019. Lead actor, Aga Muhlach also guested in Headstart to promote the film.

She participated in committees including hiring, powwow, economic development, education, constitutional task force, health board, and the Ojibwa senior board. = Keweenaw Bay Ojibwa Community College = Parrish worked at Keweenaw Bay Indian Community (KBIC) for 46 years including nearly 20 years as president of Keweenaw Bay Ojibwa Community College. She reestablished KBOCC as an institution of higher learning. In 1998, Tribal Council granted Parrish permission to reopen KBOCC which was charted in 1975 but closed down in 1980. It first started in a section of the Ojibwa Senior Citizen's center before expanding to its own buildings in Baraga in 2000. Under Parrish's leadership, KBOCC joined the American Indian Higher Education Consortium. At KBOCC, she oversaw the college achieve accreditation and expanded the campus in L'Anse, Michigan. Initiatives she worked with included Indian tuition waivers, creation of a L'Anse campus land trust, and advocating for the continuance of the Title III Higher Education Act. In 2013, KBOCC became fully accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and was granted became a Land-grant university in 2014. On January 26, 2018, she announced her resignation and retirement from KBOCC. Parrish stated she would still work as a consultant but wanted to take time to \\"relax and enjoy family.\\" Parrish was succeeded by interim president Cherie Dakota. In August 2018, Lori Ann Sherman became president of KBOCC.  Research  Parrish received funding from the Economic Research Service to conduct health assessments and a nutrition screening of the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community. This study consisted of nutrition surveys for families with children ages 1 to 4. A major obstacle facing the project included the distribution of surveys because the tribal operations did not have a central mailing list. Her study aimed to document the prevalence of nutrition related diseases in tribal youth, reduce the incidence of chronic diseases, and to create programs to teach Ojibwe culture with the goal of encouraging healthy lifestyles.  Personal life  Parrish has two children, Sharon Geroux of New Mexico and deceased son, Rick Geroux. After his death, a memorial scholarship was established at KBOCC. Parrish has seven grandchildren and cared for twelve foster children.

The racist messages were publicised on social media, which led to the society being dissolved and some students being suspended and expelled.  Background  Bracton Law Society was a student law society founded in the University of Exeter in 1965. It was named after English jurist Henry de Bracton, who was appointed the chancellor of Exeter Cathedral in 1264. At its largest, BLS had more than 1000 student members and partnerships with 35 major law firms. University of Exeter student Arsalan Motavali created a Whatsapp groupchat for BLS members in November 2017. Later on fellow University of Exeter student Matthew Bell replaced Motavali as the group administrator and changed the name to \\"Dodgy Blokes Soc\\".  Incident  Five Exeter law students sent allegedly racist, islamphobic and sexist messages in the group, including “if you ain’t English, go home,” “bomb the mosques,” “we need a race war,” and \\"rape them lifeless.\\" In March 2018, Motavali took screenshots of the conversations and posted them on Facebook, where they were shared more than 6000 times. He also reported the incident to the university and Exeter's students' union, Exeter Guild.  Investigation  On 20 March, the university announced that it had informed the police and launched an internal investigation regarding the incident. The five students involved were suspended for a week while the investigation took place.  Reactions  Vice Chancellor Professor Sir Steve Smith said \\"These outcomes are subject to appeal... but they show our absolute commitment to take serious action against those whose behaviour is fundamentally at odds with the commitment to inclusivity, tolerance and respect that lies at the heart of everything we stand for.\\" A spokesman for the university commented \\"The University of Exeter does not tolerate any form of racist, sexist or bigoted behaviour and is committed to eradicating any instances of discrimination and harassment that may arise.\\" On 19 March 2018, BLS posted on Twitter \\"Bracton Law Society has taken the decision to remove those involved from committee... The Society does not condone or tolerate such behaviour\\" The Students' Guild, stated that \\"The Students’ Guild do not tolerate this kind of behaviour. We have launched a major investigation in conjunction with the University.\\" On 22 March, students at the university organised a peaceful protest on Streatham campus, which aimed to raise awareness of racism on campus. Bell issued an apology, stating: \\"I will not attempt to excuse and deny any of the statements I have made. The comments, which I shall not repeat, are inexcusable and undeniably wrong.\\"  Aftermath  The university announced that it had suspended and expelled an unspecified number of students. Bell and Crawford were dismissed by their law firms, Hill Dickinson and Reynolds Porter Chamberlain, respectively. Bracton Law Society was officially disbanded and replaced by a new student society. On 3 June 2018, Exeter Guild organised its first, annual Exeter Respect on Campus event which aimed to end racism on campus through food, speeches and performing arts.

On 15 August 2019, the Airbus A321 operating the flight carried 226 passengers and seven crew. The flight suffered a bird strike after taking off from Zhukovsky and crash landed in a cornfield, past the airport. All on board survived; 74 people sustained injuries, but none were severe. Accident The aircraft suffered a bird strike shortly after takeoff from Zhukovsky International Airport, Moscow, Russia, bound for Simferopol International Airport, Simferopol, Crimea. A passenger recorded the plane's descent into a cornfield after a flock of gulls struck both CFM56-5 engines. The first bird strike caused a complete loss of power in the left engine. A second bird strike caused the right engine to produce insufficient thrust to maintain flight. The pilots opted to make an emergency landing in a cornfield beyond the end of the airport runway and decided to turn off both engines just before touchdown. The aircraft made a hard landing in the cornfield from Zhukovsky International Airport. The pilot chose not to lower the landing gear in order to skid more effectively over the corn. Everyone on board the flight survived. There have been differing reports on the number of injuries sustained as the criteria for counting a person as \\"injured\\" are not overly strict. According to some reports, 55 people received medical attention at the scene. 29 people were taken to hospital, of whom 23 were injured. Six people were admitted as in-patients. The number of injuries was finally fixed at 74, none of whom was severely injured. All passengers were offered (US$) as accident compensation. Aircraft The aircraft was an Airbus A321-211, registered in Bermuda as VQ-BOZ, msn 2117. It was built in 2003 for MyTravel Airways (as G-OMYA), who decided not to accept it; it was then transferred to Cyprus Turkish Airlines as TC-KTD. It then operated for AtlasGlobal as TC-ETR in 2010, and Solaris Airlines in 2011 as EI-ERU, before being delivered to Ural Airlines in 2011 as VQ-BOZ. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair in the accident and the airline announced that it would be cut up in situ (on site) to be scrapped, in an operation that was scheduled to commence on 23 August 2019. The accident represents the sixth hull loss of an Airbus A321.  Crew  The pilot in command was 41-year-old who graduated from the , in Buguruslan, Russia, in 2013. He has also received a degree in Air Navigation from the Ulyanovsk Institute of Civil Aviation, in Ulyanovsk, Russia. At the time of the accident, he had over 3,000 hours of flight time. The co-pilot was 23-year-old who also graduated from the Buguruslan Flight School of Civil Aviation, in 2017. At the time of the accident, he had over 600 hours of flight time. There were five flight attendants on board.  Proliferation of birds near airport  The proliferation of birds near Moscow–Zhukovsky is attributed to illegal waste dumps. The deployed bird control measures are overwhelmed and insufficient. In 2012, the management of one of the waste sites had been sued in Zhukovsky district court, alleging that \\"the waste sorting facilities attract massive numbers of birds due to significant content of edible refuse, and with the site located at the distance of from the airport runway this could lead to collisions between birds and aircraft, threatening human life and limb\\". The court did not find sufficient grounds to rule in favor of plaintiffs and their demands to enjoin the defendants from sorting or storing household waste at the specified site. As of 2019, this site is no longer sorting or storing household waste, instead compacting it and transferring it further for disposal; the operations, however, are conducted outdoors. A Zhukovsky air traffic controller declared: In September 2019, Rosaviatsiya proposed to work with law enforcement authorities to check the legality of waste dumps near airports, and will also examine the frequency of scheduled and unscheduled inspections of airports for the presence of birds.  Reactions  Damir Yusupov (left) and Georgy Murzin (right) at the awards ceremony in the Kremlin, 21 November 2019 Shortly after the accident, Ural Airlines released a statement on Twitter stating: \\"Flight U6178 Zhukovsky-Simferopol on departure from Zhukovsky sustained multiple bird strikes to the aircraft engines. The aircraft made an emergency landing. There were no injuries to the passengers and crew.\\" The airline praised the professionalism of the pilots. On social media, immediate comparisons were made between the accident and the \\"Miracle on the Hudson\\" incident involving US Airways Flight 1549. The pilot in command, Damir Yusupov, and first officer, Georgy Murzin, were awarded the honorary title of Hero of the Russian Federation; the other five crew members were decorated with the Order of Courage. While being praised in Russia, the crew of the aircraft was entered into the blacklist of Ukrainian NGO Myrotvorets (\\"Peacemaker\\"), which accused them of \\"knowingly and on multiple occasions making illegal crossings of the state border of Ukraine\\". Author of the first Russian disaster movie Air Crew, Alexander Mitta, announced plans to make a film based on the events of Flight 178. Investigation The Interstate Aviation Committee (, МАК) opened an investigation into the accident. The investigation is being assisted by Rosaviatsiya, the British Air Accidents Investigation Branch, and the French Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile. The cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder were both successfully recovered and their data downloaded.

Raymond Leppard, Erato CD, ECD 88100, 1985 The cover of the second version of the album was designed by Thierry Cohen, and features a photograph of von Stade taken by Colette Masson. Critical reception Claudio Monteverdi painted by Bernardo Strozzi in Venice in 1640 Alan Blyth reviewed the first version of the album on LP in Gramophone in September 1985. He warned his readers that all its music was performed in Raymond Leppard's own, controversial realizations. On the one hand, some listeners would \\"delight in [their] sheer sensuousness\\"; on the other, people who placed a premium on fidelity to Monteverdi's and Cavalli's intentions would \\"protest that this isn't really how the music should sound\\". He himself felt ambivalent, relishing the album's euphony while acknowledging that it was not historically authentic. He was in two minds about Frederica von Stade's singing also. The timbre of her voice, touching though it was, did not vary from item to item as much as it ideally should have done. Her words were not infused with sufficient meaning. Other mezzos had sung Ottavia's two anguished arias more passionately. Plumbing profound depths of feeling was not, perhaps, a task to which von Stade was especially suited. On the positive side, the album's \\"languishing\\" songs by Monteverdi were more successful, as were its arias by the less emotionally demanding Cavalli. It was true, too, that von Stade sang with more \\"consistently even tone\\" than some of her predecessors in the album's repertoire, and that, \\"an experienced artist in baroque opera\\", she scarcely perpetrated an unstylistic note from the first bar of her LP to the last. Erato's balance engineer had done his work very well: all in all, the disc was one that von Stade's fans would be guaranteed to enjoy.Gramophone, September 1985, p. 406 Ivan March reviewed the first version of the album on cassette in Gramophone in February 1986. He was more comfortable with Leppard's realizations than Blyth had been, writing approvingly that the conductor had not sought \\"to produce an anaemic 'authentic' back-up from the orchestra, who support the voice with the most attractive string textures\\". He did agree with Blyth about von Stade's limitations as an interpreter, regretting that her singing did not offer \\"the kind of emotional depth we would expect from an artist like Dame Janet Baker\\". But von Stade had sung stylishly, he thought, and Leppard had seen to it that her ornamentation was historically correct. In sum, the tape was an attractively fresh one that he had very much enjoyed.Gramophone, February 1986, p. 1087 The interior of the Queen's Hall, Edinburgh, formerly the Hope Park Chapel The audio expert John Borwick reviewed the first version of the album on CD in Gramophone in June 1986. For him, Leppard's realizations were unequivocally beneficial. \\"The orchestral effects\\", he wrote, \\"are of such continuous appeal and inventiveness ... that I am inclined to give the Scottish Chamber Orchestra star billing alongside ... Frederica von Stade\\". He thought that most listeners would enjoy hearing the album's \\"mellifluous\\" anthology of songs and arias performed with textures so rich. The audio quality of the disc, moreover, was beautiful. All von Stade fans, he concluded, would \\"welcome this feast of her singing in the baroque style of which she is such a master\\".Gramophone, June 1986. p. 93 CD track listing =First version (Erato ECD 88100)= Claudio Monteverdi (1567-1643), in realizations by Raymond Leppard * 1 (5:34) \\"Ohimè ch'io cado\\" (1624) * 2 (6:13) Lamento di Ottavia: \\"Disprezzata Regina\\" from L'incoronazione di Poppea * 3 (8:05) \\"Et é pur dunque vero\\" from Scherzi Musicali (1632) * 4 (4:00) Aria di Ottavia: \\"A Dio Roma\\" from L'incoronazione di Poppea Francesco Cavalli (1602-1676), in realizations by Raymond Leppard * 5 (5:02) Lamento di Cassandra: \\"L'alma fiacca svani\\" from La Didone * 6 (2:30) \\"La bellezza è un don fugace\\" from Il Xerse * 7 (6:10) Lamento di Clori: \\"Amor, che ti diè l'ali\\" from L'Egisto * 8 (3:10) \\"Numi ciechi più di me\\" from L'Orimonte * 9 (3:29) \\"Non è, non è crudel\\" from Scipione affricano *10 (3:33) \\"Ardo, sospiro e piango\\" from La Calisto =Second version (Erato 4509-98504-2): bonus tracks= Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791), with a libretto by Lorenzo da Ponte *11 (2:03) Aria di Dorabella: \\"Smanie implacabili\\" from Così fan tutte *12 (3:41) Aria di Dorabella: \\"È amore un ladroncello\\" from Così fan tutte Personnel =Musical= * Frederica von Stade, mezzo-soprano * Scottish Chamber Orchestra * Raymond Leppard (1927-2019), conductor and realizations * Orchestre Philharmonique de Strasbourg (tracks 11-12, second version) * Alain Lombard, conductor (tracks 11-12, second version) =Other= * Michel Garcin, producer * Yolanta Skura, engineer (first version) * Pierre Lavoix, engineer (tracks 11-12, second version) * Françoise Garcin, production assistant * Ysabelle Van Wersch-Cot, digital mastering engineer Release history In 1985, Erato released the first version of the album on LP (catalogue number NUM 75183),Frederica von Stade chante Monteverdi & Cavalli, cond.

It is located on heights south of the Levubu River offering a panoramic view. Sidney Miller led excavations from December 1993 to July 1995, and the site has also been partially reconstructed. The opening of the rebuilt Thulamela was attended by a hundred guests, including then Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism Pallo Jordan and then SANParks chairman, the late Dr. Enos John Mabuza. The name Thulamela comes from a portmanteau of thulwi (\\"mound\\") and mela (\\"growing\\") in references to the tall anthills in the area. The Makahane, a subtribe of the Vhalembeth branch of the Venda people, inhabited the Thulamela stone fortress from 1250 to 1700 C.E. Glass beads, Chinese porcelain, imported textiles, ivory bracelets, gold, bronze, and other jewelry testify to extensive trade links. Skilled goldsmiths, the inhabitants traded the metal as currency, and they also mined iron ore that they forged into iron for export. Both metals were traded for ivory, glass beads, and grain from merchants closer to the east coast. There were likely also trade links with West Africa. The graves of a 16th-century king and queen were unearthed in the 1990s excavations. Archaeologists named them King Losha and Queen Ingwe, and their castle was estimated to house 1,000 people. Dwellings along the ruined walls on the hillsides beyond could regularly have housed 2,000. Similar village ruins can be found in the Mateke Hills on the other side of the Limpopo River in Zimbabwe. The Makahane Cliffs can be found in the same area of Kruger National Park, northeast of the Punda Maria Gate near the Levubu, and was also a Vhalembethu settlement. Visitors to the park can book tours from Punda Maria Camp up to Thulamela.  Sources  * Miller, Sidney Mears (2018). Thulamela: The Lost Gold of the Vha Venda.

Her research focused on gastrointestinal diseases and rheumatology. Biography =Childhood= Nanna Svartz was one of five children of Johan Anshelm Svartz, a Latin teacher with a Ph.D. in philosophy, and his wife Anna Charlotta (born Moxén). Her siblings were born between 1880 and 1885, but died all from 1887 to 1904. She went to the local girls' school, but girls were not allowed to take the studentexamen there. Hence, the whole family moved to Stockholm in 1908, where she was able to finish her exam at Åhlinska skolan in 1910. The school's director (and her history teacher) was Lydia Wahlström, an important figure in the Swedish suffrage movement. =Early life= As Nanna Svartz wanted to become a physician, she enrolled at the Karolinska Institute in 1911. Apart from a semester at Uppsala University, she was always studying at Karolinska in Stockholm. She obtained her undergraduate degree (Medicine kandidat) in 1914 and a licentiate in medicine in 1918. She stayed at Karolinska Institute afterwards to follow her postgraduate studies and got her Ph.D. in 1927. =Career and research= Right after her undergraduate degree, she started working occasionally as an assistant at both Karolinska Institute's pathological-anatomical institute and at Serafimerlasarettet's eye clinic. She worked in a number of Stockholm's medical institutions, progressing from the position of an assistant to an överläkare, the assistant medical director, in 1936. On 17 December 1937, she was appointed professor for internal medicine at the Karolinska Institute by government decision and was the first female professor for medicine and at a public university. Before her, only Sofia Kovalevskaya had become a professor in Sweden in 1889, which was only possible because of the university being a private institution. Nanna Svartz competed with eight men for the position. Famous physicians such as Hans Christian Jacobaeus, Gustaf Bergmark, Sven Ingvar and Olav Hanssen backed her application. She was finally chosen by vote of the Karolinska lecturers. Although she had allies, among others Israel Holmgren, who supported her throughout her career, there were many critics who doubted a woman could be able to be a professor. As she was always one of few women in the positions she worked in, she followed a strict separation of work and private life and adopted certain signs of male professionalism to obtain authority among colleagues and students. She always wore a suit and tie and even hid her pregnancy, only notifying her colleagues after the child was born. In 1948, she was appointed the first head of the new King Gustaf V research institute (Konung Gustaf V:s forskningsinstitut) at Karolinska hospital, which the King inaugurated himself in the same year. Throughout her career, Nanna Svartz had a strong national and international network and traveled Europe and the world for congresses and studies. Together with the Swiss professor Alfred Gigon, she founded the International Society of Internal Medicine in 1949. She also hosted the organisation's third congress in Stockholm in 1954. In many cases, she became also the physician of influential people, for example Aleksandra Kollontaj and Karolina Widerström, who was a mentor to her. She went on working as an active physician until 1957 and only stepped down as the head of the institute in 1960. Nevertheless, she went on pursuing research in her laboratory at Karolinska Hospital until she was 93. During her scientific career, she published over 400 articles. The medicine Salazopyrine was invented by her to treat rheumatism and gastrontestinal diseases in the 1930s. It was Pharmacia's first medical product and sold since the 1940s. It is still in use. She died in 1986 at the age of 96 in Stockholm. Nanna Svartz väg on the Solna Campus of Karolinska Institute. =Family= She was married to pediatrician Nils Malmberg after her licentiate on 12 October 1918. They got to know each other in school in Västerås and studied together at Karolinska Institute. In 1929, they had a daughter, Gunvor Svartz-Malmberg, who was named after both her parents. She also became a physician. =Activism= From the difficulties in obtaining the student exam during her studies before she qualified, Nanna Svartz was confronted with discrimination throughout her life. She was interested in feminist issues from an early age on, for example when listening to a talk about women's suffrage in Västerås. Right after she obtained her undergraduate degree, she joined the Women Physicians Permanent Committee (Kvinnliga läkares permanenta kommitté, KLPK). This group fought against the discrimination of female physicians in times when competence was usually attributed to men. Professionalism was the group's main strategy and influenced Nanna Svatz's professional behaviour decisively.

In August 2019, Congolese health officials announced that REGN-EB3 and a similar monoclonal antibody treatment, mAb114, were more effective than two other treatments being used at the time.  Chemistry  Colorized scanning electron micrograph of Ebola virus particles (green) REGN- EB3 is a cocktail of three monoclonal antibodies, REGN3470, 3471, and 3479. It was invented by Regeneron using its VelociSuite technologies. Using three antibodies targets the Ebola virus at multiple points since the virus is known to mutate in different outbreaks.  Mechanism of action  Monoclonal antibodies are antibodies that are made by identical immune cells that are all clones of a unique parent cell. Monoclonal antibodies can have monovalent affinity, in that they bind to the same epitope (the part of an antigen that is recognized by the antibody).  Development  The 2014 Ebola outbreak killed more than 11,300 people. Regeneron used its VelociGene, VelocImmune and VelociMab antibody discovery and production technologies and coordinated with the U.S. government’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). The therapy was developed in six months and a Phase 1 trial in healthy humans was completed in 2015. REGN-EB3 has received orphan drug designation from both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. REGN-EB3 is being developed, tested, and manufactured as part of an agreement established in 2015 with BARDA, part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).REGN-EB3 is currently under clinical development and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.It was developed against the Zaire species of Ebola virus, but the Sudan and Bundibugyo strains have also caused outbreaks and it is unlikely that EB3 would be effective against these strains. In October 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved atoltivimab/maftivimab/odesivimab (Inmazeb, formerly REGN-EB3) with an indication for the treatment of infection caused by Zaire ebolavirus. Dosage EB3 is administered in a single dose and is stable enough to not need to be stored in a deep freezer.  Clinical trial in the Democratic Republic of Congo  During the 2018 Équateur province Ebola outbreak, a similar monoclonal antibody treatment, mAb114, was requested by the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) Ministry of Public Health. mAb114 was approved for compassionate use by the World Health Organization MEURI ethical protocol and at DRC ethics board. mAb114 was sent along with other therapeutic agents to the outbreak sites.WHO: Consultation on Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered and Investigational Interventions for Ebola virus Disease. https://www.who.int/emergencies/ebola/MEURI-Ebola.pdf However, the outbreak came to a conclusion before any therapeutic agents were given to patients. Approximately one month following the conclusion of the Équateur province outbreak, a distinct outbreak was noted in Kivu in the DRC (2018–20 Kivu Ebola outbreak). Once again, mAb114 received approval for compassionate use by WHO MEURI and DRC ethic boards and has been given to many patients under these protocols. In November 2018, the Pamoja Tulinde Maisha (PALM [together save lives]) open-label randomized clinical control trial was begun at multiple treatment units testing mAb114, REGN-EB3 and remdesivir to ZMapp. Despite the difficulty of running a clinical trial in a conflict zone, investigators have enrolled 681 patients towards their goal of 725. This is the second largest outbreak with (as of January 2020) over 3,400 confirmed or probable cases, including more than 2,200 who have died. An interim analysis by the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) of the first 499 patient found that mAb114 and REGN-EB3 were superior to the comparator ZMapp. Overall mortality of patients in the ZMapp and Remdesivir groups were 49% and 53% compared to 34% and 29% for mAb114 and REGN-EB3. When looking at patients who arrived early after disease symptoms appeared, survival was 89% for mAB114 and 94% for REGN- EB3. While the study was not powered to determine whether there is any difference between REGN-EB3 and mAb114, the survival difference between those two therapies and ZMapp was significant. This led to the DSMB halting the study and PALM investigators dropping the remdesivir and ZMapp arms from the clinical trial. All patients in the outbreak who elect to participate in the trial will now be given either mAb114 or REGN-EB3. In August 2019, Congolese health officials announced it was more effective compared to two other treatments being used at the time. Among patients treated with it, 34% died; the mortality rate improved if the drug was administered soon after infection, in a timely diagnosis – critical for those infected with diseases like Ebola that can cause sepsis and, eventually, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, more quickly than other diseases. The survival rate if the drug was administered shortly after the infection was 89%.

Born into the landed gentry of Poland, her family were members of the intelligentsia and encouraged Iwańska to pursue her literary dreams. She began publishing poetry in 1935 in various literary journals. After her high school studies, she enrolled in philosophy courses at the University of Warsaw and went on to study for a master's degree. When World War II broke out, she joined the resistance movement and served as a courier. Involved in the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, at the end of the war she became part of the secret anti-communist opposition. When arrests began involving the underground movement, Iwańska was forced to flee to the United States in 1948, where she reluctantly applied for asylum. With little proficiency in English, Iwańska initially had difficulty in adjusting. She enrolled at Columbia University to complete her PhD studies, but would not finish her degree until 1957. Unable to secure a professorship, she took several short contracts, working at traditionally black colleges in the segregated South such as Atlanta University and Talladega College. There she lectured on the similarities between political, religious, and racial persecution in Europe and segregation restrictions in the United States. In 1954, she moved to the University of Chicago and began studying with the American anthropologist Sol Tax. Eager to travel to Mexico to conduct research, in 1957 she married and became a naturalized citizen of the United States. Her work with the Mazahua people earned her recognition as a sociologist by UNESCO and eventually led to a professorship at the State University of New York at Albany in 1965, where she worked until her retirement in 1985. Having never felt at ease in the United States, that year Iwańska moved to London, where she began a period of intense literary creation. In 1989, she was honored with the knight's cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta. Diagnosed with lung cancer in 1996, she wrote her final memoir about the British health care system. Because her scientific work was written in English and her literary output was written in Polish, her legacy suffered from compartmentalization. Recent scholarship has sought to examine both aspects of her career and recover her contributions to anthropology as well as her literature. Early life Manor house on the Gardzienice estate Alicja Iwańska was born on 13 May 1918 into the landed gentry on the , near Lublin, to Stanisława Stachna (née Miłkowska) and Jan Iwański. The origin of her ancestry is unknown, with family stories indicating that the first ancestor, Jan Kante Iwański, came to Tarnów as either a worker in the forest estate of the Sanguszko family, a prisoner of war, or a Russian political refugee. Burial records indicate that the family were petty nobility and bore the Jastrzębiec coat of arms. Her grandfather August Iwański had significant property holdings in Ukraine, but purchased the estate in the Lublin Voivodeship and relocated his family to evade border unrest during World War I and the Greater Poland Uprising. Iwańska was born on the estate, but when the turmoil reached them at Gardzienice, they sold the property and moved west to the village of Mikorzyna, near Poznań. Iwańska's father had previously been widowed and then divorced his second wife. His third marriage to Iwańska's mother created controversy, partly because of his reputation as a bohemian and womanizer but also because of the 19-year difference in their ages. His lavish life, which often exceeded his means, and his disputes with the local clergy forced the family to relocate to Rzetnia. That move was traumatic for Iwańska and for the remainder of her life she believed she was destined to be a wanderer. Her parents' home was a haven for intellectuals and often the meeting place for the Skamandrites, particularly as her father's cousin Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz was part of the experimental poets' group and her mother was a poet. When Iwańska began to show an interest in writing, her father consulted with poet Julian Tuwim to improve her skill. After beginning her high school education at the Gimnazjum Generałowej Zamoyskiej (General Zamoyski Gymnasium) in Poznań, Iwańska soon transferred to the Gimnazjum Posselt-Szachtmajerowej (Posselt-Szachtmajerowa Gymnasium) in Warsaw. The more liberal Warsaw school was better suited to her temperament, leading to her matriculation in the mid-1930s. Following her poetic debut of 1935, published in the ' (Poets' Area) literary magazine, she quickly began publishing in other literary journals, including Akcja Literacka (Literary Action) and Kamenie (Stones). In 1936, she enrolled at the University of Warsaw to study philosophy under Tadeusz Kotarbiński, a Polish ethicist and philosopher. In the midst of her studies, while traveling on a train to Brussels for research on a master's degree, Iwańska met Jan Gralewski, who was also a student at the University of Warsaw on his way to study in Paris. Her trip abroad made her aware of the rising nationalism spreading across Europe, as well as the anti- Semitic and anti-Catholic sentiment of the times, though she was in fact an atheist. She returned to Poland just before the beginning of the war and in 1938, published a volume of poems Wielokąty (Polygons). Career =Polish resistance= Jan Gralewski, circa 1943 Aware that war was coming, Iwańska went to visit her family and construct a cache for necessities that might be needed during the conflict. She then returned to Warsaw, where she joined the resistance organization Związek Walki Zbrojnej (Union of Armed Struggle). Working with Wanda Piłsudska, a friend from her gymnasium days, Iwańska, code named \\"Squirrel\\", worked as a courier. She also delivered messages from prisoners held at Pawiak prison to their families. In the spring of 1940, she again met Gralewski, who was also a resistance fighter, code named \\"Pankrac\\", and the two began a romance. She worked the Warsaw-Kraków route with Wanda Namysłowska, while he worked as a courier on foreign routes, creating dispatches in Western Europe for the Polish government in exile. On 18 January 1942 the two married, though she did not take his name. In 1943, Gralewski died, along with Władysław Sikorski, in a controversial airplane crash, though the information was kept from Iwańska. She participated in the Warsaw Uprising in 1944 and at the end of the war became part of the secret anti-communist opposition. She moved to Poznan in 1945 and began working as the literary director of ' (The Voice of Greater Poland). When arrests began to reach the underground movement, Iwańska was ordered to leave by her superiors. Thanks to the influence of an uncle, she earned a scholarship to study in the United States and left Poland in 1948. =Academics= Arriving in the United States with very poor English and uncertain whether she wanted to stay, Iwańska hesitated to apply for asylum but eventually did so when friends warned her she had been named in investigations. Her hearings, during the era of McCarthyism, dragged on for years before asylum was finally granted. She enrolled in a PhD program at Columbia University and while still working on her thesis was hired to teach in the sociology department at Atlanta University in 1952. The school was a traditionally black college in the segregated South. Iwańska felt at home there, lecturing on similarities between political, religious, and racial persecution in Europe and the situation in the United States. When her contract expired, she was offered a post at Talladega College in Alabama. The Ku Klux Klan were active and all faculty and students at the university were barred from interacting with the community. Her atheism clashed with the religious university staff and her contract was terminated in 1954. Iwańska moved to Chicago, Illinois, that summer and began working for the Slavic Peoples' Project, a Yale University- Pentagon initiative that focused on preserving Czechoslovak and Polish culture. While working on the project, she met the geographer Philip Wagner, who often traveled to Mexico for his work. While working at the University of Chicago, she went to Washington state to analyze rural conditions. Presented to the American Anthropological Association in 1957, her report contrasted the differences between the treatment of Mexican seasonal workers and European peasant farmers. She concluded that Americans did not have the same historic ties to their land, viewing it as a mechanism for profit. Finally completing her PhD that year, she married Wagner. Eager to travel with him and forbidden to do so because of her status as an asylee, Iwańska became a naturalized citizen. The pair went to Mexico and there Iwańska, whose creative voice had suffered in the United States, began writing literature again. She was charmed by the culture, finding it more compatible with her European upbringing. She began collaborating with the American anthropologist Sol Tax, studied the Mazahua people, and was one of the first to publish details of the civic- religious system of duties employed to maintain order in their society. Some of her most important work was written during this period. Works like The Mexican Indian: Image and Identity and The Truths of Others: An Essay on Nativistic Intellectuals in Mexico questioned the duality of indigenous people's treatment in the larger society, noting that while the government ideology officially celebrated their culture and artworks as part of the unique Mexican identity, they experienced racism from the public. Gaining recognition from UNESCO as a sociological expert, she was sent to train in Chile and Paris, France, but became frustrated with the international bureaucracy. Her reputation earned her an assistant professorship at the State University of New York at Albany in 1965, where her work, over the next two decades, focused mostly on immigrants and emigrants in American history. In 1968, Iwańska published Świat przetłumaczony (The Translated World), a fictitious account which was based on her work in Mexico. In the book, she compared the Spanish conquest of Mexico to the Nazi occupation and Soviet- backed Communist government in Poland. Her scientific treatment of the subject Purgatory and Utopia: A Mazahua Indian Village of Mexico was published in 1971. The book consolidated much of her previous work, examining the Mazahua's view of themselves, the organization of their society, their value systems, and their view of the wider world. It also included a statement presenting the Mazahua's outlook in their own words. Iwańska interviewed the villagers, wrote down their accounts, then read them back to the community for verification and modification. In 1973, Iwańska was one of those interviewed for the British Thames Television series The World at War which described events during the Warsaw Uprising. She was awarded the Kościelski Prize in 1974. In the 1980s, Iwańska was called upon to speak on the Solidarity Movement of Poland. She examined governments in exile in her 1981 publication, Exiled Governments. In the study, she looked at Polish and Spanish diaspora communities and how the various layers — core members, proven loyalists, and people with national ties — unite to sway international policy, also covering the perception of exiles living abroad. In 1985, she took early retirement and moved to London. =Literary return= In London, Iwańska focused on writing fictional works and her memoirs. She also worked at the Polish University Abroad, where she enjoyed teaching Polish students. Having never been able to find her creative voice in English, her literary output during this period was prolific, as she wrote in Polish. In 1987, she published Niezdemobilizowani (Non-demobilized), a fictionalized account of the post-war anti-communist underground. In the book she postulated that Gralewski's death was part of an assassination plot and that he was shot, rather than killed in a plane crash. The following year she published Baśń amerykańska (American Fairy Tale), a polemic commentary on the U.S. academic community. She returned to Poland for the first time in 1989 and was honored with the knight's cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta. Returning to London, she worked on Wojenne odcinki (War Episodes, 1990), presenting the letters she exchanged with Jan Gralewski from 1940 to 1943; a volume of poetry, Niektóre (Some, 1991); Właśnie tu! (Right Here, 1992), a biography of Jean-Marie Guyau and an autobiographical comparison to herself; and Potyczki i przymierza (Skirmishes and Covenants), a diary covering the period from 1918 to 1985. In 1995, she published Kobiety z firmy (Women from the Company), which followed the stories of five women who worked with her in the intelligence service during the Warsaw Uprising. The following year, she published Tylko trzynaście (Only Thirteen), a volume of short stories, and received confirmation that her book Powroty (Returns) about her return to Poland in 1989 was accepted for publication by . Experiencing health problems, Iwańska was diagnosed with lung cancer, the same genetic disease which had afflicted her mother. While she was in hospice care, she wrote her final memoir Szpitale (Hospital), a commentary on the British health care system. Death and legacy Iwańska died on 26 September 1996 in London, and her friend Danuta Hiż published Szpitale as a tribute to her memory in the journal Kultura, published by the Kultura Literary Institute Association of Paris. Posthumously, her doctoral thesis, which included interviews conducted between 1951 and 1952 with members of the Polish intelligentsia was published as Polish Intelligentsia in Nazi Concentration Camps and American Exile: A Study of Values in Crisis Situations in 1998. There is a street named in Iwańska's honor in the \\"Literary Estate\\" section of the suburb of Strzeszyn, Poznań. Her correspondence with Sol Tax, which provides \\"rich documentation\\" on her career is housed at the University of Chicago Library in the Sol Tax Papers collection, and her correspondence with Margaret Mead is held in the Library of Congress. In 2009, Iwańska was portrayed by in the film, Generał. Zamach na Gibraltarze. In 2015, Columbia University and the New School for Social Research hosted a seminar focused on the work of Iwańska, examining not only her career trajectory as an academic, but also her work as an author. In 2019, Grażyna Kubica-Heller of Jagiellonian University presented a paper Strong authorial 'I' and feminist sensitivity – two Polish women-anthropologists in British and American academia at the International Union of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences Congress. The paper evaluated why Iwańska and Maria Czaplicka's contributions to anthropology were forgotten for decades and how re-imaging history in a feminist perspective has recovered their works.

It is a hall church with a projecting apse, adorned with stone carvings, frescoes, and medieval Georgian inscriptions. The church was almost completely destroyed in the Racha earthquake of 1991 and rebuilt in 2009. It is inscribed on the list of the Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance.  History  The Zemo Krikhi church of Archangel Michael stands at the western outskirts of the village of Zemo Krikhi, Ambrolauri Municipality, in Georgia's northwestern Racha-Lechkhumi and Kvemo Svaneti. The building tops a hill on the left bank of the Krikhula, a tributary of the Rioni River. The area is part of the historical and cultural region of Racha. Based on architectural features, the Zemo Krikhi church is dated to the late 10th or early 11th century. Its first recorded mention occurs in the travel notes of the Russian envoys Tolochanov and Yevlyev, touring western Georgia in the 1650s, and Georgian donation charters of the 17th–18th century. The church collapsed in a major earthquake which hit Racha on 29 April 1991. It was rebuilt in 2009.  Layout  The Zemo Krikhi church, measuring 13.4 × 5.7 m, is built of dressed stone blocks and lime. It is a hall church, with a projecting apse on the east. The apse has a pentagonal exterior and semicircular interior. On the south and west, the church has annexes, apparently special areas for women (sakalebo), built later in the 11th century. The western wall and the corresponding annex were remodeled in 1884. Unlike the standard tripartite sanctuary found in the contemporaneous hall churches in Georgia, the church has a bema divided into three parts: two deep and high conch-headed niches flank the altar on each side, making the interior appear monumental relative to its size. The bema is lit by two windows. The outer and inner walls of the church are richly decorated with ornamental stone carvings. The façades bear a dozen of inscriptions in the medieval Georgian asomtavruli and nuskhuri scripts, paleographically dated to the 11th century. The interior is adorned with the mid-11th-century frescoes. The paintings depict biblical scenes, portraits of various saints, including a group of female saints, clergymen, and secular donors.

Charts *List of number-one Billboard Top Latin Songs from the 1980s *List of number-one Billboard Latin Pop Albums from the 1980s *List of number-one Billboard Regional Mexican Albums from the 1980s *List of number-one Billboard Tropical Albums from the 1980s Overview The 1980s saw the major record labels such as RCA/Ariola, CBS, and EMI form their own Latin music divisions. By 1985, Billboard noted that the Latin music industry saw increase in awareness from major corporations such as Coca-Cola promoting Julio Iglesias and Pepsi advertising Menudo. =Latin pop= The romantic balada, which gained popularity in the 1970s, continued to dominate the Latin music charts in the 1980s. Veteran balladeers who continued to be popular in this decade include Julio Iglesias, José José, Roberto Carlos, and Juan Gabriel. The Latin balada is characterized by its bolero origin by fusing music from the United States with pop, R&B;, and rock. The 1980s was a golden era for the Venezuelan entertainment industry as popular telenovelas from the country also led to several actors to become successful singers such as Carlos Mata and Guillermo Dávila. Theme songs from telenovelas also became popular on radio airwaves in Venezuela. Female balada singers that became topped the Latin music charts includes Ana Gabriel, Daniela Romo, Rocío Dúrcal, Gloria Estefan, and Marisela. Notably, several baladas were Spanish-language covers of songs originally performed in Italian. Notable Spanish-language covers of Italian songs include \\"Maldita Primavera\\" by Yuri, \\"Toda la Vida\\" by Emmanuel and Franco, \\"Yo No Te Pido la Luna\\" by Daniela Romo, and \\"Tan Enamorados\\" by Ricardo Montaner. Aside from the baladas, several Latin pop artists and bands performed variety of Spanish- language pop and dance music targeted to the younger audience. These include Yuri, Marisela, Mecano, Miguel Bosé, Timbiriche, Menudo, and Flans. \\"Que Te Pasa\\" became the longest-running chart of the 1980s, spending 16 weeks on top of the Billboard Hot Latin Tracks chart. Juan Gabriel and Rocío Dúrcal collaborated with Chuck Anderson to incorporate mariachi arrangements on their ballads. Child pop singers such as Pablito Ruiz, Luis Miguel, Pedrito Fernández, and Lucerito had a prepubescent following. The Miami Sound Machine, whose vocals were led by Gloria Estefan, gained international fame in 1985 with their crossover hit song \\"Conga\\". The song blends both pop music and Latin music from the Caribbean. =Regional Mexican= In the 1980s, the regional music scene in both Mexico and the Mexican American community in the United States was dominated by grupera. This style of Mexican music combines cumbia, norteño, and rock music. The lyrics are rooted with romantic themes including heartbroken songs. Several notable grupera ensembles include Los Caminantes, Los Yonic's, Los Bukis, and Los Temerarios. Norteño band Los Tigres del Norte continued their success from the 1970s with their corridos involving social commentary such as \\"Jaula de oro\\" (\\"The Golden Cage\\") which tells of a Mexican man who crosses the Mexico-United States border illegally and raises a family in the United States who denies their Mexican heritage while the man longs to return to his country. Its parent album reached number one on the Regional Mexican charts in the United States. Similarly, Mexican singer-songwriter Joan Sebastian incorporated sounds of rancheras and ballads on his songs and was dubbed \\"El Rey del Jaripeo\\" (\\"The King of Mexican Rodeo\\"). Tejano music was also popular to the Mexican Americans living in the United States mainly in Texas. Its style is characterized by its influences from polka, cumbia, bolero, and ranchera as well as pop, rap, country music and reggae. Tejano bands such as Mazz, La Mafia, and Little Joe and La Familia pushed Tejano's popularity beyond the United States. Ranchera Vicente Fernández still remain relevant in the 1980s. His album, Por Tu Maldito Amor (1989), became the longest running number one Regional Mexican album of the decade in the United States with 21 weeks consecutive weeks at this position. American singer Linda Ronstadt, who is of Mexican descent, released Canciones de Mi Padre, a collection of songs that her father would sing. The album was certified double platinum by the RIAA for shipping over two million copies in the United States. =Tropical/salsa= The New York salsa, which was popularized Fania Records in the 1970s, saw a major decline in the scene. Merengue music from the Dominican Republic became favored by Latinos living in New York City. Wilfrido Vargas was credited for bringing merengue attention to the younger audience. Merengue music also became popular even in Puerto Rico. Another factor to merengue's popularity in the dance clubs was that it was easier to dance to compared to salsa. Milly Quezada, lead vocals of the group Milly y los Vecinos, became the first notable female merengue singer. The group was formed by her husband Rafael Vasquez, who was also her manager. Other notable merengue acts in the 1980s include Bonny Cepeda, Fernando Villalona, Juan Luis Guerra & 4.40 and Los Hijos del Rey. Vargas also formed the first all-female band Las Chicas del Can. Juan Luis Guerra performed not only love songs, but also social commentary about the poverty in the Dominican Republic and those living abroad such as \\"Visa Para un Sueño\\" (\\"Visa For a Dream\\") and \\"Ojala Que Llueva Café\\" (\\"I Hope It Rains Coffee\\"). Although New York salsa faded in popularity, another form of salsa music gained attention in its place. This form of salsa, which was slower-placed and more focused on its romantic lyrics, was known as salsa romántica. The salsa romántica movement helped salsa continued to be relevant in spite of the rise of merengue music as well as moving away from lyrics dealing with social class. Salsa romántica was characterized by its influence by the aforementioned romantic ballads and more pop-leaning sounds. In fact, several famous songs done by salsa romántica singers were covers of songs originally sung by balada musicians. \\"Lluvia\\", a song first composed by Luis Ángel, was covered by Eddie Santiago and became on the highest-peaking salsa romántica on the Hot Latin Tracks at number four. A sub-style of salsa romántica also included erotic lyrics and became known as salsa erotica. \\"Ven Devórame Otra Vez\\" by Lalo Rodríguez, a notable salsa erotica song, became a top ten hit on the Hot Latin Tracks chart. Other famous salsa romantica singers include Frankie Ruiz, Luis Enrique, Willie Gonzalez, David Pabón, and José Alberto \\"El Canario\\".

He was a son of Caliph Uthman () and a one-time seeker of the caliphate in 675/76. During his short term in Khurasan, he launched a campaign deep into Transoxiana and defeated one or two Soghdian armies. He reportedly captured Bukhara and besieged Samarkand, gaining tributary status from the latter, before proceeding to capture Tirmidh. He was dismissed by Mu'awiya, possibly due to concerns that his popularity and battlefield successes had strengthened Sa'id's previous bid to seek the caliphate instead of Mu'awiya's designated successor, Yazid I. He was killed in Medina by his noble Soghdian slaves. Life Sa'id was a son of Caliph Uthman () and the latter's wife Fatima bint al-Walid, a scion of the prominent Banu Makhzum clan of the Quraysh. Caliph Mu'awiya I () had partly based his claim to the caliphate on his pursuit of justice for the assassination in 656 of Uthman, his Umayyad kinsman. Upon hearing news that he had nominated his son Yazid I as his successor, Sa'id left Medina for Mu'awiya's court in Damascus to petition against the decision. According to the accounts of the medieval Muslim historians al-Mada'ini (d. 843) and al-Baladhuri (d. 892), Sa'id visited Damascus to demand a high- ranking office from Mu'awiya and that the latter questioned Sa'id about rumors that he was seeking the caliphate. Sa'id, in turn, argued that because he was a son of Uthman and that his mother was a noble Qurayshite (as opposed to Yazid whose mother Maysun bint Bahdal was a Kalbite tribeswoman), he was indeed a more legitimate candidate for the caliphate than Yazid. Sa'id had been supported or encouraged to claim the office by people in Medina, including a segment of the elite Ansar faction. He may have also been quietly encouraged by Marwan ibn al-Hakam, a senior Umayyad in Medina who resented Mu'awiya's rule and sought to restore the office to the Abu al-As branch of the Umayyad clan, to which Marwan and Sa'id belonged (Mu'awiya belonged to the Sufyanid branch). Mu'awiya accepted the merit of Sa'id's arguments, though Ibn Kathir (d. 1373) holds that the caliph rejected Sa'id's assertion that he was more worthy than Yazid. =Governorship of Khurasan= Depending on the source, during his meeting with Sa'id, Mu'awiya recommended that he should take up office in Khurasan, the easternmost province of the Caliphate, or granted this to Sa'id per the latter's own request. In any event, the caliph sent Sa'id to Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad, the governor of Basra and the eastern Caliphate, with directions to assign Sa'id commander of the conquests in Khurasan in 675/76. Per the caliph's instructions, Ibn Ziyad allotted Sa'id four million dirhams to distribute among the 4,000 soldiers under his command. Though there were capable commanders among the men assigned to Sa'id, including al-Muhallab ibn Abi Sufra, many of the troops collected were Basran prisoners and otherwise disruptive tribal elements from the population. On the way to Khurasan, Sa'id further recruited highwaymen from the Banu Tamim to join his ranks. Mu'awiya restricted Sa'id's jurisdiction to military affairs, assigning fiscal responsibilities to Ishaq ibn Talha, who died en route to Khurasan and was replaced in the role by Aslam ibn Zur'a al-Kilabi, a Qaysite tribal leader in the Khurasan garrison and the province's former lieutenant governor. According to the historian Muhammad Shaban, Mu'awiya's deployment of Sa'id and Ishaq represented efforts to ensure that the surplus tax revenue of Khurasan, in addition to the traditional fifth of the war booty from the conquests there, was forwarded to the caliphal treasury in Damascus. This was generally opposed by the Arab tribesmen who made up the ranks of Khurasan's garrisons, who sought to keep the bulk of the provincial revenue under their control. With Ishaq's death and Aslam's virtual usurpation of the former's role, as well as Mu'awiya's efforts to keep good relations with the Qaysites so that their Syrian counterparts would accept Yazid's nomination, Sa'id was forced to work with Aslam as his partner-in-government. After preparing his army, Sa'id launched a campaign east of the Oxus river, deeper than the previous campaign of 674 by Ibn Ziyad, and defeated a Soghdian army on the open field before capturing one of their cities and then occupying the Tirmidh fortress. The traditional Muslim histories of Abu Ubayda (d. 825), al- Baladhuri, al-Tabari (d. 923), Narshakhi (d. 959) offer varying accounts of the campaign. Al-Baladhuri and Narshakhi hold that Sa'id's crossing of the Oxus prompted Khatun, the queen of Bukhara to give allegiance to the Caliphate, but she then reneged upon the arrival of a supportive 120,000-strong army of Turks, Soghdians and soldiers from Kish and Nasaf. Sa'id's forces decisively defeated this army, entered Bukhara in triumph and, boosted by numerous defectors among the Soghdian army, besieged Samarkand for three days, after which it became a tributary of the Caliphate. Abu Ubayda also records that Sa'id besieged Samarkand. He then proceeded to capture Tirmidh and it was there that he received the tribute owed by Khatun and the allegiance of Principality of Khuttal. =Dismissal, death and legacy= Mu'awiya relieved Sa'id of his post in 677. This may have stemmed from Sa'id's growing popularity and battlefield successes, which could potentially reinforce his claims as a legitimate rival to Yazid. Ibn Asakir (d. 1176) relates that Sa'id had returned to Medina after Mu'awiya's death in 680. On his return, he took with him fifty Soghdian nobles as slaves whom he employed to work his land. He abused them by confiscating their valuables and having them dressed in wool. A number of the Soghdians then killed Sa'id, possibly with their shovels, in his walled garden before killing themselves. Marwan had attempted to rescue Sa'id, but was unable as the Soghdians had locked the garden's gate. Sa'id had at least two wives, one of whom was Ramla, the daughter of Mu'awiya's father and a leading figure among the Quraysh, Abu Sufyan ibn Harb; the other wife is not named in the sources. From Ramla, Sa'id had his son Muhammad, about whom nothing is known in the sources, and A'isha, who married Abd Allah, the son of Mu'awiya I. From his second wife, Sa'id had a daughter called Umm Sa'id who successively married Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al- Malik (), al-Abbas ibn al-Walid (son of Caliph al-Walid I, ) and Abd al-Aziz ibn Umar (son of Caliph Umar II, ). Another son of Sa'id recorded in the sources was Aban, whose mawla (non-Arab, Muslim freedman) was a high-ranking supporter of the Umayyad rebel Abu al-Umaytir in his early 9th-century revolt against the Abbasids, who had overthrown the Umayyads in 750.

He joined the Soviet Armed Forces in 1928 and within a few years became a Soviet Navy pilot and flight instructor. During World War II he received promotion to squadron and then regimental commander. After the war he became a major general before retiring from the military in 1954.  Early life  Chelnokov was born on in Irkutsk to a working-class Russian family. Two years later his family moved to the village of Glebovo just outside Saint Petersburg, which they had left in 1905 before he was born, residing there until 1926. That year Chelnokov graduated from his ninth grade of school in Kashin before starting to work as a manual laborer in Leningrad. In 1928 he began studying at the Leningrad Electrotechnical Institute, but left it shortly thereafter upon volunteering to join the military in December.  Military career  Less than a year after entering the military he graduated from the Leningrad Military Theoretical Air Force School in November 1929. He then went on to graduate from the Borisoglebsk Military Aviation School of Pilots a year later, and then the Sevastopol Military Aviation School of Naval Pilots in May 1931, after which he was sent to the Yeysk Military Aviation School as a flight instructor. There he became promoted to flight commander and piloted the Po-2, Sh-2, MBR-2, R-6, and S-68. In 1938 he was reassigned to the 1st Mine-Torpedo Aviation Regiment; there he flew the notorious Ilyushin DB-3. During the Winter War he flew with the unit as a junior pilot and later flight commander, making 40 sorties on the DB-3 and surviving several close calls with death after facing mechanical failure in the freezing weather. During a mission in January 1940 he was forced to make an emergency landing on ice in the Gulf of Finland. The aircraft was put back into service after undergoing maintenance, but on the first takeoff after the repairs he was again plagued by engine troubles. After the end of the war with Finland he continued to pilot the DB-3 as a flight commander in his unit, and before the German invasion of the Soviet Union he became a squadron commander. = World War II = During the first two months of Operation Barbarossa, Chelnokov flew in defensive missions in the Baltic, commanding his squadron of DB-3s; he made his first sortie on 24 June and flew his last mission of the DB-3 in late July. During that time the participated in the bombing of a German naval base and on multiple occasions flew without fighter escorts, resulting in intense clashes with enemy aircraft that resulted in heavy losses, which were worsened by fuel shortages. After the initial blow the regiment was withdrawn from the front to Voronezh to retrain on the Ilyushin Il-2. Being one of the first pilots to master the new plane, he was kept away from the front to train other naval pilots. In August was part of a flight to ferry ten of the new planes to the Black Sea Fleet, and later that month he returned to the Baltic fleet with a group of new Il-2s. From then until April 1942 he was a squadron commander in the 57th Assault Aviation Regiment, during which he flew in the Siege of Leningrad and was nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 28 December 1941 for accumulating 58 sorties on the Il-2; however, the title was not awarded until 14 June 1942. In April 1942 he was made deputy commander of the 1st Mine-torpedo Aviation Regiment, and in August he was promoted to regimental commander. On 2 May 1943, the master-of- armament was killed in an accidental explosion while trying to remove bombs from an old DB-3; the explosion also badly damaged several Yak fighters in addition to destroying two DB-3s. He was put under tribunal along with two other engineers from his regiment; he was given a demotion to major, removed from command of the regiment, and a suspended sentence of five years that he was supposed to serve upon the end of the war. However, in April 1944 a tribunal decided he would not have to serve the sentence. In June 1943 he took on the role of assistant commander for flight training in the 8th Guards Assault Aviation Regiment. Shortly thereafter in August he was made squadron commander in the 47th Assault Aviation Regiment. During a mission on 18 August 1943 he led his squadron in a sortie over Anapa that resulted in the destruction of 11 enemy aircraft. In October he became a flight inspector in the 11th Assault Aviation Division. In December he returned to the 8th Guards Regiment as commander, where he remained until August 1944. Despite his high position he continued to fly in combat; on 11 March 1944 he led a formation of 19 Il-2s in an attack on Axis naval vessels in Feodosia, resulting in the destruction of transport, patrol, and torpedo boats. From January to April 1944 the aviators under his command sank 15 ships and damaged 37 more. In August that year he was nominated to receive a second gold star for flying 277 sorties. That month, he was promoted to commander of the 9th Assault Aviation Division, but he left command of it in November, before he graduated from the Leningrad Naval Academy in 1945. = Postwar = After graduating from the Naval Academy in 1945 he commanded the 9th Assault Aviation Division, which he remained in command of until December 1947. From 1946 to 1950 he was a member of the Supreme Soviet. In May 1949 he was promoted to the rank of major- general, After graduating from the Military Academy of General Staff in December that year he was made assistant commander of the air force of the 4th Navy. In 1950 he became inspector-general of air defense; from 1951 to 1953 he was a senior aviation inspector for the navy, and in July 1953 he became the main navigator of the navy. From March 1954 until his retirement from the military a month later he headed the department of navigation services.  Later life  After retiring in 1954 lived in Moscow; from 1954 to 1955 he was the deputy head of the department of air and water transportation in the Ministry of Trade. He died on 16 July 1974 and was buried in the Golovinsky cemetery.

History  After the failure of the Dorchester Company in founding a settlement on Cape Ann the settlers and shareholders of the company wished to form another colonial settlement this time further south.moore 1851, p.23. The colony was to be settled between the Charles River and the Merrimack River in New England. The Massachusetts Bay Company, like other colonial joint-stock companies, was to be a corporate entity as well as a governmental one. The first settlers of the colony were Puritans who sought to create a society based on their religious beliefs unfettered from the Royal Anglican government of the Kingdom of England. The settlers were to be shareholders, with all those wishing to emigrate to new England required to buy shares. This agreement was formulated in Cambridge and came to be known as the Cambridge Agreement.Morison 1917, p.5.Morison 1917, p.6. Unlike other colonial companies whose presiding members resided and met in England, the Governors and other colonial officials moved to New England as well.

Voting rights in the colony were to be for only men of the Puritan church. Once settled in what is now Boston, the delegates formed a quasi-democratic and theocratic state based on the Laws of Moses.Morison 1917, p.8.

From 1930 to 1960 the towns of Hyne and Clearwater were known as the “Hay Capital” of the world. The area was also known as “The Milk Shed of Los Angeles” and “The World’s Largest Hay Market.” These titles were given for the vast hay fields and dairy farms in the area. There were over 25,000 milk cows in the towns of Hynes and Clearwater at this time. The price of the Hay on the commodity market was set each morning at the Hay Tree. In the 1960s and 1970s the region slowly became an urban area. House and stores replaced milk production. Many of the dairy farms moved to the city of Ontario, California and Chino, California.

In Genesis Rabbah, the same story appears but with R' Ada bar Ahava in place of Rav Hamnuna.Genesis Rabbah 58:2 Thus, it is difficult to know the actual name of his father.

Her work explores the primordial world of ancient rituals, mysterious fossilized remains, mystic forces, and African inspired architecture.Stella Jones Gallery, Windows of the Soul, Series VI, Eloise Johnson, PH. D, Curator, Southern University Museum of Art Baton Rouge, Louisiana Ramsaran's work was first inspired by a trip to Africa in 1981, and although her sculpture is inanimate, there is a lurking sense of humanity's presence.Eloise Johnson, PH.D., Curator, Southern University Museum of Art Baton Rouge, Louisiana Her recent work explores the effects of climate change on life sustaining systems and resources, specifically marine ecosystems and plant and animal species. Early life and education Helen Ramsaran was born in Bryan, Texas in 1943. She received a Bachelor of Science degree in Art Education (1965) and a Masters of Fine Art in sculpture (1968) from Ohio State University, where she studied bronze casting under David Black and welding with John Freeman. From 1968-69, Ramsaran taught at Florida A&M; University and later at Bowie State University in Maryland from 1970 to 1973. She studied photography at the New School for Social Research in New York (1973–74), and anatomical drawing at the Art Students League in New York from 1975-1976. Ramsaran retired as an Associate Professor of Art at John Jay College of the City of University of New York in 2008. Career and Artistic Style Ramsaran moved to New York City in 1973. Shortly thereafter (1978), she created a series of bronze relief sculptures called Visual Tales. This is her only series that is autobiographical in its statement and assumes the form of a visual narrative. The images and forms are somewhat calligraphic, thus posing some very delicate and challenging casting problems. In executing this body of work at the Johnson Atelier Technical Institute of Sculpture in Princeton, New Jersey, Ramsaran was able to perfect the technique of casting very delicate bronze sculptures. Legacy from Olduvai, bronze, 1990, 16 x 8 x 12 inches, (Image Courtesy of Welancora Gallery and the Artist, Photography by Adam Reich) In the 1980s, Ramsaran's work took a major shift and developed into an exploration of ancient rituals, ancient African oral traditions, ancient myths, mysterious fossilized remains, supernatural power, and African inspired architecture. Although her sculpture during this period and beyond is inanimate, there is a lurking sense of humanity's presence. The subtle carvings on many of Ramsaran's bronze sculptures are meant to represent African scarification and elements in nature, such as lighting and rain that mark the change in planting seasons and, that speak of a lost reverence for nature and its life-sustaining power. The research for Ramsaran's older works involved extensive travel, over a thirty-year period, throughout Africa, Europe, Mexico, China, and Japan. During the early 80's she traveled to Pietrasanta in Italy where she set up a small studio and spent several months casting in bronze. A few of the most pivotal moments in her research came when she visited Mexico (1982) where she observed the ancient sculpture and architecture of the Toltecs, Mayans, Zapotecs and Aztecs; Japan (1984) where she learned the delicate art of traditional Japanese papermaking or Washi while being apprenticed to the papermaker, Hiroyuki Fukunishi; and, in Zimbabwe (1987-1988) where she created a group of twenty stone carvings and bronze sculptures called Prehistoric Stamps that suggest the prehistoric origins of seeds, fossils, animals, and the Shona, Karanga and Ndebele people of the region. The overwhelming presence of granite boulders, in Zimbabwe, adorned with prehistoric, red ochre paintings of warriors and animals would forever shape Helen's approach to her work going forward. Similarly, after her experiences in Japan she created a series of experimental sculptures, in handmade paper called The Secret Myths. These works represent enlarged amulets inscribed with brightly colored symbols from African mythology. The Sanctuary Group consists of a series of large bronze sculptures informed by an age-old initiation ritual of the Poro and other associations, which takes place in the deep sacred grove of trees in the Ivory Coast. These works were included in Ramsaran's solo show at the Chrysler Museum of Art and the Studio Museum in Harlem. Ramasran's extensive research on the Dogon sacred sites in Mali informs her series of bronze sculpture that investigates the idea of the shrine as an actual place of refuge for the living and the deceased. This exploration into the idea of \\"house\\" was also an outgrowth of Ramsaran's research on African cosmology especially in the construction of houses. In 1998, Ramsaran produced an art work entitled Kuca: A Well Worn Path. This path measured approximately 125 feet long and 18 to 24 inches wide and was composed of approximately 100 bronze segments linked together to form a serpentine design. In the language of the Batammaliba people, kuca refers to a path, often associated with the concept of a place. Ramsaran comments on the profound multi-layered meaning this word holds in relationship to her sculptures: Shrine of the Arrowhead Women, bronze, 1992, 13 x 15 x 14 inches, wb, (Image Courtesy of Welancora Gallery and the Artist,Photography by Cary Whittier) According to Suzanne Preston Blier, The Anatomy of Architecture, \\"Paths constitute a frequently used metaphor in the Batammaliba ceremony and thought. Paths are commonly used to refer to the idea of destiny (one's path in life), are closely identified with the idea of history (a path through time), are employed as a frequent reference to identity (each person follow his or her own distinct path), and are often used to suggest proper conduct (the correct path of behavior). In local ritual (among the Batammaliba) and symbolic contents, the path is seen to be that element that distinguishes and gives identity (a sense of place) to all living forms.\\" Ghost Species, 2019, Carved Clay, 6 x 8 inches. (Image Courtesy of Welancora Gallery and the Artist,Photography by Cary Whittier) Ramsaran's recent series, executed in carved white clay, is not as intricate as the earlier works but they still communicate the same sophistication and physical tension. These pieces are intended to represent the dying off of the coral reef and other life- sustaining systems due to the effects of climate change. =Solo exhibitions= 2017 *\\"Extinction: Signals of Alarm\\", Kenkeleba Gallery, New York, New York 2010 *\\"A Significant Find\\", Maplewood Art Center, Maplewood, New Jersey 2002 *\\"Dwellings: Real and Imagined\\", American Museum of Natural History, New York, New York. 2001 *\\"The Spirit of a Woman\\", Cinque Gallery, New York, New York 1998 *\\"Pathways and Shelters\\", Wilmer Jennings Gallery, New York, New York 1994 *\\"Helen Evans Ramsaran\\", Solo Exhibition, Chrysler Museum of Art, Norfolk, Virginia *\\"Helen Evans Ramsaran\\", Solo Exhibition, Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York 1992 *\\"Touchstones of Grace\\", Hughley Gallery, Atlanta, Georgia 1988 *\\"Le Contes Visuels\\", La Fourmi Ailee Galerie, Paris, France =Selected Two-Person Exhibitions= 2002 *\\"Windows of the Soul: Phoebe Beasley and Helen Ramsaran\\", Stella Jones Gallery, New Orleans, Louisiana 1996 *\\"Masami Aihara and Helen Evans Ramsaran\\", Atagoyama Gallery, Tokyo, Japan =Group exhibitions= 2016 *\\"Essentia\\", Taller Boricua, New York, New York *\\"Herstory\\", Welancora Gallery, Brooklyn, New York 2014 *\\"Art of the 5 Brooklyn\\", Interchurch Center, New York, NY *\\"Facing the Rising Sun\\", Wilmer Jennings Gallery, New York, New York 2013 *\\"50 Years/50 Gifts\\", Sheldon Museum of Art, Lincoln, Nebraska *\\"Its Surreal Thing\\", Sheldon Museum of Art, Lincoln, Nebraska 2009 *\\"Twin Infinities\\", Abrons Art Center, New York, New York 2008 *\\"African American Artists on Paper\\", State University of New York at Geneseo, Geneseo, New York *\\"Something to Look Forward To\\", HUB- Robeson Galleries, Penn State University, University Park, Pennsylvania *\\"Something to Look Forward To\\", Flint Institute of Arts, Flint, Michigan *\\"Something to Look Forward To\\", Morris Museum of Art, Augusta, Georgia 2007 *\\"Back to the Future: Contemporary American Art from the Collection\\", Mead Art Museum, Amherst College, Amherst, Massachusetts 2006 *\\"Something to Look Forward To\\", Beach Museum of Art, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas *\\"Something to Look Forward To\\", California African American Museum, Los Angeles, California 2005 *\\"Something to Look Forward To\\", The Heckscher Museum of Art, Huntington, New York *\\"Looking......Seeing?\\" Selected Alumni From the Artist-in-Residence Studio Space Program, Guest Curator, Suzanne Randolph, Abrons Art Center Gallery, New York, New York *\\"Project Diversity 200\\", Corridor Gallery, Brooklyn, New York *\\"Contemporary Women Artists: New York\\", University Art Gallery, Indiana State University, Terre Haute, Indiana 2004 *\\"Creating Their Own Image\\", Parsons Gallery, Parson School of Design, New York, New York *\\"Something to Look Forward To\\", Phillips Museum of Art, Franklin & Marshall College, Lancaster, Pennsylvania 2003 *\\"For Love And Peace Of Mind: Contemporary Works of Art\\", One Good Thing Gallery, New York, New York *\\"Comfort Zones: Sculptural Solutions for the Spirit\\", TENRI Cultural Institute of New York, New York, New York 2002 *\\"Paper 2003\\", Metaphor Contemporary Art, Brooklyn, New York *\\"Assembly/Line: Works by Twentieth-Century Sculptors\\", Mead Art Museum, Amherst, Massachusetts *\\"LIFE -

The dating of the deposit, while uncertain, is associated with material assigned to the genus Ekaltadeta, placing its occurrence in the middle or late Miocene epoch. Taxonomy The description of a new species and genus was published in 2016, a collaboration between researchers at several Australian institutions. The authors placed the new genus with the Dasyuridae family, and tentatively proposed an alliance to species of Daysurinae. The holotype and only described material is a single tooth, the second or third molar, found close to the edge of the Riversleigh fossil area at a region referred to as the \\"new Riversleigh\\". The site of discovery and the genus are named for a location known as Wholly Dooley hill, which itself is was named for a volunteer working at Riversleigh, Genevieve Dooley. The specific epithet tomnpatrichorum combines the names of the researchers Tom and Pat Rich, who are commemorated for their work at Riversleigh and contributions to Australian palaeontology. Description A hypercarnivorous marsupial distantly related to Sarcophilus harrisii, the Tasmanian devil. a marsupial carnivore which occurs in Tasmania. The mass of the animal is estimated to have between 20 and 25 kilograms, around twice the weight of S. harrisii, and able to consume animals greater in size than itself. The new species is the first described from the Wholly Dooley site, which was discovered by examining satellite data and revealed an assemblage of unknown taxa deposited during a period of aridification in the Riversleigh area.

She develops optical instrumentation for the detection and diagnosis of diseases, including infection and cancer. She has served on the Board of Directors of SPIE.  Education and early career  Maitland grew up in California. She attended the Exploratorium as a child, and became interested in the creative science exhibits. At the time a new rollercoaster was being developed, and Maitland stepped in to help fix it. One of the Exploratorium employees asked if she was an engineering student. She had arthroscopic surgery as a teenager which made her interested in optics. She studied electrical engineering at the California Polytechnic State University, where she earned her bachelor's and master's degrees. She moved to the University of Texas at Austin for her doctoral studies, and earned her PhD in 2006. After completing her graduate studies, she joined the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory as a staff scientist. She joined the faculty at Texas A&M; University in 2008.  Research  Maitland works on the early detection of cancers and tuberculosis using multi-modal optical imaging. This involves fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy for initial guidance and reflectance confocal microscopy for the detection of cellular changes. The fluorescence signals can be detected from outside the body or through optical fibres. She is interested in the miniaturisation of these devices to increase the scanning speed and depth. For the detection of bacterial infection Maitland uses optical fibres to excited near-infrared optical reporters inside the lung. Fluorescence signals are monitored outside the lungs and used to quantify the levels of bacterial infection. The fibres use a diffuse fibre excitation source that allows them to get closer to pathogens in the lungs, making high resolution imaging possible. = Awards and honours = Her awards and honours include; * 2013 National Science Foundation CAREER Award * 2019 William Keeler Memorial Award She is a Fellow of SPIE and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.

Originally built in the 4th century, the church was repeatedly remodeled in the Middle Ages. The extant edifice is a domed cross- in-square design, contained in a walled enclosure with corner towers. It is inscribed on the list of the Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance.  Location  The Tsilkani cathedral stands in the centre of the eponymous village—northwest of the ancient city of Mtskheta—on the left bank of the Narekvavi, a tributary of the Aragvi River. The village, home to a Late Bronze Age burial mound and other archaeological finds, is also notable for a 4th–5th-century Christian crypt, with a Greek inscription on its wall.  History  Hodegetria of Tsilkani The Tsilkani church is credited by the medieval Georgian chronicles to King Bakar (r. c. 365–380), son of Mirian III, the first Christian king of Kartli—Iberia of the Classical sources. Originally a hall church, the cathedral was remade into a three-nave basilica in the 5th or 6th century and, eventually, reconstructed as a domed church in the 12th or 13th century. The church was further renovated in the 16th–17th century. The church was also associated in medieval Georgian tradition—elaborated in the hymns by the 13th-century cleric Arsen Bulmaisimisdze—with the monk Jesse from Antioch who came as part of the Thirteen Assyrian Fathers in Kartli around 545. It is maintained that Jesse's tomb is still preserved in the church. The cathedral was the seat of bishops of Tsilkani, first heard of in 506. The cathedral was home to the venerated Virgin Hodegetria of Tsilkani, a 9th- century icon of the Virgin and the Child attended by the archangels. The icon was repainted and refurbished at the turn of the 12th century, but the faces painted in encaustic tempera were left untouched. In 1926, the icon was moved for preservation to the Georgian National Museum in Tbilisi.  Layout  A tower with a belfry. The extant church, measuring 28 × 24 m and built largely of dressed sandstone blocks, is a cross-in-square building, with a semicircular apse and a central dome held up on four free-standing piers. The base of the dome is pierced with 12 windows. The interior is additionally lit with 10 windows cut in the walls. The church has three entrances. To the south porch is attached a small hall church with a semicircular apse and two niches, connected via a doorway to the cathedral's south nave. The church bears remnants of the coarse wall paintings, dated from the 15th century to the 18th. The cathedral is enclosed in a late-18th-century stone curtain wall, measuring 58 × 72 m. The wall is pierced by an arched brick gate on the southwest and a number of embrasures and contain rounded corner towers, one of which, on the southeast, is topped by a 19th-century hexagonal belfry.

Willoughby, who was in Siena, was clearly surprised by Holles's approach, and thought he was misinformed about his acquaintance with Dorothy, who he only knew at court where it was usual \\"to spend some hours with the ladies\\" and they had no \\"extraordinary liking\\". Holles was acting at the insistence of Dorothy's mother, who urged him to try again six months later when Willoughby returned to London.HMC Manuscripts of the Duke of Portland, vol. 9 (London, 1923), pp. vii, 149-50. In 1605 there was a rumour that Willoughy would marry the queen's Maid of Honour, Mary Gargrave, but he married Elizabeth Montagu instead.Isaac Herbert Jeayes, Letters of Philip Gawdy (London, 1906), p. 150. She described herself as a servant of Anne of Denmark, but was not a member of the household. She, (or the wife of her brother Francis Hastings, Lord Hastings, Sarah Harington, also known as Lady Hastings), had travelled to Scotland in 1603 in the hope of finding favour with Anne of Denmark. Her party met the queen ahead of an official group sent to welcome the queen at Berwick upon Tweed.

John Dunbar wrote a Neo-Latin epigram, about the tragedy stressing their equality, published in his Epigrammaton Ioannis Dunbari Megalo-Britanni (London, 1616), IV. 54.  Begging letters  Sir John Holles, who had become Comptroller of the Household of Prince Henry, recorded in his letter book attempts to secure royal favour and money for Dorothy, and he helped her draft letters to the king, queen, and prince. One letter accompanied an emblem (or emblematic jewel) that Anne of Denmark might wear, of an Indian herb that grows although severed from the earth, her mother's milk, so representing her and Stewart's devoted service. In another, Dorothy presumed \\"in this my cloudy dark misfortune to creep to the warmth of your sacred beams\\", to the extent that the queen would urge the king to pay Stewart's debts. Her third letter to the queen for money concluded, \\"I am most loth to be tedious to your majesty, words being a disease which usually accompanies misery\\". A letter to the king acknowledged a recent gift, and her presumption in begging for the queen's intercession as mediator, asking only for an annuity and £1,300 to clear Stewart's debts which otherwise may traduce the honour of Scotland and his friends. She asked Prince Henry for a place for her husband's servant John Semery.HMC Manuscripts of the Duke of Portland, vol. 9 (London, 1923), pp. 153-5. In July 1613 Dorothy Hastings alias Stewart married Robert Dillon, later 2nd Earl of Roscommon, at St Andrew, Holborn. They had a son, Henry Dillon.

The village arose in the late 18th century, settled by the son of one of Norwich's early proprietors. The district has well-preserved examples of architecture ranging from the late 18th century to the early 20th century. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. Description and history The town of Norwich was chartered in 1761 and settled the following decade. One of its first permanent residents was John Slafter, the son of proprietor and Connecticut native Samuel Slafter, who arrived in 1763. He removed from the early town center to settle the area known as Goodrich Four Corners in the 1780s. Three of the farmhouses surviving in the district were built by Slafter and other early settlers. Subsistence farming was more successful in this area than it had been in the Connecticut River valley, and the settlement flourished in the 19th century as a small farming community. Farms were primarily focused on wool production until the late 19th century, when a decline in demand prompted a shift to dairy production. Around the turn of the 20th century, one of the original farms was taken over by the Goodrich family, which lends its name to the district. The district covers , roughly centered at the four-way junction of Union Village Road, Goodrich Four Corners Road, and Pattell Road, the latter two forming a roughly north-south axis paralleling a local stream. Four farmhouses, three of which date to the 18th century, are scattered along these roadways, surround by typically 19th and early 20th-century outbuildings. The only non-agricultural building in the district is the 1937 Root School, a late example of a one-room schoolhouse which is also individually listed on the National Register.

Decided by the England & Wales High Court (EWHC), the case built on previously unclear areas surrounding Section 184 of the Law of Property Act 1925.  Facts  John and Ann Scarle were a married couple with children from previous relationships. The claimant was the daughter of John Scarle, Ms Winter. The defendant was the daughter of Ann Scarle, Ms Cutler. Both John and Ann had passed away with no clear indication of who had died first. The question for the court to decide was which step- sibling, in the absence of a clear will, would inherit the property the Scarle's had lived in and a sum of money in their bank account. The defendant, Cutler, had originally attempted to use mediation in order to offer a 50/50 split of the estate, which was rejected by Winter who began litigation.  Judgment  The defendant relied on Section 184 of the Law of Property Act 1925, also known as the Commorientes Rule. This states that the oldest person in the pair is assumed to have died first when the circumstances are unclear. The judge accepted this view, assuming that the older John Scarle had passed first. Therefore, under the Right of Survivorship in joint tenancies, the whole estate had been absorbed by Ann Scarle before passing to the defendant upon Ann Scarle's own death. Therefore, Cutler inherited the entire estate and the sum of money in the bank account. Winter was awarded nothing and ordered to pay £179,000 worth of legal fees.

It is a dissected andesitic stratovolcano at the northwestern rim of the Taal Caldera which began to form in the late Pliocene period, about 3.4 million years ago. The mountain is a prominent landmark of jagged peaks, rolling to rugged ridges and deep gorges situated just west of the hill station of Tagaytay at the southwestern end of the Tagaytay Ridge. It is well known for its scenery, as well as its retreat centers and resorts located just south of Manila. Name The name \\"Batulao\\" comes from a contraction of the Tagalog phrase \\"bato sa ilaw\\" or \\"ilaw sa dalawang bato\\" (\\"illuminated rocks\\") in reference to the phenomenon that takes place at the mountain in December when the sun's rays come out from between the mountain's two prominent peaks and light them up. Other sources say its name may have also been derived from a portmanteau of the Tagalog words \\"bato\\" (\\"rock\\") and \\"dilaw\\" (yellow) referring to the mountain's color during sunrise. Geography View of one of the mountain's twelve peaks Mount Batulao rises to a height of mostly within the municipality of Nasugbu. It forms the southwestern end of the Tagaytay Range, popularly known as the Tagaytay Ridge and historically as the Cordillera de Tagaytay, a high ridge of volcanic tuff which runs in a semi- circular direction for to Mount Sungay in the northeast in Tagaytay overlooking the Taal Lake and Taal Volcano. The mountain contains twelve peaks including its two highest peaks for which it was named. The northern side of the mountain is administered as part of Nasugbu while to the east, its foothills extend to the Cavite municipality of Alfonso. Its southern and western slopes are shared with the municipalities of Tuy, Balayan, Calaca and Lemery. Settlements include the upland barangays of Aga and Calayway (Kaylaway) in Nasugbu, Bolboc and Mataywanac in Tuy, Patugo in Balayan, Cahil in Calaca, Mayasang in Lemery and the Alfonso barangay of Kaysuyo. The mountain is situated in the Lian River Basin, a subcatchment of the Nasugbu- Lian-Calatagan Basin in the municipalities of Nasugbu, Lian, Tuy, Alfonso and Magallanes. It contains the headwaters of the Lian-Palico River, which flow down from the steep slopes of Mount Batulao and the high Mount Carilao through mostly secondary growth forest and sugarcane plantations before discharging to Nasugbu Bay of the South China Sea. This river has a total length of and produces an average annual discharge of 19.44 million cubic metres (687 million cu ft). The Montintubig (Munting Tubig), Obispo and Siomtiam rivers also have their source at Mount Batulao and drain into Balayan Bay. Mount Carilao and the Pico de Loro range as seen from the summit of Mount Batulao Mount Carilao, sometimes spelled Cariliao and also known as Mount Talamitam, occupies the gap to the north between Batulao and the Mounts Palay- Palay–Mataas-na-Gulod mountain range (also known as Mount Pico de Loro range). This mountain at Nasugbu's border with the Cavite municipality of Magallanes is known as Batulao's younger sister and is also a popular hike for beginners. To the southeast of Mount Carilao is Mount Aiming, a sharp and bare mountain which rises . The three mountains form a defile through which the Tagaytay–Nasugbu Highway passes. A large portion of the gap between the three mountains in Nasugbu is private property, most of which belongs to the Hacienda Puyat of Gonzalo Puyat & Sons and the Hacienda Caylaway of Roxas & Company. From an agricultural estate, the Puyat and Roxas family enterprises tansformed portions of this side of Mount Batulao into a prime real estate and retirement destination, with several hotels, golf courses and condominium complexes. These developments are bordered by the Batulao Forest to the south. Flora and fauna Mount Batulao overlooking Caleruega and Batulao Forest Mount Batulao has a forest cover of in its middle to lower slopes in Nasugbu, Balayan and Calaca. It is a privately owned natural sanctuary with centuries- old trees extending to the valleys and gorges to the south. The secondary growth dipterocarp forest has areas of slash-and-burn agriculture planted with corn, banana, mangoes and other fruit trees. The patches of grassland and shrubland on the mountain are dominated by cogon grass and Kans grass, while its gently sloping foothills and flat areas are planted with different agricultural crops. At least 22 bird species were recorded in and around the forest of Mount Batulao in 2004, the most common being the glossy swiftlet and barn swallow. The Wild Bird Club of the Philippines also documented the following avian residents of Batulao: blue-headed fantail, blue rock thrush, brown shrike, collared kingfisher, Philippine hanging parrot, elegant tit, long-tailed shrike, lowland white-eye, olive-backed sunbird, Philippine bulbul, Philippine coucal, Philippine fairy-bluebird, Philippine pygmy woodpecker, spotted wood kingfisher, striated grassbird, striated swallow, white-breasted woodswallow, white-browed shama, white-eared brown dove and yellow-vented bulbul. Hiking Huge boulders on the summit of Mount Batulao Mount Batulao is a popular day hike, with Philippine hiking guide Pinoy Mountaineer rating it with a \\"4/9\\" difficulty score. The mountain is recommended for beginners because of its relatively low difficulty and impressive summit vistas. Its accessibility to Metro Manila and its cool climate, as well as proximity to the popular mountain resort city of Tagaytay, also make it a popular camping destination, with at least ten designated camp sites and basic facilities like water stations, makeshift shower areas at its base and even a convenience store selling buco juice at the junction of two trails. All twelve peaks of Mount Batulao can be reached by ascending either the east or west route. East Trail, also known as the Old Trail, is the longer and more challenging route to the summit which can be accessed by trekking the rough road from the KC Hillcrest Hotel & Golf Club (formerly Evercrest) on the Tagaytay–Nasugbu Highway and turning left at a fork in the trail. It is a gradual ascent to the summit along mostly grassy slopes until camp site 8 where the steps become steep and wobbly. The newer trail to the west leads to a forested area as well as to the \\"Peak of Deception.\\" Atop its summit is an image of Mary, mother of Jesus where Marian devotees hold healing sessions twice a year. Batulao's peaks are mostly rocky cliffs that offer panoramic views of the Taal Lake and Volcano, the Pico de Loro mountain range, the coves and beaches of Punta Fuego and Calatagan, and as far south as Mount Macolod and Balayan Bay. Recreation View of Taal Lake in the far distance and Canyon Woods from the eastern side of Mount Batulao in Caylaway Mount Batulao and its environs have been a playground for Metro Manila residents since at least the 1970s. In 1975, the area of Mount Batulao in Nasugbu as well as parts of the adjacent municipalities of Maragondon and Ternate were declared as tourist zones. One of its earliest developments was the sprawling Batulao Village Club developed by the family of senator Gil Puyat and designed by architect Benjamin Bautista with landscape design by Ildefonso P. Santos Jr.. It was the destination of choice for affluent Manilans in the area of Tagaytay with its Gary Player-designed golf course, clubhouse, halfway house, village inn, cottages and sports complex with jai alai courts. In 1998, the leisure and resort development called Evercrest Golf Club & Resort (now KC Hillcrest Hotel & Golf Club) was built on of property within the Nasugbu Highlands of the Puyat-owned Group Developers Inc. It featured a 76-room hotel, golf course and a condominium, and was developed by Gulod Resort company owned by businessman Jose Go of the Ever Gotesco mall chain. The company was also the developer behind the adjacent property of Chateau Royale Sports & Country Club (now Chateau Royale Hotel Resort & Spa), a resort complex that is home to the Tree Top Adventure park and Metropolitan Medical Center Nasugbu. Other developments within the Nasugbu Highlands include Batulao Monte Grande (now Sandari Batulao), an mountain township launched by Citystate Properties of ambassador Antonio Cabangon-Chua in 2007, and Batulao Artscapes, a masterplanned community and livable art park being developed by Century Properties. Retreat centers Transfiguration Chapel at Caleruega Mount Batulao is home to Caleruega, a major retreat center and popular wedding location that sits on of hilly landscape adjacent to the former Evercrest Golf Club. It was established by the Dominican Order in 1994 as the venue for seminars and retreats of the Dominican institutions in the Philippines. The religious complex was named after the birthplace in Spain of the Dominican patron, Saint Dominic. Its famous landmark is a chapel perched on a hill, the Chapel of the Transfiguration of Jesus, that has become a favorite out-of-town wedding venue that sits only 150 people. The iconic chapel is surrounded by pine trees reminiscent of the Spanish town and has a statue of Risen Christ designed by Ben Hur Villanueva in its front lawn. The entire complex consists of 39 Catholic houses used as retreat houses, formation houses, seminaries and prayer houses. The Salesians of Don Bosco in the Philippines also run a retreat center on Mount Batulao. Founded in 1984, the Don Bosco Center for Spirituality is dedicated to their patron, Mary Help of Christians, and is also known as the Mary Help of Christians House of Spirituality. It has its own Chapel on the Hill, which also caters to weddings, located beside the entrance to its retreat house.

She showed promise as a juvenile in 2014 when she won the second of her two starts. In 2015 she took the JRA Award for Best Three-Year- Old Filly after winning both the Yushun Himba and the Shuka Sho as well as finishing second in the Daily Hai Queen Cup and the Rose Stakes. She failed to win in 2016 when she had injury problems but ran second in the Victoria Mile and third in the Queen Elizabeth II Cup. As a five-year-old she won the Hanshin Himba Stakes and finished third in both the Takarazuka Kinen and the Queen Elizabeth II Cup before being retired from racing at the end of the year. Background Mikki Queen is a bay mare with white socks on her hind legs bred in Japan by Northern Farm. As a yearling she was consigned to the Japan Racing Horse Association sale and was bought for 105,000,000 by Mizuki Noda. The filly was sent into training with Yasutoshi Ikee and was ridden in both of her races by Suguru Hamanaka. During her track career Mikki Queen was an unusually small Thoroughbred who usually weighed around 430 kg and lost up to 20 kg after a race. She was from the fifth crop of foals sired by Deep Impact, who was the Japanese Horse of the Year in 2005 and 2006, winning races including the Tokyo Yushun, Tenno Sho, Arima Kinen and Japan Cup. Deep Impact's other progeny include Gentildonna, Harp Star, Kizuna, A Shin Hikari, Marialite and Saxon Warrior. Mikki Queen's dam Musical Way was a high-class performer in France, winning the Prix Dollar in 2007. She was descended from the American broodmare Jambo (foaled 1959), making her a distant relative of Nonoalco. Racing career =2014: two-year-old season= On 7 December 2014 Mikki Queen began her racing career by finishing a close second to Gilda in an event for hitherto unraced juveniles over 1400 metres at Hanshin Racecourse. Two weeks later at the same track the filly recorded her first success as she won from seventeen opponents in a maiden race over 1600 metres. =2015: three-year-old season= Mikki Queen began her second campaign in the Daily Hai Queen Cup (a trial race for the Oka Sho) over 1600 metres at Tokyo Racecourse in February and finished second to Cat Coin, beaten a neck by the winner. The filly missed the Oka Sho in April, as she had not earned sufficient prize money, and was stepped up in trip to win Wasurenagusa Sho over 2000 metres earlier on the card. Mikki Queen's trainer Yasutoshi Ikee In the 76th running of the Yushun Himba over 2400 metres at Tokyo on 24 May Mikki Queen started the 5.8/1 third favourite behind Rouge Buck (winner of the Kisaragi Sho) and the Oka Sho winner Let's Go Donki. The other fourteen runners included Kokorono Ai (Tulip Sho), Queens Ring (Fillies' Revue), Culminar (2nd in the Oka Sho) and Cat Coin. After racing towards the rear of the field, Mikki Queen produced a strong run in the straight, gained the advantage 50 metres from the finish and won by three-quarters of a length from Rouge Buck. Hamanaka commented \\"I'm so happy she was able to demonstrate her ability. I especially concentrated on her break since she's been struggling at it so far. I thought I would relax her so to get her turn of foot at the stretch. She responded well and quickened being driven, so I just prayed for the best.\\" After a break of almost four months Mikki Queen returned for the Rose Stakes (a trial for the Shuka Sho) over 1800 metres at Hanshin. She came from last place on the final turn to finish second one and half lengths behind the winner Touching Speech with third place going to Tosen Victory. On 18 October the filly started 2/1 favourite for the 20th edition of the Shuka Sho over 2000 metres at Kyoto Racecourse when her seventeen opponents included Touching Speech, Let's Go Donki, Tosen Victory, Queens Ring, Kokorono Ai and Cat Coin. Starting from a draw on the far outside she raced in eighth place before making rapid progress on the inside in the straight and after taking the lead 100 metres out she held off the late challenge of Queens Ring to win by a neck. The winning time of 1:56.9 was a new record for the race. After the race Hamanaka said \\"she was just amazing. Her usual slow start wasn't that bad today and since the pace and surface was fast, I intentionally kept her near the pace. At the top of the stretch, I asked her to go right through the group of horses instead of going wide because I had faith in her strength and she responded beautifully.\\" On her final race of the year Mikki Queen was matched against older horses and started third favourite for the Japan Cup over 2400 metres at Tokyo on 29 November. She came home eighth of eighteen runners, two and a half lengths behind the winner Shonan Pandora. In the JRA Awards for 2015 Mikki Queen topped the poll for the JRA Award for Best Three-Year-Old Filly taking all 291 of the votes. In the official Japanese rankings Mikki Queen was rated equal with Let's Go Donki as the best three-year-old filly, nine pounds behind the top colt Duramente. =2016: four-year-old season= On her four-year-old debut Mikki Queen started favourite for the Grade 2 Hanshin Himba Stakes over 1600 metres in April but failed by a neck to catch the front-running six-year-old mare Smart Layer. In the Grade 1 Victoria Mile at Tokyo in the following month she again started favourite but despite making rapid progress from the rear of the field in the straight she was beaten two and a half lengths into second by Straight Girl with Shonan Pandora and Smart Layer in third and fourth. Mikki Queen's return in autumn was delayed by an injury to her left foreleg and she was off the track for almost six months before contesting the Queen Elizabeth II Cup at Kyoto in November when she finished well to take third behind Queens Ring and Sing With Joy. On 25 December she ended her campaign by running fifth to Satono Diamond in the Arima Kinen. In the JRA Awards for 2016 Mikki Queen finished fourth behind Marialite, Queens Ring and Straight Girl in the voting for the JRA Award for Best Older Filly or Mare. She was rated the third best older filly or mare in Japan behind Marialite and Straight Girl in the official Japanese ratings. =2017: five-year-old season= Mikki Queen's regular jockey Suguru Hamanaka Mikki Queen began her fourth campaign on 8 April with a second attempt to win the Hanshin Himba Stakes and started 1.2/1 favourite ahead of fifteen opponents including Queens Ring, Admire Lead (Victoria Mile), Jour Polaire, Denim and Ruby (runner-up in the Japan Cup), Touching Speech and Meisho Mambo. After being settled in eighth place by Hamanaka, Mikki Queen was switched to the outside in the straight and took the lead in the closing stages to win by one and three quarter lengths from Admire Lead. She started odds-on favourite for the Victoria Mile on 14 May but after having trouble obtaining a clear run in the straight she came home seventh behind Admire Lead. On 25 June the mare was moved back up in distance to take on male opposition in the Takarazuka Kinen over 2200 metres at Hanshin and produced one of her best efforts as he finished third behind Satono Crown and Gold Actor with Rainbow Line, Cheval Grand and Kitasan Black finishing further back. As in the previous year, Mikki Queen began her autumn campaign by running third in the Queen Elizabeth II Cup; on this occasion she produced a \\"powerful late run\\" but was beaten a neck and a head by Mozu Katchan and Crocosmia in a three-way photo finish. The mare ended her track career on 24 December when she came home unplaced behind Kitasan Black in the Arima Kinen. In the JRA Awards for 2017 Mikki Queen finished third behind Vivlos and Admire Lead in the voting for the JRA Award for Best Older Filly or Mare. She was rated the third best older filly or mare in Japan behind Vivlos and Queens Ring in the official Japanese ratings.

Early life and education Simonsen was born on 2 August 1873 in Copenhagen, the son of merchant Georg Harald Simonsen (1841–1890) and Caroline Jensen (1845–1913). He graduated from Nørrebros Latin- og realskole in 1889 and was then an apprentice for three years at B. Kromann jr. in Marstal before working first for the textile company v. Barm & Petersen in Flensburg and then for six years for Holger Petersen on Købmagergade in Copenhagen. Career In 1899, Simonsen started his own company which traded in building materials. The company grew rapidly. It purchased Niverød Brickworks in 1911, Snesere Brickworks in 1916 and later also Kollerup Brickworks. He was also a major importer of timber from Sweden and Finland. In 1918, when World War I had resulted in a shortage of cargo ships, he attracted media attention for converting a delivery of timber from Finland into a gigantic raft, naming it Refanut and towing it to Denmark. Simonsen's business gave him a thorough knowledge of the construction industry. During the economic crisis of the 1920s, Simonsen was stuck with great quantities of timber and bricks that no one wanted to buy. He responded by starting a new career as a developer. In 1926, he acquired a large piece of land at Svanemøllen in Copenhagen from the estate of S. N. Meyer. He constructed Svanemøllegården and Ulfsgård and sold off the rest of the land in lots. He was later also involved in a number of other development projects, both alone and in collaboration with others. These included Lindevangsgården, Hostrups Have, Ringkøbinggården, Hollændervænget and Thorsgård. In 1936, Simonsen converted his company to a limited company under the name Harald Simonsen A/S with an initial capital of DKK 1 million. The property management division was placed in a separate company. Personal life Simonsen's grave in Frederiksberg Old Cemetery Simonsen married Betty Nathalia Thorup (1877–1949) on 10 January 1899. The couple had two children, Ib Simonsen and (née Simonsen). Simonsen constructed a house on Østerbrogade (now Dag Hammerskjolds Allé 28) for his own use in 1917. The building was designed by Carl Brummer and is known as \\"Little Amalienborg\\". He was a skilled cricket player and an honorary member of Danske Studenters Roklub. He became Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog in 1927 and was awarded the 'Cross of Honour ('Dannebrogsmand) in 1939. He died on 3 February 1949 and is buried in Frederiksberg Old Cemetery.

It was occupied over a long period of time, between 350,000 and 120,000 years ago. Four Neanderthal remains have been recovered in excavations that were begun in 1989: a fragment of a fibula, two teeth, and a nearly complete parietal bone from an adult. All date from the late Middle/early Late Pleistocene. The thickness of the cortical bone in the fibula indicates it came from non-modern man. Description Graphic representation of the history of the cave. Image by Museo de Prehistoria de Valencia. The cave is located in the La Valldigna valley, which is demarcated by the Les Creus mountain range to the north, whose highly eroded reliefs slope towards the valley, and the Mondúver range to the south. The valley is covered by sediments from the Quaternary period, and opens in the east to a marshy landscape with dunes, which connects to the coastal Mediterranean plain. The Cueva de Bolomor is on the right side of a cliff; it is a karst cave at above sea level, surrounded by karstified hills. The cave today is more a rock shelter, of about in length and wide, and deep with an irregular interior. Formerly, it was a much wider cave, before its dome fell in (probably due to seismic activity). Today's mouth of the cave overhangs the valley and offers a view of the coastal area, including the town of Cullera. Occupation and remains Archaeologists recognize a stratigraphy of 17 layers, dated between 350 and 121,000 years ago. Three main periods of occupation are recognized: 350,000 years ago, 200,000 to 150,000 years ago, and 120,000 years ago. Human occupants ate a wide variety of animals, including ungulates of all sizes, besides tortoises and birds. Throughout the occupation, they ate young elephants. A relative rarity for the Middle Pleistocene is the frequency with which the remains of rabbits, marked with cuts, are found; such small, quick prey is unusual for the period, and is most likely a specific feature of a unique locality. Any prey, including young elephants, would have had to be carried up the steep slope. Flake production dominated the flint technology, fire was habitually used, and there was lithic recycling; the Levallois technique was not often used, and no handaxes were found. It is postulated that the site represents a transition from an Acheulean to a post-Acheulean mode of living, which may have taken place between Marine Isotope Stages 9 and 7. Bolomor is one of \\"numerous European sites [that] attest new technological behavior oriented toward long and complex knapping methods, with long and complex repetitive core reduction, predetermined flake shape, and tool standardization\\". Layers with scrapers and denticulate tools alternate. Fifteen hearths, in age ranging between 250,000 and 100,000 years old, are being studied. Some of the hearths were lined with stone. History of the research The site has been excavated annually since 1989, during a 30-day period. Research is supported by the Prehistoric Investigation Service of the Valencian Council, and the material deposited in the Prehistory Museum of Valencia.

Harvard University Kennedy School of Government Graduation- Solomon Areda Waktolla Harvard Law School Graduation- Solomon Areda Waktolla Early life and Education Solomon Areda Waktolla was born on April 29, 1975 from his father Areda Waktolla Hordofa and his mother Kibbi Bedhane Molu, in the town of Garba Guracha, Salalee, North Shewa zone of Oromia regional state in Ethiopia. He grew up in an extended family with twelve of his sisters and brothers. His hardworking parents contributed a meaningful role in shaping the person he is today. He credits his unwavering principles and integrity to his parents’ Orthodox Christian faith and values. In addition, growing up in an extraordinary rich cultural traditions of the Oromo society, that values inclusiveness and kindness, gave Waktolla a different outlook of life. From an early age, Waktolla stood out as the smartest kid in the class regularly receiving first grade honors from school. He attended his elementary and high school education in a public school in the town of Garba Guracha. He then attended Addis Ababa University and obtained a bachelor's degree in Law in 1997. He pursued a Masters of Laws degree (LL.M) from Harvard Law School and Master of public Administration (MPA) from Harvard Kennedy School of Government. He obtained HIID Merit Scholarship award from Harvard University. At Harvard Kennedy School of Government, Waktolla completed the fellowship of Edward S. Mason Program in public Policy and Management. In addition, he received Masters of Laws (LL.M) in International Economic Law at the University of Amsterdam. He is a member of the Harvard Alumni Association and currently serving as Harvard University Contact Person in Ethiopia. Waktolla is a fellow of Golda Meir Mount Carmel International Training Center and an alumnus of the Center for American and International Law. Judicial career  After graduating from the law school, Waktolla began working as an assistant judge in the Oromia Region Supreme Court. After his clerkship, Waktolla was appointed as a judge of the Regional High Court in West Shewa Zone of Oromia region in Ambo Town. During his years in the Ambo High Court, he served in both Civil and Criminal divisions of the court. In 2001, Waktolla started his judgeship at the Federal First Instance Court of Ethiopia. From February 2003 to January 2009, Waktolla served as a Federal High Court Judge and sat in Commercial, Criminal and Labor Divisions of the Federal High Court. =The Genocide Trial/The Red Terror Trial= During his six-years tenure at the Federal High Court, Justice Waktolla presided over the historical Red Terror/genocide Trial where the former Ministers and other Higher Officials that served during the Derg regime were prosecuted for genocide and crimes against humanity. Key Shibir (Amharic: ቀይ ሽብር ḳäy šəbbər), also known as the Ethiopian Red Terror, was a violent political repression campaign of the former Ethiopian military regime, Derg, against other competing political groups in Ethiopia. The Ethiopian Red Terror was based on the Red Terror of the RussianC ivil War. It began in 1976, when communist Mengistu Haile Mariam took control of the military dictatorship and ousted Emperor Halie Selassie, and lasted until 1978. During these years, the governing body used atrocious violence against anyone that wasn't a part of its party by arbitrarily arresting, torturing, and massacring thousands of people. It is estimated that 30,000 to 750,000 people were killed over the course of the Qey Shibir. The special prosecutor office filed charges against the public and military officials of the former government, proceeding with what are collectively called the ‘Red Terror trial. Out of the total of 5198 defendants charged 2246 defendants were charged while in detention and 2952 defendants were charged in absentia. The Red Terror trial is the first of its kind on the African continent. The charges brought against the defendants include genocide and crimes against humanity, torture, murder, unlawful detention, rape, forced disappearances, abuse of power and war crimes. The Special Prosecutor Office charged the former officials with committing genocide by deliberately and systematically planning to exterminate opposition political groups, which is a violation of article 281 of the 1957 Ethiopian Penal Code. Article 281 of the 1957 Ethiopian Penal Code, unlike the Genocide Convention, extends its protection to political groups in addition to national, ethnic, racial and religious groups. The trials of the majority of the defendants were carried out before the Federal High Court in Addis Ababa. The trial illustrates a belief against impunity for human rights violators. The prosecutions inform the public of what happened in a bid to deter future recurrences of similar violations of human rights. Those who were found guilty were convicted and sentenced by the Federal High Court. Some of them were convicted in absentia. Most of the convicted offenders were sentenced to the penalty ranging from five years up to twenty five years rigorous imprisonment depending on the degree of their participation, while some were sentenced to life time rigorous imprisonment and very few red terror convicts faced death penalty by the Court. In 2010, following a petitition from religious bodies in Ethiopia, the death sentences handed down by the court were commuted to life imprisonment by the President of Ethiopia. In undertaking the tasks of investigating the past violations and prosecuting those responsible, while providing due process of law, states are dispensing justice to victims as well as to guarantee the non repetition of crime of similar nature. =Vice President of the Federal First Instance Court= In January 2009, the Ethiopian House of Parliament appointed Waktolla to serve as the Vice President of the Federal First Instance Court of Ethiopia. His notable achievement while serving as a vice president includes the successful implementation of the reform packages introduced in the Ethiopian Judicial System. He was actively involved in the Ethiopian Court Reform Program through participating in the Comprehensive Justice System Reform Program Base Line Study. He also partook in the implementation, evaluation and coordination of these reform activities. Private legal practice  After graduating from Harvard law School, in December 2014 Waktolla started the private legal practice, establishing his own firm named Solomon Areda Law Office in Addis Ababa. Solomon Areda Law office offered a diversified expertise on various areas of the law; ranging from dealing in complex litigation and arbitration, corporate and commercial transactions, banking and finance, labor and employment, intellectual property, energy and infrastructure, mining and natural resources, construction law and Tax law. He advised both local, as well as global multi-nationals seeking to do business in Ethiopia and other African Countries Waktolla also represented local and international companies on multi-million commercial disputes before Federal Courts and Arbitration Tribunals. Notable cases include: * Represented Elily International Hotel and GEBCON PLC on property injunction litigation suit involving at Federal High Court and Federal Supreme Court of Ethiopia * Represented Nile Petroleum Company Limited Ethiopia Branch on contractual civil litigation involving at Federal High Court of Ethiopia * Advised Sodere Resort Share company in the share acquisitions of the Ethiopian Privatization Agency * Represented GBCON Plc. in a construction claim involving before an Arbitration Tribunal at Addis Ababa Chamber of Commerce * Represented GBCON Plc. in a dividend and income tax suit involving at Federal Tax Appeal Commission and Federal High Court of Ethiopia * Advised BANK HAPOALIM B.M in relation to export credit facility agreement in the aggregate, the principal amount of advanced to Ethiopian Sugar Corporation for the execution of a turn-key, engineering, procurement and construction project for a drip irrigation system, including bulk water supply and water delivery * Advised Dangote industries Ethiopia plc in its contract with Sinoma International Engineering CO.

The PCA was the first permanent intergovernmental organization to provide a forum for the resolution of international disputes through arbitration and other peaceful means. The PCA is established by the Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes, concluded at the Hague 1899 during the first Hague Peace Conference to facilitate arbitration and other forms of dispute resolution between states.  Policy research  The Ethiopian Government in collaboration with UNDP hired an international consultant,Center for International Legal Cooperation CILC), to conduct a study in order to identify the shortcomings of the Ethiopian legal system. In this study, Waktolla worked with the group of International Experts and produced a Comprehensive Justice Sector Reform Program Base Line Study Report. The Ethiopian legal reform was initiated based on this study. Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute the US based non-profit organization, organized The Way Forward Project to conduct a study analyzing opportunities and challenges facing policy makers in six African Countries including Ethiopia as they work to develop system of Care that serve children in and through their families. Justice Waktolla, worked with a group of international Experts in framing the strategies for developing the legal and government infrastructure necessary to support child welfare systems which promote individualized best interest determinations and family-based care. The Way Forward Project was released at US State Department Summit held on 8 November 2011 at George C. Marshall Center in the presence of the former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and other officials from the US and other parts of the world. Waktolla engaged in coordinating various projects with NGOs and Government offices geared towards promoting child justice through child friendly courts. He presented a research paper on 'the creation of child friendly courts in Ethiopia' on the UN Conference on the Convention of the Rights of the Child held in Geneva November 2009. At Harvard Law School Waktolla, as a required written work, authored legal policy research on Land governance regime of Ethiopia. Ethiopia is one of the African countries that attracted foreign investors in agricultural land investment. However, these land investments has led to widespread displacement of the local people and massive human right violations. The government leased these lands to foreign investors by displacing small scale land holders, pastoralists and other indigenous people, who depend on land for their survival. The research focuses on how to redesign the land governance system of Ethiopia by examining a wide range of other countries' collaborative arrangements between large-scale investors and local small-scale farmers and finally proposes what alternative inclusive business models and policy frame works to be adapted in the Ethiopia's context to address the current challenges. Appointment to the position of Deputy Chief Justice Deputy Chief Justice Solomon Waktolla presiding the Bench On November 1, 2018, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced the nomination of Meaza Ashenafi and Solomon Areda Waktolla to the Chief justice and Deputy Chief Justice position of the federal supreme court of Ethiopia respectively in a live, nationwide television broadcast from the Ethiopian Parliament. The House of People's Representatives (HPR) approved the appointment of Meaza Ashenafi and Solomon Areda Waktolla as Chief Justice and Deputy Chief Justice of the Federal Supreme Court respectively by a unanimous vote. Some of the parliamentarians who spoke during the nomination have also praised the Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed for his picks based on meritocracy. Deputy Chief Justice Waktolla, serving alongside newly appointed Chief Justice Meaza Ashenafi, is engaged with reforming and modernizing the Ethiopian Judiciary since coming into office. He is also presiding over one of the cassation benches of the Federal Supreme court. Furthermore, he is serving as a Deputy chair of the Council of the Constitutional Inquiry of Ethiopia.

He has written for Komsomolskaya Pravda, TASS, RIA Novosti and Sport Express. He traveled with the Soviet Union national ice hockey team as both a journalist and translator, and reported on ice hockey at the Olympic Games, the Ice Hockey World Championships and Canada Cup tournaments. His other work includes published books and television screenplays. As an ice hockey administrator he sat on International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) committees, and acted as a press secretary for the Russian Superleague and its successor the Kontinental Hockey League. He received the Paul Loicq Award in 2000 from the IIHF for contributions to international ice hockey. Early life Kukushkin was born on 3 May 1942, in Biysk, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union. His love for ice hockey began as a boy playing ball hockey. He developed an appreciation for goaltenders by playing the position in school, and his understanding of the inherent physical demands and frequent injuries. He learned the English language as a young adult on the advice of his parents, and wanted to become a journalist. His father, a writer of Soviet literature under the pseudonym Vladimir Nikolaev, urged his son to study mechanical engineering in case a journalism career failed. Kukushkin followed that advice and graduated from Moscow Power Engineering Institute in 1965. Journalism and writing career Kukushkin began his career in sports journalism becoming a member of the Union of Journalists of the Russian Federation in 1966, and then a member of the International Sports Press Association in 1969. He was originally a freelancer and a correspondent for Komsomolskaya Pravda, before he worked at TASS for 22 years. He later worked for RIA Novosti and Sport Express. Canadian journalist Matthew Fisher and The Hockey News have referred to Kukushkin as the \\"dean of European hockey writers\\". He has published books in addition to reporting on ice hockey, and written screenplays for television documentaries on sports, ice hockey and popular science. Kukushkin's career includes reporting on ice hockey at the Olympic Games from 1968 to 2002, each Ice Hockey World Championships in the same time frame, and every Canada Cup tournament played. Due to his knowledge of English, he traveled with the Soviet Union national ice hockey team as both a reporter and translator. He had access to the team's locker room and the opportunity to speak directly with the players and be part of their daily life. Kukushkin translated early discussions for the event which became the 1972 Summit Series. He was present at the 1972 Izvestia Cup when Alan Eagleson and John Ziegler Jr. made the suggestions to Andrey Starovoytov, the general secretary of the Soviet Union Ice Hockey Federation. Kukushkin authored books on the Canada Cup tournaments, and Soviet national team coach Viktor Tikhonov. Kukushkin's book The Red Machine revealed that the nickname for the Soviet national team came into usage during the 1983 Super Series, when a headline in a Minneapolis newspaper headline read \\"The Red Machine rolled down on us\\". The Soviet national team was succeeded by the Russia men's national ice hockey team after the breakup of the Soviet Union. When the new national team struggled in 1994, Kukushkin said that \\"The people are upset. Russia is a nation of critics.\\" He reported that the Russian team was struggling with finances to support training, no funding was received from the national level, and professional teams in Russia were struggling to stay afloat. He also reported that the Russian people were upset at losing the nation's best players to the National Hockey League (NHL), and not playing on the Russian national team. Ice hockey administrator Kukushkin sat on International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) committees which included the championship bid committee and the IIHF Hall of Fame committee from 1998 to 2003, the evaluation committee and the IIHF Hall of Fame committee from 2003 to 2008, and the strategic consulting group from 2013 to 2016. He also served as the press secretary for the Russian Superleague. He stated that NHL players were attracted to playing in Russia before the 2004–05 NHL lockout happened, and that Russian team owners were spending more on salaries. He noted that taxation in Russia was favorable to expatriate players, and expected the trend to continue despite uncertain profitability. Kukushkin and Ice Hockey Federation of Russia president Vladislav Tretiak participated in discussions with NHL representatives Gary Bettman and Donald Fehr, for a potential 2007 revival of the Summit Series. He commented that the event was profit-driven by ticket sales and broadcasting rights, but noted that Russian players wanted to participate for pride rather than just money. He was surprised that original proposals were discussed by René Fasel of the IIHF and Bob Nicholson of Hockey Canada. Ultimately the 2007 Super Series was arranged using junior players, and coincided with the IIHF's 100th anniversary. In 2008, the Russian Superleague was reorganized into the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). Kukushkin remained in his advisory role, and stated that \\"we see the league as a challenge to the NHL in the future\\". He felt the Lokomotiv Yaroslavl plane crash in 2011 would deter players from the KHL, stating it was \\"a horrible blow and a colossal loss for the league\\", and suggested more diligence by teams in chartering flights. In 2015, he cautioned against the KHL expanding due to a lack of good players. He instead suggested the KHL be divided into three levels based on play ability, and stated \\"we shouldn't copy the NHL, because sometimes the copy becomes a parody, and it doesn't do any good\\". Kukushkin is part of the selection committee for the Russian Hockey Hall of Fame as of 2016. Awards Kukushkin was made a laureate of the International and All-Union Sports Film Festivals in 1972. He received the Paul Loicq Award in 2000 from the IIHF for contributions to international ice hockey. He was the third recipient of the award, and the first Russian. He stated that he was very surprised to honored with the award, which he received at the IIHF Hall of Fame induction ceremony at the 2000 IIHF World Championship hosted in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

It is a two-story rectangular wood frame structure set on a stone foundation, with white clapboard siding and a gabled roof. A square tower rises from the northern end of the roof, topped by an octagonal spire. The tower has two stages, each with a hipped roof and louvered openings on each side. The front facade has two symmetrically placed entrances on either side of a tall window. All three elements are capped by a shallow peaked lintel. The building's corner boards are paneled, with an entablature extending along the sides. The church was built in 1859 for a congregation established in 1798; it was that organization's third edifice, built on the site of the second, which was destroyed by fire in 1857. It was built by Charles Richardson, owner of a local carriage shop and sometime bridge builder. It was apparently designed to serve a broader array of community functions, and housed Waterford's annual town meetings until 1957. It continues to serve both civic and religious functions, hosting historical society events and meetings of the town selectmen. The National Register listing was the result of a process begun in 2017 by formation of a committee including a town selectman, a town librarian, the Waterford Historical Society and church leaders.

The decision to launch this centre was made in 2011,Onze Geschiedenis, website of the Dairy Campus and it was opened in 2016.——, Steatssekretaris Van Dam iepenet nij sintrum Dairy Campus, Omrop Fryslân, 19 May 2016——, Steatssekretaris Van Dam iepenet Dairy Campus yn Ljouwert, Omrop Fryslân, 26 May 2016——, Koeien kijken: Dairy Campus in Leeuwarden, eDepot, Wageningen University & Research, 2014 The Campus traces its roots to the test farm Bosma Zathe, founded in Ureterp in 1944; its building complex was formerly called Nij Bosma Zathe (nij means \\"new\\" in the West Frisian language). Today, the Dairy Campus is part of Wageningen University & Research (WUR). All activities in the centre are focused on the development of sustainable methods for the production and processing of dairy products. History In May 1944, the Centraal Instituut voor Landbouwkundig Onderzoek (\\"Central Institute for Agricultural Research\\", CILO), based in Wageningen, leased the dairy farm Bosma Zathe in the Frisian village of Ureterp for agronomic research. In 1956 this test farm was taken over by the (Frisian provincial) Christelijke Boeren en Tuinders Bond (\\"Christian Farmers' and Horticulturalists' Association\\", CBTB), which ran it for the following sixteen years. During a reorganisation in 1972, Bosma Zathe was transformed into a regional research centre (ROC). As such it became, from 1974 onwards, a collaboriation between the CBTB, the Friese Maatschappij van Landbouw (\\"Frisian Society of Agriculture\\") and interest groups of farmers and horticulturalists from the neighbouring Province of Groningen. Through a merger in 1995, the test farm became part of a national Stichting Praktijkonderzoek Rundvee, Schapen en Paarden (\\"Foundation for Practical Research into Husbandry of Cattle, Sheep and Horses\\"). From that point, the research which took place there was coordinated from Lelystad, in the central Dutch province of Flevoland. De Dairy Campus in Leeuwarden. In 2000, the test farm Bosma Zathe was moved from Ureterp to the Boksumerpolder,——, Nij Bosma Zathe offisjeel iepene, Omrop Fryslân, 7 December 2000 near the Frisian capital of Leeuwarden, where it took the name of Nij Bosma Zathe (nij means \\"new\\" in the West Frisian language). The building complex in that location was newly built in 1999. Nij Bosma Zathe was officially opened by the Queen's Commissioner in the Province of Friesland Ed Nijpels on 6 December 2000. The entire moving operation cost in excess of 17 million Dutch guilders. Afterwards, Nij Bosma Zatha, together with the other five Dutch regional research centres in the field of dairy farming (Cranendonck, De Vlierd, Zegveld, Aver Heino and Waiboerhoeve), became part of Wageningen University & Research (WUR). Nij Bosma Zathe's function was that of centre for practical research for the dairy farming area of the northern Netherlands region (nl). In 2001 the test farm was grouped with the Praktijkonderzoek Veehouderij (\\"Practical Research Animal Husbandry\\"), an independently operating part of WUR. At that time Nij Bosma Zathe was made up of two residential dwellings, a (traditional) barn, a dairy barn with room for 184 cows, a barn for young cattle with facilities for calving, and a shed for agricultural machinery. Because of the discontinuance of the Landbouwschap, an organisation which had imposed a collective tax on Dutch farmers from which practical research was paid, budget cuts to the test farms became inevitable. In 2008-2009 all parties involved came to the agreement that the test farms for dairy farming would by brought together in one location.——, Nij Bosma Zathe kennissintrum, Omrop Fryslân, 3 December 2009——, Nij Bosma Zathe superboerderij, Leeuwarder Courant, 3 December 2009 , Koeien voor de kennis, Leeuwarder Courant, 21 May 2016 The intention was to establish a single national knowledge centre for innovation, scientific research, education and practical learning in the field of dairy farming and the production and processing of dairy products, named 'Dairy Campus'. Leeuwarden was named as the location of the newly centralised test farm, but that plan ran into opposition from the Animal Science Group of Wageningen University, ., Is vertrek Nij Bosma Zathe nog te keren?, HalloLeeuwarden.nl, 5 November 2010——, Wageningen nei Nij Bosma Zathe, Omrop Fryslân, 14 December 2010. who considered that a concentration of the test farms for dairy farming at Waiboerhoeve, near Lelystad, the largest test farm in the Netherlands, was a more central location. Inside a dairy barn where scientific research is conducted into feedstuffs and efficient feeding. The bluish containers are where the feed is deposited. Each cow wears a collar with a chip which allows it access to a single container. In that way the efficacy of the feedstuffs can be measured by milk output. In the end the decision that the Dairy Campus would be located at Nij Bosma Zathe was taken in 2011——, Opwurdearring Nij Bosma Zathe, Omrop Fryslân, 24 January 2011 on the basis that Friesland is pre-eminently a dairy farming province, with a large number of organisations in the sphere of agriculture. Behind the scenes the Province of Friesland and the Municipality of Leeuwarden did some hard lobbying to get the Dairy Campus in Leeuwarden, among other things by promising €20 million in subsidies,——, \\"Dairy Campus fan grut belang\\", Omrop Fryslân, 3 February 2011 a third of that for establishing the infrastructure and the rest for the curriculum and scientific research. Of that €20 million, €2.5 million came from the provincial government, another €2.5 million from the municipal government, and the remaining €15 million from the Frisian part of the Samenwerkingsverband Noord-Nederland (\\"Northern Netherlands Regional Cooperation\\", SNN). At the end of the summer of 2014, the expansion of Nij Bosma Zathe was supposed to begin with the construction of four new dairy barns and a new reception facility.——, Nije stâlen by Dairy Campus, Omrop Fryslân, 28 April 2014 However, the plans were delayed because of new budget cuts.——, Utwreiding Dairy Campus Ljouwert krijt foarm, Omrop Fryslân, 22 December 2015 In the end it was not until February 2015 before the expansion could begin. Overall it would cost €9 million. It had been intended that Nij Bosma Zathe would be the only Dutch test farm for dairy farming from 2015 on, but in the event the Dairy Campus was divided between two locations until the beginning of 2016, namely Nij Bosma Zathe and Waiboerhoeve, near Lelystad. Only after the construction work at Nij Bosma Zathe was completed, were all activities centralised in Leeuwarden. The Dairy Campus was formally opened by State Secretary for Economic Affairs Martijn van Dam, on 26 May 2016. In August 2018 Prime Minister Mark Rutte visited the Dairy Campus., Trots overheerst bij bezoek premier rutte aan Dairy Campus en Water Campus, Friesch Dagblad, 21 August 2018, Premier Rutte op Dairy Campus: \\"We zijn zo goed, we zijn onverslaanbaar!\\", Leeuwarder Courant, 21 August 2018. From 2016 onwards, over a period of ten years, €40 million were invested in the Dairy Campus, of which €1 million became available for innovation projects on a yearly basis. Half of that money was made up of subsidies by the Province of Friesland and the Municipality of Leeuwarden, while the remaining half was provided by Wageningen University and partners in the private sector.

The Dairy Campus today In 2019 the Dairy Campus consists of a reception and presentation building,Onderzoeksfaciliteiten, website of the Dairy Campus conference rooms, training areas, manure facilities, ponds to purify effluent a rotary milking parlor, and six dairy barns, each with its own function, such as raising young cattle, the processing of manure, and research into the accumulation of ammonia, life expectancy, grazing systems, and feedstuffs and efficient feeding. The test farm has 18 permanent employees (more than half in farming positions and the remainder in the office) and 550 milch cows (not counting a couple of hundreds heads of young cattle). Furthermore, it also includes 300 hectares of pasture. More than thirty research and innovation projects are being conducted at any time.Werken bij, website of the Dairy Campus. Apart from its status as a knowledge and research centre, the Dairy Campus is also an enterprise, which has to pay for itself. Half of all proceeds comes from supplying milk to FrieslandCampina, and the other half is derived from sponsoring of scientific research.[source needed] Installment of a new gas installation, in December 2018, made the biogas from the biofermenter, which had been placed in the Dairy Campus by Biogas B.V., suitable to supply to the public gas net.——, Nieuwe biogasinstallatie in gebruik genomen op de Dairy Campus in Leeuwarden, Omrop Fryslân, 14 December 2018.

Activities The Dairy Campus is the (only remaining) centre for scientific research and practical training in the field of dairy farming in the Netherlands. The test farm is used to gather data which can be employed to invent new, innovative ways of running a farm and processing dairy products. As a subdivision of Wageningen University, the Dairy Campus focuses on achieving and promoting close cooperation between the scientific community, education and the agricultural sector. Students from middelbaar beroepsonderwijs (job-oriented secondary education), hoger beroepsonderwijs (job-oriented higher education) as well as universities can perform the practical stages of their education at the Dairy Campus or take classes in practical training there. It is also possible for them to get busy exploring scientists' ideas in provisional research projects. And companies can pay to have their products tested in the suitable environment of the Dairy Campus. The test farm sees itself as a(n) \\"(inter)nationally leading centre where research, innovation, education, practical training and the dissemination of knowledge of the entire dairy production and processing chain are brought together.\\" The intention of the institute is to raise dairy farming to a higher level vis-à-vis economic profitability, environmental concerns, animal welfare and social acceptance. The Dairy Campus wants to become the most important centre for innovation in the Netherlands, thereby evolving into \\"the Silicon Valley of and for the entire dairy farming sector.\\" All activities in the centre are focused on the development of durable methods for the production and processing of dairy products. Cooperation The Dairy Campus is cooperating closely with a large number of companies, research centres, educational institutes, government agencies and interest groups.Partners, website of the Dairy Campus Among those are of course other subdivisions of Wageningen University, but also Nordwin College (nl), Van Hall Larenstein University, Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, campus Friesland, LTO Nederland (nl), FrieslandCampina, the Municipality of Leeuwarden, the Province of Friesland and several educational institutes abroad.——, Molly Chen út Sina wurdt nije lektor Dairy Campus, Omrop Fryslân, 14 September 2015.
