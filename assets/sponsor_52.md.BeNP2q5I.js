It was founded in 1860 as a private company and it operated as such for more than 100 years before it was nationalized under the rule of Gamal Abdel Nasser. At that time it became the Alexandria Water General Authority (AWGA), a department of Alexandria Governorate in charge of both water supply and sewerage. In 2004, through a country-wide sector reform it became a commercially oriented company under private law. The sewerage and wastewater treatment functions were transferred to a separate company, the Alexandria General Organization for Sanitary Drainage (AGOSD), later renamed to Alexandria Sanitary and Drainage Company (ASDCO). The water utility became a company under private law, reverted to its old name AWCO and gained some operational independence. Both AWCO and ASDCO are part of the government-owned Holding Company for Water and Wastewater, which owns all utilities in Egypt. AWCO serves 4.5 million inhabitants, a number that increases to 6 million during the summer season. The Alexandria water utility is one of the better-performing water service providers in Egypt, ranked fifth among 22 water utilities by the Egyptian Water Regulatory Authority in 2012/13. Water resources The city of Alexandria receives its water from the Nile River through the Mahmoudiyah Canal and the \\"Drinking Water Canal\\" that branches off from the Mahoudiyah Canal. Six water treatment plants draw their raw water from these two canals. The Noubaria Canal brings Nile water to the settlements in the western part of the Governorate. Two more water treatment planst are located on the Noubaria Canal. Because Alexandria is located downstream on the Nile, raw water quality is degraded, including by silt, weeds and debris. The salinity of the water is also elevated at around 600 parts per million. The water undergoes extensive treatment so that it complies with Egyptian drinking water quality standards. Each water treatment plant has its own laboratory that regularly monitors the quality of the treated water. In addition, there is a Central Laboratory that has been certified according to the ISO 17025:2005 standard. Water samples are taken on a weekly basis from the distribution network and showed a 98.4% compliance with standards in 2010-11.Nadia Abdou:Alexandria Water Company, Presentation at the 6th World Water Forum in Paris, 14 March 2012 Corporate governance and role of women As of 2005, all eight members of AWCO‚Äôs Board of Directors, including its Chairperson, Nadia Abdou, were women, making it one of the few utilities in the Arab world run by women. The board of directors consists of five members who are AWCO staff, including its chairperson, as well as four external board members. Two external board members are appointed by the Governorate of Alexandria and two by the Holding Company for Water and Wastewater that owns AWCO and to which its Board of Directors reports. AWCO is free to use its operating budget in any way it wants. However, investment plans and any internal restructuring have to be approved by the Holding Company.USAID/ARD:Case Studies Of Bankable Water And Sewerage Utilities, Volume Ii: Compendium Of Case Studies, 19 August 2005 Increases of residential tariffs are infrequent. They have to be approved by the holding company, the national water regulatory agency EWRA, the Ministry of Housing, the Cabinet of Ministers, the President of the Republic and the National Assembly. Industrial tariffs can be set by the company. Evolution of performance Between 2000 and 2004 the utility underwent a process of capacity development that manifested itself in the improvement of a number of performance indicators. For example, the utility introduced employee incentives. Field inspectors received five Egyptian pounds (about US$0.80) for each illegal connection they discovered. Also, meter readers and collectors received an incentive equal to up to 30% of their salary for exceeding monthly targets. Furthermore, water quality monitoring was improved and internal performance benchmarking as well as a financial forecasting tool were introduced. The utility increased its compliance with Egyptian drinking water standards from 90% to 100%; customer satisfaction improved from 60% to 82%; non-revenue water was reduced from 38% to 30% and bill collection efficiency increased from 59% to 81%. Technical assistance provided by various donors (USAID, GTZ and the Netherlands) helped in bringing about these improvements. It is not clear to what extent these improvements were sustained over time. According to one study, collection efficiency declined again to 65-70% in 2008.Badran, M., Jamrah, A., Gaese, H. (2010): Assessment of a cost-covering sanitation tariff for Alexandria/Egypt Tariffs and cost recovery In 2004 AWCO was the only water utility in Egypt generating revenue sufficient to cover all operation and maintenance costs and debt service. The ratio of revenues to operating costs was 150% in that year. This was achieved although residential water tariffs in Egypt are among the lowest in the Middle East and North Africa: In 2012, for the first 10 m3 per month the residential water tariff was only Egyptian Pound 0.23/m3 (US$0.04) and for the second block until 30m3 it was Egyptian Pound 0.31/m3 (US$0.05), and for the third block until 45m3 it was EP 0.41/m3 (US$0.06). Unmeterd residential tariffs vary between 3.50 and 6.80 Pound per month depending on the number of rooms of the apartment or house. Non-residential metered tariffs vary between 0.60 and 2.30 Pound per cubic meter. They thus are up to ten times higher than the lowest block of the residential tariff. The highest tariff categories apply to private schools and universities and to large industries. Average water consumption is around 300 liter/capita/day (45m3 per month for a family of five). It is thus higher than in other countries in the region or in Europe, which has a favorable impact on revenues. Sanitation tariffs are a surcharge of 35% to the water bill. Revenues for sanitation are passed on to the Alexandria Drainage Company after deduction of a service fee. ASDCO does not recover its operating costs. Alexandria seen from space Wastewater treatment and discharge Until the 1980s domestic and industrial sewage from Alexandria were discharged without treatment into the Mediterranean Sea, where it caused pollution of beaches and degradation of aquatic life. Therefore, the local authorities decided to treat wastewater and discharge it into Lake Mariout, an important fishing ground and recreational area. The discharge of domestic and industrial wastewater, as well as nutrient-rich agricultural drainage, caused the degradation of the lake‚Äôs water quality and its biodiversity. Ten wastewater treatment plants are operated by ASDCO. Their total capacity is 1.4 million m3 per day. The two main plants with a combined capacity of about 1 million m3 per day provide only primary treatment. Only one third of wastewater samples were in compliance with regulations in 2007. Challenges and perspectives The city of Alexandria faces several environmental challenges. One is the expected long-term rise in the level that threatens to gradually inundate the city. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) expects the sea level to rise by up to 59 cm in the worst of all considered scenarios by 2100.Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change: A 0.5-m rise in sea level would lead to estimated losses of land, installations, and tourism of more than US$32.5 billion in the Governorate of Alexandria alone, cutting off the city of Alexandria from the Delta.R.T.Watson, M.C.Zinyowera, R.H.Moss (Editors), Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change:The Regional Impacts of Climate Change: An Assessment of Vulnerability , Section 2.3.4. African Coastal Zones, 1997 Another challenge is a possible decrease in the flow of the Nile, which will particularly hurt Alexandria as it is the furthest downstream on the river. Such a decrease could be caused by global warming or by increased water use from upstream countries. One option for Alexandria to respond to the latter challenges is to embark on seawater desalination, which is energy-intensive and thus not only expensive, but would further contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Under an EU-funded research project called SWITCH, a plan for Integrated Urban Water Management has been developed. It has assessed ‚Äúhow Alexandria can meet a large part of its future water demand locally without depending mainly on Nile Waters‚Äù. According to the plan rainwater harvesting, stormwater usage, water reuse and water demand management could help in reaching that goal.SWITCH - Managing Water for the City of the Future:Alexandria City story, no date  See also  *Water supply and sanitation in Egypt *Water resources management in modern Egypt External links WaterWorld: Egypt's Iron Lady of Water, a 2012 interview with Nadia Abdou, Chairperson of Alexandria Water Company.

This case was prosecuted under the Endangered Species Act. Approximately twenty-two agents of the Fish and Wildlife Service raided the farm of Taiwanese immigrant, Taung Ming Lin, and ‚Äúarrested‚Äù his tractor and disc. The government then charged Mr. Lin and his corporation with three counts of violating the Endangered Species Act. The potential penalty was three years in jail and a $300,000 fine for Mr. Lin. In addition, the government sought (1) to have Mr. Lin deed over 363 acres of his 720 acres of land to the government and (2) pay the government approximately $172,000 to maintain Mr. Lin's land as a habitat for the endangered species. The national media and the agricultural community took an avid interest in this case, which was eventually dismissed.Eastern District of California, 1994, Case No. CR-94-5041 SSH United States v. Hanoum On appeal it was argued that the case of U.S. v. Lara-Hernandez,588 F.2d 272(9th Cir. 1978) was distinguishable from the Hanoum case since in Lara, the motion for new trial had been based upon facts known to the accused at the time of the trial. However, in Hanoum, the facts upon which the motion for new trial was based had not been known to the defendant in the seven-day period after trial. The Court of Appeals added a new aspect to the standard and held that a motion for new trial based upon ‚Äúnewly discovered evidence‚Äù is limited only to where the newly discovered evidence relates to the elements of the crime charged. The Hanoum case is significant in that it established a new interpretation of the law with regard to a motion for new trial based upon newly discovered evidence.

Its surviving remnants are located in Vernon's Valley Falls Park, about one mile south of the mill pond. History Christian Sharps became well known for inventing the breech-loading rifle in 1848, known for its long-range accuracy and use by the military in the American Civil War. After that war, demand for the weapon declined, and Sharps sought another money-making opportunity. The nation's native trout stocks were in decline, due in part to overfishing and the damming of rivers for industrial purposes. Sharps purchased of farmland, including an old mill and mill pond in southern Vernon that were well suited for use as a fish hatchery. On the site he built a small cabin, several ponds, and water control structures. He also built up berms to protect key elements of the facility from flooding. He anticipated being able to produce 300,000 fish per years, and planned to expand production to 500,000. Sharps died from tuberculosis in 1874, before he could effectively reap the rewards of his investment. His family left Vernon, and the site reverted to the previous owner and mortgage holder. The property was acquired by the Vernon Fire District in 1962, and the mill pond was dredged and converted into a recreation area.

The toponym Nevern in Wales may be identically derived.  Course  The River Nairn rises in the Monadhliath Mountains and flows northeast through Strathnairn to enter the Moray Firth at Nairn. The headwaters of the Nairn, the Allt Mor and Crom-allt Beag drop steeply down the western slopes of C√†rn Ghriogair, their combined waters flowing beneath the B851 road and turning northeastwards. The young River Nairn is soon joined by the diminutive River Brin on the right bank and later by a burn draining the sizeable Loch Duntelchaig on the left. The River Farnack is the next right bank tributary, followed by the Craggie Burn near the A9 road crossing of the Nairn at Daviot. River Nairn at Nairn The river continues to flow past Drummossie Moor which lies to its northwest and indeed past Culloden Moor, site of the battle in 1746.

Spring Hill developed as a rural waystation on an early 19th- century turnpike, and has seen only modest development since the late 19th century. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Description and history The village of Spring Hill was little more than a cluster of agricultural farmsteads until the early 19th century, located atop a local hill near the geographic center of Mansfield. It grew as a stopping point on the turnpike running between Norwich, Connecticut and Springfield, Massachusetts (now Storrs Road, Connecticut Route 195), and as an early center for the growing of mulberry trees in pursuit of silk production. Later in the 19th century, Charles and Augustus Storrs, two of its leading residents, gave land to the state for the founding of the University of Connecticut. The principal development since then has been the addition of residences in the 20th century, primarily for people affiliated with the university. The district extends along Storrs Road roughly between East Road and Spring Hill Road. It is about in size, and includes 13 historically significant buildings. Only two survive from the 18th century; most of the rest are 19th century construction, with the Greek Revival as the predominant architectural style. The district includes one church, the Gothic Baptist church built in 1877, as well as two civic buildings that have served as Mansfield's town hall. The Spring Hill area was defined as a Connecticut state historic district in 1972 and, with the same borders, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. and Contributing properties The district includes two of the four houses that had made up Spring Hill as a distinct community around 1800: *957 Storrs Road, at listing known as the Altnaveigh Inn, c.1776 *974 Storrs Road, a cottage, c.1740 One other building was destroyed by fire and the other one was demolished.

Early life Toon was born with a rare condition known as \\"transposition of the great vessels\\". At the age of three, he required open-heart surgery to ease the problem and had a cardiac pacemaker fitted when he was just seven. He was unable to play contact sports at school and his heart condition kept him undersized enabling him to taking up coxing.SMH Cox with Ticker Club and state rowing Raised in Queensland, Toon's senior club rowing was from the Toowong Rowing Club. Toon's first state representation for Queensland came in 1997 when he was selected to cox the Queensland youth eight to contest the Noel F Wilkinson Trophy at the Interstate Regatta within the Australian Rowing Championships. On twelve consecutive occasions from 1998 to 2009 Toon was selected to cox the Queensland men's senior eight contesting the King's Cup at the Interstate Regatta. In Toowong Rowing Club colours he steered numerous crews in national championship title attempts at the Australian Rowing Championships. He coxed composite Queensland lightweight eights contesting the Australian lightweight eight championship in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008. In 2007 he was in the stern of the composite Queensland four which won the Australian coxed four national title.

It was discovered in 1978 by Takeo Saegusa and Yoshihiko Ito as a method to introduce Œ±-Œ≤ unsaturation in carbonyl compounds. The reaction as originally reported involved formation of a silyl enol ether followed by treatment with palladium(II) acetate and benzoquinone to yield the corresponding enone. The original publication noted its utility for regeneration of unsaturation following 1,4-addition with nucleophiles such as organocuprates. Saegusa-Ito oxidation For acyclic substrates the reaction yields the thermodynamic E-olefin product exclusively. Acyclic substrates This discovery was preceded nearly eight years earlier by a report that treatment of unactivated ketones with palladium acetate yielded the same products in low yields. The major improvement provided by Saegusa and Ito was the recognition that the enol form was the reactive species, developing a method based on silyl enol ethers. Benzoquinone is actually not a necessary component for this reaction; its role is to regenerate palladium(II) from its reduced form palladium(0), so that a smaller amount of expensive palladium(II) acetate is required at the beginning. The reaction conditions and purifications could be easily simplified by just using excess of palladium(II) acetate without benzoquinone, while at a much higher cost. Since the reaction typically employs near- stoichiometric amounts of palladium and is therefore often considered too expensive for industrial usage, some progress has been made in the development of catalytic variants. Despite this shortcoming, the Saegusa oxidation has been used in a number of syntheses as a mild, late-stage method for introduction of functionality in complex molecules. Mechanism The mechanism of the Saegusa‚ÄìIto oxidation involves coordination of palladium to the enol olefin followed by loss of the silyl group and formation of an oxoallyl-palladium complex. Œ≤-hydride elimination yields the palladium hydride enone complex which upon reductive elimination yields the product along with acetic acid and Pd0.Oxidation , Chem 215 lecture notes The reversibility of the elimination step allows equilibration, leading to the thermodynamic E-selectivity in acyclic substrates. It has been shown that the product can form a stable Pd0-olefin complex, which may be responsible for the difficulty with re-oxidation seen in catalytic variants of the reaction. Mechanism of Saegusa oxidation. Ligated acetate groups are omitted for clarity. Scope The wide applicability of the Saegusa‚ÄìIto oxidation is exemplified by its use in several classic syntheses of complex molecules. The synthesis of morphine by Tohru Fukuyama in 2006 is one such example, in which the transformation tolerates the presence of carbamate and ether substituents. Fukuyama Synthesis of Morphine Samuel J. Danishefsky's synthesis of both (+) and (-) peribysin began with a Saegusa‚ÄìIto oxidation of the Diels-Alder adduct of carvone and 3-trimethylsilyloxy-1,3-butadiene to yield the enone below. In this case the oxidation tolerated the presence of alkene and carbonyl moieties. Danishefsky synthesis of peribysin Yong Qiang Tu's synthesis of the Alzheimer's disease medication galantamine likewise used this reaction in the presence of an acid- sensitive acetal group. Tu synthesis of galantamine Larry E. Overman's synthesis of laurenyne utilizes a one-pot oxidation with pyridinium chlorochromate followed by a Saegusa oxidation, tolerating the presence of a halogen and a sulfonate. Overman synthesis of laurenyne The synthesis of sambutoxin reported by David Williams uses a novel Saegusa‚ÄìIto oxidation involving an unprotected enol moiety. The enone product cyclized in situ to regenerate the enol and form the tetrahydropyran ring. Subsequent deprotection of the methoxymethyl group furnished the natural product. Williams sambutoxin synthesis Variations The vast majority of improvements to this reaction have focused on rendering the transformation catalytic with respect to the palladium salt, primarily due to its high cost. The original conditions, though technically catalytic, still require 50 mol% of palladium(II) acetate, raising the cost to prohibitively high levels for large scale syntheses. The major advances in catalytic versions of this reaction have steered towards co- oxidants that regenerate the palladium(II) species effectively. Specifically, conditions using atmospheric oxygen as well as stoichiometric allylcarbonate have been developed. With respect to the former, the method developed by Larock in 1995 represents an environmentally and cost-attractive method as a catalytic substitute for the Saegusa‚ÄìIto oxidation. Catalytic Saegusa‚ÄìIto oxidation utilizing oxygen as a co-oxidant This method suffers from long reaction times and often produces significantly lower yields than the stoichiometric equivalent as showcased in the synthesis of platyphillide by Nishida. The contrast of the two methods highlights the catalytic method's shortcomings. Synthesis of platyphillide Catalytic variants employing stoichiometric diallylcarbonate and other allylic carbonates have also been developed, primarily by Jiro Tsuji. For these the choice of solvent is essential: nitrile solvents produce the desired enones while ethereal solvents produce Œ±-allylketones instead. Catalytic Saegusa‚ÄìIto oxidation using diallylcarbonate as a co-oxidant This latter method has enjoyed greater success as a synthetic tool, most notably in the Shibasaki total synthesis of the famous poison strychnine. Shibasaki synthesis of strychnine Despite these methods, much work remains to be done with regard to catalytic installation of Œ±-Œ≤ unsaturation.

The pipeline, running from Tabasco to Hidalgo, was owned by the Pemex petroleum company, and exploded after thieves from the Los Zetas drug cartel attempted to siphon off the oil. The gas explosion and resulting oil fire killed 29 people, including thirteen children, and injured 52. Some of the flames in the fire became ten metres high, and the smoke towered over the city. The blast also damaged 115 homes, completely destroying 32 of them, and prompted the evacuation of 5,000 residents. Firefighters eventually controlled the blaze, but electricity and water remained cut following the explosions, and the military was deployed to the site. Mexican President Felipe Calder√≥n visited the explosion site on the day of the incident to offer condolences to the victims' families. The fire was one of the deadliest in Mexican history, largely destroying an area of five-kilometre radius, and some oil may have polluted the Atoyac River. Background The Los Zetas gang, one of the most powerful drug cartels and paramilitary groups involved in the ongoing Mexican Drug War, was blamed for the explosion. Throughout 2010, drug-related conflicts had killed 12,456 people. In 2008, Pemex reported 9.3 billion pesos ($750 million USD) of oil lost to thieves. Previously, close to sixty illegal tapping incidents occurred near the explosion site due to thieves stealing the oil. Much of the stolen oil is often trafficked to the United States. Investigation Felipe Calder√≥n ordered an official investigation into the incident. A hole was found at the pipeline, and several bodies lay near the initial site of the explosion. The cause of the spark that led to the explosion is still unknown. The investigation is to include an assessment of the environmental impact of the explosion, including the pollution of downstream reservoirs. Mechanical failure was not ruled out as a possible cause of the oil leak despite evidence of theft and tampering of the pipeline. The pipeline was re-opened on December 22.

Although it is based on a story by Major Robert Glassburn, Major Alexander Chilton, and Herbert David Walter, the plot is essentially the same as West Point, produced at MGM in 1928. Dress Parade is preserved at the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive and the UCLA Film and Television Archive, and has been released on home video by Grapevine Video.

The story is the first in the Skinjacker trilogy that takes place in Everlost, the place between life and death. Summary Nick and Allie, who have just awoken in a ghostly parallel to the real world, are saved by a boy named Lief, who tells them that they are called \\"Afterlights\\" who cannot be seen by living. They are somewhat like ghosts, and retain the exact appearance they had when they died. He warns them of a dreaded and evil monster, the McGill, and Johnnie-O and the altar boys before they make their way to New York City. There, they meet Mary Hightower, the \\"mother\\" of Afterlights who keeps many Afterlights safe, and is the author of hundreds of books about living in Everlost. She lives with the children under her care in the destroyed World Trade Center, which exists because things that are much beloved in the world can cross into Everlost when they are destroyed. They settle down, but Allie is not content. Allie notices other Afterlights at the Twin Towers keep repeating and doing the same exact thing everyday, becoming stuck in ruts. Allie sets out with Nick and Lief to see whether he has special powers and they meet The Haunter. Allie gets Lief and Nick captured by The Haunter and learns that she can pick up living things and also possess living people, or \\"Skinjack\\". Allie explores her power while Nick begins to discover his own purpose. Allie is captured by the McGill, a grotesque monster who controls a ship full of Afterlights who fear him. The McGill has taken hundreds of Afterlights, including Nick and Lief prisoner. They are all hung by their ankles like pieces of meat. Since fortune cookies in Everlost always tells the truth, the McGill believes he can come back to life if he collects a thousand souls. Allie is able to manipulate the McGill and grow close to him as she attempts to save Nick and Lief. She makes him think that she can teach him to skinjack, even though only those who come to Everlost with the ability are able to. The real identity of the McGill is revealed - he is a boy name Mikey McGill, the younger brother of Mary Hightower (really Megan McGill). Mikey and Megan died at the same time and after they awoke as Afterlights they went to their home. There, Megan watched as Mikey sank into the earth. However, unbeknownst to her Mikey was able to claw his way out of the center of the Earth through pure force of will, but over time evolved into a hideous monster, reflective of his anger. Mary, also known by others as the Sky Witch, had been lying to the children. She stole the coins that all Afterlights invariably have when they wake up. The coins allow them to leave Everlost when they are ready, but Mary misguidedly believes that the light at the end of the tunnel is malicious and that children should stay in Everlost forever. Nick receives the nickname \\"Chocolate Ogre\\" because of the chocolate stain on his face, and Mary spreads rumors about how he sends Afterlights away by luring them in with the smell of chocolate. Allie outsmarts the McGill, who is unmasked by Mary and returned to the form of a human boy when Mary shows a picture of him. Allie, traveling home sinks through a bridge but is later saved by Mikey, who agrees to accompany her the rest of the way to her home.  Settings  The stories in the Everlost takes place in Everlost. Everlost is the place between life and death that all lost [children] end up after getting lost in their journey to the afterlife. These lost children, or Afterlights as they are called, are unseen by the real \\"living\\" world. The afterlights for the most part cannot interact with the real world and will sink to the Earth's core if they stay still. It is implied that this fate has befallen to a great many afterlights. They can interact with certain objects that are loved so much by their owners that, when the object breaks, it crosses over to Everlost, unbroken, and is given a place there for eternity. The same is for certain places that were destroyed (the twin towers are used as an example) that were loved and cherished by many people and will never be forgotten. There are no adults in Everlost presumably because they know where they are going In Everlost all fortunes are supposedly true, thus fortune cookies are extremely valuable.  Characters  * Allie Johnson \\"Allie the Outcast\\": Allie is a 14-year-old girl who ends up in Everlost after the car she is riding in, crashes head-on on a highway with the packed black Mercedes that Nick was in. Allie is brave and \\"goal\\" orientated though not a planner. She was reborn nine months later in \\"Everlost\\" as an Afterlight. Allie discovers that she has the gifted ability to \\"possess\\" (or \\"skinjack\\" as it is called in the book) people. She tries to return home to meet her parents in order to put her troubled mind at ease. However, on the way, she and Nick encounter many adventures. * Nick: He is 14 years old. A half-Japanese boy who is more of a follower, not a leader. He was riding in a packed black Mercedes on the way to a wedding when he died with chocolate on his face; now he is stuck in formal clothes and a chocolate covered mouth for eternity. He is initially enamored by Mary, but realizes that she is harming Afterlights and must be stopped. * Megan \\"Mary Hightower\\" McGill: A 15-year-old self- proclaimed expert on Everlost. She has written many books on living in the world between life and death, and encourages Afterlights to accept Everlost and stop moving on. She also thinks of herself as the mother of the many children stuck in this world, being one of the oldest inhabitants at fifteen. She will do anything to keep the \\"lost\\" Afterlights in Everlost. * Michael Edward McGill, \\"The McGill\\" or \\"Mikey\\": The 14-year-old brother of Megan McGill. After escaping the earth's core by becoming a monster, he encounters a ghost ship where he spends nearly 30 years looting and \\"kidnapping\\" Afterlights after believing a fortune in a chinese fortune cookie that in exchange for 1000 souls, he can return to the land of the living. * Travis, alias \\"Lief\\": An 11-year-old boy Allie and Nick had found in the crossed-over forest that had burned down years ago. He follows them throughout the novel, until he reaches a state of peace and leaves Everlost through a coin. Before he leaves it is discovered that his real name was Travis. This is how Nick realizes the coins have the power to help any Afterlight \\"to get where they're going\\".  Sequel  The novel Everwild was published in 2010. It follows Allie's return home to her parents in order to put her restless mind at ease. Allie is accompanied by the reformed Mikey, the fearful monster \\"The McGill\\" who has been terrorizing Everlost for 30 years. Everwild also follows Nick's quest to save all new afterlights from Mary Hightower, who plans to recruit the new afterlights into her army and keep them in Everlost for eternity. The third and final book in the trilogy is Everfound, published in 2011. It concludes the series and ultimately describes the fate of all the main characters. The war continues and Nick is reborn. They have to stop Mary now for she could be the one to extinguish the living world. A new character also appears and the quest to go West continues with Milos.

The aperture is large, ovate, glossy white inside with the pattern visible in banded specimens. Apertural margins are converging. The aperture is 1.30 times as long as wide, 0.70 times the total height. The peristome is broadly expanded and backwardly reflexed, glossy whitish. Columellar margin is straight, broadly expanded and merging into the rather thick parietal callus. The height of the shell is 36.7‚Äì41.1 mm. The width of the shell is 21.9‚Äì36.2 mm. The shell has 6‚Äì6.5 mm. Dimensions of the holotype are as follows: The height of the holotype is 41.1 mm. The width of the shell is 26.2 mm. The height of the aperture is 22.6 mm. The width of the aperture is 17.9 mm. The height of the last whorl is 29.6 mm. The shell has 6.3 whorls. Type material: apertural and abapertural views of two shells of Scutalus mariopenai showing its color variability: { Holotype Paratype } A pale-grey specimen with a dark-greyish band along the foot. Living animal is whitish- to pale-grey, with a dark-greyish band along the foot. Tentacles are dark-grey near the eye-tips, lighter at the base. This species is closely allied to Scutalus ortizpuentei Weyrauch, 1967 which was described from Dept. Cajamarca, R√≠o Chancay valley, between Chiclayo and Chota, 80 km north of Quinden (ca. 06¬∞38‚ÄôS 079¬∞05‚ÄôW) in Peru. It differs from this species by being smaller (41 vs. 48 mm shell height), having a smaller aperture, and the lip more broadly expanded. The faintly visible subdivision of the spiral bands around the periphery, visible in some specimens of Scutalus mariopenai, resembles the more pronounced colour pattern in Scutalus ortizpuentei. It may also be compared to Scutalus cretaceus (Pfeiffer, 1855) from which it differs by being less elongate, having a stronger sculpture on the last whorl, having the inside of the aperture whitish coloured; having the lip more broadly expanded.

Tyler is the identical twin of hockey player Justin Donati, only older than Justin by 7 minutes. Though neither brother has been drafted, both attended the Detroit Red Wings rookie camp in 2006. Playing career On January 8, 2005 Tyler, along with brother Justin Donati, was acquired from the Oshawa Generals to the Toronto St. Michael's Majors for Cal Clutterbuck. Tyler played alongside of Justin on the Toronto St. Michael's Majors of the OHL, but this was ended when Tyler was traded to the Belleville Bulls. Tyler and his brother both attended the Detroit Red Wings rookie camp as non-draft invitees in August/September 2006 and played well, both producing points regularly throughout the tournament games. His 2010-11 season with the Elmira Jackals was cut short after being side-lined due to shoulder surgery. On May 23, 2012, Donati left for Europe to join V√•lerenga Ishockey of the GET-ligaen in Oslo, Norway. After two seasons abroad, Donati returned to his home province of Ontario, in signing a one-year deal with the Brampton Beast of the ECHL on September 15, 2014. Personal information Tyler and his brother Justin are actively involved in the \\"points for Cancer\\" fund, with money for each point either Donati scores being matched by their respective hockey clubs going to research to find a cure for ovarian cancer. They joined this organization because their mother Corinne was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2003. Despite their mother dying in July 2006, the brothers continue \\"points for Cancer\\" fundraising in her name.

This same task is #P-complete for general graphs. Counting the number of matchings, even for planar graphs, is also #P-complete. The key idea is to convert the problem into a Pfaffian computation of a skew-symmetric matrix derived from a planar embedding of the graph. The Pfaffian of this matrix is then computed efficiently using standard determinant algorithms. History The problem of counting planar perfect matchings has its roots in statistical mechanics and chemistry, where the original question was: If diatomic molecules are adsorbed on a surface, forming a single layer, how many ways can they be arranged? The partition function is an important quantity that encodes the statistical properties of a system at equilibrium and can be used to answer the previous question. However, trying to compute the partition function from its definition is not practical. Thus to exactly solve a physical system is to find an alternate form of the partition function for that particular physical system that is sufficiently simple to calculate exactly. In the early 1960s, the definition of exactly solvable was not rigorous. Computer science provided a rigorous definition with the introduction of polynomial time, which dates to 1965. Similarly, the notation of not exactly solvable should correspond to #P-hardness, which was defined in 1979. Another type of physical system to consider is composed of dimers, which is a polymer with two atoms. The dimer model counts the number of dimer coverings of a graph. Another physical system to consider is the bonding of H2O molecules in the form of ice. This can be modelled as a directed, 3-regular graph where the orientation of the edges at each vertex cannot all be the same. How many edge orientations does this model have? Motivated by physical systems involving dimers, in 1961, Kasteleyn and Temperley and Fisher independently found the number of domino tilings for the m-by-n rectangle. This is equivalent to counting the number of perfect matchings for the m-by-n lattice graph. By 1967, Kasteleyn had generalized this result to all planar graphs.  Algorithm  = Explanation = The main insight is that every non-zero term in the Pfaffian of the adjacency matrix of a graph G corresponds to a perfect matching. Thus, if one can find an orientation of G to align all signs of the terms in Pfaffian (no matter + or - ), then the absolute value of the Pfaffian is just the number of perfect matchings in G. The FKT algorithm does such a task for a planar graph G. The orientation it finds is called a Pfaffian orientation. Let G = (V, E) be an undirected graph with adjacency matrix A. Define PM(n) to be the set of partitions of n elements into pairs, then the number of perfecting matchings in G is :operatorname{PerfMatch}(G) = sum_{M in PM(V)} prod_{(i,j) in M} A_{i j}. Closely related to this is the Pfaffian for an n by n matrix A :operatorname{pf}(A) = sum_{M in PM(n)} operatorname{sgn}(M) prod_{(i,j) in M} A_{i j}, where sgn(M) is the sign of the permutation M. A Pfaffian orientation of G is a directed graph H with (1, ‚àí1, 0)-adjacency matrix B such that pf(B) = PerfMatch(G). In 1967, Kasteleyn proved that planar graphs have an efficiently computable Pfaffian orientation. Specifically, for a planar graph G, let H be a directed version of G where an odd number of edges are oriented clockwise for every face in a planar embedding of G. Then H is a Pfaffian orientation of G. Finally, for any skew-symmetric matrix A, :operatorname{pf}(A)^2 = det(A), where det(A) is the determinant of A. This result is due to Cayley. Since determinants are efficiently computable, so is PerfMatch(G). =High-level description= An example showing how the FKT algorithm finds a Pfaffian orientation. # Compute a planar embedding of G. # Compute a spanning tree T1 of the input graph G. # Give an arbitrary orientation to each edge in G that is also in T1. # Use the planar embedding to create an (undirected) graph T2 with the same vertex set as the dual graph of G. # Create an edge in T2 between two vertices if their corresponding faces in G share an edge in G that is not in T1. (Note that T2 is a tree.) # For each leaf v in T2 (that is not also the root): ## Let e be the lone edge of G in the face corresponding to v that does not yet have an orientation. ## Give e an orientation such that the number of edges oriented clock-wise is odd. ## Remove v from T2. # Return the absolute value of the Pfaffian of the (1, ‚àí1, 0)-adjacency matrix of G, which is the square root of the determinant. Generalizations The sum of weighted perfect matchings can also be computed by using the Tutte matrix for the adjacency matrix in the last step. Kuratowski's theorem states that : a finite graph is planar if and only if it contains no subgraph homeomorphic to K5 (complete graph on five vertices) or K3,3 (complete bipartite graph on two partitions of size three). Vijay Vazirani generalized the FKT algorithm to graphs that do not contain a subgraph homeomorphic to K3,3. Since counting the number of perfect matchings in a general graph is #P-complete, some restriction on the input graph is required unless FP, the function version of P, is equal to #P. Counting matchings, which is known as the Hosoya index, is also #P-complete even for planar graphs.. Applications The FKT algorithm has seen extensive use in holographic algorithms on planar graphs via matchgates. For example, consider the planar version of the ice model mentioned above, which has the technical name #PL-3-NAE-SAT (where NAE stands for \\"not all equal\\"). Valiant found a polynomial time algorithm for this problem which uses matchgates.

The volcanic field covers an area of 1500 km2, overlying Precambrian metamorphic and plutonic rocks of the Tuareg shield. Many cones are breached, and the dominantly basaltic and basanitic volcanic products are rich in peridotite and pyroxenite xenoliths and megacrysts. The youngest volcanoes rest on Neolithic terraces and are of Holocene age. The Tuareg Shield is a geological formation lying between the West African craton and the Saharan Metacraton in West Africa. Named after the Tuareg people, it has complex a geology, reflecting the collision between these cratons and later events. The landmass covers parts of Algeria, Niger and Mali. Origins The Tuareg Shield is mainly composed of Archean or Paleoproterozoic terranes and Neoproterozoic terranes that amalgamated during the Pan African orogeny when the West African craton and the Saharan metacraton converged. The shield originated in oceanic island arcs that formed on the cratons during 900 Ma to 680 Ma, of which relics remain as thrust sheets on top of more rigid bodies. In Mali, the Tilemsi belt is a complex of intraoceanic arcs that formed above a subduction zone sloping down to the east and were accreted to the shield during the Pan-African orogeny. The western part of the Hoggar Mountains (Ahaggar Mountains) is made of material from the Pharusian Ocean. This comprises oceanic basalts, arc volcanic and sedimentary rocks and sediments, which were shed into the Pharusian Ocean by the West African craton and the eastern Hoggar. Fracturing During the oblique collision of the West African craton with the Saharan metacraton the shield was torn into separate but rigid moving blocks. These blocks were separated by subvertical shear zones. The fractured shield was penetrated by volcanic magmas that formed the Hoggar Mountains in Algeria, Adrar des Ifoghas in Mali and A√Ør Mountains in Niger. The Trans-Saharan orogenic belt which lies along the eastern margin of the West African craton is generally thought to have been caused by the collision between that craton and the Tuareg shield. Later events At the start of the Phanerozoic the shield was eroded and covered by Ordovician sandstones. More recently, around 95 Ma - 90 Ma, the area was partly submerged by a seaway linking the Mediterranean and the proto- Atlantic. Since then, starting around 30 Ma the area rose by as much as 3000 meters. Volcanic activity started around 35 Ma - 30 Ma, and continues sporadically to this day. The higher areas consist of the uplifted Precambrian basement overlaid with volcanic rocks.

Physical mesomechanics and computer engineering design of materials (rus) Deep mesomechanics ideas can be successfully used in the new approach to earthquake prediction where the seismic source mesostructure appears to be an intermediate term precursor.Goldin S.

For example, an axiom with six NAND operations and three variables is equivalent to Boolean algebra: : ((amid b)mid c) mid (amid((amid c)mid a)) = c where the vertical bar represents the NAND logical operation (also known as the Sheffer stroke). Stephen Wolfram, and separately, a group of researchers including William McCune, Branden Fitelson, and Larry Wos, identified this axiom by testing 25 candidate axioms, the set of Sheffer identities of length less or equal to 15 elements (excluding mirror images) that have no noncommutative models with four or fewer variables. MathWorld, a site associated with Wolfram, has named the axiom the \\"Wolfram axiom\\". McCune et al. also found a longer single axiom for Boolean algebra based on disjunction and negation. In 1933, Edward Vermilye Huntington identified the axiom :{ eg({ eg x} lor {y})} lor { eg({ eg x} lor { eg y})} = x as being equivalent to Boolean algebra, when combined with the commutativity of the OR operation, x lor y = y lor x, and the assumption of associativity, (x lor y) lor z = x lor (y lor z). Herbert Robbins conjectured that Huntington's axiom could be replaced by : eg( eg(x lor y) lor eg(x lor { eg y})) = x, which requires one fewer use of the logical negation operator eg. Neither Robbins nor Huntington could prove this conjecture; nor could Alfred Tarski, who took considerable interest in it later. The conjecture was eventually proved in 1996 with the aid of theorem-proving software. For errata, see This proof established that the Robbins axiom, together with associativity and commutativity, form a 3-basis for Boolean algebra. The existence of a 2-basis was established in 1967 by Carew Arthur Meredith: : eg({ eg x} lor y) lor x = x, : eg({ eg x} lor { eg y}) lor (z lor y) = y lor (z lor x). The following year, Meredith found a 2-basis in terms of the Sheffer stroke: :(xmid x) mid (ymid x) = x, :x(ymid(xmid z)) = ((zmid y)mid y)mid x. In 1973, Padmanabhan and Quackenbush demonstrated a method that, in principle, would yield a 1-basis for Boolean algebra. Applying this method in a straightforward manner yielded \\"axioms of enormous length\\", thereby prompting the question of how shorter axioms might be found. This search yielded the 1-basis in terms of the Sheffer stroke given above, as well as the 1-basis : eg( eg( eg(x lor y) lor z) lor eg(x lor eg( eg z lor eg(z lor u)))) = z, which is written in terms of OR and NOT.

She is particularly known for incorporating indigenous Filipino instruments into orchestral productions. Biography Lucrecia ‚ÄúKing‚Äù Roces Kasilag was born in San Fernando, La Union, Philippines, the third of the six children of Marcial Kasilag, Sr., a civil engineer, and his wife Asuncion Roces Ganancial, a violinist and a violin teacher. She was Kasilag's first solfeggio teacher. The second was Do√±a Concha Cuervo, who was a strict Spanish woman. Kasilag later studied under Do√±a Pura Villanueva, during which time performed her first public piece, Felix Mendelssohn's May Breezes, at a student recital when she was ten years old. Kasilag grew up in Paco, Manila, where she was educated at Paco Elementary School and graduated valedictorian in 1930. She then transferred to Philippine Women's University for high school, where in 1933 she also graduated as valedictorian. For college, she graduated cum laude in 1936 with a Bachelor of Arts, majoring in English, in the same university. She also studied music at St. Scholastica‚Äôs College in Malate, Manila, with Sister Baptista Battig, graduating with a Music Teacher's Diploma, major in piano, in 1939. During World War II, she took up composition, and on 1 December 1945, she performed her own compositions in a concert at Philippine Women's University. From 1946 to 1947, Kasilag taught at the University of the Philippines‚Äô Conservatory of Music and worked as secretary-registrar at Philippines Women's University. She completed a Bachelor of Music in 1949, and then attended the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, studying theory with Allen I. McHose and composition with Wayne Barlow. Kasilag returned to the Philippines, and in 1953 she was appointed Dean of the Philippines Women's University College of Music and Fine Arts. After completing her studies, Kasilag made an international tour as a concert pianist, but eventually had to give up a performing career due to a congenital weakness in one hand. Kasilag was instrumental in developing Philippine music and culture. She founded the Bayanihan Folks Arts Center for research and theatrical presentations, and was closely involved with the Bayanihan Philippine Dance Company. She was also a former president of the Cultural Center of the Philippines, head of the Asian Composers League, Chairperson of the Philippine Society for Music Education, and was one of the pioneers of the Bayanihan Dance Company. She is credited for having written more than 350 musical compositions, ranging from folksongs to opera to orchestral works, and was composing up to the year before she died, at age 89. Lucrecia Roces Kasilag died due to pneumonia on August 16, 2008 in Manila, Philippines.

The film is packaged with a boxset of music from the American rock band The Maine, and is sold exclusively on iTunes. Plot The film is a tale about a small band of contumacious boys and girls that live in a hidden village on a faraway beach; they are the Ivory Rebellion, a feral group of children that are fighting from oppression against an evil queen named Johanna, and her ruthless Onyx Empire. Like Peter Pan & The Lost Boys, the rebels have shunned society and live completely free of parents and authority figures. Their existence, albeit a simple one, is entirely devoid of technology, minus simple firearms and an ancient tube radio. Surrounding their beach is a border, the land across from which is forbidden and belongs to the Onyx Empire. For the longest time a treaty was set forth, stating that no one from either side shall cross said border, but in a last-ditch effort to induct the boys and girls of the Ivory Rebellion, Queen Johanna has halted all supply shipments into their village. The rebels are running low on food, and with the threat of starvation, are forced to make a decision that could cost them everything.

Ubeydullah demanded recognition from Ottoman Empire and Qajar dynasty authorities for an independent Kurdish state, or Kurdistan, which he would govern without interference from Ottoman or Qajar authorities.Ozoglu, Hakan. Kurdish Notables and the Ottoman State: Evolving Identities, Competing Loyalties, and Shifting Boundaries. Feb 2004. . pp. 74-75. He was a Sayyid, a descendant of Prophet Muhammad. He claimed descent from Shaykh Abdul Qadir Gilani. Sheikh Ubeydullah was an influential landowner in the 19th century and a member of the powerful Kurdish ≈ûemdinan family from Nehri. He was the son of Sheikh Taha and a nephew to Sheikh Salih, from whom he inherited the leadership of the Naqshbandi order in ≈ûemdinan. After his rebellion was suppressed, he was exiled first to Istanbul, then to Hijaz where he died. Map over uprising, 1880 Rise to power The emergence of Islamic scholars and leaders, or Sheikhs, as national leaders among the Kurds was the result of the elimination of hereditary semi-autonomous Kurdish principalities in the Ottoman Empire, especially following the Ottoman centralization policies of the early 19th century.Jwaideh, Wadie. The Kurdish national movement: its origins and development. Syracuse University Press, 2006. pp. 75-79. Sheikh Ubeydullah was one of several religious leaders who were there to fill the void and reestablish a sense of lawfulness in the former principalities that had been since left to feuding chieftains. Despite previous revolts by Kurdish leaders to reassert control over territories, mainly their own former principalities, Sheikh Ubeydullah is regarded as the first Kurdish leader whose cause was nationalist and who wished to establish an ethnic Kurdish state.The Emergence of Kurdish Nationalism and the Sheikh Said Rebellion, 1880-1925 University of Texas Press, 1989. pp. 1-7. Sheikh Ubeydullah was from an already powerful family, the ≈ûemdinan from the region of the same name - ≈ûemdinan - who owned considerable amounts of land in the Kurdish areas of the Ottoman Empire. Following the outbreak of the Russo- Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878), Ubeydullah filled the political vacuum left by the devastation in the region and assumed the Kurdish leadership role and he and his followers defended the Ottomans against the Russians. Personality and Kurdish nationalism In a clear indication of Kurdish nationalist intentions, Ubeydullah wrote in a letter to a Christian missionary in the region: \\"The Kurdish nation, consisting of more than 500,000 families is a people apart. Their religion is different, and their laws and customs distinct... We are also a nation apart. We want our affairs to be in our hands, so that in the punishment of our own offenders we may be strong and independent, and have privileges like other nations... This is our objective... Otherwise, the whole of Kurdistan will take matter into their own hands, as they are unable to put up with these continual evil deeds and the oppression, which they suffer at the hands of the Persian and Ottoman governments.\\" Ubeydullah was able to gain the military support of Kurdish tribesmen as well as Nestorian Christians from the Hakkari region. A letter written by a Christian missionary who was in constant contact with Ubeydullah noted, \\"The Shaykh wrote in his paper a great deal about the Nestorian Christians there, praising them as the best subjects of the Sultan. The Sultan objected to such language, and three times returned the letter for correction. Finally, the Shaykh said, \\"I don't know much about politics, but I do know something about truth telling, and this is the truth.\\" Expeditions and subsequent fall Kurdish tribesmen, 1873. Sheikh Ubeydullah was able to successfully assert his control over the area by gaining the support of Kurdish tribesmen who were hopeful of his objective to restore order in the war-ravaged region. British correspondence during the height of Ubeydullah's power indicates that he was able to successful assert control over a vast region that stretched the former Bohtan, Badinan, Hakkari, and Ardalan confederacies. A late nineteenth century writer, George Curzon, wrote, \\"A chieftain named Shaykh Obeidallah acquired a great reputation for personal sanctity...and gradually came to be looked upon as the head of Kurdish nationality.\\" In 1880, Ubeydullah's militia invaded the northwestern Kurdish territories of Qajar dynasty in attempt to expand his control. Ubeydullah demanded recognition of a Kurdistan state and his rule over the region. His militia was defeated by the Qajar army and he withdrew his forces to Ottoman territories. Facing attacks from both sides of his territory, Ubeydullah eventually surrendered to Ottoman authorities in 1881 and brought to Istanbul. From there he escaped and returned to Nehri for some time. But he was re- arrested by the Ottoman Empire and sent into exile to Hijaz, in present day Saudi Arabia. He passed away in Mecca in 1883.

Benefactions As a Baptist and a Calvinist, Hollis required his donations to be used for directed purposes. For example, in 1721, he established the Hollis Chair of Divinity at Harvard, with a salary of ¬£80 per year, with the stipulation that Baptists be included for consideration. This broadening constituted a form of dissent from strict adherence to the orthodoxy of the day, where New England's reform Protestantism was being buffeted by ripples and uncertainties generated by the Glorious Revolution of 1688/9.

He was also the chairman of the Manchester and Liverpool District Bank, and a director of the London and North Western Railway and the Atlas Insurance Company. He was High Sheriff of Lancashire in 1906‚Äì7. Broadhurst was born in Broughton, near Manchester. He was the second son of Henry Tootal Broadhurst. Some relations, such as Charles Edward Broadhurst, emigrated to Australia. He was educated at Eagle House School in Wimbledon, and then at Winchester College. He started to work at the family cotton business in 1876. He married Charlotte Jane Ashton in 1887; her father was also a cotton manufacturer, Thomas Ashton; her brother was Thomas Gair Ashton, 1st Baron Ashton of Hyde. Broadhurst's father and grandfather were both cotton manufacturers. His father joined forces with Henry Lee and Joseph Lee and Robert Scott to form a partnership that became Tootal, Broadhurst Lee Limited, which integrated cotton spinning and power loom weaving. It was the third largest vertically integrated cotton business in Lancashire, with around 5,000 employees in 1887. Its mills included Sunnyside Mill in Bolton, and Ten Acres Mill and Hemming Works near Manchester. Broadhurst's main responsibility in the company was on the finance committee of which he became chair in 1900; in 1907 he became company chairman. Broadhurst lived in the Manor House at North Rode near Congleton, and lived the lifestyle of a country gentleman, spending August and September of each year at his grouse moor in Scotland. For the rest of the year he was a dedicated businessman, though he took extended periods of leave because of nervous illness in 1910, 1912 and 1916. Broadhurst was president of the Prestwich Conservative Association, but unlike many other Conservatives, who favoured tariffs to protect the domestic markets of British businesses, he was in favour of free trade. In early 1906, he crossed party lines to support Winston Churchill, the successful Liberal candidate for Manchester North West. Broadhurst also supported Churchill at a by-election in 1908, required after Churchill was appointed as President of the Board of Trade. The seat was won by the Conservative candidate William Joynson-Hicks, who described Broadhurst as a \\"Mugwump Millionaire\\". Broadhurst joined the committee that organised the recruitment of the Manchester Pals battalions in the First World War, raising funds towards the cost of uniforms and equipment, and joined the Cotton Control Board in 1917. He was also involved in good works, as a governor of the Whitworth Institute, chairman of the Manchester and Salford Lifeboat Fund, and a member of the council of Manchester University. In March 1906, Broadhurst was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Lancashire. Broadhurst donated land in Moston to Manchester Corporation in 1920, as an offering of thanks to the men and women of Manchester for the work they had done in the First World War, the location becoming known as Broadhurst Park.Friends of Broadhurst ‚Äì history 2Broadhurst Clough ‚Äì The Journey so Far, Manchester City Council The football ground of F.C. United of Manchester was built in the area in 2015, also called Broadhurst Park. Broadhurst was created a baronet, largely for his local war work, on 4 February 1918. The baronetcy became extinct upon his death as he and his wife had no children. He left an estate of ¬£149, 903.

She was the author of Secret History; or, The Horrors of St. Domingo, in a Series of Letters Written by a Lady at Cape Francois to Col. Burr, late Vice-President of the United States, Principally During the Command of General Rochambeau (Philadelphia, 1808) and Laura (Philadelphia, 1809), and possibly three other novels: Zelica: The Creole (London, 1820); The Scarlet Handkerchief (London, 1823); and The Stranger in Mexico (not extant). Biography She was born Honora Davern in Philadelphia on December 11, 1773 to Rosa and William Davern, the latter of whom died at sea a few weeks after her birth, probably in January 1774. On Valentine's Day 1779, her mother married a Philadelphia innkeeper named William Hassel (sometimes Hassal); Sansay's stepfather maintained Hassal's Tavern (or The Half Moon ‚Äî a generic name for an English pub), which was located across from the State House (Independence Hall), where local politicians and members of Congress often met informally. Rosa and William Hassel had two children of their own, Sansay's half-siblings, Mary (born November 12, 1781) and William (born December 24, 1784). Incidentally, it was Mary who has often been mistakenly credited with the authorship of Secret History and Laura (the mistake derives from the name of the author-character of Secret History, also named Mary). (For Leonora's and siblings' birth dates, Rosa & Hassel's marriage, and other early biographical details, see Jennifer Van Bergen, Reconstructing Leonora Sansay.Jennifer van Bergen.\\"Reconstructing Leonora Sansay - Another World Is Possible\\", January 3, 2010.) At some point in the mid- to late 1790s (she shows up in the Philadelphia City Directory for 1796 as \\"Eleonora Hassel, Gentlewoman\\"), Sansay met Aaron Burr, who became her confidant and patron. (Sansay stated that she met him after the death of her fianc√©, who had left a letter leaving her and their unborn child \\"to his protection.\\"Laura [Drexler, ed.] 216. While there are scattered references in Secret History to Leonora's son, it is unknown what became of her child, if indeed she did have one.) Some scholars believe Burr and Sansay were lovers, but this is contested by Van Bergen. Burr continued to play an important role in Sansay's life until she disappeared from the historical record. Leonora writes in Secret History that Burr convinced her to marry Louis Sansay (St. Louis), then a New York merchant having fled his plantation in Saint-Domingue (now Ha√Øti), a French colony subject to a massive slave uprising that would ultimately end with the declaration of Haitian Independence in 1804. In early 1802, Louis Sansay made plans to return to Haiti to reclaim his property. He sent Leonora to visit Burr in Washington to obtain letters of recommendation and a passport for Louis.Louis Sansay to Aaron Burr, March 22, 1802 (NY Hist. Society - NHi:2042.) Corroborating the purpose of Leonora's visit, Burr also wrote to his cousin, Pierpont Edwards: Louis Sansay wrote Burr several letters during the time Leonora stayed in Washington with Burr. In these letters, Louis asked that, \\"considering the affection and the attachment that you always have attested for [Leonora]\\", Burr would \\"employ yourself for us ... to obtain for me at the expense of the French government my passage [to Haiti] and that of my wife, my daughter and of my two servants by making him see that I am without means.\\"Louis Sansay to Aaron Burr, March 22, 1802 (NY Hist. Society - NHi:2042.) Louis thanked Burr for \\"all the kindnesses that you were willing to show for her and for me\\" and informed Burr that he was taking Leonora with him to Haiti (despite the dangers there), that he hoped Burr would urge her to return to New York as soon as possible to set sail with Louis, \\"as it is impossible for me to be happy without her possession very near.\\"Louis Sansay to Aaron Burr, March 29, 1802 (NY Hist. Society - NHi:2042.) Each subsequent letter after Louis' first one manifested increasing anxiety on his part about Leonora. Finally, on April 2, Louis wrote Burr with \\"horrible anxiety\\" about Leonora, saying it had been nine days and he had received only one letter from her, claiming he feared she was ill, but contradicting himself by charging her with \\"flightineses and fickleness\\" and claiming \\"I tremble that her intention is to abandon me.\\" Declaring he would \\"sacrifice even my life rather than to see her in the possession of another,\\" Louis begged Burr \\"to reassure my heart, which is broken with pain,\\" \\"to urge her to come back as promptly as possible.\\" Trying to convince Burr that he only had \\"her happiness and mine\\" at heart, Louis promised to bestow $12,000 dollars upon her (even though in his 3/22 letter, he had stated that \\"after all the misfortunes that I endured, sir, recently and my resources being almost exhausted\\") if Burr could manage to get her to go to Haiti with him.LS to AB, April 2, 1802, NHi:2042. Translations of Louis Sansay's letters from original French by Denis Olivier, New York. Leonora returned to Louis and the couple embarked for Haiti in late May or early June.See Mary-Jo Kline, Political Correspondence & Public Papers of Aaron Burr,(1983), 2:703n2. From Haiti, Sansay continued corresponding with Burr; these letters form the basis for Sansay's first book, Secret History. They describe the final days of French rule on the island. After departing Haiti, Leonora and Louis lived for a time in Cuba.See Matthew L. Davis, Memoirs of Aaron Burr, 2:326. But when his \\"intolerable and groundless jealousy\\" grew to the point where \\"[i]n every man that approached me he saw a rival\\" and when he \\"came home [one night] in a transport of fury, dragged me from my bed, said it was his intention to destroy me, and swore that he would render me horrible by rubbing aqua-fortis [nitric acid] in my face,\\" Leonora left him, escaping in the dark of night to a remote village 12 miles away.See Secret History (1808, 1971) pp. 186‚Äì90; (2007) [Drexler, ed.], pp. 138‚Äì39. Eventually Sansay made her way to Jamaica and back to Philadelphia. She next played a part in Burr's alleged 1806‚Äì07 conspiracy, for which he was indicted (and acquitted) for high misdemeanor and treason in 1807. Sansay appears in a March 1, 1808 news item in The Richmond Enquirer under one of her pseudonyms, Madame D'Auvergne, an apparent francisation of her birth name (Davern). (See Thomas Abernethy, Burr Conspiracy (1954), p. 270 - Robert T. Spence testified he had sailed from Philadelphia to New Orleans \\"with Bollman, Alexander, and a Madame D'Auvergne, alias Nora Haskel\\"].

(New Haven, 1987), 2:259 - He wrote to Lewis DeMun in New Orleans: \\"If you see M. D'Avergne [sic], say every thing that the sincerest respect would prompt.\\") After the Burr trial, Sansay returned again to Philadelphia and wrote and published Secret History; or, The Horrors of St. Domingo, in a Series of Letters Written by a Lady at Cape Francois to Col. Burr, late Vice-President of the United States, Principally During the Command of General Rochambeau. The following year, Sansay's Laura appeared in print from the same press, Bradford & Inskeep. She set up a flower manufacturing business with the help of Eric Bollman.See \\"Mrs. L****** [Phila.] to Burr, July 29, 1812, in Matthew L.

Two other novels may be attributed to Sansay: Zelica, the Creole (1820) and The Scarlet Handkerchief (1823). Both were published in London, but indicate that they were transmitted from America. The flyleaf for \\"Zelica, the Crole\\" advertises the author's other works as follows: \\"In the press, by the same author, The Scarlet Handkerchief, 3 vols. The Stranger in Mexico, 3 vols.

The third novel, A Stranger in Mexico, is promoted, though no copies have been found. It is unknown why or when Sansay traveled to England, but she appears to have died there. Her interment on November 12, 1821 in the Parish of Newent, County of Gloucester is recorded in the Church of England Burials.

Five of her sixteen books have been national bestsellers, and she has sold more than two million copies of her books. Early life She was born Susan Kennedy. At age ten, she became friends with an 80-year-old neighbor, Mr. Boggs. When Mr. Boggs went to the hospital with a serious illness, he credited young Susan for helping him recover with the homemade cards and letters she sent every day for a month. No one else, he said, had visited or called during his illness. The experience inspired Kennedy to spend her life in some similar work. Professional life In 1982, at age 28, Kennedy moved to San Francisco with $30. She had \\"opted out of the money system\\" two years earlier. She earned enough money from her artwork to buy a building, the home and work space which she called her \\"magic cottage.' In 1989 she created a poster, How to be an Artist. In an interview SARK said, ‚ÄúThe only reason why my poster ‚ÄòHow to Be an Artist‚Äô ever became known and went on to sell two-and-a-half million copies was because of my cat, Jupiter, who would get up on his tiny legs and peel this poster off the wall. It would land on the floor and wake me up in the morning. For five days this went on, and finally I said, ‚ÄòWell, maybe I‚Äôm supposed to do something with this thing.‚Äô‚Äù She then offered it for sale in the catalog of a local metaphysical store. The poster quickly became popular, selling more than 1000 copies within a week. The sudden popularity created a difficulty for Kennedy, because the posters were produced by hand and she lacked facilities for mass production. She completed the posters by devising a system for producing them, and using space in a garage without permission, hiding the posters under a tarp when she heard the owners approaching. The poster's success led a publishing company to contact Kennedy, who soon published her first book, A Creative Companion, which she wrote in two weeks. In 1993, SARK created Camp SARK, LLC, a company which created products inspired by her artwork. The company's sales were strong, but it failed to return on investments, and SARK relaunched it as Planet SARK in 2003, focusing the company on publishing, events, and online commerce. The new company was more successful than its predecessor.

The Vicus Jugarius was very old‚Äîperhaps even older than Rome itself. The Latin word jugarius can mean either \\"yoke\\" or \\"ridge\\". The Vicus Jugarius entered the Forum from the southwest, along the shoulder of the Capitoline Hill and between the Temple of Saturn and the Basilica Julia near Servilius‚Äô Pool. The Arch of Tiberius (now vanished) was built for the street to pass through here. Its other end, in the southern Campus Martius, was near the Forum Holitorium. This was the extent of the street in late Republican and Imperial times, but in former days, it was much longer, extending as far as the Quirinal Hill and representing a part of the original trade route to the Tiber River. Its ancient name may actually have originally signified a ‚Äúhigh-road‚Äô, rather than the later sense of ‚Äúyoke‚Äù; something like \\"the Road along the [Capitoline] Ridge\\". A spot on the road known as the Equimaelium perhaps recorded the leveling of the home of Spurius Maelius.  Etymology  Latin words associated with jugarius include jugalis (\\"yoked together\\") and jugo (\\"to marry\\" or \\"join\\"). Some words deriving from this Latin root are (in English): \\"yoke\\", \\"join\\", \\"juncture\\", \\"conjugal\\" and even \\"yoga\\" (from the Sanskrit root yuj, meaning \\"to yoke\\" or \\"to unite\\"). Juga, or Jugalis, is an epithet of the goddess Juno in her aspect as marriage goddess (she was believed to join a couple in matrimony). As Juno Juga‚ÄîJuno of the Yoke of Holy Matrimony‚Äîshe had an altar on the Vicus Jugarius (exact location unknown). Although it was believed by the ancients that this gave its name to the street, in reality, it was probably the other way around.

The theatre was originally built in 1887 by Dolph Levino before it was rebuilt in 1896 by the renowned theatre architech Frank Matcham. The new building suffered an extensive fire in 1899 and was rebuilt again by the following year. Rebuilt as a cinema in 1937, it closed in 1961 and was subsequently demolished in 1962. History =Original theatre= On 9 April 1887, Professor Dolph Levino opened Levino's Hall at the site. Levino had previously operated a circus act in nearby Westgate Street which had enjoyed a ten week run in the city the previous year. Levino himself performed a mesmerism act. He had acquired the site in November 1896 and the hall was built by Fred Martin, who presented Levino with a marble clock upon the hall's opening. Martin later filed for bankruptcy and cited the Hall as a major factor, alleging he lost ¬£3000 in the venture. The site could accommodate a total of 1500 people, 800 of which would be situated in the pit. A balcony above the pit provided further areas for spectators and a total of six boxes (three on each side of the building) were also built. Plans for a museum in the opening area of the hall were also proposed. Levino painted several of the areas of the theatre himself, including the proscenium. At Levino's Hall, the acts at his opening night included a trained dogs and monkeys troupe, a human farmyard and Levino himself with his mesmerism act. In his first year, Levino became embroiled in a dispute with Charles Rodney, the owner of the nearby Philharmonic Music Hall, over the use of music at the site. Rodney claimed that the use of music being played during the show's acts meant Levino's Hall was breaching the terms of his license. Levino claimed that Rodney hired people to cause disturbances during his shows and asked for police protection. The case brought by Rodney was later dismissed under the condition that future acts would not be signing or dancing at the venue. Levino's acts proved popular and, several months after opening, the theatre was closed in order to undergo \\"extensive alterations and decorations\\". It reopened in November 1887 under the new name of Levino's Museum of Varieties. In 1888, the Hall was sold to Oswald Stoll and his mother, Adelaide, on a 999 year lease for ¬£175 per year. The Stolls renamed the Hall the Empire House of Varieties and reapplied for a licence permitting music and dancing at the venue. =Empire Palace of Varieties= A drawing of the Empire Palace in the Evening Express, 1896 The Stolls enjoyed considerable success at the site and, by 1895, the size of the Hall was deemed insufficient to deal with the demand for tickets. In conjunction with H.E. Moss, he founded a new company, the Cardiff, Newport, and Swansea Empire Palaces Ltd, which subsequently purchased the leases of the Empire theatre in all three cities. At the Cardiff site, the company also purchased an adjacent building and rebuilt the original hall to expanded capacity at a cost of between ¬£22,000-¬£25,000. The new building was constructed of red brick and Bath stone and featured a tower in the centre of the structure and was designed by Frank Matcham. Part of the redevelopment was aimed at the theatre being able to host two performances each night while the building's capacity was extended to accommodate around 2300 spectators at a time. Matcham's design included a sliding roof to improve ventilation and saw it dubbed \\"the coolest theatre in the country\\". In its first month of opening, a fire broke out in one of the Palace's rooms and prompted an evacuation of the building although the damage was confined to one area. Another fire in 1899 proved significantly more damaging to the Palace, resulting in the building being largely destroyed on 31 October. At the time of the fire, one of the main performers at the Palace was Lottie Collins who estimated that she suffered a loss of ¬£500 in the blaze. Other performers estimated losses of between ¬£20-¬£100 in equipment. Rebuilt Palace Still set about rebuilding the Empire Palace and the new structure, again designed by Matcham, reopened on 30 September 1900. The rebuilt Empire was described as \\"more elaborate\\" than its predecessor and the opening night was attended by the Mayor of Cardiff and Samuel Brain. In order to avoid any chance of fire, the new Empire was constructed entirely of steel and concrete and was built with the stage entirely separate from the auditorium. Asbestos was also used around the stage to avoid any fires spreading into the rest of the building. The South Wales Echo described the structure as \\"the safest place of public entertainment in the town.\\" The overall cost of rebuilding the theatre was estimated to be around ¬£15,000. =Later years= The theatre was rebuilt again in 1915 and remained in use until 1932 when it was converted into a cinema by the Gaumont British Theatres Corporation. It was closed in 1961 and was demolished the following year.

Content Published only a year after Ernst Wunschmann's \\"√úber die Gattung Nepenthes\\", Hooker's monograph expanded the number of known species considerably. Hooker recognised 33 species, including 7 described for the first time: N. bicalcarata, N. celebica (later synonymised with N. maxima), N. echinostoma (later reduced to a variety of N. mirabilis), N. hirsuta, N. khasiana, N. tentaculata, and N. vieillardii. Nepenthes blancoi and N. maxima were listed as \\"species non satis not√¶\\" (little known species), while N. cristata was included under \\"species admodum dubia\\" (very doubtful species). Hooker also described 5 varieties: N. albomarginata var. villosa, N. boschiana var. lowii (later described as N. stenophylla), N. phyllamphora var. macrantha (later synonymised with N. mirabilis),Cheek, M.R. & M.H.P.

In polymer chemistry and polymer physics, the Flory‚ÄìFox equation is a simple empirical formula that relates molecular weight to the glass transition temperature of a polymer system. The equation was first proposed in 1950 by Paul J. Flory and Thomas G. Fox while at Cornell University. Their work on the subject overturned the previously held theory that the glass transition temperature was the temperature at which viscosity reached a maximum. Instead, they demonstrated that the glass transition temperature is the temperature at which the free space available for molecular motions achieved a minimum value. While its accuracy is usually limited to samples of narrow range molecular weight distributions, it serves as a good starting point for more complex structure-property relationships. Overview The Flory‚ÄìFox equation relates the number-average molecular weight, Mn, to the glass transition temperature, Tg, as shown below: :T_{g} = T_{g,infty}-frac{K}{M_{n}} where Tg,‚àû is the maximum glass transition temperature that can be achieved at a theoretical infinite molecular weight and K is an empirical parameter that is related to the free volume present in the polymer sample. It is this concept of ‚Äúfree volume‚Äù that is observed by the Flory‚ÄìFox equation. Free volume can be most easily understood as a polymer chain's ‚Äúelbow room‚Äù in relation to the other polymer chains surrounding it. The more elbow room a chain has, the easier it is for the chain to move and achieve different physical conformations. Free volume decreases upon cooling from the rubbery state until the glass transition temperature at which point it reaches some critical minimum value and molecular rearrangement is effectively ‚Äúfrozen‚Äù out, so the polymer chains lack sufficient free volume to achieve different physical conformations. This ability to achieve different physical conformations is called segmental mobility. A polymer chain (represented by the white circles) exhibits more free volume (represented by the gray shading) at the ends of the chain than from units within the chain. thumbrightDistribution of the associated free volume along polymer chain in the presence of plasticizer as shown by recent molecular simulation study. Free volume not only depends on temperature, but also on the number of polymer chain ends present in the system. End chain units exhibit greater free volume than units within the chain because the covalent bonds that make up the polymer are shorter than the intermolecular nearest neighbor distances found at the end of the chain. In other words, chain end units are less dense than the covalently bonded interchain units. This means that a polymer sample with long chain lengths (high molecular weights) will have fewer chain ends per total units and less free volume than a polymer sample consisting of short chains. In short, chain ends can be viewed as an ‚Äúimpurity‚Äù when considering the packing of chains, and more impurity results in a lower Tg. Recent computer simulation study showed that the classical picture of mobility around polymer chain can differ in the presence of plasticizer, especially if molecules of plasticizer can create hydrogen bonds with specific sites of the polymer chain, such as hydrophilic or hydrophobic groups. In such the case, polymer chain ends exhibit only a mere increase of the associated free volume as compared to the average associated free volume around main chain monomers. In special cases, the free volume around hydrophilic main chain sites can exceed the free volume associated to the hydrophilic polymer ends. Thus, glass transition temperature is dependent on free volume, which in turn is dependent on the average molecular weight of the polymer sample. This relationship is described by the Flory‚ÄìFox equation. Low molecular weight values result in lower glass transition temperatures whereas increasing values of molecular weight result in an asymptotic approach of the glass transition temperature to Tg,‚àû . The figure to the left clearly displays this relationship ‚Äì as molecular weight increases, the glass transition temperature increases asymptotically to Tg,‚àû (in this arbitrary case shown in the image, Tg,‚àû = 365 K). =Molecular-level derivation= The main shortcoming related to the free volume concept is that it is not so well defined at the molecular level. A more precise, molecular- level derivation of the Flory‚ÄìFox equation has been developed by Alessio Zaccone and Eugene Terentjev. The derivation is based on a molecular-level model of the temperature-dependent shear modulus G of glassy polymers. The shear modulus of glasses has two main contributions, one which is related to affine displacements of the monomers in response to the macroscopic strain, which is proportional to the local bonding environment and also to the non- covalent van der Waals-type interactions, and a negative contribution that corresponds to random (nonaffine) monomer-level displacements due to the local disorder. Due to thermal expansion, the first (affine) term decreases abruptly near the glass transition temperature Tg because of the weakening of the non- covalent interactions, while the negative nonaffine term is less affected by temperature. Experimentally, it is observed indeed that G drops sharply by many orders of magnitude at or near Tg (it does not really drop to zero but to the much lower value of the rubber elasticity plateau). By setting G(T_g) = 0 at the point where the G drops abruptly and solving for Tg, one obtains the following relation: :{T_g} = frac{1}{alpha _T}(1 - C - phi _c^* + 2Lambda) - frac{alpha _T M_n} In this equation, phi_c^* is the maximum volume fraction, or packing fraction, occupied by the monomers at the glass transition if there were no covalent bonds, i.e. in the limit of average number of covalent bonds per monomer z_{rm co}=0. If the monomers can be approximated as soft spheres, then phi_c^*approx 0.64 as in the jamming of soft frictionless spheres. In the presence of covalent bonds between monomers, as is the case in the polymer, the packing fraction is lowered, hence phi _c = phi _c^* - Lambda cdot {z_{rm co}}, where Lambda is a parameter that expresses the effect of topological constraints due to covalent bonds on the total packing fraction occupied by the monomers in a given polymer. Finally, the packing fraction occupied by the monomers in the absence of covalent bonds is related to T_g via thermal expansion, according to phi_c = exp (-alpha_T T_g -C), which comes from integrating the thermodynamic relation between thermal expansion coefficient alpha_{T} and volume V, alpha_T = frac{1}{V},left(partial V/partial Tright), where alpha_T is the coefficient of thermal expansion of the polymer in the glassy state. Note the relation between packing fraction phi and total volume given by phi=v N/V, where N is the total number of monomers, with molecular volume v, contained in the total volume V of the material, which has been used above. Hence C is the integration constant in ln(1/phi)=alpha_{T}T+C, and it was found that Capprox0.48 for the case of polystyrene. Also, M_0 is the molecular weight of one monomer in the polymer chain. Hence the above equation clearly recovers the Flory‚ÄìFox equation with its dependence on the number average molecular weight M_n, and provides a molecular-level meaning to the empirical parameters present in the Fox-Flory equation. Furthermore, it predicts that T_g sim 1/alpha_{T}, i.e. that the glass transition temperature is inversely proportional to the thermal expansion coefficient in the glass state. =Alternative equations= While the Flory‚ÄìFox equation describes many polymers very well, it is more reliable for large values of Mn and samples of narrow weight distribution. As a result, other equations have been proposed to provide better accuracy for certain polymers. For example: :T_{g} = T_{g,infty}-frac{K}{(M_{n}M_{w})^frac{1}{2}}. This minor modification of the Flory‚ÄìFox equation, proposed by Ogawa, replaces the inverse dependence on Mn with the square of the product of the number-average molecular weight, Mn , and weight-average molecular weight, Mw . Additionally, the equation: :frac{1}{T_{g}} = frac{1}{T_{g,infty}}+frac{K}{T_{g,infty}^2}frac{1}{M_{n}} was proposed by Fox and Loshaek, and has been applied to polystyrene, polymethylmethacrylate, and polyisobutylene, among others. However, it is important to note that despite the dependence of Tg on molecular weight that the Flory-Fox and related equations describe, molecular weight is not necessarily a practical design parameter for controlling Tg because the range over which it can be changed without altering the physical properties of the polymer due to molecular weight change is small. The Fox Equation The Flory‚ÄìFox equation serves the purpose of providing a model for how glass transition temperature changes over a given molecular weight range. Another method to modify the glass transition temperature is to add a small amount of low molecular weight diluent, commonly known as a plasticizer, to the polymer. The presence of a low molecular weight additive increases the free volume of the system and subsequently lowers Tg , thus allowing for rubbery properties at lower temperatures. This effect is described by the Fox equation: :frac{1}{T_{g}} = frac{w_{1}}{T_{g,1}}+frac{w_{2}}{T_{g,2}}. Where w1 and w2 are weight fractions of components 1 and 2, respectively. In general, the accuracy of the Fox equation is very good and it is commonly also applied to predict the glass transition temperature in (miscible) polymer blends and statistical copolymers.

Beyond the Azores, the Cult of the Holy Spirit is alive in parts of Brazil (where it was established three centuries ago) and pockets of Portuguese settlers in North America. The cult of the Holy Spirit involves traditional rituals and religious celebrations of these faith communities. In its original sense, \\"cult\\" referred to an accepted religious practice, in sharp contrast to the term's modern, negative connotation. Devotion to the Holy Spirit is part of classical Catholic dogma and is the inspiration of several Catholic religious institutes, including the Spiritans, but what is considered here has peculiar characteristics of its own. History The dove: iconographic symbol of the Holy Spirit =Joachimites= Worship of the Holy Spirit was promoted by Joachim of Fiore,Maria Santos Montez (2007), p. 170 a millenarian prophet who, on the basis on his interpretation of the Book of Revelation, postulated that 1260 would see the beginning of A Third Age. (He himself died in 1202.) The Third Age would be governed by the Holy Spirit and would represent a monastic governance, in which the hierarchy of the Church would be unnecessary and infidels would unite with Christians. These theories became associated with the Fraticelli strand of the Franciscan Order and were condemned by Pope Alexander IV in 1256.Maria Santos Montez (2007), pp.169‚Äì170 =Cult= Two hundred years later, there was a rebirth of the popularity of the doctrines in the Azores; their religious manifestations, rituals and symbols began to permeate the islands and, consequently, persist until today. These acts of faith were heavily influenced by Franciscan spiritualists, who were members of the first religious order that colonized the Azores, and brought with them traditions that were being extinguished on the mainland by Catholic Church orthodoxy. Here, in isolated communities under environmental pressures and the uncertainties of life, the millenarian rites of the Holy Spirit were accepted and fostered. The Azores, and those communities that had their origins in the archipelago, became the last outposts of Joachimite doctrines. The origins of the modern cult and its rituals are not definitively understood. The dominant theory postulates that the celebrations were introduced into Portugal by Queen Elizabeth of Portugal.Maria Santos Montez (2007), p. 169 The cult's principal centre of devotion was in Tomar, which was also the location of the priory of the Order of Christ, charged with the spirituality of newly discovered lands (including the Azores). Another centre was Alenquer, where, in the first years of the 14th century, Queen Elizabeth introduced the first celebration of the Imp√©rio do Divino Esp√≠rito Santo (), probably influenced by Franciscan spiritualists, who there founded the first Franciscan Convent in Portugal. From there the cult first spread in Portugal (Aldeia Galega, Alenquer, Sintra, Tomar, Lisbon), and later accompanied the Portuguese during their Atlantic discoveries. The new colonies were, in the beginning, subordinate to the priory in Tomar, later the archbishop of Funchal, and finally, the new bishopric of Angra do Hero√≠smo, which were overseen by the Order of Christ, who nominated new clerics, oriented the faithful and supervised the religious development. In this context, references to the proliferation of the cult of the Holy Spirit appeared early, and in a general way, throughout the archipelago. Gaspar Frutuoso, writing 150 years after the beginning of the island's settlement, indicated that this devotion existed in all the islands; its expansion was tolerated, if not promoted, by the Order of Christ. References in the Constitui√ß√µes Sinodais da Diocese de Angra (approved in 1559) by the Bishop of Angra, Friar Jorge de Santiago show that some attention was given to the cults by the episcopal authorities. The existence of the Irmandades do Divino Esp√≠rito Santo () were first noted in the 16th century. The first hospital constructed in the Azores (1498), under the Santa Casa da Miseric√≥rdia of Angra, received its current name, the Hospital do Santo Esp√≠rito. The distribution of food (meats, bread, milk) was already an important part of the charity common in the middle of the 16th century. From then on, and in particular after the beginning of the 18th century, the cult of the Holy Spirit assumed a position of importance in Azorean culture, becoming a unifier of the population in the various islands. With Azorean emigration, the cult was transplanted to Brazil, where by the end of the 18th century there existed feast days in Rio de Janeiro, in Bahia, and other zones where Azorean immigrants settled, such as Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul and Pernambuco. In the 19th century, the traditions spread to Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Hawaii, Connecticut and California in the United States, as well as to Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia in Canada. The Feast of the Empire of the Divine Holy Spirit was also celebrated on board of the naus on their way to Brazil and to India, during the 16th century. In a letter sent to Italy from Goa (India), the Jesuit missionary Fulvio Gregori reports: \\"The Portuguese used to elect an Emperor by the Feast of Pentecost and it was so also in this ship St. Francisco. Indeed, they chose a boy as Emperor on the eve of Pentecost, in the midst of great pomp. They dressed him very richly and then put on his head the imperial crown. They also chose for him lords and officers at orders, so that the captain was appointed overseer over his house, another gentleman was appointed cupbearer, each with his office at the disposal of the Emperor. Even the officers of the ship joined in, the master, the pilot, etc. Then, on the day of Pentecost (Easter or Holy Spirit), all dressed to perfection, at an altar on the bow of the ship, where there was more space, with beautiful cloths and silverware, they led the Emperor to Mass, with music, drums and courtiers. There he was seated on a chair with velvet cushions, with a crown on his head and a sceptre in his hand, surrounded by his court, to the accompaniment of artillery salvos. The courtiers of the Emperor feasted and then, finally, served everyone here on board, around three hundred people.\\" =Spiritual tenets= Generally, there are several prescribed tenets that organize this religious movement, that were derived from Joachimite dogma: * Hope (') -- the faithful seek the fulfillment of religious dogma that assumes a period of human spiritual development and brotherhood, and in which the Holy Spirit is the fountain of knowledge and order; *Faith in the Divine (') -- that the Holy Spirit is present in all places, it knows all and sees all, and the faithful recognize that there are no secrets from the Holy Spirit. Offenses are severely punitive; O Divino Esp√≠rito Santo √© vingativo ('), and holy vows/promises to God should be kept. Seven spiritual virtues guide the brotherhood of the faithful: wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of the Lord. *Egalitarianism -- all brothers are equal, and all can be mordomos ('), and all may be crowned in their ritualized functions as the emperor, receiving equal respect and obedience when invested with this authority: it is the practical application of the Joachimite principles. *Solidarity and Charity -- in the distribution of alms (meat, soup and milk traditionally), the poor are privileged recipients who equally take part in the celebrations, while all offenses are pardoned in order to receive the Holy Spirit. *Autonomy from the Church; the cult of the Holy Spirit is not dependent on the formal organization of the Church, nor are the clergy needed to participate in the practices; there are no intermediaries between the devotees and the Divine. Over time, in practice, this tenet of Joachimite spirituality has become more obscure, as the Church plays a role in blessing the events (through processions to the local church and masses held auspiciously for the feast) Imp√©rios The organization of the cult, with some variation between the islands, and between the Azorean diaspora includes the following structures: =Irmandade= The Irmandade (') is the organizational nucleus of the cult, comprising the brothers, voluntarily registered (and accepted) and who are all equal in rights and responsibilities. Although they have historically been exclusively masculine, both women and men are accepted, as are members of different origins or titles. This rule was rarely violated, although on some islands there did exist Imp√©rios dos nobres, which only accepted brothers from the local aristocracy.The most recognized exception was the Imp√©rio dos Nobres in Horta, on the island of Faial, whose membership was composed of local nobility. Today, the responsibility of the Imp√©rio is conferred in the local C√¢mara Municipal of Horta. Each irmandade is a territorial unit, constituted as local associations of neighbours, grouping families and residents from within a particular parish or locality. These groups have defined compromises, based on consensual rules that are not written, but recognized by the members. In cases where the diocese or authorities have attempted to impose or intervene in the businesses of these groups, there has generally been passive resistance and indignation from its members. =Imp√©rio= Each irmandade is organized around the Imp√©rio do Divino Esp√≠rito Santo, normally a small structure, with a distinct architectural style where the faithful conduct their rituals. The architecture of the Imp√©rios varies from island to island; from simple tile-roofed buildings (such as in Santa Maria) to grande chapels with ornate facades and crowned with an imperial crown (in Terceira). It is used as a place to store the reliquaries, penants, symbols; to cook and/or distribute the offerings; and to perform some of the religious services associated with the event. The appearance of permanent imp√©rios began in the last half of the 19th century, probably resulting from money remitted from emigrants in the Brazilian and/or Californian diaspora. Until this point, the cult would realize their services in treatros, structures constructed principally for the events, that were later torn down. The Azorean diaspora, particularly those from New England and Canada, in addition to small structures, would construct larger enclosed salons owing to the conditions in these environments. =Mordomo= During each celebration, one member of the irmandade would receive the designation of mordomo, which was normally made by drawing straws or name selection from a hat, usually by a young child.Maria Santos Montez (2007), p.170 Many irmandades admit that voluntarism is common, when one of the brothers will make an offering or promessa (') to the Holy Spirit, necessitating an act of benevolence and charity. The mordomo is responsible for coordinating the collection of funds for the feast, the organization of the event, the peoples invited, the purchase of meat, bread, wine, etc. and generally seen as the supreme authority of the brothers during the event. Symbols An altar in honor of the Holy Spirit with Crown, an example from the island of S√£o Jorge Crown, scepter and orb of the Holy Spirit The rituals of the cult include various symbolic objects that are typically incorporated during the ceremonies; they include: * Crown, scepter and orb -- these are most important symbols of the Imp√©rio, and assumes a central place during the celebrations. The crown is an imperial design, in silver, normally with four arms that meet at a golden orb (also in silver) surmounted by the dove of the Holy Spirit. Each crown comes with a silver scepter, again, surmounted with the dove of the Holy Spirit. In addition, the crown and scepters are decorated with ribbons of white, and mounted on a silver plate with a tall rest. The size of the crown varies, and in general, each irmandade may have one large and two smaller crowns, used to represent the Imp√©rio of the Holy Spirit. In addition to being used in crowning ceremonies, it is considered an honor to transport the crown or let it remain in your home, which occurs with the brotherhood routinely. Throughout the years, the crown will circulate, remaining in a place of honor in the household, where nightly prayers would occur. Although, traditionally, the process of moving the crowns from household to household involved a cortege, escorted by the brotherhood, in modern times, the movement is not as ornamented. * Flag -- the pennant, of brilliant red color, is a double-side quadrangular dimension (five palms on the side), knitted with a relief of the white dove of the Holy Spirit and rays of gold and white irradiating from its center. The flagstaff, made of wood, is two meters in height (although some are smaller or taller) surmounted with the dove of the Holy Spirit in tin or silver. The flag will accompany the crown and is always present in the liturgical ceremonies and crowning; it is an honor to be selected to carry the flag during the ceremonial cortege. A smaller flag is usually raised near the location of the crown, wherever it stays, and it is common to see white flags line the squares during the ceremonies. * Hymn -- the Hino do Esp√≠rito Santo ('), composed at the end of the 19th century, is used by the bands and sung during the crowning ceremonies. Although primiarly used in these ceremonies, some of its chords have been inserted into the Hymn of the Azores (the regional national anthem). * Mace and ribbon -- inspired by the ceremonial maces carried traditionally by municipal judges or officials, the ceremony and cort√®ge is accompanied by a variable number of mace-bearers (but usually 12). The wooded maces, usually 1.5 meters in length, sometimes include a base for a candle, or surmounted with a tin or silver dove. During the cort√®ge the mace-bearers surround the crown-bearer, in some cases the maces are joined together to form a rectangle, and the crown-bearer walks within the space. In some irmandades an extra mace (sometimes painted in white) will be provided to an individual who will be responsible for maintaining the procession in good order. It is occasionally, referred colloquially as the \\"enxota porcos\\" (), likely a reference to a time when animals roamed the streets, and had to be forced to the side of the road. The organization would normally select people who needed a position of honor: mostly young people. * Foli√µes do Divino -- a small group of about five musicians that sing hymns, accompanied by drum, cymbal, and tambourine, who visit the homes of the brotherhood.Maria Santos Montez (2007), p. 172 They are also included in the transference of the crown, at the collection of donations, during the procession, the rituals and the distribution of offerings. On the island of Santa Maria as well as the area of Beira on S√£o Jorge, the foli√µes are part of more complex rituals that have disappeared from other islands, involving the liturgy of the Holy Spirit. Rituals A coronation ceremony in the first half of the 20th century =Procession= Also, referred to as the cort√®ge, imp√©rio or mudan√ßa (); on Easter day, the crowns are transported to the church, where they are placed on the altar, until the end, when they ceremonially crown the recipient (coronation). The emperor will then depart for his home, accompanied by his cort√®ge and the brotherhood, and led by the Holy Spirit's standard, the foli√µes, the crowns surrounded by the poles (in a rectangular form) and trailed by the faithful. Normally, a band will follow the cort√®ge with cheerful processional music, although they may be accompanied alone by the Foli√µes of the Divino. Upon arriving at the emperor's home, the crowns are placed on an altar of honour of wood and adorned with white paper and flowers, to remain throughout the week. Every evening the neighbours and faith community gather at the home where traditionally some food and dancing may have occurred, but usually ends with the recitation of the rosary and benedictions to the Holy Spirit. On the following Sunday, the crowns depart once again with the cort√®ge for the church, where they are received by the local parish priest, who recites the Magnificat (a traditional pastoral benediction). The process, traditionally, repeats itself until the seventh Sunday following Easter (referred to as the Domingo do Bodo), and in some cases until the eighth Sunday following Easter (traditionally referred to as the Segundo Bodo or Domingo da Trindade).Maria Santos Montez (2007), p. 174 The modern tradition, influenced by religious immigrants, is shortened to include a brief cort√®ge procession (usually on the same day of the coronation), and ceremonial transfers of the crown to the home of the emperor, all performed throughout the summer.The shortened timeline was likely influenced by many immigrants who were limited to shorter vacations, most likely in the summer, but whom wished to follow the spirit of their traditions. =Coronation= The coronation () concludes the principal religious ceremonies and involves the placement of the silver crown on the head of the emperor, or persons destined to hold it in the ceremony, by the parish priest. Similarly, after ritually kissing the dove on the silver sceptre, the faithful are empowered to rise with the crowns while benedictions are made in the name of the Holy Spirit, while the hymn is played. Immediately following this ceremony, the cortege is reformed and proceeds to exit the church, with the priest singing the Magnificat once again. =Bodo= Traditionally, on the seventh Sunday following Easter (Pentecost Sunday) the faithful realize the bodo. On this day, the cort√®ge, after leaving the church travel to the imp√©rio, where the Holy Spirit's standard and the crowns are placed in exhibition. In front of the imp√©rio, on long bunks, are placed offerings or esmolas that, after being blessed, are distributed to the gathered. The brotherhood receive the people and invite them to freely partake of bread and wine, while meat, sugar pastries and massa sovada (traditional Portuguese sweet bread) are offered to the participants, organized by the mordomo. At the end of the Bodo, the crowns are collected and the cortege ferries them to the home of the mordomo. The Monday following this seventh Sunday of Easter, is Azores Day, or as it is traditionally known, the Dia da Pombinha (). Esmola The esmola or pens√£o () is constituted by a portion of beef cattle (specifically killed for the event), bread and vinho de cheiro (a high alcohol content wine derived from the Isabel caste grapes). It is distributed to the brotherhood, as well as the families in most need. =Fun√ß√£o= The function, is the gathering of neighbors, family and friends for a ritualized meal that includes invited guests of the principal who took on a promise to the Holy Spirit.Maria Santos Montez (2007), p. 175 The meal consists of the Holy Spirit Soup, a meat broth that is applied to buttered bread and tempered with mint leaves, either accompanied with the cooked meat used in its preparation, Portuguese sweet bread and sweet rice puree sprinkled with cinnamon. There are many variations on the meat broth recipe that includes the methods of preparing the soup, the availability of side dishes or the consistency of the soup. On the island of Terceira, for example, the Holy Spirit Soup is accompanied by an alcatra, a plate of meat cooked in red wine in an earthen pot. The function symbolizes community sharing, and occurs in the presence of the crowns and flag, accompanied by hymns to the Holy Spirit, normally led by the Foli√µes. Today, these functions are also held outside the normal religious context, on the Day of the Azores, during protocol receptions or more recently as tourist inspired events to promote the culture of the Azores (and uncommonly open to the public). The largest function recorded, occurred on 10 June 2000, when 8000 participants gathered on the Rua de S√£o Pedro, in Angra do Hero√≠smo, in the presence of the President of the Portuguese Republic, the Prime Minister and President of the Regional Government, as well as the accredited members of the Portuguese diplomatic corp and other invited dignitaries. Brian√ßa As part of the rituals leading-up to the function, a cortege will also proceed through the community with a cow (which will later be slaughtered for the feast), decorated with colourful paper flowers and accompanied by the foli√µes.Maria Santos Montez (2007), pp. 169, 174 This secondary cortege, proceeding the events of the coronation and bodo, stops at the door of each family who contributes money, while hymns and chants are made, and the traditional brian√ßa music played.Maria Santos Montez (2007), p. 174 Ceia The ceia dos criadores is a dinner organized in honor of the farmers who have contributed animals for the meal, or who have contributed gifts to the brotherhood. Much like the brian√ßa it serves as a moment to raise funds for the events; those invited traditionally include illustrious social figures and local politicians.

History\\"Provplats RFN Vidsel 50 √•r\\", RFN Veteranklubb/FMV, 2008, p.53 (in Swedish) Vidsel Air Base was established as a secret wartime air base by the Swedish Air Force in 1957. It was called \\"Krigsflygf√§lt nr. 42\\" (Wartime airbase no. 42) and not put on maps or written about. The majority of work at the base was done by personnel from the Test & Evaluation department of Swedish Defence Materiel Administration (FMV). The use of the base was both as a dispersed airbase in case of war, and for the newly established Vidsel Test Range. The secrecy of the base was lifted in 1965, with foreign aircraft using the base from 1966, though very sparsely. During the 70's the use of the base for training of Swedish Air Force crews increased steadily, and more and more of the operations was taken over by personnel from the 21st wing. In 1980 all training for the Swedish Air Force in north Sweden was moved to Vidsel Air Base. Vidsel Air Base was completed as a Bas 90 airbase in 1989, meaning that apart from a main runway three shorter runways had been added together with other facilities. Aircraft operated Vidsel Air Base is able to operate all current types of aircraft used by the Swedish AF, as well as a number of other aircraft from other users, including many NATO, as the airfield is equipped with an arresting wire.

It was established in 1721 by Thomas Hollis, a wealthy English merchant and benefactor of the university, at a salary of ¬£80 per year. It is the oldest endowed chair in the United States, the first professorship in theology in the country, and in the early 19th century it was considered to be \\"the most prestigious endowed professorship in America\\". History, denominational issues The terms for the new position were drawn up in London on 22 August 1721. Requirements for the professor were not very sectarian, although Hollis made a requirement of character: \\"That he should be a man of solid learning in divinity, of sound, or orthodox principles, one well gifted to teach, of a sober and pious life, and of a grave conversation.\\" Traditionally, the chair's occupant has the right to graze a cow on the Harvard Yard, but until 2009 none but the first two Hollis professors had done so; in 2009, upon his retirement, theologian Harvey Cox restored the tradition and chose Faith, a Jersey cow belonging to the Farm School in Athol, Massachusetts. Although Hollis was a Baptist, he had enough faith in the liberal and tolerant atmosphere at Harvard to endow the chair and allow the president and faculty of the university to appoint theologians to the chair, with the condition \\"that none be refused on account of his belief and practice of adult baptism.\\" Hollis's \\"sound and orthodox principles\\" initially meant Congregationalist or Calvinist. The chair's first occupant, Edward Wigglesworth (1732‚Äì1794), had to swear allegiance to the Medulla Theologiae, a Calvinist theological manual by William Ames. The chair was first unoccupied, briefly, from 1803 to 1805, when the Puritans at Harvard ceded power to the Unitarians; in 1805, Unitarian Henry Ware assumed the post. Proponents of the Unitarian faction pointed out that it would be impossible to find a man orthodox enough for the 1720s in the early nineteenth century; \\"orthodox\\" they interpreted as following \\"the general sentiment of the country.\\" In the 1830s, Harvard found itself in financial trouble and at the same time was moving away from the teaching of religion. Josiah Quincy III, then-president of Harvard, refused to nominate a successor for Henry Ware, and the post was left unoccupied a second time. It also seems that the original endowment had dried up. In the meantime, to lessen the possible charge of a \\"narrowly sectarian education\\" the chair was moved to the Divinity School, which had been formed in 1816.

It feeds on several species of legumes (plant family Fabaceae) worldwide, including forage crops, such as pea, clover, alfalfa, and broad bean, and ranks among the aphid species of major agronomical importance. The pea aphid is a model organism for biological study whose genome has been sequenced and annotated. Generalities and life cycle In the autumn, female pea aphids lay fertilized eggs overwinter that hatch the following spring. The nymphs that hatch from these eggs are all females, which undergo four moults before reaching sexual maturity. They will then begin to reproduce by viviparous parthenogenesis, like most aphids. Each adult female gives birth to four to 12 female nymphs per day, around a hundred in her lifetime. These develop into mature females in about seven to ten days. The life span of an adult is about 30 days. Population densities are at their highest in early summer, then decrease through predation and parasitism. In autumn, the lengthening of the night triggers the production of a single generation of sexual individuals (males and oviparous females) by the same parthenogenetic parent females. Inseminated sexual females will lay overwintering eggs, from which new parthenogenetic females will emerge in early spring. When the colony begins to become overcrowded, some winged females are produced. These disperse to infest other plants, where they continue to reproduce asexually. When temperatures become colder and day lengths shorter, sexual winged females and males appear. These mate, the females lay diapausing eggs and the life cycle starts again. Pea aphids can complete their whole reproductive cycle without shifting host plant. Several morphs exists in pea aphids. Besides differences between sexual and parthenogenetic morphs, winged and wingless morphs exist. Overcrowding and poor food quality may trigger the development of winged individuals in subsequent generations. Winged aphids can then colonize other host plants. Pea aphids also show hereditary body color variations of green or red/pink. The green morphs are generally more frequent in natural populations. Acyrthosiphon pisum is a rather large aphid whose body can reach 4 mm in adults. It generally feeds on the lower sides of leaves, buds and pods of legumes, ingesting phloem sap through its stylets. Unlike many aphid species, pea aphids do not tend to form dense colonies where individuals would stay where they were born during their whole lifetimes. Pea aphids are not known to be farmed by ants that feed on honeydews. More than 20 legume genera are known to host pea aphids, though the complete host range remains undetermined. On crops such as peas and alfalfa, A. pisum is considered among the aphid species or major agronomical importance. Yields can be affected by the sap intake that directly weakens plants, although pea aphids seldom reach densities that might significantly reduce crop production. However, like many aphid species, A. pisum can be a vector of viral diseases to the plants it visits. Protection against pea aphids includes the use of chemical insecticides, natural predators and parasitoids, and the selection of resistant cultivars. No insecticide resistance is documented in A. pisum, as opposed to many aphid pests. Pea aphids, although collectively designated by the single scientific name A. pisum, encompass several biotypes described as cryptic species, subspecies or races, which are specialized on different host species. Therefore, the pea aphid is more accurately described as a species complex. The pea aphid is thought to be of Palearctic origin, but it is now commonly found worldwide under temperate climate. The spread of A. pisum probably resulted from the introduction of some of its host plants for agriculture. Such an introduction likely occurred into North America during the 1870s, and by 1900 it had become a serious pest species in the mid-Atlantic states. By the 1950s, it was widespread throughout the United States and Canada. Its host range in North America is very similar to that of the closely related blue alfalfa aphid (Acyrthosiphon kondoi).  Model organism  Adult, parthenogentic pea aphid on alfalfa - this red morph shows the reddish/dark markings due to carotenoids that some individuals produce. A. pisum is considered as the model aphid species. Its reproductive cycle, including the sexual phase and the overwintering of eggs, can be easily completed on host plants under laboratory conditions, and the relatively large size of individuals facilitates physiological studies. In 2010, the International Aphid Genomics Consortium published an annotated draft sequence of the pea aphid genome composed of approximately 525 megabases and 34000 predicted genes in 2n=8 chromosomes. This constitutes the first genome of a hemimetabolous insect to have been published. The pea aphid genome and other of its features are the focus of studies covering the following areas: *Symbiosis with bacteria - As all Aphididae, A. pisum hosts the primary endosymbiont Buchnera aphidicola, which provides essential amino acids and is necessary for aphid reproduction. Buchnera is transmitted from mothers to offspring, and it has coevolved with aphids for dozens of million of years. A. pisum also hosts a range of facultative bacterial symbionts that can be transmitted maternally and horizontally, and which affect ecologically important traits in aphids, such as body color, resistance to abiotic and biotic stress, and nutrition. *Polyphenism (the production of several discrete morphs by the same genotype) - Studies on pea aphids have helped to establish the environmental and genetic components controlling the production of sexual and winged morphs, among other features. *Asexual reproduction - Pea aphid lineages include parthenogenesis in their life cycles, and some have even lost the sexual phase. Pea aphids are models for deciphering the origin and consequences of asexual reproduction, an important question in evolutionary biology. *Polymorphism and physiology explaining phenotypic variations in aphids - Loci and physiological mechanisms underlying body color, reproductive cycle and the presence of wings in males (which is genetically based) have been identified in pea aphids or are being investigated. A. pisum is notable for being the only animal organism so-far identified that has the ability to synthesize a carotenoid. Plants, fungi, and microorganisms can synthesize carotenoids, but torulene (3',4'-didehydro-Œ≤,Œ≥-carotene, specifically a hydrocarbon carotene) made by pea aphids, is the only carotenoid known to be synthesized by an organism in the animal kingdom. Torulene imparts natural, red-colored patches to some aphids, which possibly aid in their camouflage and escape from predation by wasps. The aphids have gained the ability to synthesize torulene by horizontal gene transfer of a number of genes for carotenoid synthesis, apparently from fungi. *Gene duplication and expansion of gene families - The pea aphid genome presents high levels of gene duplication compared to other insect genomes, such as Drosophila, with the notable expansion of some gene families. *Interaction with host plants and speciation - As most phloem feeders, the pea aphid is adapted to feeding on a limited set of plants. Studies on pea aphids have identified candidate loci, molecular and physiological mechanisms that are involved in host nutrition and virulence. Genetic, molecular and physiological studies have also evidenced specialization to different host species as a motor of ecological speciation between pea aphid biotypes.  Endosymbiotic Relationship with Buchnera aphidicola  A. pisum participates in an obligate endosymbiotic relationship with the bacteria Buchnera aphidicola. A. pisum is the host and Buchnera is the primary endosymbiont. Together they form the holosymbiont.IAGC (2010) Genome Sequence of the Pea Aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum. Plos Biol 8 This is an obligate, symbiotic relationship and both partners are completely dependent on each other.Brinza, L., et al. (2009) Systemic analysis of the symbiotic function of Buchnera aphidicola, the primary endosymbiont of the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum. Cr Biol 332, 1034-1049 When treated with antibiotics to remove the Buchnera bacteria, A. pisum growth and reproduction are interrupted or reduced. Buchnera lacks genes required for living independent of a host and is unculturable outside of the aphid host. The A. pisum and Buchnera holosymbiont is one of the most well studied symbiotic relationships both genetically and experimentally. = Evolution of the Endosymbiotic Relationship = The A. pisum and Buchnera endosymbiotic relationship is likely to have evolved 160-280 million years ago. Phylogenetic analysis shows that Buchnera is a monophyletic group and that the phylogenies of Buchnera and A. pisum coincide. Therefore, there was likely one original Buchnera infection of the common ancestor of aphids and co-speciation of the holosymbiont has occurred since then.oran, N.A., et al.

Series B: Biological Sciences 253, 167-171 Buchnera is related to Enterobacteriaceae including Escheriachia coli and it is likely that Buchnera evolved from a bacterium that originally occupied the gut of the aphid common ancestor.Douglas, A.E. (1998) Nutritional interactions in insect-microbial symbioses: Aphids and their symbiotic bacteria Buchnera. Annu Rev Entomol 43, 17-37 = Nutritional symbiosis = Like other insects of the order Hemiptera, A.pisum utilizes an endosymbiotic bacterium to overcome the nutritional deficiencies of phloem sap. A. pisum feeds on phloem sap of host plants including Medicago sativa (alfalfa), Pisum sativa (pea), Trifolium pretense (red clover), and Vicia faba (broad bean). The phloem saps of these plants are nutritionally rich in carbohydrates but poor in terms of nitrogen.Douglas, A.E. (1993) The Nutritional Quality of Phloem Sap Utilized by Natural Aphid Populations. Ecol Entomol 18, 31-38Douglas, A.E. (2006) Phloem-sap feeding by animals: problems and solutions. J Exp Bot 57, 747-754Gunduz, E.A. and Douglas, A.E. (2009) Symbiotic bacteria enable insect to use a nutritionally inadequate diet. P Roy Soc B-Biol Sci 276, 987-991Sandstrom, J. and Moran, N. (1999) How nutritionally imbalanced is phloem sap for aphids? Entomol Exp Appl 91, 203-210 The ratio of essential amino acids to nonessential amino acids in these phloem saps ranges from 1:4-1:20. This ratio of essential to nonessential amino acids is severely disproportional compared to the 1:1 ratio present in animal tissues and necessary for survival. Animals, including A. pisum, can produce nonessential amino acids de novo but cannot synthesize nine essential amino acids that must be obtained through their diets: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. In addition to these nine essential amino acids, A. pisum is unable to synthesize arginine due to missing urea cycle genes.Wilson, A.C.C., et al. (2010) Genomic insight into the amino acid relations of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, with its symbiotic bacterium Buchnera aphidicola. Insect Mol Biol 19, 249-258 The endosymbiotic relationship with Buchnera allows A. pisum to overcome this lack of essential amino acids in the phloem sap Sandstrom, J. and Pettersson, J. (1994) Amino-Acid-Composition of Phloem Sap and the Relation to Intraspecific Variation in Pea Aphid (Acyrthosiphon-Pisum) Performance. J Insect Physiol 40, 947-955 When provided with nonessential amino acids, Buchnera converts nonessential amino acids into essential amino acids to be returned to A. pisum.Sasaki, T. and Ishikawa, H. (1995) Production of Essential Amino-Acids from Glutamate by Mycetocyte Symbionts of the Pea Aphid, Acyrthosiphon-Pisum. J Insect Physiol 41, 41-46 This nutritional provisioning has been examined genomically (metabolic complementary, discussed below) and experimentally. Isolated bacteriocytes containing Buchnera have been shown to actively take up 14C labeled glutamine (a nonessential amino acid) where it is then converted into glutamic acid. This glutamic acid is then taken up by the individual Buchnera cells and used to synthesize the essential amino acids isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, and valine as well as nonessential amino acids that can be returned to A. pisum. Mutual nutrient provisioning is likely the main reason for the persistence of this symbiosis. = Holosymbiont Structure = Buchnera are housed in specialized, aphid-derived cells located in the hemocoel of the A. pisum body cavity. Each Buchnera cell has an inner and outer gram-negative cell membrane and is individually enclosed in an aphid- derived symbiosomal membrane. These encased cells are then grouped into specialized, aphid-derived bacteriocytes (mycetocytes). Bacteriocytes are large, polyploid cells surrounded by a thin lining of flat sheath cells. There are about 60-80 bacteriocytes in each pea aphid and are organized into the bi- lobed bacteriome. A bacteriome is a specialized organ that runs along the length of the pea aphid on two sides of the body and joins near the hindgut.Wilson, A.C.C., et al. (2003) Heritable genetic variation and potential for adaptive evolution in asexual aphids (Aphidoidea). Biol J Linn Soc 79, 115-135 Bacteriocytes are located near the ovariole cluster and Buchnera cells are vertically transferred from the mother's ovaries through transovarial transmission. The Buchnera cells are transferred to eggs during oogenesis or to the developing embryos during embryogenesis. = Genome Sequencing = A. pisum and Buchnera were the first insect-endosymbiont pair to have the genomes of both partners sequenced. This has provided researchers with a great deal of information about the evolutionary and molecular interactions of this endosymbiosis. The A. pisum and Buchnera genomes have experienced unique modifications that are likely related to the establishment and maintenance of the endosymbiotic relationship. The genomes of both organisms have undergone significant gene loss compared to related organisms. The Buchnera genome is 641-kb and consists of a circular chromosome with 2 plasmids. It has been reduced to one-seventh of the size of its closest free- living relative, E. coli. Buchnera has lost genes that would allow it to live outside the host but maintains genes essential for the nutrition of A. pisum. The Buchnera genome is missing genes required for surface membrane construction such as lipopolysaccharides and phosopholipids as well as genes associated with cellular defense. Transporter genes and regulatory genes are also missing from the genome. Such gene loss is typical of an obligate and intracellular bacterium. The A. pisum genome has undergone more unique genomic changes compared to other insects of the order Hemiptera. The aphid genome is 464MB with aphid-specific orphan genes making up 20% of the genome and gene duplication present in more than 2000 gene families. These orphan genes and gene duplications are likely associated with the ‚Äúmetabolic, structural and developmental‚Äù components of the endosymbiotic relationship. A. pisum specific gene duplications of amino acid transporters highly expressed in bacteriocytes have been observed. These duplications are likely associated with the genetic establishment and maintenance of the endosymbiotic relationship. No lateral gene transfer has been detected between A. pisum and Buchnera. It was previously believed that lateral gene transfer was responsible for the severe gene reduction in the Buchnera genome but sequencing has shown that this has not occurred. = Metabolic complementarity = Individually, the metabolic pathways of A. pisum and Buchnera are incomplete. Jointly, the genomes of these two organisms complement each other to produce complete metabolic pathways for the biosynthesis of nutrients such as amino acids and other essential molecules.Ramsey, J.S., et al. (2010) Genomic evidence for complementary purine metabolism in the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, and its symbiotic bacterium Buchnera aphidicola. Insect Mol Biol 19, 241-248 The ancestral partners of this symbiosis are likely to have had complete metabolic pathways, however pressure to maintain these pathway genes was reduced due to redundancy as a result of the presence of the other partner's genome. Unlike other related insects, the A. pisum genome is missing genes necessary for the urea cycle. the purine salvage pathway, and other genes that code enzymes necessary for the biosynthesis of molecules. These missing reaction intermediates are likely provided by genes within the Buchnera genome. For example, A. pisum is the only species with a sequenced genome known to be missing key components of the purine salvage pathway, essential for the production of DNA, RNA, signaling molecules, and ATP. The Buchnera genome contains the necessary genes to encode the reaction intermediates missing from the A. pisum genome. Through this complementation, the nucleotide requirements of both organisms are fulfilled: the purine salvage pathway is completed for A. pisum and Buchnera receives necessary guanosine. The Buchnera genome has retained genes required for the biosynthesis of essential amino acids but has not retained genes responsible for the degradation of amino acids. The A. pisum genome on the other hand, contains 66 amino acid biosynthesis genes and 93 amino acid degradation genes. Both A. pisum and Buchnera contribute to the metabolic pathways of amino acid biosynthesis. This metabolic complementarity is illustrated by the use of asparagine, a nonessential amino acid in phloem sap, as a major precursor in the production essential and nonessential amino acids necessary for the growth and survival of A. pisum and Buchnera. = Immune system = Genome sequencing of A. pisum shows that the genome lacks expected genes essential to immune response pathways. The A. pisum genome lacks IMS, dFADD, Dredd and Retish genes that are a part of the IMD (immunodeficiency) pathway and present in other related insects. Also missing are peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) that detect pathogens and alert the IMD pathway as well as antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes which are produced once the immune pathway has been activated. A reduced immune system may have facilitated the establishment and sustained maintenance of the symbiotic relationship between the Buchnera bacterium and A. pisum. Also, phloem sap is a diet with reduced amounts of microbes which may have lower the evolutionary pressure of A. pisum to maintain the immune response pathway genes.

In 27 years of reportage he has travelled to 145 countries. Luca Bracali is closely involved with environmental issues, such as the ice-melt and global warming, as can be seen from the photos he has taken in the Antarctic and Arctic regions. Through photographic projects he has collaborated with polar researchers from the University of Alaska, Fairbanks and the Barneo Ice Camp, which was the starting point for a Ski Eco-Expedition to the geographic North Pole in 2009. Thanks to these Polar expeditions, broadcast on more than forty radio and television programmes, he was able to become a member of APECS (Association of Polar Early Career Scientists) and subsequently has collaborated with IASC (International Arctic Science Committee). Since 2010 his pictures have been exhibited in museums and galleries in Roma, Milano, Napoli, Bologna, Sofia Kiev, Odessa Copenaghen, Hofn, Bruxelles, Yangon, Montreal and New York City, showing his own particular way of conceiving a photograph - a geometric composition of saturated colours where light plays a fundamental role. Luca Bracali is also busy in the television industry and after one year as the tv host of a travel and adventure program aired on Sky satellite, he became the director of \\"Easy Driver\\"Easy Driver, Rai 1 television program, a weekly television program on Rai 1. Subsequently he has worked with RAI 2, especially with TG2 TG2 and Stories and with Rai 1 in two daily programs: \\"Uno Mattina\\" and \\"Il caff√® di Rai Uno\\" with documentaries and services dedicated to its explorations in documentary style, in addition to RAI 3 in \\"Kilimangiaro\\" .

The series centers around the war over nanotechnology between two powerful scientists, Gabriel and Deadalus, from the extra-dimensional world of New-Gen.Montero, Patrick. It is currently being produced as a movie, destined for success. \\" 'New-Gen' comic book series merges classic superhero tale with hi-tech nanotechnology\\". Daily News. July 21, 2010 Publication history New-Gen was launched by A.P.N.G. Enterprises and Issue 6 was published and distributed at New York Comic Con in Oct. 2010. The second volume of the comic, NEW-GEN: New Dawn, debuted at New York Comic Con in October 2011. NEW-GEN is printed, advertised, and distributed by Marvel Comics. Mark Hamill will lend his voice to characters in New-Gen's upcoming full-length featured film. Plot New-Gen is an extra-dimensional world where science and technology reign supreme. Nanotechnology controls a huge amount of the world's features, including weather, architecture, energy and materials science. The scientist Gabriel, pioneer in nanotechnology, strives for good and the betterment of his world through the use of his technology. However, his apprentice Deadalus, grows ruthless and seeks to use the nanobots to gain power and control over New-Gen. Deadalus unleashes a powerful, unpredictable type of nanotechnology on the world, which infects several of the children of New-Gen, changing them into super-powered creatures. Gabriel defeats Deadalus and banishes him to the underworld. Gabriel then takes in all the children affected by his nanotechnology in order to protect and train them in the use of their powers, founding the Association for the Protection of the New Generation (A.P.N.G.) in the process. Fearing his infant twin sons, Chris and Sean, were affected, Gabriel sends them to Earth in present-day New York City to protect them from Deadalus, much to the dismay of his wife, Thea. While trapped in the underworld, Deadalus finds fierce robo-insectoid creatures called MetalMites that he can mentally control. After discovering that the Mites can dig into other dimensions, he vows to get back to NEW-GEN and get revenge on Gabriel.Overview of the NEW-GEN Comics Volume 1 Years later, Deadalus escapes the underworld and begins wreaking havoc on ancient Crete. Gabriel sends the oldest and strongest member of the A.P.N.G., Mini, to dispatch Deadalus and his army of MetalMites. Mini battles the MetalMites, destroying many of them with his horns, but the fight becomes too much for him to handle alone. Gabriel sends the battle-robot, Horus, to help finish the fight against Deadalus and his creatures. When Mini and Horus have Deadalus beaten, Gabriel tells them to let him live, re-banishing Deadalus to the underworld. Throughout the battle, the native Cretans assume Mini is a sort of monster, which eventually leads to the Greek myth of the Minotaur. Meanwhile, in present-day New York, Chris and Sean prepare to enter a new school in New York City. They are forced to deal with the pressures of fitting in, combined with a growing distance between them and their adoptive parents, and strange visions of Gabriel and Deadalus, of whom they know nothing. On New-Gen, Gabriel encounters challenges finding the best way of teaching the A.P.N.G.. Simultaneously, in the underworld, Deadalus discovers an enormous quantity of dormant microbots. The microbots respond and behave much like the nanobots he worked with on New-Gen. Deadalus plans to use the microbots to gain power over other worlds and dimensions. He infects himself with the microbots, much like he infected the children of New-Gen, in order to have them reconstruct his body and gain superhuman powers. In the transformational process, Deadalus' physiology is drastically altered, coming to more closely resemble a demonic beast than a man. His mind is also altered, furthering his powerlust into genuine megalomaniac insanity. He adopts the identity of Sly, and sets his MetalMites to tunneling into a new world to conquer for his own. Additionally, he uses the microbots to upgrade the MetalMites, increasing their destructive power. Once Sly begins taking over the futuristic world of Nu-Mangi, Mini is sent in to stop him once again. However, Sly and his upgraded MetalMites prove far too powerful for Mini alone. The remaining members of the A.P.N.G., Flyer, Diamond, Gazelle, and Roboduck, join Mini for the battle. Meanwhile, on Earth, Sean begins having nightmares and visions of the battle, haunted in the night by the faces of Sly and the MetalMites The battle rages on the surface of the new world, as the A.P.N.G. destroy wave after wave of MetalMites. Sean and Chris keep getting increasingly vivid glimpses of the battle while at school, but are clueless as to why they are being plagued by the visions. During a lull in the battle, Sly flees and the A.P.N.G. rests knowing another wave is soon to come. Gabriel, observing the battle from New-Gen, holds up several glowing green orbs full of nanobots. Sly, determined to destroy the A.P.N.G. finds machines built by the natives of the new world. He uses his microbots to take over the machines and turn them into larger, more powerful MetalMites. As the twins' visions become more and more clear, they complain of pain and discomfort as their bodies begin to change, alarming their parents as well as Gabriel who is watching them from New-Gen. . During the battle, the A.P.N.G. show signs of victory until Sly shoots them all with a specialized radiation, destroying all of the nanobots in their bodies, reverting them to their human forms and taking away their powers. Just as Sly is about to finish the A.P.N.G. off, Gabriel teleports to the battle wielding his Kane. He gives the A.P.N.G. the green orbs, containing nanobots that will heal the A.P.N.G. and restore their super-powered forms. As the members A.P.N.G. fight the giant machines, Gabriel battles Sly. The two former friends fight brutally, landing crushing blows and unleashing powerful energy bolts against each other. Eventually, Gabriel and the A.P.N.G. overcome Sly and his forces, but Gabriel decides to again spare Sly, saying he is not ready to finish off his old friend. NEW-GEN: New Dawn In 2011, A.P.N.G. Enterprises launched their second series, NEW-GEN: New Dawn.\\"Volume 2 NEW-GEN: New Dawn\\". New-Gen. accessed July 26, 2011. The series' recounts the origin of Gabriel, the manifestation of his abilities, and his arrival in NEW-GEN. Gabriel, at the time known as Gabriam, resides in Ancient Egypt as the son of the Pharaoh. Because he displays a high aptitude for alchemy, Pharaoh entrusts Gabriam's education to the nation's most prominent scientists, led by master alchemist, Soeet. Under their tutelage, Gabriam excels and his abilities quickly surpass those of the men assigned to instruct him. This level of genius, combined with his royal status, causes Gabriam to become pompous, challenging his teachers and using his talents to create ostentatious displays. Gabriam's behavior captures the attention of Soeet, who resents his condescending remarks and doubts his suitability as the future pharaoh. With aide from his fellow scientists, Soeet plots to murder the boy by poisoning his drink at his nightly dinner with Pharaoh. That evening, Pharaoh expresses pride in his son, but implores him to act with greater humility and compassion. Angered by the criticisms, Gabriam storms out of the palace, leaving Pharaoh to dine alone and drink from the poisoned cup. Gabriam is mysteriously transported to Pharaoh's side, but his powers cannot heal his father. With his dying breath, Pharaoh begs Gabriam to continue to make him proud and passes him his scepter, which glows and transforms into a new shape in his hands. Years pass and Gabriam, now acting as pharaoh, is plagued with doubts about his leadership. As Egypt stands on the brink of war with a neighboring nation, his advisors urge him to act aggressively, while he prefers to keep the peace. As he ponders the gravity of the situation, the ghost of Pharaoh suddenly appears before him and announces he has used the magic of his scepter, which he refers to as \\"the Kane\\", to pause time and reconnect with his son. He addresses Gabriam's questions about the Kane, explaining that it was constructed using an early form of nanotechnology by an ancient, highly advanced alien civilization called the Nephesh. Intended to journey the universe collecting information about distant civilizations, the Kane fell to Earth where it was discovered by a wanderer. Pharaoh reveals that he was the wanderer who made the discovery, and that the Kane granted him superhuman abilities, including enhanced speed, strength, and the ability to slow his aging. He recounts his discovery of Gabriam as an infant, abandoned in the palace courtyard, and how the Kane responded to and bonded with the baby. He concludes, telling Gabriam his abilities are derived from the Kane and that it will lead him to his destiny of creating a utopia. As the ghost of Pharaoh vanishes, an advisor enters the throne room to spread word that negotiations have failed and the enemy's troops are rapidly approaching. Gabriam charges to the city gates to address the general, but is attacked upon arrival. To protect himself and his people, he harnesses the power of the Kane to launch a massive attack that annihilates the army. Although acting in self-defense, Gabriam laments the loss of life and begins a journey to gain control of his abilities. He uses the Kane to create a portal, allowing him to travel into the future, and places him in a dark cavern which seems familiar, but he cannot recall how. Gabriam continues deeper into the cave, where he is attacked by a powerful demonic figure. While fighting the demon, he inquires what he has done to incur his assailant's wrath. The creature insists that he has destroyed his life, which perplexes Gabriam, certain they have never met. As he grows weary in the struggle, the Kane creates a portal, allowing him to escape. The dimensional jump places him in a lush, beautiful world, NEW-GEN, where he is greeted by a young man named Deadalus. Gabriam immediately feels comfortable with the stranger, and the two quickly become friends. Seeing an opportunity to use his abilities to improve the newfound realm, Gabriam sets up a laboratory, and takes on Deadalus as an apprentice. Together, the two men progress their research and create a revolutionary form of nanotechnology capable of transforming organic matter on a molecular level. Deadalus brainstorms how their discoveries can heal the sick, while Gabriam shows caution and fears negative effects that may come along with its use. As time goes by, Gabriam grows more powerful due to the Kane being strengthened through exposure to the nanobots. Gabriam continues to work alongside Deadalus and enters a relationship with the beautiful and compassionate Thea, one of NEW-GEN's caretakers. Deadalus requests Gabriam's presence to display the nanobot's immense potential, enhancing NEW-GEN's landscape and revitalizing the world's plant life. Gabriam expresses his gratitude and commends his apprentice's vision, and Deadalus retorts that if he is truly appreciative, he will allow him to use their discoveries to heal his sick wife, Kallius. Gabriam refuses, claiming the nanobots aren't stable enough for human trials, and past experimentation on Kallius have progressed her condition. As they quarrel, Deadalus is alerted that his wife has taken a turn for the worse. He rushes to Kallius' side where she bids him farewell and asks him to look after their infant daughter, Carmen. Once again, Deadalus begs his mentor to intervene, but it's too late. Mourning his loss, Deadalus becomes consumed with grief and resentment toward Gabriam. NEW-GEN: Deadalus Rising Currently, there are plans for the NEW-GEN franchise to expand to film. NEW- GEN: DEADALUS RISING is a 3D CGI animated film that continues the story established in the first volume of the NEW-GEN comic book. The film follows twins, Chris and Sean, and Carmen, as they try to protect Earth and NEW-GEN from Deadalus' plans for vengeance. Characters *Gabriel- Gabriel was born in ancient Egypt as the son of the Pharaoh and possessed a genius-level understanding of science, particularly alchemy. Following the death of his father, Gabriam ascended to the role of Pharaoh, before beginning a journey across the universe to achieve balance and gain control over his abilities, ultimately leading him to New-Gen. Gabriel is the foremost scientist in New- Gen when it comes to nanotechnology. His knowledge of science and the practical applications of nanotechnology have helped him lead New-Gen to a new era, causing many to see him as father of New-Gen's prosperous new age. Due to his patriarchal nature, he constantly strives to make the universe a safer, more harmonious place, but is fiercely combative when those he cares about are in danger. He took in the infected children of New-Gen, feeling a great deal of responsibility for their mutations. He is capable of making very difficult decisions, which causes rifts between him and his wife on numerous occasions. His Kane grants him immense control over nanotechnology, affording him superhuman strength, the ability to form energy blasts and allowing him to bend the fabric of time and space itself.Basic Information of NEW-GEN Characters *Deadalus-Born on New-Gen after Gabriel had already arrived and begun his work, Deadalus grew up to eventually become one of Gabriel's greatest proteges. Together the two made scientific advancements, particularly in nanotechnology, but had a falling out after Gabriel refused to allow Deadalus to use their discoveries to save his terminally ill wife because of doubts about its suitability for human trials. Following his wife's death, Deadalus began experimenting to make the inhabitants of New-Gen \\"perfect,\\" invulnerable citizens and becomes enraged when Gabriel seeks to stop him, believing his experiments are unethical. Gabriel is victorious in their battle and banishes Deadalus from NEW-GEN to the Under¬¨world dimension, which he quickly makes his base of operations. After discovering MetalMites and mircobots, which he controls through mental force, Deadalus takes control of the destructive technology. His self-afflicted microbot infection drives him towards a more bestial state of consciousness and physically transforms him into a demonic being. . *Thea-Also born on New-Gen, Thea was one of the powerful caretakers for the natural world of New-Gen before Gabriel arrived. Thea's levitation and clairvoyant abilities make her a formidably powerful match for Gabriel. She is strong willed and passionate in her actions, but possesses a motherly instinct. The two soon fell in love and with each of their individual talents, found a way to balance the natural world of NEW-GEN with the technological advances Gabriel made to also improve the world. The decision to send their sons, Sean and Chris, to Earth is a source of constant conflict between the two powerful beings. Thea even leaves for a time to return to her former home. Eventually, however, she returns to take over the co-tutelage of the children of NEW-GEN at A.P.N.G. Headquarters. *Sean and Chris-Sean and Chris are twin brothers, the children of Gabriel and Thea. The two of them were sent to Earth as babies, under the care of robot parents to keep them safe from Deadalus when he unleashed his nanites upon New-Gen. The two boys know northing of their origins, their true parents or their true place of birth. Whether the two of them grow to have any Nanopowers like the rest of the A.P.N.G. remains to be conclusively seen, but they have vivid visions of the battle on Zaadar III between the A.P.N.G. and Sly. *Nate Guard-A sentient robot constructed by Gabriel under the watchful eye of Thea, Nature Guardian or Nate Guard, was built to monitor New-Gen's electro- magnetosphere and the precise balance of the nanobots and technology that currently works in concert with the natural environment of New-Gen. If there are problems with either, he fixes it or alerts the A.P.N.G. if he finds the issue to be beyond an everyday occurrence. His sentience, which allows him to gather more information beyond that which is pertinent to his primary directive, gives him an insatiable curiosity. He asks constant questions on the nature of everything, much to the annoyance of other members of the A.P.N.G. He is able to alter his shape, adapting to the situation he presently finds himself in, making him a mechanical analogue to Darwin from the X-Men. *Mini-Minotaur was only a little older than the other children when he was infected by Deadalus's nanobots and mutated into a bull-headed humanoid with hoofed feet. He has a staunch and aggressive temperament, much like that of a real bull. He has a nasty temper, but remains a stalwart and loyal companion to his friends. He serves as the drill sergeant and de facto field leader for the A.P.N.G. He is often the first member of the team dispatched by Gabriel in many combat situations. His mutation gave him, in addition to a physically altered body, highly increased strength and durability, which he uses to his advantage in battle when running headlong into enemies with his sharp horns. *Roboduck- A first generation combat robot from New-Gen, Roboduck is equipped with several plasma-based weapons systems. In addition to arm mounted plasma cannons, and rocket enabled flight, he has the ability to fire an extremely powerful plasma blast from his mouth, in a \\"burping\\" fashion. Roboduck was affected in a very bizarre way by Deadalus' nanobots that mutated the children of New-Gen. Instead of changing Roboduck physically and granting him extra powers, they transformed Roboduck's programming, causing him to behave in a manner much more similar to a human than a machine. This in turn, makes Roboduck the most truly sentient of all robots on New-Gen, as he is able to feel emotion, disobey orders, improvise, develop a sense of humor, and act the part of class clown with the rest of the A.P.N.G. *Diamond-With a body composed of a diamond-like material, Diamond's body appears to be one of the strongest materials discovered on New-Gen. He is nearly invulnerable and possesses limited superhuman strength. He is devoted to martial arts training and seeks northing short of perfection for himself, physically as well as mentally. He is highly intelligent and intuitive and has a quick sense of humor and friendly temperament, which is balanced by his extremely strict self-discipline. *Flyer-Flyer's Nanopowers give him the ability to fly with large brown bat-like wings. He's driven by a competitive spirit to prove he's just as good if not better than all the others who have slightly stronger mutations. His competitive spirit is most often tested against Gazelle, who routinely gives him a run for his money. His cocky, sometimes arrogant attitude is tempered by a fierce loyalty to his friends and an eagerness to prove himself as a force to be reckoned with. *Gazelle-Gazelle's mutation transformed her into a humanoid creature appearing similar to her namesake, with two long horns, fur, hoofed feet and an elongated snout. The nanobots also afforded her with tremendous speed and agility, which more than make up for the fact that her martial arts skills leave much to be desired. She often expresses jealousy towards her friends who look more human than she does, but on the whole is a very caring and nurturing figure. She continually competes with Flyer, one of her best friends. *Carmen-The youngest of the A.P.N.G. and daughter of Deadalus, Carmen works extra hard to prove herself to compensate for her dark legacy. She wants to make sure that everyone knows her as her own, capable formidable person, instead of the daughter of a supercriminal. Since her father was banished, she was taken in by Gabriel and Thea like many other children and always strives to do her best in order to remind everyone, she is far more than her father's daughter.

It has also received PRIME designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of GBM. Mechanism of action Asunercept blocks the CD95‚Äìligand (CD95L) from binding to the CD95-receptor (CD95), which induces apoptosis. In oncology, this blockade is intended to prevent the killing of activated T cells that can be induced by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), endothelial cells, or fibroblasts. In MDS, CD95L-signaling is a negative regulator of erythrocyte production in the bone marrow and its blockade has been shown to rescue erythroid progenitors. Clinical development A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase I study to examine the safety and tolerability of asunercept has shown that it is well tolerated. The efficacy of asunercept was tested in a phase II randomized controlled trial with patients suffering from GBM. A total of 83 patients with first or second relapse of GBM were enrolled in the successful proof-of-concept trial. The primary goal of doubling the number of patients reaching progression-free survival at six months (PFS6) was substantially exceeded.

Their name means a worker in bamboo. The Basor are found mainly in the districts of Jalaun, Hamirpur, Mahoba, Jhansi, Kanpur and Banda. They speak Bundelkhandi dialect, although most can also understand the high version of Hindi, known as Khari Boli. Present circumstances The Basor practice strict community endogamy, as well as clan exogamy, which is a common practice among most North Indian Hindus. Their clans are called gotras, the main ones being the Bahmangot, Dhuneb, Katahriya, Sikarwar, Samangot, Sonach and Supa. Marriages do not occur with the Muslim Bansphor community. The Basor live in multi-caste villages, but occupy their own distinct quarters. Each of their settlement contains an informal caste council, known as a panchayat. The panchayat is headed by a pradhan, a position which is hereditary. In addition, there is an overarching panchayat of between three and four villages, which headed by a chaudhary. The panchayat resolves any intra-community dispute, as well as acting an instrument of social control. They are Hindus and have Lakshmi and Durga as their tribal deities. The Basor are marginal farmers and sharecroppers. Their traditional occupation was basket making and animal husbandry.

While returning to Dunkirk, he died in the water after his motor launch was sunk by enemy aircraft. Biography Clouston was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, the son of William Stewart Clouston and Evelyn Campbell. Edward Clouston, a prominent banker, was his uncle. He studied at Selwyn House School, Lower Canada College and McGill University. After training at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, he was commissioned as a sub- lieutenant on 15 August 1923, with seniority from 15 May 1921. He first served aboard the destroyer leader in the Mediterranean, receiving promotion to lieutenant on 11 March 1924, with seniority from 15 June 1922. He trained at , the Naval Gunnery School at Portsmouth, in mid-1927. He then served as Gunnery Officer in the light cruisers on the America and West Indies Station, and at Portsmouth, being promoted to lieutenant commander on 18 June 1930. Promoted to commander on 31 December 1934, Clouston served as a gunnery instructor at Excellent throughout the mid-1930s before being appointed to command the destroyer on 29 May 1937. =Dunkirk= In May 1940 while Isis was in dock for repairs, Clouston was attached the Naval Shore Party of eight officers and 160 men under the command of Captain William Tennant sent to the port of Dunkirk to help organise the evacuation. The Naval Shore Party embarked on the destroyer at Dover and sailed on 27 May. Three officers cut cards for their assignments. Clouston won the eastern mole, a narrow wooden walkway mounted on a concrete breakwater, not designed to be used by ships, but the only part of the port that had not been heavily bombed by the Luftwaffe. For the next five days, Clouston organised and regulated the flow of men along the mole into the waiting ships. On 1 June, Clouston returned to Dover to report to Vice-Admiral Bertram Ramsay. On the afternoon of 2 June, he and a party of 30 men left Dover on two Royal Air Force rescue motorboats for the final night of the evacuation. Off the coast of France, the two boats were strafed and bombed by eight Ju 87 Stukas, and Clouston's boat was sunk, leaving the crew clinging to the wreckage. Clouston ordered the other boat to continue to Dunkirk, and while waiting for rescue he and his men eventually succumbed to exhaustion and hypothermia. Only one man survived. On 11 July 1940, Clouston posthumously received a Mention in Despatches for his part in the Dunkirk operation. Clouston is buried in Becklingen War Cemetery, Lower Saxony, Germany. Clouston is mentioned by Charles Gray in the 1958 film Dunkirk. Clouston was portrayed by the actor William Hope in the 2004 BBC series Dunkirk. Clouston's actions inspired the character of \\"Commander Bolton\\" in Christopher Nolan's 2017 film, Dunkirk. Due to the attention drawn to Clouston by the film, Parks Canada installed a plaque in Montreal honouring him for his role in the evacuation at Dunkirk. Personal life Clouston married Gwyneth Lilian Vanderpump (1906-2002) on 28 September 1935; they had two sons. His two younger brothers were also naval officers.

It lies to the north of the A35 trunk road between the towns of Bridport and Lyme Regis, and to the south of the two highest hills in Dorset, Lewesdon Hill (279m) and Pilsdon Pen (277m). It is drained by the River Char, which flows south-west to its mouth on the English Channel coast at Charmouth. All of the vale lies within the Dorset Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. There is an electoral ward with the same name stretching from Whitchurch Canonicororum north to Thorncombe. The total population of this ward is 1,717.  Landscape  The landscape of the vale is agricultural and consists of narrow lanes winding between farms that lie amongst small fields, old hedgerows, copses and ancient semi-natural woods. The vale is almost wholly surrounded by hills, including Lewesdon Hill (279 m), Dorset's county top, Pilsdon Pen (277 m), Dorset's second highest point and site of an Iron Age hill fort, Lambert's Castle Hill (258 m), also with an Iron Age hill fort and views across the vale,Lamberts Castle, Dorset: Walk of the week at www.telegraph.co.uk. Accessed on 22 March 2013. and Hardown Hill (207 m). The vale has escaped wholesale ploughing and large-scale agricultural intensification, leading to a landscape that still contains a wealth of wildlife.  History  Farming existed in the vale at least as early as the Iron Age, with early farmers keeping livestock such as sheep and cattle and also cultivating crops such as barley and peas. Later in the Middle Ages these agricultural activities expanded and forest clearance increased; several of the farms in the vale have names ending in '-hay', which means 'enclosure', and these have their origins in the forest clearances from this time, as does the vale's irregular pattern of many small fields. In the 13th century Marshwood Castle was built on a site now occupied by Lodgehouse Farm. It was a motte and bailey construction but only earthworks remain today. Due to the poorly-draining nature of its clay soil, until modern times the vale maintained a reputation for being difficult to traverse in wet weather. In 1906 Sir Frederick Treves called it \\"marshy and full of trees\\" and quoted the Dorset historian John Hutchins (1698 - 1773) who said it \\"was hardly passable by travellers but in dry summers\\", whilst in 1965 the Dorset-born agriculturalist and broadcaster Ralph Wightman remembered that in his boyhood in the early twentieth century \\"after months of hopeless winter rain .... little farms across the fields were cut off in desperate poverty and loneliness\\". Mains water and electricity didn't reach the vale until the second half of the 20th century, and ploughing with horses was still common in the 1960s.  Settlements  Today a number of small villages and hamlets (Fishpond Bottom, Marshwood, Birdsmoorgate, Bettiscombe, Pilsdon, Bowood, Broadoak, Ryall and Whitchurch Canonicorum) surround the vale, sited mostly on the hills and higher ground which virtually encircle it. The impervious clay soil of the floor of the vale has historically provided less amenable sites for building, and only supports a few scattered farms. The village of Whitchurch Canonicorum is the largest settlement connected to the vale, and is notable for its church, which has the rare distinction (shared with few other churches) of possessing the bodily remains of the saint to which it is dedicated (St. Wite or St. Wita, in this case). Pilgrims to this shrine stopped to refresh themselves at the thirteenth-century inn which still stands a couple of miles to the north in the centre of the vale, and folklore recounts that this is why thereafter the inn became known as the \\"Shave Cross Inn\\", after the shaved heads of its pious guests. The village which shares its name with the vale, Marshwood, stands on the line of hills to the north, and from the churchyard the whole vale can be viewed to the south, with the coastal hills and the English Channel beyond.

The Declaration was written by Hilary Teague and adopted simultaneously with the first Constitution of Liberia. The anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration and accompanying Constitution is celebrated as Independence Day in Liberia. The Declaration articulates the history of the Americo-Liberians who settled the original colony and lays out the aspiration of Liberia to be accepted as a free and independent state within the \\"comity which marks the friendly intercourse of civilized and independent communities.\\" Listing the injustices committed against African Americans as a result of slavery in the United States, the Declaration notes the foundation of the colony by the American Colonization Society, as well as their gradual withdrawal from governance in favor of increasing self-governance by the colonists. The noted goal of Liberia is both to establish a state built upon the structure and principles of the law of nations and to modernize the indigenous peoples of the region, including converting them to Christianity. The Declaration partially relied upon the United States Declaration of Independence, in particular its discussion of natural law: > We recognize in all men certain inalienable rights; among these are life, > liberty, and the right to acquire, possess, enjoy, and defend property. Its listing of injustices perpetrated by the United States parallels the charges set forth in the US Declaration of Independence against King George III. However, the Liberian Declaration asserts no right of revolution but frames its independence as the planned purpose of the colony by the American Colonization Society. The Society, having surrendered all control of the colony in January 1846, fully encouraged the independence of Liberia. The Commonwealth of Liberia declared its independence from the American Colonization Society on July 26, 1847, as the Republic of Liberia, creating Africa's first independent republic. On January 3, 1848, Joseph Jenkins Roberts, a free man of color born in Norfolk, Virginia, United States of America, was sworn in as Liberia's first president. The Liberian constitution and flag were modeled after the United States Constitution and flag because nearly all of Liberia's founders were either free people of color and former slaves who had emigrated as colonists from the United States. Liberia was founded as a colony of the American Colonization Society, a private organization established in Washington, D.C. in 1816. On February 5, 1862, after 15 years of avoiding the issue, the United States officially recognized Liberia's independence. Signatories Eleven delegates and one secretary, representing the three counties of Liberia, signed the Declaration along with the Constitution of Liberia: Montserrado County :1. Samuel Benedict :2.

Because it is linked to Portugal by a bridge over the river Mente, the place was traditionally used for illegal trade and smuggling.  Administrative division  Veiga do Seixo belongs to the parish church of Castrelo de Cima with the villages of Covelas, As Lapedas (already disappeared), O Mourisco and San Payo. The village is on the border with Portugal (Cisterna).  Climate  The village and the surrounding area of Ri√≥s has a pronounced Mountain-Mediterranean climate with cold winters and very dry and hot summers, during which devastating fires often occur.  Fauna and flora  Veiga do Seixo is home to many rich species of flora and fauna. Flora include the holm oak (Quercus ilex), turpentine tree (Pistacia terebinthus), Montpellier Maple (Acer monspessulanum). Among the fauna are the European bee-eater (Merops apiaster), red-rumped swallow (Hirundo daurica), European roller (Coracias garrulus), and a rare type of gecko, (Tarentola mauritanica), which is especially difficult to find in other parts of Galicia.  Demography  The demographic evolution of Veiga do Seixo is marked by the abrupt fall in the population occurred during the decades of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s and similar to many other villages in Galicia where there was a massive emigration to bigger and more industrialized Spanish territories like the Basque Country, Catalonia and Madrid. It was also remarkable the number of people that emigrated to Switzerland and Argentina, also known as the fifth Galicia due to the enormous number of Galicians in that country. Nowadays the risk of depopulation is alarmingly high with almost all the inhabitants being over 65, a very low birthrate and few possibilities for young people to develop any career. The village also does not have any infrastructure.  Transport  There is no public transport at all, such as buses or trains and the only way to travel around is by private taxi. The closest train station is A Gudi√±a, 20 km.  Folklore  The patronal feasts are celebrated on 26 and 27 July in honour of the patron saint of the village Santa Ana, or Santi√±a as the locals call it. The celebrations are possible thanks to the money gathered from all the people of the village. It is typical before the music starts to prepare the mystic drink of Queimada while reciting the magic hum to get rid of the evil eyes, bad spirits and witchcraft. It is known that a long time ago a big carnival was celebrated in the village with handmade masks and costumes called vellar√≥ns. Although the traditions have been lost with the passing of the years, the parish church of Ri√≥s is trying to recover them within the framework of the famous Carnaval of Ver√≠n.  Leisure  Even if Veiga do Seixo is a tiny village it has many attractive things to offer such as the European Route of the chesnut or a river pool in the summer. It is also the only village in the area with two bars, both of them offering groceries.

Muhammad bin Abdallah al-Wazir was a Sayyid of the Al Wazir lineage from Wadi'l-Sirr. He was a 23rd-generation descendant of the imam ad-Da'i Yusuf (d. 1012).The line of descent is ad-Da'i Yusuf - al-Qasim - Yahya - Ali - al-Hajjaj - Muhammad - al-Mansur - al-Mufaddal - Ali - Ibrahim - al-Hadi - Abdallah - Muhammad - Ibrahim - Ahmad - Yahya - Muhammad - Abd al-Quddus - al-Hadi - Salah - al-Hadi - Muhammad - Abdallah - al-Mansur Muhammad. His career coincides with a period of great disorder in the Zaidi state in Yemen which was founded in 1597. The realm of the imam was confined to part of the highlands while the lowlands were ruled by the Ottoman Turks. The current imam al-Hadi Ghalib was deposed in 1852 by the population of San'a, who appointed a governor called Ahmad al- Haymi. In the next year 1853, the ulema and notables acknowledged Muhammad as their new imam. As such, he adopted the title al-Mansur Muhammad. He conducted a military campaign to disperse the Arhab tribesmen who had occupied Haima. However, the expedition proved fruitless. Al-Mansur Muhammad himself was expelled from San'a after a very short tenure. When he left the city he cursed the inhabitants.

It is located in Shanghai of China. It is under co-direction of the Shanghai Education Commission and Fudan University. The school was established in 1950, and the High School started an English language international division in 2006. The school is a co-educational, college preparatory boarding and day school offering a Western curriculum for expatriate middle and high school students (grades 1 to 12). Curriculum The school uses an American- based curriculum, with the added requirement of Chinese as a first foreign language. Students may select another language if they can pass the Intermediate Level HSK test (the Chinese government language test for foreigners, similar to the TOEFL for English language testing). FDIS offers both AP and IB for Grades 11‚Äì12. Admissions The school is open only to those holding a foreign passport or a green card. An ESL program is available. Accreditation and affiliations FDIS is recognized and accredited by China‚Äôs Ministry of Education, and has applied for accreditation from the Western Association for Schools and Colleges (WASC) in the United States, and for membership in the East Asian Regional Council of Overseas Schools (EARCOS) membership. Staff Teachers are recruited worldwide. History The High School Affiliated to Fudan University (Fudan International School) was founded in 1950 as a common high school directly subordinate to the university and the Ministry of Education. An international division serving students from Hong Kong and Macao was formed in 1994. In 2002, the mission of this international division was expanded to allow foreign passport holders to study a Chinese curriculum. FDIS opened in September, 2006 with a 10th grade class of 11 students. As of September 2008 the school enrolls 100 students (56 boys and 44 girls) in grades 6 through 12. All students must be foreign passport holders or hold green cards. Our current student body consists of over 200 students from all around the world. Academic Liaison Columbia University, especially Teachers College, has had strong ties with Chinese educators as early as 1910. Drawn by the philosopher John Dewey and by the international educational leader Paul Monroe, prominent leaders such as Tao Xingzhi, Hu Shih, Zhang Boling, and Chen Heqin adapted progressive educational ideas to Chinese conditions, and developed ideas, institutions and programs to propel modern education in China. Their efforts include mass literacy movement, synthesis of East and West educational views, establishing an improving higher education system, and developing early childhood education.

Attacking were Brian B√≥ruma and the D√°l gCais, while defending were Donnub√°n mac Cathail and the remainder of the Viking army of Limerick. The latter were probably the followers of the newly elected and final King of the Foreigners of Munster Aralt mac √çmair, son of the recently slain Ivar of Limerick, although it is possible Donnub√°n was in overall command. Brian and the D√°l gCais were victorious, with the result that the Limerick lordship and its territories were decisively lost to the Gaels until the Norman invasion of Ireland. Much had already been lost to the D√°l gCais by 977, probably including the great d√∫n of Limerick itself, but the lordship included other territories, some a number of miles inland, and the Norse-Irish themselves appear to have briefly remained viable in these. Aralt was probably slain in the conflict but Donnub√°n seems to have survived. Later accounts state he also was killed.  Annallistic accounts  According to the Annals of Inisfallen: According to the Annals of the Four Masters: According to the early 12th century Cogad G√°edel re Gallaib:Todd, p. 102‚Äì3 The 18th century compilation known as the Dublin Annals of Inisfallen report another tradition of uncertain provenance. Here Aralt has been replaced by a certain Olaf,Translation by John O'Donovan, Annals of the Four Masters, Vol. II, p. 706, note possibly his brother, who was actually killed a little before along with his father Ivar and third brother Dubcenn, on Inis Cathaig in 977. One final source, now lost but used by John Collins of Myross in the late 18th or early 19th century, reports:Printed in O'Donovan, Annals of the Four Masters, Vol. II, pp. 706‚Äì7, note Croom Castle was in fact a principal fortress of the O'Donovan family in the 12th century but it is unknown how early they came into possession of the stretch of the River Maigue on which it is located. Possibly Collins was making an assumption but this is unverifiable. A form of the name Cathair Cuan survived at least as late as the year 1200, where it appears in a Norman survey of the region as Cathircuain,Calendar of Documents, Relating to Ireland, 1171‚Äì1251, p. 21 which unfortunately cannot be associated with any known modern site.

While he was Minister, a bill was passed that established the powers of the Censorship Board. It allowed the board to dispose of undesirable publications without challenge. It was claimed that its passage would allow Malawi standards and interests of morality, decency and public order to prevail in entertainment and publications. It was opposed by Michael Blackwood, a spokesman for European settler interests. Msonthi noted that, \\"It is our duty, as a government, to make sure that people who take any films in this country for show or their private use, do so in accordance with the decency and morality of this country. We must make sure that what they photograph is the right thing.\\" The bill was passed with three readings and within three days. The Censorship Board was run by Tobias Banda.

Life The eldest son of Richard Wright, he was born at Blakeney, Norfolk, on 7 February 1764. His father was a labourer; his mother, Anne (d. 11 October 1810), claimed cousinship with Sir John Fenn. A relative (who died in 1776) sent him to school, and would have done more had his parents not become dissenters. He served as page, and was apprenticed to a shopkeeper, joined (1780) the independent church at Guestwick under John Sykes (d. 1824), and began village preaching on week nights; for which he was excommunicated. The Wesleyans allowed Wright to preach, but he did not join them.. For a short time he ministered to a newly formed General Baptist congregation at Norwich. Here he made the acquaintance of Samuel Fisher, who had been dismissed on a moral charge from the ministry of St. Mary's Particular Baptist church, Norwich, and had joined the Sabellian Particular Baptists, founded by John Johnson. Fisher ministered for periods of six months alternately at a chapel in Deadman's Lane, Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, and a chapel erected (1778) by his friends in Pottergate Street, Norwich: Wright was engaged to alternate with Fisher at both places. Shortly the arrangement was broken, and Wright gave his whole time to Wisbech. His views rapidly changed; he brought his congregation with him from Calvinism to unitarianism. Some time after they had been disowned by the Johnsonian Baptists, he gained their admission to the General Baptist assembly. His influence extended to the General Baptist congregation at Lutton, Lincolnshire, which had become universalist (1790). This introduced him (1797) to William Vidler, to whose periodical, the Universalist's Miscellany, he contributed (in the last half of 1797) a series of letters (reprinted Edinburgh, 1797). Vidler and he exchanged visits, and he made Vidler a unitarian (by 1802). At this time Wright wrote much on universalism. Wright began to travel as a missionary, and in 1806 the Unitarian Fund was established in London, with Wright as the first travelling missionary. His journeys were mostly on foot; his effectiveness was greater in private than as a preacher. In 1810 he resigned his charge at Wisbech, to devote himself entirely to itinerant work. His travels took him through most parts of England and Wales, and in Scotland as far as Aberdeen. In 1819 the Unitarian Fund brought him to London to superintend the organisation of local preachers. He became (September 1822) minister of a Baptist congregation at Trowbridge, Wiltshire, which he brought into the General Baptist assembly. In 1827 he moved to the charge of a small congregation at Kirkstead, Lincolnshire, where John Taylor had once preached. Here he died on 16 September 1836; a tablet to his memory was set up in Kirkstead chapel. Views Wright was a Biblical fundamentalist in his teaching, following the model of John Biddle. He also acknowledged his legacy to Fausto Sozzini (i.e. Socinianism).‚ÄòOnce, after an evening so spent, he said to me \\"If I stay here much longer you will make a Socinian of me.\\"‚Äô In his discussions and missionary visits around northern England he continually challenged other Christians to address the question of whether Christ wholly died on the cross: \\"to his real person, whatever natures might constitute that person, did the real person who is called Christ actually die?\\".. He taught against the pre- existence of Christ and followed the views of Joseph Priestley and Thomas Belsham in rejecting the virgin birth of Jesus.....

Constructed in 1925, the 14-story building is the only high-rise designed by Charles I. Barber, and has over the years housed the offices of dozens of banks, physicians, and various financial and architectural firms. The Lexington, Tennessee-based First Bank is the current anchor tenant. In 1988, the General Building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its architecture and its role in Knoxville's commercial history. Design Market Street facade The General Building is a 14-story \\"L-shaped\\" building rising on the northwest corner of Church Avenue and Market Street. By 1958, a four-story annex had been added to the rear of the building, giving the first four stories a square shape, rather than an L-shape. The first three stories of the Church and Market facades are covered with a rusticated limestone veneer. All four corners are delineated by concrete quoins along the entire height of the building, and the roof is decorated with a terra cotta cornice. The elevator penthouse atop the building typically bears the name of the anchor tenant (currently First Bank). The main facade, facing Market Street, consists of three arched openings, with the north opening leading to the general lobby, the south leading to the bank lobby, and the middle opening containing a window. The bank lobby is the most elaborate interior room, consisting of arched ceilings and a second-story mezzanine with a balustrade. The general lobby contains marble floors and bronze-plated elevator doors. Much of the building's interior was extensively remodeled in the early 1970s. The General Building is situated near the heart of the Knoxville's Central Business District. Gay Street lies one block to the east, Market Square lies two blocks to the north, and the courthouse and other municipal buildings lie just over a block to the south.

The ELLI index is an annually updated composite indicator summarizing the state of lifelong learning for European countries. The ELLI IT platform is an online portal that provides access to regional data related to learning and socio-economic outcomes in Europe. Index =Description= The ELLI Index is an annual measure of lifelong learning at national and sub-national levels in Europe. The ELLI Index is a composite index created from several other variables. The variables used to create the ELLI Index describe the different learning environments of school, community, work and home life. The variables cover the range of ages from birth to post-retirement. The ELLI Index measures learning in four different domains taken from the UNESCO framework completed by Jacques Delors that include learning to know, learning to do, learning to live together and learning to be.Delors et al. Learning: the treasure within. Report to UNESCO of the International Commission on Education for the 21st Century. UNESCO, 1996. =Conceptual framework: UNESCO dimensions of learning= The ELLI project references the conceptual framework developed by UNESCO's International Commission on Education for the Twenty-first Century under the leadership of Jacques Delors.UNESCO.

Learning: The Treasure Within The conceptual framework of ELLIHoskins, Bryony, Cartwright, Fernando, & Schoof, Ulrich. Making Lifelong Learning Tangible Bertelsmann Stifung, 2010. is a revised version of the UNESCO framework. The revisions are based on changes that reflect the European context and European policy environment and have been adapted according to existing data. The operationalization of the dimensions defined by UNESCO using data sources was developed by the Canadian Council on Learning for the Canadian Composite Learning Index (CLI).Canadian Council on Learning. The four pillars of lifelong learning  Learning to know ‚Äì the formal education system  The dimension of learning to know predominantly assesses the learning of young people within the formal education system. By including data on the formal system, ELLI measures the input and outcomes of the area in which most ministries of education allocate the majority of their budget and on which policy decision making and policy directions currently place their emphasis. In terms of investment, this dimension contains indicators on total expenditure on education and training. The range of learning opportunities for formal education that are included in ELLI are pre-school, school, higher education and adult education institutions. This pillar also measures learning outcomes from traditional core disciplines such as math, science and reading in secondary schools, as well as completion and attainment rates for post-secondary education. The learning to know pillar covers the majority of the political priorities related to education as stated by European member states.European Council and European Commission. Key competences for a changing world: Draft 2010 joint progress report of the Council and the Commission on the implementation of the Education & Training 2010 work programme. European Council and European Commission, 2010.European Council. Europe 2010: A new European strategy for growth and jobs. European Council, 2010.  Learning to do ‚Äì vocational learning  This dimension measures the participation rates, learning opportunities and investment (by employers, government and individuals) in job-related skills. These skills can improve economic performance and social inclusion through increasing job prospects and career opportunities for the individual and improve competitiveness of the enterprise, region or country.Feinstein, L. The contribution of adult learning to health and social capital Routledge: Oxford Review of Education, 2004.Extending the learning curve. Telegraph-Journal, 2010. This dimension predominantly measures adults‚Äô continual professional development at their place of work through formal, non- formal and informal learning opportunities. It also measures students‚Äô participation in the vocational track of the formal education system which, depending on the country/region, can also include young people within compulsory education. The variables used to construct this dimension predominantly reflect investment in learning by employers, government and individuals.  Learning to live together ‚Äì learning for social cohesion  This dimension measures individual-level attitudes and dispositions that promote social cohesion such as trust, intercultural competence and political and community engagement.Putnam, R. Bowling alone: The collapse and revival of American community. Simon and Schuster, 2000. Learning and education has long been considered more than an issue of creating skills for employability and has been part of a social policy tool to sustain democracy, create social mobility and increase levels of health and social inclusion.Dewey, J. Democracy and education: An introduction to the philosophy of education. Free Press, 1916/1966. This dimension tries to capture the learning of the values of democracy, tolerance and trust and the skills and interest to be able to engage other people. Learning to live together starts at home, with learning from parents and siblings, and continues through interactions at school and work and through involvement in civil society organizations. In most European countries there is a specific curriculum subject on citizenship through which many of these competences are developed; however, research has indicated that it is the level of democracy at school that is the key driver for developing these competences.Benton, T et al. Citizenship Education Longitudinal Study (CELS): Sixth Annual Report. Young people's civic participation in and beyond school: Attitudes, intentions and influences. DCSF, 2008. The investment of individuals, families, communities and countries is often much more hidden for the learning to live together dimension as there are fewer exams and qualifications in this field compared to traditional subject-based disciplines.  Learning to be ‚Äì learning as personal growth  This dimension predominantly measures self-directed learning and individuals‚Äô efforts and investment in learning. This learning is facilitated by government provision and information provided on learning opportunities, but these provisions are considerably less than the provisions for compulsory formal education.Schuller, T and Watson, D. Learning through life: Inquiry into the future for lifelong learning. Niace, 2009. This dimension captures informal and implicit learning that happens through engagement and participation in the home and through community and cultural activities. The implicit learning measures include activities undertaken in which the individual does not set out with a learning objective in mind and for which there is no certification of learning achievements from participation. Nevertheless, learning is often highly successful through this style of learning because participation is usually motivated by personal interest. Learning in the home often makes use of the internet, incidental access to information, virtual communities and virtual relationships. In addition to implicit learning, there is one indicator in this dimension on explicit participation in lifelong learning. This indicator, which could potentially fit in all dimensions, is placed here because individuals participate in learning for many reasons. Ultimately, participation in lifelong learning is largely voluntary, which means that those who choose to engage in it are more likely to be motivated by the interests of personal growth and development, which is the focus of this dimension. =Purpose= ELLI is a heuristic for understanding lifelong learning across Europe.Happiness must be learned. G√ºtersloh, 2009. In this context, lifelong learning is understood as a continual process of personal and social development and is understood to reflect not only the benefits that employability and a competitive economy offer but also the individual and social benefits of health, happiness and citizen empowerment.Akerman, R. Vorlaus, J. and Brown J.The social and personal benefits of learning: a comprehensive review of international research. Bertelsmann Stiftung, (forthcoming). According to this perspective, the objectives of learning need to reflect a holistic understanding of the individual and combine a variety of knowledge, skills, values and attitudes. From this perspective, the aim of learning is to enhance the qualities of self-esteem, resilience and a positive attitude towards learning and to develop critical thinking and the ability to learn new things. The ELLI index is the first composite index used to describe lifelong learning in Europe. =Uses and limitations= The ELLI Index can be used to understand how a country or region is performing in relation to others in the field of lifelong learning. The ELLI Index should be interpreted as the a summary of the context and outcomes of lifelong learning as they relate to the social and economic well-being of regions.Cartwright, Fernando & Rhode, Martin. Methodological Basis of the ELLI Index The ELLI Index does not provide an in-depth evaluation of a country or region's policy and performance on lifelong learning. The assumptions used in the creation of the ELLI Index may not be an appropriate basis for comparison for all contexts. When the results are taken out of their specific context there is the risk that they may be oversimplified or misused to make biased or partisan specific policy claims.Saisana, Michaela, et al. Handbook on constructing composite indicators. Methodology and user guide. JRC/OECD, 2008. The ELLI Index is a starting point for analysis; specific research questions may be more appropriately addressed with more specific data. =Methodology = The ELLI Index is created using a statistical algorithm to combine data provided by statistical agencies and commercial providers into five values for each region with sufficient data. This method uses a combination of principal components analysis and linear regression to produce the values for the sub-indices representing the separate learning dimensions. The values for the four learning dimensions are combined to produce the overall ELLI index using inverse-variance weighting. This methodology was developed for the CLI and subsequently validated by an independent review and sensitivity analysis Saisana, Michaela. 2007 Composite Learning Index: Robustness Issues and Critical Assessment. Joint Research Centre: European Communities, 2008. =ELLI Index Europe 2010 ‚Äì results= The overall ELLI Index results show that the Nordic countries Denmark, Sweden and Finland and, in addition, the Netherlands rank highest. Particularly Denmark and Sweden have been the most successful countries in Europe at implementing the idea of lifelong and lifewide learning. The top performers are followed by a group of countries that consist of mainly Central European and Anglo-Saxon countries. The next group of countries, which are below the EU average, are from Southern and Eastern Europe and range from the Czech Republic to Poland. The lowest performing group of countries is also in Southern and Eastern Europe, including Hungary, Greece, Bulgaria and Romania. However, there are many exceptions to these general patterns. Slovenia, a former communist country and new member of the European Union, performs well, scoring above the EU average and on par with Germany. Further details are documented in: Bertelsmann Stiftung, The ELLI Index 2010, Making Lifelong Learning Tangible. IT platform The ELLI IT platform (www.elli.org) provides access to regional data related to learning and socio-economic outcomes in Europe.Bertelsmann Stiftung. ELLI Portal Theplatform is a web application interface to a geodatabase. Currently the regional units in the database are the 27 countries of the European Union and subnational administrative units (NUTS levels defined by Eurostat. In the current stage the values for subnational administrative units are only available for Germany. The data populating the databased are provided by Eurostat, regional governments and private data providers.Bertelsmann Stiftung. ELLI Portal Login The ELLI IT platform has basic database application functions of querying and updating. Users may add new data for existing geographic entities but may not create new geographic entities. All queries and updates to the database are managed by the user interface of the ELLI IT platform. Users are provided with tools like scorecards, charting, Google motion charts and mapping that may be used to visualize and communicate the data for a specific region in the platform. All of the data provided by the ELLI IT platform may be displayed on a customizable map. Report on learning Learning takes place on the regional level. Local authorities want to know and manage lifelong learning in the regional level. Therefore, the Bertelsmann Stiftung is developing an ELLI- learning report, which allows to display indicators of learning. The selected indicators are selected according to their importance for steering and monitoring resources for learning and monitoring the results of learning. The ELLI Report on learning is developed in cooperation with the SOFI, G√∂ttingen.  Response  Despite representing a small part of the ELLI project, the majority of the media response has been to the ELLI Index.

It has some facilities for scripting in Python, as well as the creating macros from existing constructions.  Import and export  Kig can import files made by DrGeo and Cabri Geometry as well as its own file format, which is XML-encoded. Kig can export figures in LaTeX format and as SVG (vector graphics) files.  Objects  Kig can handle any classical object of the dynamic geometry, but also: # The center of curvature and osculating circle of a curve; # The dilation, generic affinity, inversion, projective application, homography and harmonic homology; # The hyperbola with given asymptotes; # The B√©zier curves (2nd and 3rd degree); # The polar line of a point and pole of a line with respect to a conic section; # The asymptotes of a hyperbola; # The cubic curve through 9 points; # The cubic curve with a double point through 6 points; # The cubic curve with a cusp through 4 points.  Scripting language  = Inside the figure = Another object is available inside Kig, it is a Python language script. It can accept Kig objects as variables, and always return one object. For example, if there is already a numeric object inside the figure, for example 3, the following Python object can yield its square (9): def square(arg1): return DoubleObject(arg1.value() ** 2) The variables are always called \`arg1\`, \`arg2\` etc. in the order they are clicked upon. Here there is only one variable \`arg1\` and its numerical value is obtained with \`arg1.value()\`. If now one wants to implement the square of a complex number (represented by a point in the Argand diagram), the object which has to be selected at the creation of the script must necessarily be a point, and the script is def csquare(arg1): x = arg1.coordinate().x y = arg1.coordinate().y z = x * x - y * y y = 2 * x * y x = z return Point(Coordinate(x, y)) The abscissa of the point representing the square of the complex number is x^2-y^2 as can be seen by expanding (x+iy)^2=x^2-y^2+i(2xy). \`Coordinate(x,y)\` creates a Python list made of the two coordinates of the new point. And \`Point\` creates the point which coordinates are precisely given by this list. But a Python object inside a figure can only create one object and for more complex figures one has to build the figure with a script: = Figure created by a script = Kig comes up with a little program (written in Python) called \`pykig.py\` which can # load a Python script, e.g. \`MyScript.py\` # build a Kig figure, described by this script # open Kig and display the figure.

Hill of Saul). History The structure was intended to be a summer residence for King Hussein of Jordan, who his grandfather, King Abdullah I, conquered Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank and annexed the territory after the 1948 Arab- Israeli War. Construction started in the mid-1960s, but was interrupted when Israel captured the area during the 1967 War. Still owned by the Hashemite Kingdom, it remains today as found in 1967, an unfinished shell. The hill, located just west of Pisgat Ze'ev overlooking the Arab neighborhood of Shuafat, is 2,754 ft above sea level, making it one of the highest summits in the region. The palace was built in reaction to the locating of the residence of Israel's president in West Jerusalem. Intended to be the official holiday retreat of the Jordanian royal family, it was to be an architectural masterpiece that would host dignitaries from around the world. The design envisaged a grandiose structure consisting of three levels, interconnected with arches plated with Jerusalem stone.Jordanian monarch's villa in Jerusalem turns into shelter for junkies, Xinhua News Agency, November 22, 2010. Construction came to a halt after the 1967 war when Israel took control of the West Bank. The structure was still a building site and was left uncompleted. The skeletal, two-storey cement structure remained empty and has since become a haven for drug users.

By December 2018 de Kogel had two young children. Career De Kogel began his career with the youth team of FC Utrecht. He played senior football as a striker for FC Utrecht, VVV-Venlo, Almere City, Go Ahead Eagles and Cornell√†, scoring 53 goals in 168 league appearances. De Kogel's career ended following a serious car accident in Salini, Malta, on 11 June 2018. De Kogel was visiting the island on holiday with friends. De Kogel had to be cut out of the car he was travelling in by the fire service. He underwent hours of surgery, and doctors doubted that he would ever walk again, let alone play football. Four days after the accident his former club FC Utrecht paid for de Kogel to be flown back to the Netherlands, where he spent a further six weeks in hospital. Doctors suggested a prosthetic knee, although de Kogel was opposed to that. Following the accident his Spanish club Cornell√† stopped paying his salary, and the insurance company of the taxi driver responsible for the accident did not make a payout. Settlement was reached with Cornell√† in December 2018 following the intervention of both the Dutch and Spanish players' associations. However, de Kogel was still involved in legal proceedings related to the accident in March 2019. Six months after the accident, de Kogel was still undergoing rehabilitation at a military centre in Doorn, from Monday to Friday every week. In December 2018 de Kogel was considering his future, whether in or outside of football. Later that month he returned to football as a youth coach at SV Houten. Eight months after the accident de Kogel was still walking with crutches. Due to his financial difficulties, a FC Utrecht fan started a collection for de Kogel. There were donations from fans of numerous clubs, the sale of shirts and pennants, and a charity match between Jong FC Utrecht and Go Ahead Eagles, which de Kogel symbolically 'kicked off'. The total raised was just under ‚Ç¨24,000, from donations, sales, and match proceeds. Professional footballer Hakim Ziyech later contributed.

When the weather is fine it is possible to walk to the island through the shallow water. The island is a protected nature reserve. It is known for its pink sand beaches, created by tidal and wave-induced deposits of pigmented microorganisms living in a symbiotic relationship with native seaweed. Greek War of Independence At the highest point on the island there is a plaque that commemorates a tragic event. On Easter Sunday of 18 April 1824 several hundred Greeks, mostly women and children, were killed on Elafonisi by Ottoman soldiers. To avoid advancing Turkish Ottoman troops, forty armed men had taken refuge on the island with women, children and old folk where they were waiting for a ship to take them to the Ionian Islands. The Ottoman soldiers had decided to camp on the beach opposite the island. One of their horses walked along the shallow water to the island and the people hiding on the island were discovered. According to several sources there were between 640 and 850 people in total, most of whom were killed and the remaining survivors were sold into slavery in Egypt.Website of local Kissamos, Mythymna and Inachorio (Greek)Article in Ta Nea newspaper of 17 August 2007 (Greek)Alan Hall: Walking in Western Crete: 45 walks in Kissamos and Selinos, S.200 (English) Shipwreck of the Imperatrix A large wooden cross commemorates a shipwreck from 22 February 1907.

Biography =Early career= Watanabe was a native of Komaki, Aichi, as the eldest of a tobacco merchant, Wada Takeemon. His father went bankrupt, and Watanabe was forced to quit middle school and was adopted by a farmer named Watanabe Shobei, taking his surname at the age of 19. At the age of 20 he was accepted as an officer cadet and graduated from the 8th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in June 1897. On graduation, he was assigned to the IJA 19th Infantry Regiment and was promoted to lieutenant in November 1899. He entered the 17th class of the Army Staff College in December 1900. On graduation at the head of his class in December 1903, he was promoted to captain, and made a squad leader in the IJA 36th Infantry Regiment, which he accompanied to Manchuria during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905. At the end of the war, he was reassigned to the Imperial General Headquarters and the following year was appointed as an aide to General Yamagata Aritomo. He was sent as a military attach√© to China in 1906 and Germany in 1907, and was promoted to major in December 1908. Watanabe returned to Germany as a military attach√© attached to the Japanese embassy in Berlin from May 1909 to June 1910, and on his return to Tokyo was assigned to the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff. In November 1910, Field Marshal Yamagata again requested that Watanabe be appointed as his aide, and Watanabe served Yamagata again until February 1915. In the interim, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel in June 1913. In February 1915, after the start of World War I, Watanabe was assigned to the IJA 3rd Infantry Regiment. He transferred back to the General Staff in May 1916, and was promoted to colonel in July of the same year. In October 1917, he was sent as a military attach√© to the Japanese embassy at Brussels, Belgium, where he was able to study first-hand on the effects of mechanized warfare. =As general= In August 1920, Watanabe was promoted to major general, and assumed command of the IJA 29th Infantry Brigade. He returned to the General Staff as Head of the 4th Bureau in September 1922. In May 1925, Watanabe was promoted to lieutenant general, and became commandant of the Army Staff College. In May 1926, he was commander of the IJA 7th Division. From March 1929, he commanded the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force, and from June 1930 was the commander of the Taiwan Army. In August 1931, Watanabe was recalled to Tokyo and promoted to full general and military councilor with oversight over Army aviation. In July 1935, he was promoted to one of the most prestigious posts within the Imperial Japanese Army, that of Inspector General of Military Training, replacing Jinzabur≈ç Masaki. Masaki was a close associate of General Sadao Araki and his Imperial Way Faction, promoting totalitarian, militarist, and expansionist ideals, whereas Watanabe had a reputation as a moderate. Many of the rebel officers of the February 26 Incident respected Masaki and blamed Watanabe for the personnel change. On his appointment, he gave a press conference in which he stated his belief that the Army should be under the control of the Ministry of the Army, thus implying his support for civilian control over the military, greatly incensing the Imperial Way Faction supporters. AISN B07BDNTDM4 Watanabe was the only active-duty military person on the rebel target list. Rebel soldiers surprised Watanabe at home in Ogikubo during the February 26 Incident, machine-gunning him to death in front of his wife and daughter. His grave is at Tama Cemetery in Tokyo. His daughter, Kazuko, was a classmate of future Empress Michiko, and later became a Catholic nun.

It was established in June 1949 and is administered by the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent De Paul and St. Louise De Calamari. The school offers Preschool, Primary and Secondary Education for boys and girls (Coed). It is located in Quezon City.  History  In 1750, Mother Paula, of the Third Order of St. Dominic, sailed from Spain to the Philippines with the intent to provide a home for poor and abandoned children. She founded a house she called Beater De Santa Rosa, named in honor of St. Rose of Lima, where she began to take care of children. After Mother Paula's death, the house was placed under Royal Patronage. The Royal Audience, through its regent, His Excellency, D.S. Trevino, sought to assist the Daughters of Charity by continuing the work. In 1866, Sister Pervasive, Carmen, and Eustacia De Lara took over Beater, and with the approval of its board of directors, changed its name to Collegial De Santa Rosa. In addition to providing a home for young girls, the Sisters insured the girls received a thorough Catholic education. The school enjoyed the support of the Spanish government and wealthy families of that time. It was able to withstand the revolution and a nearby earthquake. Over time, it grew into an elite school for girls. In 1933‚Äì34, the High School Home Economics was opened. Two years later, the Junior Normal College was inaugurated. On December 27, 1941, a bomb dropped by the Japanese destroyed the school. The Sisters sought refuge in Concordia College, the provincial house of the Daughters of Charity. In spite of the war, the Sisters continued their mission of caring for homeless children and teaching catechism. They engaged in needlework to support themselves. When liberation came in 1943, Mrs. Warner, an American who stayed with the Sisters, offered her home at Manga Avenue in Santa Mesa, Manila as a new school site. They were able to reopen the primary school and offer a special course in needlework and handicraft. In 1946, with Sister Carmen Reta, D.C. as Visitatrix, a building in Santa Mesa was bought. There, the Sisters resumed their operation. In October, the Board of Directors of Santa Rosa proposed for the Sisters' return to the former site, Intramuros. The Sisters refused due to the fact that they would have to accept certain conditions, such as having to relinquish the name Colegio de Santa Rosa. Instead, they adopted the name Immaculate Heart of Mary College. The Sisters were then faced with the task of putting up a college of their own. Due to their hard work, cooperation, and guidance, the school's population grew and its buildings were expanded. In 1952, The Sisters bought a lot in Quezon City where the college presently stands. A four-story, U-shaped building was built. It was inaugurated on February 2, 1957, along with the unveiling image of Our Lady at the campus rotunda, by Father Zacaraias Subinas, C.M. In 1957, the school launched an expansion under Sister Filomena Zulueta, D.C. Additional wings were built to house the chapel and the auditorium. New equipment and facilities were installed. Saint Joseph's Home was completed in 1959. From 1963-1972 an additional wing was constructed, the Sacred Heart Building, to house primary school classrooms. Personnel upgrading was undertaken and lay members joined the administrative staff. However, competition led to inadequate enrollment, and the College Department was phased out. The school has continued upgrading itself. In 1983, the individual Reading Program was implemented. The Basic Education Department (BED) had its Congregational Evaluation Visit (CEV) on March 3‚Äì5, 1986.

His autobiographical essay \\"Rescue\\" (included in A Memory, a Monologue, a Rant, and a Prayer) has been performed internationally. He moderated the men's panel at the New Orleans Superdome for V to the Tenth in 2008. Matousek is currently working on a theatrical piece called Breaking Out the Man Box (with playwright James Lecesne), which will serve as V-Men's artistic vehicle (as Ensler's \\"The Vagina Monologues\\" launched V-Day). A popular writing instructor, he has taught memoir at Manhattanville College in Purchase, New York, as well as the Omega Institute in Rhinebeck, and The New York Open Center. Matousek is a member of PEN International and a core faculty member of Old Stone Farm, a wellness center in Staatsburg, New York.

This Palayam is also referred to in the early records as Vadagarai or Vadhagerri. Earlier location This Maravar palaiyam was located in the Sankarankovil taluk, in the former Tirunelveli province of the Nayak kingdom of Madurai. Internal Civil war In 1781, after a civil struggle lasting 12 years, Vellaya Thevar finally defeated Periyaswami Chempuli Chinnanja Thevar and became the polegar. His success \\"in recovering the estate brought about a complete change in the relations between the Company and the palaiyam.\\" Vellaya Thevar was an active supporter of the Company, while the camp of Periyaswami Chinnanja Thevar sought help from the polygars of Sivagiri and Panchalamkurichi to regain his estate. A certain Peddaswami Thevar, a son of Irula Nanji Thevar, enlisted the aid of several polygars and besieged Chokkampatti for five months. Their siege had to be lifted when Colonel Fullarton descended upon them. In retaliation for the help given by Sivagiri and Panchalamkurichi (qq.v.) to his rival, Vellaya Thevar assisted Fullarton in storming their positions in 1784. After the \\"Period of Assignment\\" came to an end in 1785, Vellaya Thevar‚Äôs position as a friend of the English became untenable. \\"When the sima came under the administration of the Diwanam, Etubar Khan was appointed to hold charge of affairs at Tirunelveli. Vellaya Thevar got into disfavour with him on account of his refusal to give him bribes and presents as much as he wanted. At this time, Periyaswami Thevar, son of Irula Nanji Thevar, pleased Etubar Khan by paying him a large amount of money and though his help got the estate of Chokkampatti transferred to his name.\\" A nawabi army restored Periyaswami Chinananja Thevar and forced Vellaya Thevar to flee Chokkampatti in 1787. On his death, three years later, the estate passed to his minor son. The exiled Vellaya Thevar, the ninth polygar of the line (and also known as Rama Bhadra II) continued to cultivate the Company‚Äôs friendship and in 1796 the Government decided that his restoration \\"was no less an act of justice than of policy\\". Post Polygar war At the end of the First Polegar War in 1799, the polygar of Chokkampatti surrendered two forts and 100 armed men to Major J. Bannerman. In 1803 he received his sanad as zamindar and was confirmed in an estate that comprised 18 villages. His son, who succeeded him in 1810, rebelled against the Government and his estate was sequestered in 1834; it was restored to his son and heir in 1859. By 1866, the new zamindar had gone bankrupt. In 1868, the zamindari of Chokkampatti was auctioned to pay back taxes. It was divided into 18 parcels whose owners were known as mitadars.

The material has a particle size ranging from 20 mm to 75 micrometres and can be categorized as a soft aggregate. It contains mainly silica, alumina, iron oxide, and magnesia.http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt;=18959384http://trb.metapress.com/content/n766814mj7n78588/  Use of kimberlite tailings  = In detergent = The present invention provides a process for the preparation of detergent builder Zeolite-A from Kimberlite tailing generated as solid waste during diamond mining is disclosed. The process comprises, reacting an acid treated Kimberlite tailing with alkali solution to obtain sodium silicate and reacting it with alkaline aluminum source at room temperature and crystallizing at higher temperature to obtain Zeolite-A. The product is useful as builder in detergent formulation. = In rural roads = With a view to assessing the potential use of kimberlite tailings in road works, the Central Road Research Institute engaged in a detailed laboratory study. Kimberlite tailings were characterized to determine their physical engineering properties. Results indicate that kimberlite tailings are a marginal material and possess adequate strength for use in the construction of rural roads. The feasibility of utilizing this material for the construction of various layers of road pavement by adopting stabilization techniques was investigated. A study was also undertaken to assess the suitability of this material for use in bituminous mixes. The laboratory studies indicate that kimberlite tailings can be used in subbase and base course layers in a road pavement. They can also be used in bituminous macadam as the base course and in premix carpet as a wearing course. A 1-km- long road was constructed near the diamond mine using kimberlite tailings, and its performance was monitored during a period of 1 full year. The road's performance was found to be satisfactory. However, since kimberlite is one of the fastest weathering rocks found on the surface of the Earth it is doubtful at best that it could ever be used as a construction material. In fact kimberlite exposed to water or air will alter to serpentine soil with very fine particles extremely fast. Some mines use this characteristic and stockpile kimberlite ore in outside pits and after a couple of years it can then be processed without any crushing hence better preserving the diamonds it contains. = Hydrated amorphous silica = New process is described for the preparation of free flowing hydrated amorphous silica from kimberlite tailing. The process comprises treating of kimberlite with acid, further reacting it with alkali solution to obtain soluble metal silicate solution, which is subsequently neutralized with mineral acid to polymerize silica as insoluble precipitates. The products is useful in rubber, paints as abrasive etc. = sorption of arsenic from the groundwater = The experiments were conducted to investigate the sorption of arsenic from the groundwater onto kimberlite tailings in two phases - batch studies and column studies. In batch studies, the effects of different factors such as pH, adsorbent dose and adsorbent size on the performance of kimberlite tailings were investigated. Adsorption kinetics and equilibrium isotherm studies were also carried out. The adsorption capacity of kimberlite tailings was calculated as 0.25 mg/g of adsorbent. In column studies, the performance of fixed-bed kimberlite tailings was studied and the adsorption capacity was found to be 0.27 mg/g of adsorbent. Film diffusion was found to be the rate-limiting factor for the removal of arsenic by kimberlite tailings. Adsorption of arsenic was found to be pH dependent and higher removal efficiencies were observed near neutral pH range. The arsenic uptake increased with increase in adsorbent dose. Spent kimberlite tailings could be regenerated with dilute NaOH. The proposed treatment methodology was applied to the groundwater samples collected from various places of North 24-Parganas district situated in West Bengal, India. The samples were analyzed for the presence of total arsenic. The arsenic contamination of groundwater was found to be location specific in North 24-Parganas district. The maximum arsenic concentration at certain places was found to be many folds more than the WHO recommended limits. The treatment of arsenic contaminated water samples with kimberlite tailings showed 90-94% removal in 12 hours. The present study can be used as a basis for designing and developing filter columns, which can be attached to the tube wells for low cost and effective removal of arsenic.

It was typical of the apartment blocks that were built in Davenport near the turn of the 20th century. (pages 1-30 of PDF document) It was advantageously located near the expanding campus of Palmer College of Chiropractic, along a streetcar line and within walking distance of the downtown area. Palmer College now owns the building. Architecture Argyle Flats is a three-story structure built on a raised basement. Its basic form is compact and rectilinear. It rises three floors above an exposed basement and features an asymmetrical facade. The smooth brick walls contrast with the rough textures of the cornices that feature Romanesque Revival corbelling and round-arched windows on the attic level in pointed gables that rise above the coping. with Decorative details are found at the building's main entrances and on the cornice. The cornice itself continues across the deeply recessed hyphen between the two facades, which minimizes the reality that the building is two separate blocks. Argyle Flats also features full-height, polygonal, projecting window bays. There are two entrances in the main facade that each lead to flats on one side of a bearing or party wall. The exteriors of both sides of the building are a mirror-image of the other, which is typical of the city's double houses.

It was built in 1736 by Charles Cobbe, Archbishop of Dublin, and remained the property of his Cobbe descendants until 1985. It was then acquired by Dublin County Council, in a unique arrangement, under which Newbridge House would remain the family home. Set within 400 acres of partially wooded parkland, Newbridge House is one of the finest surviving examples of Georgian architecture. Background Newbridge House main entrance On June 19, 1736, Charles Cobbe, then Bishop of Kildare, paid ¬£5,526.5.6 for the townlands of Donabate, Lainstown, Haggardstown and Newbridge, containing 490 acres. However Bishop Cobbe had a prior interest in these lands, having come to the financial assistance of the Weyms family (port owners) some years earlier. when they had difficulty in repaying a mortgage taken out on the lands. On 21 July 1742 Bishop Cobbe made his second purchase of lands in the parish. These consisted of the townlands of Kilcreagh, Corballis and Baltra, containing in all 510 acres. The purchase price was ¬£6,425.00. As with the first purchase the Cobbe interest came into being through the owner, Maurice Keating, having difficulty in repaying a mortgage. The final purchase of land by the Cobbe family was made in 1811, when Charles purchased the fields north of Newbridge Demesne and bordering on Turvey Avenue. The Archbishop was succeeded by his son, Thomas, who in 1751 married Lady Elizabeth Beresford, daughter of the Earl of Tyrone. She brought a dowry with her, thus enabling major improvements to be made to the house. In the Red Drawing Room, added by them, they lavishly entertained and hung many superb pictures purchased on their behalf by the incumbent of Donabate Church, the Rev. Matthew Pilkington, who was well qualified to do the buying, as it was he who composed the first major English Dictionary of Painters. Their eldest son, Charles Cobbe, died in 1798, when their eldest grandson, another Charles, became heir apparent. He joined the army, served in India, and returned to Bath in 1805. Four years later he married Frances Conway and immediately came to live at Newbridge, where he carried out much refurbishing with the aid of his wife's money. During the family's absence in Bath, the Estate had become run down. Charles's considerable energies were used to build it up again. He threw down the \\"wretched mud cabins\\" occupied by his tenants and built new houses on his estate which were paid for by the sale of some of the family's most prized paintings, such as the Gastor Poussin and a Hobbema. Charles Cobbe died in 1857 and was succeeded by his son, another Charles. He, in turn, died in 1886, leaving no male issue, his estate passing to his wife for her lifetime. Before her death she persuaded Thomas Maberley Cobbe, a grandnephew of her late husband, to return to Newbridge from America to take over the estate. He died young in 1914, leaving two infant sons, Thomas and Francis, of whom the latter died in 1949. Thomas did not marry, and on his death in 1985 he was succeeded by Francis's family, Hugh, Alec, and Mary. The property was then acquired by the County Council, but the Cobbe family will continue to reside at Newbridge House from time to time, due to a special arrangement with the County Council. = Lanestown castle = One of the earliest and largest structures still standing in the Donabate locality is Lanestown castle, a late medieval castellated tower house located in the grounds of Newbridge House. It was originally the largest of four tower houses in the immediate area north of the Broad Meadow estuary along with Portrane Castle (Stella's Tower), Turvey (now demolished) and Donabate (attached St. Patrick's Church of Ireland Church). The tower was probably part of the ¬£10 Castle scheme initiated in 1429 by King Henry VI in which a landowner would be funded ¬£10 if he built a defensive tower to aid in protecting the Pale. Mansion Newbridge House was built by Archbishop Cobbe between 1747 and 1752 to the design of architect James Gibbs. Newbridge still contains most of its original furniture. The interiors include the Red Drawing Room, the Museum of Curiosities and ornate plasterwork found throughout the house. The house now offers tours of both the house and farm for money, alongside public events throughout the year. =Shakespeare portrait= The Cobbe Portrait is an unattributed panel painting of William Shakespeare painted from memory,believed by some to be the only surviving painting of Shakespeare. Support for this theory is drawn from the inheritance of the portrait by the Cobbe family from Shakespeare's patron, Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, and its resemblance to the Janssen portrait, a long-standing candidate to be a portrait of Shakespeare. Scientific examination has dated the panel and paint used to Shakespeare's lifetime, but the claim that it is of Shakespeare has been regarded with scepticism. The Cobbe Portrait of William Shakespeare Family From 1736 until 1985, Newbridge Estate served as the ancestral home of the Cobbe family. Estate and farm Newbridge Demesne opened as a County Dublin Regional Park in 1986. It consists of approximately 400 acres of gently undulating pastureland, woodland, watercourses and pleasure grounds. The estate still maintains a small farm, including a fine, square cobbled courtyard adjoining the house that was designed by Robert Mack, and built about 1790 after the completion of the main house.

The series premiered on American and Canadian television on September 25, 2006. The first season, which finished 21st of 142 American primetime television programs in Nielsen ratings, was released on DVD and HD DVD on August 28, 2007. The Blu-ray was released on August 26, 2008. Within the seasons of the show are \\"volumes\\", which allow the writers to focus on shorter story arcs. The first season comprises a single volume of 23 episodes called Genesis, which is also the same title of the show's pilot episode. Plot The plot of Heroes is designed to be similar to the stories of comic books with small story arcs built into the series' larger story arc plot. Each season of Heroes is designed to involve ordinary people who discover extraordinary super powers, and how these abilities take effect in the character's daily lives. The first season, known as \\"Genesis\\", begins as a seemingly ordinary group of people gradually becomes aware that they have special abilities. Events illustrate their reactions to these powers, and how the discovery affects their personal and professional lives. At the same time, several ordinary individuals are investigating the origins and extent of these abilities. Mohinder continues his late father's research into the biological source of the change, while Noah represents a secret organization known only as \\"The Company\\". While coping with these new abilities, each of the characters is drawn, willingly or unwillingly, into the Company's conspiracy to control superpowered people and into a race to stop an explosion from destroying New York City. Meanwhile, focus is placed on Peter Petrelli as he tries to maintain his volatile power, and Sylar, a serial killer hunting superhumans. Cast and characters *Milo Ventimiglia as Peter Petrelli, the protagonist; a nurse and Nathan's brother, gains the abilities of evolved humans who come near him. *Hayden Panettiere as Claire Bennet, a high school cheerleader with the power of rapid cellular regeneration. Marc Hirschfeld, executive vice president of casting for NBC Universal Television stated, \\"When they were trying to decide who the cheerleader should be, I literally picked up the phone and said to the producers, 'You've got to meet Hayden Panettiere.'\\"How the 'Heroes' cheerleader got the part *Jack Coleman as Noah Bennet, or \\"Horn-Rimmed Glasses\\" (recurring episodes 1 to 10), Claire's father and employee of the Company. *Tawny Cypress as Simone Deveaux, Peter's friend and Isaac's girlfriend. *Leonard Roberts as D. L. Hawkins, a convict who can walk through solid objects. *Santiago Cabrera as Isaac Mendez, a painter and drug addict with the ability to paint the future. *Masi Oka as Hiro Nakamura, an office worker possesses the ability of space-time manipulation. This allows him to teleport, stop time, or travel through time, but recent events in the series have prevented him from regaining his full abilities. Hiro was one of the last main characters to be created by Tim Kring; he was added to the pilot episode after Kring's wife noticed none of the existing main characters were happy about their powers. *Greg Grunberg as Matt Parkman is a police officer with the power to read minds. *Adrian Pasdar as Nathan Petrelli, an anti-hero and New York senator who can fly. *Noah Gray-Cabey as Micah Sanders, Niki and D.L.'s son and a technopath. * Ali Larter as Niki Sanders, D.L. Hawkin's wife and Micah Sanders' mother. She is a single mother with a dangerous alter-ego and super-strength. ** Larter also plays Jessica Sanders, Niki's split personality. *Sendhil Ramamurthy as Mohinder Suresh, a scientist who continues his father's research on super-powered humans. =Recurring characters= Episodes Production =Conception= Heroes began development early in 2006, when Tim Kring, creator of NBC's Crossing Jordan, came up with the show's concept. Kring wanted to create a \\"large ensemble saga\\" that would connect with the audience. He began thinking about how big, scary and complicated he felt the world is, and wanted to create a character-driven series about people who could do something about it. Kring felt that a cop or medical drama did not have characters that were big enough to save the world. He came up with the thought of superheroes; ordinary people who would discover extraordinary abilities, while still rooted in the real world and in reality. Casting directors Jason La Padura and Natalie Hart brought forth a cast of new faces such as Milo Ventimiglia who described the pilot as a \\"character drama about everyday people with a heightened reality.\\" A heightened reality that was brought to light through the work of production designer Ruth Ammon. Kring wanted the series to have touchstones that involved the characters and the world they lived in. Before he began putting his ideas together, he spoke with Lost executive producer Damon Lindelof, with whom he had worked for three years on Crossing Jordan. Kring credits Lindelof for giving him ideas on how to pitch the series to the network and advice on the lessons he (Lindelof) learned about working on a serialized drama. The two still speak and support each other's projects. When Kring pitched the idea for Heroes to the NBC network, he described the network's reaction as \\"excited...very supportive.\\" He comments that he has been partners with NBC for some time based on his six- year run as showrunner for Crossing Jordan. When he pitched the pilot, he described every detail, including the cliffhanger ending. When NBC executives asked him what was going to happen next, Kring responded, \\"Well, you'll just have to wait and find out.\\" After the project was greenlit, a special 73-minute version of the pilot was first screened to a large audience at the 2006 Comic Con in San Diego. It was initially reported that this unaired pilot would not be released, however it was included on the first season DVD set. Reception =Critical reception= During the series' first season, the American Film Institute named Heroes one of the ten \\"best television programs of the year.\\" Doug Elfman of the Chicago Sun-Times stated, \\"the show's super strengths are its well-developed filmmaking, smooth pacing and a perfect cast. It views like the first hour of a fun, thoughtful movie.\\" Barry Garron at The Hollywood Reporter also stated, \\"Heroes is one of TV's most imaginative creations and might, with luck, become this year's Lost.\\" Less favorable reviews included the Philadelphia Inquirer, who commented that although the show had many \\"cool effects,\\" it \\"lands, splat, in a pile of nonsense and dim dialogue.\\" In response to the first pod of season one episodes, The Chicago Tribune went as far as saying, \\"you could watch the first few episodes of Heroes, or you could repeatedly hit yourself on the head with a brick. The effect is surprisingly similar.\\" On Rotten Tomatoes, the first season received an 83% approval rating, with average rating of 8.04/10, based on 18 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \\"The first season of Heroes promises a fresh take on the superhero genre, with enough style and foreshadowed intrigue to attract a following.\\" At Metacritic, the Heroes pilot received a 67/100, with generally favorable reviews from critics. =Ratings= U.S. viewers for each episode in the series, broken down into its five volumes. The pilot episode generated 14.3 million viewers, with the season high topping out at 16.03 million viewers for episode 9. When the series returned from hiatus on January 22, 2007, the ratings averaged about the same as the pilot with 14.9 million viewers. When the show went on a second hiatus during the first season, from March 4, 2007 to April 23, 2007 (7 weeks), ratings hit a new low; the lowest being 11.14 million viewers during part one of the three part finale, \\"The Hard Part.\\" =Awards and nominations= By the time Heroes completed the first half of the first season, the show had already collected an assortment of honors and accolades. On December 13, 2006, the Writers Guild of America nominated the program for \\"best new series\\" of 2007. On December 14, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association nominated the program for a Golden Globe Award for \\"best television drama\\", and nominated Masi Oka (Hiro Nakamura) for Best Supporting Actor on a TV Series. On January 9, 2007, Heroes won the award for Favorite New TV Drama at the 33rd People's Choice Awards.

Historical context When the Republic of Turkey invaded the Republic of Cyprus in 1974 many thousands of Cypriots were displaced from their homes and their land and have since been prevented from enjoying their use. Since 1974, homes have been built on land that is still owned by displaced Cypriots and those new homes have been sold to buyers, who may not have known that the land that the homes were built on was still owned by displaced Cypriots. Parties =Plaintiffs= The plaintiffs were Michalis Toumazou, Nicolas Kantzilaris and Maroulla Tompazou. The class action was to be brought on behalf of all displaced Cypriots, and others, who are victims of alleged property crimes committed by the commercial entity called the TRNC (representing the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, a country which is not recognised by the United States) and HSBC Bank USA's participation in the alleged laundering of funds for that commercial entity.

Life Elisabeth Kuyper was born in Amsterdam, the eldest of three children. At the age of twelve, she began the formal study of music at the Maatschappij tot Bevordering der Toonkunst with Antoon Averkamp, Louis Coenen, and Daniel de Lange. She began composing at an early age, including a piano sonata and a prelude and fugue, which she performed for her diploma examination in 1895, and a one-act opera that was performed in Amsterdam in 1895. She moved to Berlin in 1896 to continue her composition studies with Heinrich Barth and Leopold Carl Wolff at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik, completing her studies there in 1900. In 1901, Kuyper became the first woman to be admitted to study composition at the Meisterschule f√ºr Komposition, led by Max Bruch. She was quite productive as a composer during her master classes with Bruch, including creating a violin sonata, a ballad for cello and orchestra, and a serenade for orchestra. Max Bruch became a great champion of and mentor to Kuyper, and they stayed connected even through his very old age. He conducted many of her compositions, recommended her for stipends from the Dutch government, and even helped her obtain German citizenship. In 1902, A. A. Noske of Middelburg became the first to publish one of Kuyper's compositions: her Sonata for Violin and Piano, which she dedicated to P. W. Janssen. The debut performance of the sonata was on July 18, 1902, at a music festival in the city of Nijmegen, with Elisabeth Kuyper on the piano and Marie Hekker on the violin. On October 1, 1905, Elisabeth Kuyper became the first woman composer to be awarded the Mendelssohn Prize. She then composed perhaps her best known and most played work, the Violin Concerto in B Minor, opus 10. The piece premiered on February 13, 1908 with the Hochschule orchestra conducted by a 70-year-old Max Bruch. In April 1908, she became the first woman to be appointed as a professor of Composition and Theory at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik. Because of the challenges Kuyper faced during her career, she became strongly connected with the women‚Äôs liberation movement of the period. Other than possible soloist performances, professional opportunities for female musicians were extremely limited, as no major orchestras of the time employed female musicians. Kuyper took great effort to bring change this situation. In 1908 she formed a women's choir at the . In 1910 she formed and conducted the Berlin Women Musicians' Orchestra. For the convention of the International Council of Women held in The Hague in 1922, Kuyper assembled an orchestra and choir and led them in the performance of her Festival Cantata. After which, and with the encouragement of Lady Ishbel Aberdeen, Kuyper moved to London in 1923, where she founded the London Women's Symphony Orchestra. In 1924 she founded the American Women's Symphony Orchestra in New York City.Christine Ammer (2001, 2nd edition 2016) gives 1925 for the year Kuyper founded this orchestra: see which also notes that the Women's Orchestral Club had indeed previously been founded in 1924, by Spiering. In 1925 Kuyper returned to Europe and her teaching position at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik in Berlin, then retired to Switzerland. She died in the town of Muzzano, in the Lugano district of Switzerland.

Confectionery manufacture shares many similarities with pharmaceutical production. SweeTarts, an example of a tablet candy A powder or granule mixture is prepared, a dye mold is filled, and then the mixture is compressed and ejected. While drug tablets are constrained to shapes and sizes that can be swallowed easily, candy tablets are designed to be chewable and can take a wider variety of shapes and sizes. The tablet pressing operation Introduction The manufacture of oral solid dosage forms such as tablets is a complex multi-stage process under which the starting materials change their physical characteristics a number of times before the final dosage form is produced. Traditionally, tablets have been made by granulation, a process that imparts two primary requisites to formulate: compatibility and fluidity. Both wet granulation and dry granulation (slugging and roll compaction) are used. Regardless of whether tablets are made by direct compression or granulation, the first step, milling and mixing, is the same; subsequent steps differ. Numerous unit processes are involved in making tablets, including particle size reduction and sizing, blending, granulation, drying, compaction, and (frequently) coating. Various factors associated with these processes can seriously affect content uniformity, bioavailability, or stability. Sizing Sizing (size reduction, milling, crushing, grinding, pulverization) is an important step in the process of tablet manufacturing. In manufacturing of compressed tablets, the mixing or blending of several solid pharmaceutical ingredients is easier and more uniform if the ingredients are about the same size. This provides a greater uniformity of dose. A fine particle size is essential in the case of lubricant mixing with granules for its proper function. Advantages of smaller tablets are as follows: *Increased surface area, which may enhance an active ingredient's dissolution rate and hence bioavailability *Improved tablet-to-tablet content uniformity due to a larger number of particles per unit weight *Controlled particle size distribution of dry granulation or mix to promote better flow of mixture in tablet machine *Improved flow properties of raw materials *Improved colour and/or active ingredient dispersion in tablet excipients *Uniformly sized wet granulation to promote uniform drying The following problems may arise if the process is not controlled properly: *A possible change in polymorphic form of the active ingredient, rendering it less or totally inactive, or unstable *A decrease in bulk density of active compound and/or excipients, which may cause flow problem and segregation in the mix *An increase in surface area from size reduction may promote the adsorption of air, which may inhibit wettability of the drug to the extent that it becomes the limiting factor in dissolution rate Various types of machine may be used for the dry sizing or milling process, depending on whether gentle screening or particle milling is needed. The range of equipment employed for this process includes: *Fluid energy mill *Colloidal mill *Ball mill *Hammer mill *Cutting mill *Roller mill *Conical mill Powder blending The successful mixing of powder is more difficult than mixing liquid, as perfect homogeneity is difficult to achieve. Another problem is the inherent cohesiveness and resistance to movement between the individual particles. The process is further complicated in many systems by the presence of substantial segregation influencing the powder mix. This arises from the difference in size, shape, and density of the component particles. The powder/granules may be blended at the pre-granulation and/or post-granulation stage of tablet manufacturing. Each process of mixing has an optimum mixing time, and longer mixing may result in an undesired product. The optimum mixing time and speed must be evaluated. Blending prior to compression is normally achieved in a simple tumble blender. This be a fixed blender into which the powders are charged, blended and discharged. It is now common to use a bin blender from which the container (bin) can be removed and brought directly to other processing steps.https://www.powderprocess.net/Equipments%20html/Bin_Blender.html In special cases of mixing a lubricant, overmixing should be particularly monitored. The various blenders used include the \\"V\\" blender, oblicone blender, container blender, tumbling blender, and agitated powder blender. Nowadays, to optimize the manufacturing process, particularly in wet granulation, various improved pieces of equipment which combines several processing steps (mixing, granulation and/or drying) are used. These are the mixer granulator and high shear mixing machine. Granulation Following particle size reduction and blending, the formulation may be granulated, which provides homogeneity of drug distribution in the blend. This process is very important and needs experience to attain proper quality of granules before tableting. Quality of granule determines the smooth and trouble free process of tablets manufacturing. If granulation is not done in a proper manner, the resulting mixture may damage the tableting press. Drying Drying is an important step in the formulation and development of a pharmaceutical product. It is important to keep the residual moisture low enough to prevent product deterioration and ensure free flowing properties. The commonly used dryers include the fluidized-bed dryer, vacuum tray dryer, microwave dryer, spray dryer, freeze dryer, turbo-tray dryer, and pan dryer. Tablet compression = Tablet press = After the preparation of granules (in wet granulation) or sized slugs (in dry granulation) or mixing of ingredients (in direct compression), they are compressed to get the final product. The compression is done either by a single-punch machine (stamping press) or by a multi-station machine (rotary press). The tablet press is a high-speed mechanical device. It squeezes the ingredients into the required tablet shape with extreme precision. It can make the tablet in many shapes, although they are usually round or oval. Also, it can press the name of the manufacturer or the product into the top of the tablet. Stage 1: Top punch is withdrawn from the die by the upper cam. Bottom punch is low in the die so powder falls in through the hole and fills the die. Stage 2: Bottom punch moves up to adjust the powder weight. It raises and expels some powder. Stage 3: Top punch is driven into the die by upper cam. Bottom punch is raised by lower cam. Both punch heads pass between heavy rollers to compress the powder. Stage 4: Top punch is withdrawn by the upper cam. Lower punch is pushed up and expels the tablet, which is removed from the die surface by surface plate. Stage 5: Return to stage 1. =Tablet testing= The physical properties of a tablet are tested either by manual or automated sampling and IPC testing (in-process control). Tablet \\"hardness\\", also called \\"breaking force\\", is tested to assure that the tablet's strength will survive all further processes, such as dedusting, coating and packaging. The hardness value of a tablet gives an early indication of the tablet's disintegration time. Further measured parameters are weight, thickness, diameter, disintegration time, friability, and abrasion. Friability and abrasion testing is performed in rotating testing drums, designed according to the pharmacopeia. The measured parameter is weight loss before and after testing and tumbling the tablets at a particular time and speed. In the friability test drum tablets are being carried up by a \\"shovel\\" and dropped. Tablets are also not allowed to fall apart during the test. In the abrasion test, drum tablets are not falling/dropping, but rolling on the ground of the test drum and losing weight due to the friction between tablets. =Tablet deduster= In almost all cases, tablets coming out of a tablet machine have excess powder on their surface which is removed by passing them through a tablet deduster. =Fette machine= The Fette machine chills the compression components to allow the compression of low-melting point substances such as waxes, thereby making it possible to compress products with low melting points. Physical features of compressed tablets Compressed tablets can be round, oblong, or unique in shape; thick or thin; large or small in diameter; flat or convex; unscored or scored in halves, thirds, or quadrants; engraved or imprinted with an identifying symbol and/or code number; coated or uncoated; colored or uncolored; one, two, or three layered. Tablet diameters and shapes are determined by the dies and punches used in compression. The less concave the punches, the flatter the tablets; conversely, the more concave the punches, the more convex the resulting tablets. Punches with raised impressions produce recessed impressions on the tablets; punches with recessed etchings produce tablets with raised impressions or monograms. Logos may be placed on one or on both sides of a tablet, depending on the punches. Packaging Tablets must be packaged before they can be sent out for distribution. The type of packaging depends on the formulation of the medicine. Blister packs are a common form of packaging. They are safe and easy to use, and the user can see the contents without opening the pack. Many pharmaceutical companies use a standard size of blister pack. This saves the cost of different tools and changing the production machinery between products. Sometimes the pack may be perforated so that individual tablets can be detached. This means that the expiry date and the drug's name must be printed on each part of the package. The blister pack itself must remain absolutely flat as it travels through the packaging processes, especially when it is inserted into a carton. Extra ribs are added to the blister pack to improve its stiffness.

Description Artist rendering of a typical wing of Drosophila appendiculata. Red asterisk (*) indicates partial cross veins.Drosophila appendiculata was described by Malloch in 1934 and is distinguished from all other Drosophila species by the three characteristic partial cross-veins on the fourth long vein that intrude into the space between the fourth and fifth long vein. One of these partial cross veins is between the posterior cross vein and the tip of the wing while the other two partial cross veins originate from the fourth long vein between the posterior and anterior cross veins. The wing is transparent, with brownish clouding around the cross veins, including the partial cross veins, and the tip/front of the wing. The flies are generally yellowish-brown with a slightly darker thorax and small black triangle on the tergites of the abdomen. With a size of 5 to 5.5 mm, this species is relative large for the genus Drosophila. The egg have four filaments. J.R. Malloch (1934) Acalyptrata (concluded).

In the Italian dictionary‚ÄîVocabolario della Lingua (Nicola Zanichelli, 1970)‚Äîstregoneria is defined as a magical practice intended to produce harm or illness. The statement that stregoneria refers to a harmful magical practice is supported by ethnologist Elsa Guggino, who states that words related to stregoneria are always used disparagingly to describe someone practicing malevolent magic (Stregoneria: The \\"Old Religion\\" in Italy from Historical to Modern Times, by Marguerite Rigoglioso, 2000). This is also noted by scholar Gary R. Varner, in his book Charles G. Leland: The Man & the Myth, in which he states that the word strega (witch) is a disparaging term used to denote those who practice black magic, and that the term \\"maga\\" is used to denote those who practice white magic and healing. Anthropologist Sabina Magliocco, in her article titled \\"Spells, Saints and Streghe: Folk Magic and Healing in Italy,\\" remarks that \\"At one time, many villages had a number of folk healers who could cure a variety of illnesses, They ranged from those who cured with herbs, magic formulas and prayers to professional sorcerers who were called in serious cases of magical attack. In practice, however, these practitioners overlapped, since almost any illness could be judged to be the result of a magical working. Folk healers seldom referred to themselves as streghe (although their neighbors might call them such), but as fattuccchiere, \\"fixers,\\" maghi (masculine plural; singular mago), maghe (feminine plural; sing. maga), \\"magic-workers.\\" In contrast to the academic and historical evidence some modern practitioners of Stregoneria claim it is the Folk Magic practices of Italy. The use of the word Stregoneria to describe Italian Folk Magic is common mostly among Italian-American practitioners. Practitioners of Folk Magic traditionally would usually be called something along the lines of fixers, healers, or those who help, but to be called a witch would be a direct insult. Virtually all practitioners would have considered themselves Roman Catholic and witches in Italian folklore and Roman Catholicism are traditionally connected to the devil. Practices of Stregoneria include making Brevi, or charm bags, and healing the Malocchio Although Stregoneria does indeed make use of a variety of Catholic practices, due to the use of magic Stregoneria, unlike Benedicaria, tends to be more at odds with the teachings of the Catholic Church, blending Catholic and Pre- Christian traditions. Stregoneria and Benedicaria Benedicaria is Italian Folk Catholicism that, in its purest form, is completely in line with the teachings of the Catholic Church. Stregoneria and Benedicaria often overlap, specifically in the intercession of the Saints, Catholic prayers, and the use of Catholic Sacramentals. Many practitioners of both Benedicaria and Stregoneria typically make use of each other‚Äôs practices to the point where it‚Äôs almost impossible to see where one ends and the other begins. Stregoneria and Stregheria Stregheria is the religious practice of witchcraft with roots in Italy. Its Italian-American branch, popularized by author Raven Grimassi, is reflective of Neo-Paganism, and makes use of much of the magical practices of Stregoneria but does not include elements of Catholic-based folk magic, which displaced the pre-Christian enchanted worldview in Italian culture.

He was perhaps best known for describing the condition known as multiple neuritis as well as directing scientific attention in Great Britain to the deep reflexes.  Life  He was born in Edinburgh the son of Alexander Stewart, a painter and decorator, and his wife, Agnes Grainger. The family lived at 88 Princes Street facing Edinburgh Castle.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1837 He was educated at the High School in Edinburghhttps://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf He was then accepted at the University of Edinburgh Medical School, graduating MD in 1858, and studied further as a postgraduate in Berlin, Prague and Vienna. On his return to Edinburgh he became resident physician in the Royal Infirmary. In 1862 he was appointed pathologist to the Royal Infirmary and lecturer on pathology and on diseases of children at the Extramural School of Medicine at Surgeon's Hall. During the following seven years he published numerous papers on pathological and clinical subjects, and in 1869 unsuccessfully contested the chair of general pathology at the University of Edinburgh. In 1866 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh his proposer being John Hutton Balfour. At this time he was living with his family at 32 Queen Street, a fashionable Georgian townhouse.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1870 He resigned his post as pathologist, and was in early 1876 elected ordinary physician to the Royal Infirmary and lecturer on clinical medicine. On the death of Dr. Thomas Laycock later the same year, Grainger Stewart succeeded him as Professor of Medicine at the University of Edinburgh, serving as such until his own death in 1900. He wrote several prominent medical works, notably on kidney, lung and nervous diseases, and the popular textbook On the position and prospects of therapeutics: a lecture introductory to a course on materia medica and dietetic (1862). Grainger Stewart was president of the tenth International Medical Congress in Berlin, and in 1898 was president of the British Medical Association at its meeting in Edinburgh. From 1889 to 1891 he was president of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. In 1882 he was appointed a Physician-in-Ordinary to Queen Victoria for Scotland, and in 1894 received a knighthood on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, Lord Rosebery. He received the honorary degree Legum Doctor (LL.D.) from Aberdeen University in 1897. He was also a literary critic, playwright, and amateur archaeologist, an elder of the Free Church and in politics a Liberal.

He was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council between 1851 and 1856 and again from 1879 until his death. He was also a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly between 1856 and 1872. He was the first Secretary for Public Works in New South Wales. Early life Flood was the illegitimate son of an Irish convict. He had minimal formal education but became an apprentice carpenter and builder. By 1840 he had become extremely wealthy and had acquired a large amount of city property and pastoral interests including Narrandera Station and property on the Darling River. He also owned wool stores at Circular Quay, a wool pressing company and flour mills. He was a foundation alderman of Sydney City Council and was a supporter of the Benevolent Society. State Parliament In 1851, prior to the establishment of responsible self-government, Flood was elected to the semi- elected New South Wales Legislative Council . He represented the electorate of North-Eastern Boroughs until the granting of responsible self-government in 1856. At the first election under the new constitution he was elected to the Legislative Assembly as the member for the same seat. At the next election in 1858 he transferred to the two-member Sydney seat of Cumberland (South Riding). This seat was subsequently renamed Canterbury at the 1859 election and Flood retained it until he resigned in January 1860 apparently after a heated dispute with the Premier, William Forster. He subsequently re-entered the Assembly after winning the seat of Central Cumberland at the 1869‚Äì70 election. He did not willingly contest the 1872 election although he was nominated for the electorate of Newtown. In 1879 he accepted a life appointment to the Legislative Council, which he retained until his death. Flood was politically radical and opposed the re-introduction of transportation and the autocratic powers of the Governors prior to the granting of responsible government. He was socially conservative and had a reputation of being a tough businessman who objected to the level of wages demanded by labourers in the colony. His support of Protestantism alienated many in the colony's large Irish community. Government Flood's only ministerial appointment was as Secretary for Public Works in the second government of Charles Cowper. He was appointed on 1 October 1859 but his appointment was curtailed by the fall of Cowper's government 26 days later. William Forster believed that Cowper had created the position and appointed Flood in an unsuccessful attempt to strengthen his parliamentary position.

The majority of Muslim women who became active participants did so on the side of the National Liberation Front (FLN). The French included some women, both Muslim and French, in their war effort, but they were not as fully integrated, nor were they charged with the same breadth of tasks as their Algerian sisters. The total number of women involved in the conflict, as determined by post-war veteran registration, is numbered at 11,000, but it is possible that this number was significantly higher due to underreporting.De Groot, Gerard, Peniston-Bird, Corinna. A Soldier and a Woman: Sexual integration in the Military. New York: Longman, 2000 p. 247 There exists a distinction between two different types of women who became involved: urban and rural. Urban women, who constituted about twenty percent of the overall force, had received some kind of education and usually chose to enter on the side of the FLN of their own accord. Largely illiterate rural women, on the other hand (the remaining eighty percent), became involved due to geographical proximity to FLN operations paired with force, although some of them did join out of compassion.Lazreg, Marnia. The Eloquence of Silence. London: Routledge, 1994 p. 120 The rural women combatants in the Algerian War were referred to as the mujahidat and \\"left their homes and families to join the FLN armed guerrilla bands, the Arm√©e Lib√©ration Nationale (ALN)\\". They tended to be young, unmarried, and prepared to join the resistance \\"with or without the approval of their families\\". The mujahidat also were \\"social assistants to the rural population in the zones in which they were posted and would give local female peasants advice on topics such as hygiene and education\\". They also had important political responsibilities as many of these female combatants promoted the FLN by \\"organizing political meetings with local women\\". The urban women combatants were referred to as the fidayat and largely \\"engaged in paramilitary activities in the urban centres\\". Roles Women operated in various areas during the course of the rebellion. Meredith Turshen claims, ‚ÄúWomen participated actively as combatants, spies, fundraisers, as well as nurses, launderers, and cooks.‚ÄùTurshen, Meredith. ‚ÄúAlgerian Women in the Liberation Struggle and the Civil War: From Active Participants to Passive Victims‚Äù.

A Soldier and a Woman: Sexual integration in the Military. New York: Longman, 2000 p. 223 The range of involvement by a woman could include both combatant and non-combatant roles. While the majority of the tasks that women undertook centered on the realm of the non-combatant, those that surrounded the limited number that took part in acts of violence were more frequently noticed. The reality was that ‚Äúrural women in maquis [rural areas] support networks‚ÄùVince, Natalya ‚ÄúTransgressing Boundaries: Gender, Race, Religion and ‚ÄòFracaises Musulmannes during Algerian War of Independence.‚Äù French Historical Studies. Vol. 33 No. 3 (Summer 2010) p. 445-474, p.445 contained the overwhelming majority of those who participated. This is not to marginalize those women who did engage in acts of violence, but simply to illustrate that they constituted in the minority. Women Combatants Despite the fact that destruction of civilian and military targets by women through paramilitary activities included less than seventy women, or about 2% of the total females in the military arm of the FLN,Lazreg, Marnia. The Eloquence of Silence. London: Routledge, 1994 p. 124 it was these acts, especially during the Battle of Algiers (1957), which received most of the attention given to women in this conflict. A reason for such attention was that included in the women who perpetrated direct violence against the French were Djamila Boupacha and Djamila Bouhired, combatants in the Battle of Algiers. Eventually captured, the trials of these women, specifically Bouhired, gained recognition from international audiences.Macmaster, Neil. Burning the Veil. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2009 p. 318 Another reason is that the violent nature of such activities, especially when carried out by women, were much more sensational than feeding and nursing FLN soldiers.  Oral Testimonies  As a result of mujahidat and fidayat not having many written accounts about them, oral testimonies have been the main source in understanding the significance of women's roles in the FLN-ALN and their contributions to the Algerian War. While these important pieces of testimony give a voice to women who were often \\"excluded from the history and memory of the Algerian War as well as victimized in postcolonial Algeria,\\" there remain many omissions in the oral accounts of women combatants. Some particularly difficult issues that are often excluded from oral testimonies relate to \\"marriages in the maquis and the FLN-ALN's control of women's sexuality in the maquis.\\" As noted by scholar Ryme Seferdjeli, \\"In two interviews with mujahidat (Layla Ettayeb and Djamila Amrane) who married in the maquis, they categorically refused to speak about the circumstances in which they got married; nor would they make any comment on it\\". Another example of why testimonies of rape and torture of the women combatants in Algeria do not come to light can be seen in the story of a mujahida named Louisette Ighilahriz. When Ighilahriz \\"published her story admitting to having been tortured and raped during the Algerian War, she received little support from other mujahidat.\\" This can be accounted for by the fact that revealing such violence, especially of a sexual nature, is considered a taboo and reliving such trauma can be extremely difficult for survivors of sexual violence. Therefore, few women combatants are prepared to publicly admit personal stories of the torture and rape that took place during the war. Further, by revealing accounts of sexual violence and subjugation during the war, mujahidat would be seen as victimized women rather than courageous fighters who were absolute members of the ALN. During and after the war, the FLN rhetoric was very much focused on spreading a heroic image of the mujahidat, \\"in order to achieve public recognition\\" and as a form of revolutionary propaganda, which may have influenced the oral testimonies of the mujahidat. In an interview with an unnamed mujahida she acknowledged that: > \\"It is difficult to write history. There are things we will never be able to > tell. I have to admit that I would have difficulties in invoking certain > points or details.\\" In another interview with a mujahida named Houria, when the interviewer and historian Ch√©rifa Bouatta, \\"asked about the nature of the affective and sexual relationships\\" with Houria's first husband, she immediately answered, \\"No, we don't talk about that.\\" Covert Operations In addition to general support tasks, women possessed gender-specific abilities that allowed them to carry out clandestine tasks that would have proved difficult for men. Though women used these capabilities in both the urban and rural arenas of the war, it was the nature of the urban dimension of the war that contained the highest concentration, both in number and frequency, of covert activities by females. The best documented example of this is in the Battle of Algiers. In this battle male FLN operatives, driven underground by the French, stayed out of the public realm, avoiding detention and interrogation, while the women who helped to keep them hidden were able to move about freely and smuggle weapons and other sensitive materials as a result of their manipulation of personal appearance. The manner in which women did this was twofold; first by the religious practice of wearing the veil, which the French saw as above suspicion, or, adopting a European appearance seeming to demonstrate their adherence to French values and way of life. Women like Djamila Bouhired, due to the incapacitation of men, were also charged with carrying out terrorist attacks ordered by FLN leadership and did so by again using changes in dress to their advantage. The desire to pull off the veil by the French manifested because the Algerian woman was a target of French male lust. To not arouse suspicion, Algerian women used western style implements like strollers and handbags to conceal explosives while sporting western attire without any veils. An attempted bombing was carried out by Yasmine Belkacem,https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-18631608 https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-18631608 but perhaps the most famous incident involving Algerian women revolutionaries during the Battle of Algiers was the Milk Bar Caf√© bombing of 1956, when Djamila Bouhired, Zohra Drif, Samia Lakhdari, and Yacef Sa√¢di planted three bombs: one in a cafeteria on the Rue Michelet, one in the Air France office in the Mauritania building in Algiers, which did not explode, and a final one at the Milk Bar Caf√©, which killed 3 young women and injured multiple adults and children. Algerian Communist Party-member Raymonde Peschard was initially accused of being an accomplice to the bombing and was forced to flee from the colonial authorities. In September 1957, Drif was arrested and sentenced to twenty years in the Barbarossa prison but was ultimately pardoned by Charles de Gaulle on the anniversary of Algerian independence in 1962. FLN and Women \\"Some historians argue that the leaders and male combatants generally accepted the presence of women in the maquis, seeing them as sisters in combat. Others claim that they were on the whole hostile to the presence of women in military units.\\" Externally the FLN pursued policies that highlighted women in the Algerian War. El Moudjahid, a publication of the FLN, sought to create the ‚Äòmyth‚Äô of the female warrior and to idolize her as a martyr and linchpin in the war.Lazreg, Marnia. The Eloquence of Silence. London: Routledge, 1994 p. 130 Articles published, including contributions by women to a series ‚ÄòDiary of a Guerilla‚Äô, cast the female in a heroic light highlighting her bravery and contributions to the war effort. The writings of Frantz Fanon also lent themselves to FLN propaganda because he championed the idea that by simply participating in the war women were engaging in an act of liberation.De Groot, Gerard, Peniston-Bird, Corinna. A Soldier and a Woman: Sexual integration in the Military. New York: Longman, 2000 p. 244 The FLN was then able to formulate a motivation for women based on an ‚Äúabstract notion of ‚Äòfreedom‚Äô‚Äù linked with strong nationalism as opposed to a goal of social progress, avoiding the need to engage in a discussion of women‚Äôs issues because they equated it to freedom from colonial rule. Publicly, the FLN identified the contributions of women, but avoided promising specific rewards as a result. Internally FLN attitudes towards women are described in a statement by an FLN commander Si Allal: > ‚Äúit is forbidden to recruit djoundiates [female soldiers] and nurses without > the zone‚Äôs authorization. In independent Algeria, the Muslim woman‚Äôs freedom > stops at the door of her home.

Burning the Veil. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2009 p. 316 According to scholar Ryme Seferdjeli, \\"Women have been reluctant to address the question of marriages in the maquis\\". While marriages did occur during the war, whether or not marriages were ever forced has not been entirely determined. Many interviewed women combatants were evasive in regards to the topic of marriage within the maquis. Further, within \\"a few wilayat the FLN strongly encouraged mujahidat to marry\\" and many mujahidat \\"who joined the ALN during the war ended up marrying\\" the male combatants in the maquis. The ALN \\"authorized or forbade marriages\\" depending on the wilaya and if at the time the ALN found marriages to be problematic or beneficial. Historian and former combatant Djamila Minne, who interviewed many former women combatants, explains that: > \\"Beyond those feelings of suspicion and hostility, or admiration and > glorification, deep bonds of affection were established, which were the > result of long periods spent together and dangers faced together. During the > interviews, it struck me that out of 47 women militants who married during > or after the war, 38 are married with men militants.

France and Women By 1957, largely through torture of captured women, the French came to acknowledge the different roles played by female FLN members including their terrorist actions.Gates, Barbara The Political Roles of Islamic Women: A Study of Two Revolutions - Algeria and Iran. Austin: University of Texas at Austin, 1987 p. 96 Around this time the French initiated a campaign of ‚Äòemancipation‚Äô directed at Muslim women that sought to draw them away from the FLN.

Journal of North African Studies. Vol. 9 No.4 (Winter 2004) p. 19-61 p. 19-56 After the War Scholars disagree on the effect of female participation in the FLN on women's rights after the conflict. For example, Laura Sjoberg and Caron E. Gentry claim that women in Algeria, regardless of their involvement and contributions to the conflict, nevertheless remained in their pre-war subservient position afterward as a result of the prevailing societal, religious, and cultural conditions. On the other hand, Natalia Vince writes that, \\"to argue that the war years were a period of relative freedom for rural women‚Ä¶in which they had more opportunities to enter into the public sphere and mix with men, which in turn led to either a permanent change in attitudes or a return to male dominance and separate spheres once the war ended, is to adopt an analysis that rural interviewees would not use themselves.\\" Films *The Battle of Algiers by Gillo Pontecorvo (1966) See also *Women in Algeria *Women in Islam *Women in Arab societies  References  Algerian War Terrorism in Algeria French Algeria ","title":"Women in the Algerian War"},{"id":"30163565","text":"Jake Newton may refer to: *Jake Newton (footballer) (born 1984), Guyanese international footballer *Jake Newton (ice hockey) (born 1988), American ice hockey player ","title":"Jake Newton"},{"id":"30163577","text":"is a Skiing video game, developed by Human Club and published by Human Entertainment, which was released exclusively in Japan in 1995.

Prior to its construction, people were imprisoned in Cardiff Castle. Background Cardiff's original court and gaol were located within the walls of Cardiff Castle. Whilst the court moved within the castle walls, the gaol was always located within the Black Tower. The earliest surviving gaol record is a Gaol Calendar from 1542, at which time the castle was still used.John Hobson Matthews (ed.), 'Glamorgan Calendar Rolls and Gaol Files: Introduction', Cardiff Records: volume 2 (1900), pp. 142-151. Retrieved on British History Online 30 March 2013. After the Town Hall was built in the High Street in 1331, its main space included a court room, which resulted in the construction of a holding gaol in the basement. Operations A new gaol was established in Cardiff in the 16th century, occupying a site on the High Street. In 1770, improvements and expansions were undertaken. The gallows were located on the site of the current St. Mary Street entrance to Cardiff Market, where Dic Penderyn was hanged on August 13, 1831. By 1814, the gaol was deemed insufficient, and after lands were secured south of Crockherbtown, construction took place, with the new Cardiff Prison opening at the end of 1832. This prison took over the county jail duties, but the gaol continued as the town jail. After the Home Office took over responsibility for corrections in the Prison Act 1877, the prison was expanded and the gaol finally closed.

This grand and affecting picture exhibits the ruins of a church and convent upon the summit of a hill, occupying the whole extent of the view in the second distance, the declivity of which presents a cemetery, interspersed with large stones. On the foreground are a broken tree lying across a rapid stream, a tomb of black marble, with an inscription on it; a row of three sarcophagi extending along the front; and on the left stands a cluster of large umbrageous trees, the verdant hues of whose foliage is contrasted by the leafless trunk of a beech. Three persons in black are seen near a small tomb on the side of the hill, musing amidst the tombs. The grandeur and solemnity of the scene is strikingly enhanced by rolling stormy clouds, in which may be perceived the evanescent colours of a rainbow. 4 ft. 6 in. by 5 ft. 9 in.‚ÄîC. In this excellent picture, the artist has evidently intended to convey a moral lesson of human life ; and in addition to this, there is a sublimity of sentiment and effect reigning throughout the composition which renders it worthy of the powers of Nicolo Poussin.

By Francis Skeat (1963). Francis Walter Skeat (3 December 1909 ‚Äì 31 August 2000) was an English glass painter who created over 400 stained glass windows in churches and cathedrals, both in England and overseas. Skeat was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, a Fellow of the British Society of Master Glass Painters, and a member of the Art Workers Guild. Education and career Skeat was born in St Albans in Hertfordshire; his mother Theodora had an embroidery studio in Chester and his grandfather was Walter William Skeat, the etymologist. Skeat was educated at Lyndale School, St Albans and Whitgift School, Croydon. At the age of eighteen, he was apprenticed to Harry Scott Bridgwater who was a leading mezzotint engraver. He was a follower of Sir John Ninian Comper; after exhibiting at the Paris salon in 1932, he returned to St Albans in 1933 and the following year he became a pupil of Christopher Webb, who had a studio in St Albans and encouraged him to work in stained glass. He later worked for A.R. Mowbray and Co. in Oxford and for J. Wippell and Co. of Exeter; he also designed glass for the firm of Barton, Kinder and Alderson. In 1934 he presented two glass panels to the Church of St John in Old London Road, St Albans, where he was a parishioner. These panels, featuring the Good Shepherd and St John the Baptist, were his first church windows. In 1955 St John's was demolished and the panels were moved to St Peter's. In 1937 he married Birgit Ann Mari Lindquist from Gothenburg, Sweden, where he lived until the end of the Second World War. After the war, he opened his first studio at 7a Market Place, St Albans, before moving his studio to Cross Lane, Harpenden. His first major commission was for the largest window in the southern hemisphere, for the south transept of St George's Cathedral, Cape Town, South Africa. The rose window was installed in 1957, and was designed by Frank Spears. Haunted house Skeat's parents lived at Romeland Cottage, adjacent to St Albans Cathedral (which prior to 1877 was the church of St Albans Abbey, which in turn had been founded nearly 1100 years earlier in 793 by Offa, king of Mercia). Shortly before Skeat was born, a Swedish maid, Hilma, was climbing the stairs to go to bed when she felt the presence of something close to her; she was then pinned against the wall and her candle went out. In the darkness she saw a figure wearing a cowl who spoke to her in a strange tongue, later identified as Latin. The figure quickly vanished, leaving Hilma deeply shocked. The following night she was in bed asleep when she woke to find the same figure standing at the foot of her bed. In the moonlight she could see that he was wearing a metal medal around his neck. Canon Glossop (the rural dean) was brought to the cottage from the Abbey to talk to the maid; from her description he identified the medal as similar to those given to pilgrims to the Abbey in the Middle Ages. It is believed that the cottage was built on the site of the Abbey's charnel house, where the bodies of monks would be laid awaiting burial. Style and mark A sample of Skeat's marks Skeat's mark as seen at Holy Trinity, Crockham Hill, Kent Skeat's works employ crisply drawn figures on a largely clear glazed background, which was a popular formula in post-war stained glass. The panels he created for St John's church in St Albans bear his marks described as \\"a hart lodged at gaze in a small shield within a larger shield with walled top and alternate horizontal sections\\" and a \\"scrolled shield with a hart statant\\". The hart is taken from the Arms of the county of Hertfordshire. The lines across the shield are an allusion to a ford, a pun on the county‚Äôs name. His mark later became a rebus, St Francis of Assisi, around whom radiate small flying birds, together with his initials. Works Among Skeat's works is the memorial to the footballer, Duncan Edwards, who played for Manchester United and England. He was one of eight players who was killed in the Munich air disaster in February 1958; Edwards was only 21 at the time of his death. On 27 August 1961 a stained-glass window depicting the player, designed by Skeat, was unveiled in St Francis's Church, the parish church for the Priory Estate, Dudley, by Matt Busby, Edwards's former manager. In the City of London church of St Sepulchre-without-Newgate there is a memorial window to John Smith, the governor of Virginia and associate of Pocahontas who was buried there in 1631. The window was designed by Skeat and given to the church by Bradford Smith in 1968. Captain John Smith is shown in the central panel of the window with his navigational instruments at his feet. The east window in the Lady Chapel of St Andrew's Church, Swavesey in Cambridgeshire, contains a 1967 Tree of Jesse by Francis Skeat. In a letter to the incumbent and the churchwardens, Skeat writes:- Jesse appears in the right hand light and is in a standing position facing left. The figures in the window are:- first light, Boaz; second light, Ruth and above her Jacob; middle light, Abraham and Isaac; above them, the Blessed Virgin Mary and Child; at the top, Asa; fourth light, David with Solomon above him; fifth light, Jesse. The text at the bottom of the window, taken from the 1662 Book of Common Prayer version of Nicene Creed, reads:- Publications In May 1977, Skeat published \\"Stained Glass of St Albans Cathedral\\". Other works to which he has contributed include: *The Stained Glass Work of J√°nos Hajnal: Vol. XV No. 3 (British Society: London, 1974‚Äì75) *A Survey of Stained Glass in Museums: Vol. XVII, No. 2 (British Society: London, 1978‚Äì79) *A Survey of Stained Glass in Museums and Art Galleries (Part Two): Vol. XVI, No. 3 (British Society: London, 1979‚Äì80) *The Vanished Glass of Exeter Cathedral References External links *List of Stained Glass Windows created by Francis Skeat *List of Stained Glass Windows designed by Francis Skeat 1909 births 2000 deaths People from St Albans People educated at Whitgift School British stained glass artists and manufacturers ","title":"Francis Skeat"},{"id":"30163982","text":"This is a list of video games based on the wrestling sport of sumo.

Nemess√°nyi is considered the most talented and important maker in the Hungarian violin-making school. During his lifetime, he was already acknowledged as the most outstanding craftsmen of stringed instruments in all of Hungary and his instruments are of great importance to Hungarians. His life and work strikingly parallels that of Italian luthier Giuseppe Guarneri del Ges√π.  Early life  Not much is known about Nemess√°nyi's early life. His middle name of \\"F√©lix\\" is thought to be wrong, as it does not appear in any known documentation (marriage or birth certificate). It was assumed that he was born in Preschau, but it is now known that Nemess√°nyi was indeed born in Liptau-St. Nikolaus (formerly Verbicz- Hu≈°t√°k) to the son of an impoverished shoemaker. His father had urged young Samuel to take up glass blowing, but found that his interest lay in working with wood. At the age of 18, he moved to Pest to learn carpentry and cabinet making. By a stroke of luck, the workshop where he served his apprenticeship was very close to the violin shop of noted German luthier Johann Baptist Schweitzer. Nemess√°nyi then met Thomas Zach, an assistant to Schweitzer and also a talented maker himself. In April 1855, impressed by Nemess√°nyi's skill with woodworking, Zach took the talented young man as his apprentice and Nemess√°nyi began his training in the most regarded violin shop by the most famous luthiers in Hungary. Nemess√°nyi's talent developed remarkably under the guidance of his mentors and due to his exceptionally quick progress, he managed to finish the usual 4-year apprenticeship in only 3 years. On May 4, 1858, following the advice of his mentors, he traveled to Prague to meet with Hungarian maker Anton Sitt, a former Schweitzer pupil himself. At Sitt's shop, Nemess√°nyi had the opportunity to examine and repair many fine, old Italian instruments. After spending a year working with Sitt, Nemess√°nyi returned to Hungary a master of his craft at the age of 22.  Middle years  Nemess√°nyi moved to Szeged where he found his first wife. He was married on January 21, 1861 to the 18-year-old Anne Boldizs√°r. He was well liked in Szeged and he enjoyed profitable working conditions. Being the restless character that he was, he was soon dissatisfied with the quiet of Szeged. He gathered all his tools and moved his family around from town to town, such as P√©cs (F√ºnfkirchen), working for varied lengths of time in each. Upon receiving an invitation, Nemess√°nyi uprooted his family once more and moved to Pest, where his reputation as a violin maker was growing. On April 4, 1863, he received his masters diploma from the Pest Musical Instrument Maker's Guild and was accepted as a member. The Nemess√°nyi's moved to 7, Haj√≥ St. which was formerly the property of deceased violin maker, Franz Tischenant. The music scene in Pest was rapidly expanding, thus giving Nemess√°nyi an opportunity to further develop his work. He soon was able to move to a better location at 4, Gr√°n√°tos St. where he soon became overwhelmed with repairs and orders for new instruments by artists, gypsy violinists, and wealthy amateurs. Nemess√°nyi profited greatly from his work, but also received additional support by his father-in-law. Nemess√°nyi was overly generous, usually borrowing money to poor friends which led to a constant lack of it. What few funds remained were spent on his excessive taste for wine, which would eventually become his fatal vice. In May 1870, Nemess√°nyi's young wife died and his love of adventure and preference for wine suddenly stopped. His four children were taken into custody by their grandparents in Szeged. It was during this period that Nemess√°nyi took on two apprentices: Karl Hermann Voigt and B√©la Szepessy. Voigt only stayed with Nemess√°nyi for a year, returning to Vienna soon after. He was replaced by Eduard Bartek, a talented young man. It was not long before Nemess√°nyi took a liking to Bartek's sister, Anna. They were wed in Szeged in 1872 with the support of the Boldizs√°rs. Nemess√°nyi returned to his work with a fresh outlook to the newly appointed capital of Budapest. New clients often had to wait for months for their instruments due to his heavy workload. Nemess√°nyi's new wife found his adventurous lifestyle too much to bear and soon left him with their two daughters. To make matters worse, Szepessy also left and travelled to Vienna, Munich, and finally to London where he established himself as a first-rate maker and shop owner. Were it not for Anna Boldizs√°r's mother, Nemess√°nyi would have remained alone in despair. She moved to Budapest and brought Nemess√°nyi's four children from his first marriage. They rented a flat at 7 Hatvani St. and she took care of the children and housework. Nemess√°nyi's workshop was once again prospering and in his beautifully furnished drawing room, he hosted the best musicians Budapest had to offer, such as: Ede Rem√©nyi, Karl Huber (musician), and his son, the famous prodigy, Eugene Hubay. Nemess√°nyi's excessive ways soon began to take over his tranquil life. He wasted the inheritance from is first marriage and his mother-in-law was forced to return to Szeged with the rest of the money and his children, so that they would receive a good education. Nemess√°nyi was once again alone. He left his large flat and moved around to various places in Budapest. Luise Nemess√°nyi, the widow of his brother, became his new partner and she let him stay at 18 Nagyf√∫varos St. where she ran a grocery shop. They had two children together. The relationship between Nemess√°nyi and the Boldizs√°r's was soon restored and even Anna Bartek forgave him for his ways.  Early Death  Nemess√†nyi's shaky lifestyle took a great toll on his health. His excessive drinking led to his early demise at the height of his most productive period. On March 5, 1881, he suffered a stroke and collapsed in the street, dying shortly afterward. He was barely 44 years old. Although none of his sons chose violin making, Nemess√°nyi's apprentices, B√©la Szepessy and Eduard Bartek, are generally credited for carrying on the Nemess√°nyi line throughout the late 18th and early 20th century. Bartek taught Paul Pil√°t who taught many talented apprentices, including: Dezs≈ë B√°r√°ny, Mih√°ly Rem√©nyi, and J√°nos Spiegel to name a few. Despite the fact that Nemess√†nyi was irresponsible, impulsive, and careless, he was a kind and compassionate man whom everyone liked. He was truly a dramatic figure in the world of violin making and left a sizable impression in the Hungarian violin-making school. His life leads a striking parallel with that of Giuseppe Guarneri del Ges√π who also lived excessively with the drink and died in his early 40s, at the height of his career. Nemess√†nyi's talent with Guarnerian modeling only enhance this fact.  Labels  During his early working years, he wrote his labels by hand. As early as 1863, he began to use printed labels. New labels were ordered in 1871 with larger letters and were mistakenly printed with \\"Samueli\\". In some cases he erased the extra 'i', but on some, he left it as it was. On occasion, Nemess√†nyi was known to use the brand mark of \\"N S\\". In faked violins, there almost always exists a brand mark, even though Nemess√†nyi barely used it in his own instruments. His labels appear as such: ---- ---- Samuel Nemess√°nyi fecit Pestini, 1874 ---- ---- Samuel Nemess√°nyi fecit ad formam Antonio Stradiuarii Pestini 1865 ---- ---- Csin√°lta Nemessanyi Samu Pecsen S.N. 1861 II ---- ---- Nemess√°nyi Sam P. Maggininiutan Bpesten 1879 It should be mentioned that it is disputed that Nemess√†nyi ever created a Maggini model. ---- ---- Samuel Nemess√°nyi fecit ad formam Joseph Guarnerii pestini anno 1879 ---- ----  Instruments  Due to his lifestyle, Nemess√†nyi's work reflected his moods. When he had to deal with unpleasant clients or suffered from depression, he often produced inferior work; however, at his best, he distanced himself from everyone, producing master instruments within a few weeks. These are the instruments that are often compared closely with that of Stradivari and Guarneri. Nemess√†nyi had a predilection for del Ges√π models. He copied some instrument models so perfectly that his unbranded and unlabeled instruments were often in circulation as genuine del Ges√π's and other famous Italian makers. Due to this, only a small number of instruments are known to be made by him. Genuine violins and cellos made by Nemess√†nyi himself are outstanding instruments and compare favourably with the best of 18th and 19th century instruments. William Henley had this to say about Nemess√†nyi's instruments. \\"Tonal quality completely congenial to the bravura soloist, neither string dull or unequal, but a splendidly free emission of sonorous strength and brilliancy...\\" Nemess√†nyi had a special gift with wood, always using beautifully flamed maple and tight-grained spruce for his instruments. He was often able to work as thin as 2.2 millimetre's under the bridge with his best quality spruce. The final shape of each instrument depended on the acoustic qualities of the wood he was working with, resulting in different measurements for nearly every instrument. It is also known that he was an excellent restorer. Even though Nemess√°nyi's best instruments look nearly identical to their Italian counterparts, it is not this fact alone that created the illusion that some were indeed the genuine articles. It is their playability that also compares favourably with the instruments they were meant to represent. Herbert Goodkind said this about the playability of Nemess√°nyi's instruments: \\"They possess both mellowness and power, and an ease and evenness of response that enables the performer to produce the gamut of dynamic shadings from pianissimo to fortissimo without loss of quality.\\" Heinrich W. Ernst once owned a Del Ges√π with a label that read \\"Joseph Guarnerius fecit Cremona 17\\". Even though it's measurements and appearance match that of a genuine Del Ges√π, it was made around 1860 by Samuel Nemess√†nyi. It is illustrated in \\"Journal of the Violin Society of America\\" Vol. II, No. 2 by Herbert Goodkind. As a copyist, Nemess√†nyi is placed in the ranks of the Voller Brothers, Vuillaume, Lupot and John Lott.

Currently none of the firefighters, EMTs, or paramedics in Calvert County are paid. They are all 100% volunteers, who provide countless hours for extensive training and provide emergency services 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. However, on January 20, 2018, the Calvert County Board of County Commissioners approved a phased-in approach of hiring paramedics, starting in FY 2019. Calvert County Fire-Rescue-EMS (CCFEMS) (http://www.calvertfirerescueems.com) is dispatched by full-time paid dispatchers at the Calvert County Control Center. Priority one medical calls, determined by the Control Center to be immediately life-threatening in nature, requires the dispatch of the closest fire engine, the two closest ambulances, and the Calvert County Advanced Life Support Paramedic Unit centrally located in Prince Frederick, Maryland. If an ambulance fails to respond within 5 minutes, the third closest ambulance is dispatched as well. Since the ambulances are staffed only with an EMT-Basic and provide only basic life support level care, the centrally located paramedics respond in a Chevy Suburban or Ford Expedition and take command of the ambulance if the patient requires advanced life support Paramedic level care. This may occur on the scene or at a rendezvous en route to the hospital. If the EMT-Basics on the ambulance determine the patient is not suffering a life-threatening emergency and does not need a more advanced level of care, they may cancel the medic unit and continue to the hospital at the EMT-Basic level of care. Priority two medical calls, determined by the 911 control center to be potentially life-threatening, dispatch the closest ambulance and the Calvert County Emergency Medical Services Advanced Life Support Paramedic Unit centrally located in Prince Frederick, Maryland. If an ambulance fails to respond within 5 minutes, the next closest ambulance is dispatched as well. Priority three medical calls, determined by the 911 control center to be routine or non-emergency in nature, dispatch only the closest ambulance, although once on scene they may request a Paramedic unit to meet them en route to the hospital to upgrade their ambulance if the patient is suffering a true emergency. If an ambulance fails to respond within 5 minutes, the next closest ambulance is dispatched as well. Units en route to a priority 3 call may be rerouted by the Control Center to a higher priority call if one should be received prior to arriving on scene. Calvert County is served by six volunteer fire departments, one volunteer rescue squad, one volunteer dive team, and one volunteer Advanced Life Support Paramedic Unit, all largely funded by the Calvert County government. Company 1 is the North Beach Volunteer Fire Department (http://www.northbeachfire.com/). North Beach has two engines, one tower, one heavy rescue, one brush truck, two basic life support ambulances, a boat, and a zodiac. Company 2 is the Prince Frederick Volunteer Fire Department (http://www.pfvfd.org/). Prince Frederick has two engines, one tower, one heavy rescue squad, one tanker, and one brush truck. Company 3 is the Solomons Volunteer Rescue Squad & Fire Department (http://www.svrsfd.org/). Solomons is the farthest from the hospital, and also has the highest call volume in the County. Company 4 is the Prince Frederick Volunteer Rescue Squad (http://www.pfvrs.org/). It is separate from the PFVFD. PFVRS has two ambulances, a boat, and a zodiac. Company 5 is the Dunkirk Volunteer Fire Department (http://www.dunkirk5.com). Company 6 is the Huntingtown Volunteer Fire Department (http://www.hvfd6.org). Company 7 is the St. Leonard Volunteer Fire Department (http://www.slvfd.org). Company 10 is Calvert Advanced Life Support (CALS), or the Paramedic Unit (http://www.calvertals.net). They are the only advanced life support providers in the County and the last all volunteer ALS service in the State of Maryland. They are centrally located in Prince Frederick, and respond everywhere in the county with chase vehicles (Chevy Suburbans or Ford Expeditions) to upgrade local Basic Life Support (BLS) Ambulances that require a higher level of care for a seriously ill or injured patient. Company 12 is the Calvert County Rescue Dive Team (http://www.ccrdt.org/). There are no companies 8, 9, or 11.

Biography Ashley was the son of Anthony Ashley of Damerham, Hampshire, and Dorothy Lyte, daughter of John Lyte, Esq., of Lytes Cary of Somerset. He was the younger brother of Anthony Ashley, 1st Baronet of Wimborne St Giles, and the elder brother of Sir Francis Ashley of Dorchester.His elder brother, Sir Anthony Ashley, inherited the family estates at Wimborne St Giles. He was the grandfather of Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury. . Ashley attended the Grammar School at Southampton under the headmaster Hadrian Saravia. At the age of 13 he continued his studies at Salisbury Cathedral School with Adam Hill. Anthony Wood says he became a fellow commoner of Hart Hall in 1580, and does not speak of his being a member of any other college in Oxford University, but from his autobiography it appears he transferred to Magdalen Hall. Ashley was granted his BA degree in 1582 and was named fellow in 1583. He was made Master of Arts in 1587. In 1588 he entered New Inn and was admitted to Middle Temple on 8 October 1588.H. A. C. Sturgess, (1949). Register of Admissions to the Honourable Society of the Middle Temple. Butterworth & Co. (Publishers) Ltd: Temple Bar. Vol. 1, p. 58. He was called to the Bar on 24 October 1595 after travelling to France. His mind was too mercurial for law, and he gave himself to the study of Dutch, French, Spanish and Italian. \\"Finding the practice of law\\", says Wood, \\"to have ebbs and tides, he applied himself to the learning of the languages of our neighbours, to the end that he might be partaker of the wisdom of those nations, having been many years of this opinion, that as no one soil or territory yieldeth all fruits alike, so no one climate or region affordeth all kind of knowledge in full measure.\\"Wood obtained this quotation from Ashley's own Vita which is now (MS Sloane 2131). Ashley was elected Member of Parliament for Dorchester in 1597. He lived for many years in the Middle Temple, dying in October 1641, leaving no descendants. He was buried in the Temple Church, leaving his personal library of over 4000 volumes to re- establish that of Middle Temple. Literary background and published works Ashley, who wrote during the reigns of Elizabeth and James I, is called by Wood in his Athen√¶ Oxonienses \\"an esquire's son and Wiltshire-man born\\". When Ashley was a boy he delighted in reading Bevis of Hampton, Guy of Warwick, Valentine and Orson, Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, and later the Decameron of Boccace and the Heptameron of the Queen of Navarre. His principal works are: *Urania, in Latin verse, London, 1589, quarto, translated from the French of Du Bartas *The Interchangeable Course, 1594, folio, translated from the French of Louis le Roy *Almansor, the learned and victorious King that conquered Spain, his Life and Death, London, 1627, quarto, translated from Spanish.

Plot Detective Hollis Lucetti (Terrence Howard) receives news from a doctor that he has been sterile his entire life. Upon reaching home, he questions his wife about who their children's father is. The story switches to Gavin Nichols (Charlie Hunnam), an atheist, standing on a ledge as if to jump to his death. A small crowd forms below Gavin, and Hollis responds to the emergency. At first it looks like a regular suicide attempt. It is quickly revealed to be more complex than that, as Gavin explains to Hollis that he has no other choice than to jump, or somebody else will die. The story flashes back and describes the story of the love triangle between Gavin, Shana (Liv Tyler) and Joe (Patrick Wilson). Shana is the new girl at the hotel where Gavin works. She lives with her husband Joe in an apartment just down the hall from Gavin's. Joe is a fundamentalist Christian who infantilizes Shana. During a visit one night, Gavin and Joe discuss religion. Gavin neatly picks apart Joe's born again belief system, pointing out that most of the people on Earth would go to Hell, even Catholics, if Joe's faith were correct. Gavin points out that a Chinese child who dies in a traffic accident might never even know about Jesus, and therefore has no chance to be born again. Joe's response is that such an example is not proof of God's unfairness, but merely the reason why Christians are called to proselytize. Their discussion heats up into a full blown argument that ends when Shana asks Gavin to leave. At work, Shana notices Gavin consoling one of his grief-stricken employees with talk about God. He puts on a genuine act as a believer which helps calm the employee down. On a walk with Gavin one day, she confides in him that she used to be a drug addict and a prostitute. She ended up with a john one night who liked to have sex in empty churches. He beat her badly afterward, and Joe discovered her in the sanctuary. Joe helped her turn her life around, and she feels an immense debt of gratitude to him. She tells Gavin that Joe wants them to move to Uganda to spread God's word. Gavin and Shana spend more time with each other, and they eventually begin an affair. Joe quickly deduces what is going on and witnesses their assignations. He confronts Gavin as he is leaving for work and insists that he join him for a talk. In his apartment, Joe tells Gavin that he previously had a wife and two kids, but he would leave them at night to score drugs and hookers and do all kinds of depraved things. He lost his family and was drunk in a gutter when he was born again. He believes that, after God had already given him so much, God gave him Shana to take care of. He quotes Psalm 23 to Gavin and forces him at gunpoint to read Leviticus 20:10, \\"If a man commits adultery with another man‚Äôs wife‚Äîwith the wife of his neighbor‚Äîboth the adulterer and the adulteress are to be put to death.\\" Gavin counters with the story of the adulteress from John 8, whom Jesus saves by ordering only those without sin to cast a stone at her. Joe agrees that Gavin has a point, but he questions whether Gavin has the conviction to die for his beliefs. The next day, when Shana is supposed to leave Joe, Gavin is waiting for her to call. Joe calls Gavin instead and orders him to the top of a building. Joe has decided that, \\"I'm more of an Old Testament kind of guy\\", but instead of killing both Gavin and Shana, only one of them has to die. Joe has Shana at gunpoint and will kill her at noon if Gavin does not jump off the building. Lucetti grows increasingly desperate to save Gavin. He tells him more about his story, explaining that his wife committed adultery out of love and fear that she would lose her husband. She wanted their children to look as much like Lucetti as possible. So, she slept with his younger brother. Gavin scolds Lucetti for focusing too much on the pain of his wife's betrayal instead of the love that motivated her. He asks Lucetti to tell Shana he loves her before jumping off the building. The police find Joe and Shana in a hotel room with a direct view of Gavin's suicide. Joe is arrested. Lucetti goes home to his wife and kids, seemingly determined to reconcile. Cast * Charlie Hunnam as Gavin Nichols * Patrick Wilson as Joe * Liv Tyler as Shana * Terrence Howard as Hollis Lucetti * Christopher Gorham as Chris Production Chapman, an atheist who identifies himself as a distant relative of Charles Darwin, wrote the character of Gavin Nichols to be the first openly atheist hero in a story about religious conflict.New atheist movie 'The Ledge' evangelizes godlessness According to Chapman, it is \\"the first pro-atheist feature film ever to be released in America.\\" His goal was to \\"put out a piece of work that makes the basic intellectual arguments for atheism, but also makes a powerful emotional argument against cruelty of a religious kind\\" and the \\"ways people suffer as a result.\\" Chapman was able to recruit his desired actors starting with Hunnam and the film was shot in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in March 2010.My Interview with Writer/Director Matthew Chapman Terrence Howard Walks ‚ÄòThe Ledge‚Äô The film premiered in the U.S. Dramatic Competition at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2011.

It is the first attempted autocephalous Eastern Orthodox jurisdiction for North America. The American Orthodox Catholic Church originally functioned as an archbishopric before elevation to the patriarchate. It is led by Patriarch Roger Paul Willingham. The American Orthodox Catholic Church was chartered in 1927 by Metropolitan Platon (Rozhdestvensky) of New York and led by Aftimios Ofiesh before his disputed suspension and deposition in 1933. The purpose of the American Orthodox Catholic Church was to establish a new tradition in North America separate from any other particular ethnic or cultural traditions. It operated in the United States of America with initial support from the Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church in America (today the Orthodox Church in America), until Ofiesh suspected autocephaly. In 1929, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA (Ecumenical Patriarchate) schismed from the American Orthodox Catholic Church. History Bishop Aftimios Ofiesh (second right) with the 1921 pan- Orthodox gathering of bishops Aftimios Ofiesh officially founded the American Orthodox Catholic Church in 1927 with assistance from Metropolitan Platon. The Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church in America (ROGCCA) originally supported the establishment of the North American Orthodox jurisdiction as a diocese. The movement to establish a new American tradition gained popularity. Within four years, the American Orthodox Catholic Church consecrated four bishops with a charter granted from the ROGCCA. After the consecration of the four bishops, its formal members developed a constitution for the new Orthodox church.Garvey, F.J. 2014, \\"Turning to Tradition: Converts and the Making of an American Orthodox Church by D. Oliver Herbel (review)\\", American Catholic Studies, vol. 125, no. 3, pp. 78‚Äì80. = Open hostility = Aftimios Ofiesh in 1922 The establishment of the church inspired a reactionary movement against it, especially from the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR). Although the ROGCCA severed ties with ROCOR in 1926, the ROCOR still viewed itself as the ROGCCA's rightful canonical authority. Aftimios replied forcefully, denouncing the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia for their actions and forbade his clergy and faithful from having anything to do with them. Like his estranged former associates in ROCOR, ROGCCA Metropolitan Platon turned his back on the American Orthodox Catholic Church out of perceived lack of loyalty. However, others began to doubt Platon's support of the new church primarily because of publications in the Orthodox Catholic Review (edited by Hieromonk Boris and Priest Michael) that were aimed at the Episcopal Church USA. To worsen matters, the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch sent Archbishop Victor (Abo-Assaley) of New York to America in 1924, where he encouraged Orthodox Arabs to come under Antiochian jurisdiction rather than under the Russians or the new American Church. Despite his efforts, he did not make much headway in his endeavors.To counteract Archbishop Victor's actions, Aftimios and his group began to focus on the establishment of the church's legal status. For a while, the American Orthodox Catholic Church enjoyed some success. In May 1928, Sophronios (Beshara) was consecrated as Bishop of Los Angeles. He was given responsibility for all territory west of the Mississippi River and for parishes who still considered themselves to be under the jurisdiction of the Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church in America. However, the success did not last. It was expected that with its first bishops, they would achieve a solid foundation, but this did not happen. In 1929, Aftimios attempted to gain Greek Archbishop Alexander Demoglou of Rodostolou's support for the new church. Demoglou was the first primate of the newly formed Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America. His response was that he had authority over not only all of the Greek Orthodox in America, but also over all Orthodox Christians in America. Aftimios ordained Reverend Demetrius Cassis, an American of Greek parentage, for the new American Church.Surrency, Archim. Serafim. The Quest for Orthodox Church Unity in America (New York: Sts. Boris and Gleb Press, 1973), 32‚Äì42. In The Quest for Orthodox Church Unity in America, Fr. Serafim believes that Aftimios's opposition to the new church had shifted from reservation to optimism. Fr. Serafim claims this shift in Aftimios's emotions because of a letter dated October 4, 1929 where Aftimios declared that: :\\"His Eminence, the Most Reverend Platon (Rozhdestvensky), the Metropolitan of Khersson and Odessa, has no proper, valid, legal, or effective appointment, credentials or authority to rule the North American Archdiocese of the Russian Orthodox Church in any capacity. Such being the case it follows that from the departure of His Eminence Archbishop Alexander (Nemolovsky) that the lawful and canonical ruling headship of the Archdiocese of the Aleutian Islands and North America in the Patriarchal Russian Church has naturally been vested in the First Vicar and Senior Bishop in this Jurisdiction\\" therefore \\"the title and position of 'Metropolitan of North America and Canada' has no canonical existence in the Russian Church.\\" It is signed by \\"Aftimios, First Vicar and Senior Bishop in the Archdiocese of the Aleutian Islands and North America.\\" Undoubtedly, Aftimios wrote the letter assuming that Platon had already given him authority over all Orthodox Christians in North America. Fr. Serafim continues by saying that Aftimios's denunciation of Platon's authority barely affected the Russian parishes or their clergy. The reason for Aftimios's denunciation was that Platon would continue to rule the archdiocese until a bishop was sent to relieve him, even though the Ukaz of Patriarch Tikhon suspended Platon. The announcement of Aftimios's authority had a negative effect on some members of the American Orthodox Catholic Church. Two weeks after it became public, Bp. Emmanuel (Abo-Hatab) requested canonical release from Aftimios, who gave it reluctantly. He went over to Platon and tried to bring Syrian parishes away from Aftimios and back under the ROGCCA. Despite these troubles, Aftimios continued to explore new opportunities. He began negotiations to bring Bp. Fan (Noli) to serve as a bishop in the new American Church, with jurisdiction over Albanian Orthodox Christians. Though Bp. Fan did eventually come to the United States, it was under the auspices of the ROGCCA. Aftimios continued his attempts to boost the legitimacy of his jurisdiction. Around October 1930 Aftimios sent a letter to his clergy indicating that they ought to keep their distance from Bp. Germanos (Shehadi) of Zahle who had come from Antioch, without the Antiochian Orthodox Church's authorization, to gather funds from Arabic Orthodox parishes and to encourage such parishes to come under Antioch's jurisdiction. While in the U.S., Bp. Germanos accepted Archpriest Basil Kherbawi under his omophorion. Kherbawi had previously been suspended by Abp. Aftimios for disloyalty. = Disintegration = In 1932, Aftimios's cathedral was taken from him and given over to the ROGCCA by a decision of a New York State court. The charter stated that the cathedral could only be used by a hierarch subject to the authority of the Russian Church. Nevertheless, Aftimios consecrated two more bishops, Ignatius ((W.A.) Nichols, a former Episcopal cleric who had become an Old Catholic episcopus vagans), and Joseph (Zuk) of New Jersey. Zuk had ties to the Ukrainians, who had the allegiance of a half dozen parishes. Aftimios's discouragement over the state of his jurisdiction is believed the cause to make the decision that is known to the Eastern Orthodox Church as the death-knell for the American Orthodox Catholic Church: :\\"...on the 29th of April 1933 Abp Aftimios, in defiance of all Orthodox Tradition and Canon Law... married in a civil ceremony to a young Evangelical Syrian girl born in America [she was actually a member of the Syrian Orthodox parish in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]‚Äîand despite all the efforts of responsible parties, he refused to resign as Archbishop of the new Church.\\" The two new bishops of the church, Ignatius and Joseph, voiced their support of Aftimios's marriage. In previous traditions and cultures, bishops were not allowed to marry, but since the new church is separate from any other particular ethnic or cultural traditions, they acknowledged Aftimios's decision as courageous. Three days after Aftimios's wedding, Ignatius and Joseph held a synod meeting by themselves. During the meeting, they elected Joseph as the new President Archbishop of the American Orthodox Catholic Church. Since they believed that Aftimios had resigned, Ignatius was designated his successor. Fr. Serafim observes that these leadership complications eventually undermined any authority the church may have still had. Fr. Andrew Stephen Damick largely blames the multiple consecrations by Ignatius as another complication. By the summer of 1933, only six parishes remained in the American Orthodox Catholic Church. Joseph later denied making the agreement that Ignatius would be his successor. His denial was not very significant because he was already sick. Joseph died soon after, on February 23, 1934. Ignatius then got married in June 1933 and began forming ecumenical relations with the representatives of the Living Church in America. The Living Church had been competing with the ROGCCA and ROCOR. He eventually broke relations with the Living Church and returned to being an episcopus vagans. Before his death, Joseph started multiple small religious bodies, many of whom claim apostolic succession from him. He became the first bishop of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA and died as the pastor of a small community church in Middle Springs, Vermont. The only bishop left to the American Orthodox Catholic Church was Sophronios (Beshara), who then appealed to Platon for assistance. He had also intended to contact Emmanuel Abo-Hatab, but Emmanuel died on May 29, 1933. Despite his challenges, Bp. Sophronius embraced his new position as 'President Locum Tenens of the American Holy Synod.' Bp. Sophronius hoped to use his new position to mend relations with Metr. Platon and to be viewed as an equal authority within the Church. By this point, Platon was focused on the arrival of the representative of the Patriarchate from Russia, Bp. Benjamin Fedchenkov of Saratov. Fedchenkov's purpose in the United States was to investigate the ecclesiastical status of Orthodox America. Due to the new church's lack of support, the remaining priests and parishes joined other authorities or became members of the Independent Sacramental Movement. Hieromonk Boris and Priest Michael were received back into the authority of Moscow and the ROGCCA. Later, in 1933, Sophronios officially removed and suspended Aftimios in October and deposed Ignatius in November. Sophronios still refused to submit to Platon or the Moscow Patriarchate. The American Orthodox Catholic Church in its original form ended when Sophronios died in 1934 in Los Angeles. Fr. Serafim gives the date of his death as 1934, but his gravestone reads 1940. He is now buried at the Antiochian Village in Pennsylvania alongside St. Raphael of Brooklyn and Emmanuel (Abo-Hatab). = Succession = Despite many attempts to reestablish the American Orthodox Catholic Church, the primary visible continuation of the church is the American Orthodox Catholic Church (American Patriarchate) and its Western Rite metropolis based in Pennsylvania. The American Orthodox Catholic Church (American Patriarchate) was re-incorporated in Delaware in 2012 and trademarked. Other notable continuations include the Byleorussian Orthodox Catholic Church (now the American World Patriarchs), the American Orthodox Church established in 1972 by Bishop Joseph Thaddeus (Alan Sanford), the THEOCACNA-Vladimir Synod, and the American Orthodox Catholic and Apostolic Church established in 1986 (previously named the Russian Orthodox Church in America).  Practices  The American Orthodox Catholic Church and its successors are distinguished from the mainstream Eastern Orthodox Church by permitting married bishops and various Western Rite liturgies. Practices commonly held within the successive American Orthodox Catholic Church Western Rite Metropolia (American Patriarchate) are the Divine Liturgy in Celtic, Gallican, Anglo-Catholic, and Old Roman Orthodox (Liturgy of Saint Hipolitus, stemming from the Anaphora of the Apostolic Tradition) rites.

It was built above the burial place of St Nicholas, a 4th- century Christian bishop of Myra, an important religious figure for Eastern Orthodox Christians and Roman Catholics and the historical inspiration for Santa Claus. Its use dated from its 6th century construction for the state church of the Roman Empire by Justinian the Great. The basilica is on UNESCO's tentative list to become a World Heritage Site. History The church was built in AD 520 on the foundations of an older Christian church where Saint Nicholas had served as a bishop. Justinian I contributed to the reconstruction. It is noted for its remarkable wall frescos, and its architectural and religious significance. Over time the church was flooded and filled with silt. In 1862 it was restored by Russian Emperor Nicholas I, who added a tower and made other changes to its Byzantine architecture. The church continued to function until its final abandonment by the Eastern Orthodox Church in 1923, when the remaining Greeks of Demre were required to leave by the Population exchange between Greece and Turkey.

Jacquinot de Besange's family originates from aristocratic lineages in Lorraine, northeastern France. He arrived in China in 1913 as a missionary, and served the Portuguese congregation at the Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in Hongkou. He also served as chaplain to the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. De Besange had lost his right arm in an explosion while conducting chemistry experiments in his youth, and was known as the \\"one armed priest\\". De Besange acted as president of the China International Famine Relief Commission during the 1932 Battle of Shanghai, where his relief work for refugees, including negotiating a 4-hour truce between the Chinese and Japanese armies to allow the evacuation of civilians and casualties from the warzone, made him a household name in Shanghai. The \\"de Besange model\\" began with the Shanghai Safety Zone (ÂçóÂ∏ÇÈöæÊ∞ëÂå∫, \\"Nanshi Refugee Zone\\"), or \\"Jacquinot de Besange Safe Zone\\", in 1937 during the Second Sino-Japanese War. This was a de-militarised zone for Chinese civilians located in a part of the Old City of Shanghai that was adjacent to the Shanghai French Concession. The de- militarised zone was respected by both side of the war and the concession authorities. It was administered by an international committee composed of representatives of the US, British and French communities, and policed by the Chinese police. The zone was credited with saving the lives of thousands of Chinese residents between 1937 and 1940, when it was abolished after de Besange left Shanghai. Aside from setting up the Safety Zone, de Besange was also responsible for arranging for refugee camps to be set up in the Tu-seh- weh orphanage and Fuh Tan College to shelter refugees fleeing the war zone.Time Magazine 7 November 1938 \\"WAR IN CHINA: Safety Zones\\" Following the example of de Besange in Shanghai, the foreigners in Nanking created the Nanking Safety Zone (Âçó‰∫¨ÂÆâÂÖ®Âå∫), managed by the International Committee for the Nanjing Safety Zone, led by German businessman John Rabe. The same model also inspired the Hankou Safety Zone, the Zhangzhou Safety Zone and the Shenzhen Safety Zone. His work is acknowledged in the Protocols and Commentaries to the 1949 Geneva Convention. A film of his life and work, Jacquinot: A Forgotten Hero directed by Krzysztof Zanussi, was featured in the 2009 Shanghai International Film Festival.

He became a Bencher of the Inner Temple in 1672, Recorder of London in 1676, and was knighted a year later on 3 February 1677. Dolben apparently served well as Recorder; when he was promoted a few years later, the Corporation of London gave him some silver plate \\"as a loving remembrance\\".

Deinacrida connectens is a flightless nocturnal insect that lives under rocks at high elevation. Mountain populations vary in colour. This species is the most widespread of the eleven species of giant wƒìtƒÅ (Deinacrida).

Opuscula Entomologica, Supplement 2. However, Deinacridopsis was later recognized as a synonym of Deinacrida by New Zealand entomologist Graeme William Ramsay in 1961 and the species was moved to the Deinacrida genus.Ramsay, G.W. 1961: The synonymy and systematics of a genus and two species of New Zealand weta (Orthoptera: Stenopelmatidae: Henicinae). Proceedings of the Royal Entomological Society of London (B), 30: 85‚Äì89. doi:10.1111/j.1365-3113.1961.tb00169.x In the same paper, Ramsay also recognized Deinacrida sonitospina as a synonym of D. connectens, which was previously described by New Zealand entomologist John Tenison Salmon in 1950 from specimens found at Mount Peel and Mount Arthur.Salmon, J.T. 1950: Revision of the New Zealand wetas - Anostostominae (Orthoptera: Stenopelmatidae).

Conservation Under the 2014 New Zealand Threat Classification System, Deinacrida connectens is listed as a ‚ÄúNot Threatened‚Äù species and is the only species of Deinacrida not totally protected by legislation.Trewick, S.A., Johns, P., Hitchmough, R., Rolfe, J. & Stringer, I. 2014:Conservation status of New Zealand Orthoptera. New Zealand Threat Classification Series 16. Due to being restricted to high elevation, it is thought that introduced mammalian predators are not a threat to D. connectens populations, since these predators are uncommon in these regions. This is in contrast to other Deinacrida species, which are generally at lower elevation and are more frequently preyed upon by introduced predators, causes a decline in giant wƒìtƒÅ species abundance. Diet Deinacrida connectens is known to be omnivorous, but in the wild is generally observed feeding on plants.Field, L.H. 1980:Observations on the biology of Deinacrida connectens (Orthoptera: Stenopelmatidae), an alpine weta. New Zealand Journal of Zoology, 7(2):211-220 doi:10.1080/03014223.1980.10423778 D. connectens has been observed in the wild browsing lichens, herbs and shrubs such as Aciphylla and Gaultheria depressa.Larsen, H. & Burns, K.C. 2012:Seed dispersal effectiveness increases with body size in New Zealand alpine scree weta (Deinacrida connectens). Austral Ecology, 37(7): 800-806. doi:10.1111/j.1442-9993.2011.02340.x In captivity D. connectens ate a range of ‚Äúvegetables\\" (lettuce, carrot, clover, and dandelion leaves), fruit (apples, apricots), and raw beef, cheese and insects (cicadas, tenebrionid beetles). Feeding generally occurs early at night, after D. connectens has emerged from their daytime cover. Ecology Deinacrida connectens is New Zealand‚Äôs largest nocturnal alpine insect, but occurs at lower abundance than smaller grasshopper and cockroach species in the same environment. The scree wƒìtƒÅ is known to be capable of dispersing some fleshy fruit seeds by endozoochory. In an experiment, D. connectens' ability to disperse seeds of Gaultheria depressa by feeding was found to be dependent on the size of the wƒìtƒÅ. At smaller sizes, fewer seeds were eaten and the wƒìtƒÅ could be considered seed predators, (almost no seeds made it intact through the guts of individuals measuring 2 cm or less). With larger sized wƒìtƒÅ however, thousands of seeds were consumed, some of which were presumably capable of being dispersed large distances, suggesting D. connectens can act as a seed disperser. One captive individual D. connectens was recorded successfully passing 686 intact seeds. Morphology Males of Deinacrida connectens, like other Deinacrida, are smaller than the females. Adult males are about 3.5 cm in length whereas adult females are about 4.5 cm in length. However, one source has described females measuring 7.2 cm long. Body weight of adults has been recorded to reach almost 10g. Like other Anostostomatidae, D. connectens can produce sound by using their hind legs to rub their abdominal tergites. The hind legs rub against tiny \\"peg\\" like structures, referred to as stridulatory pegs. Throughout the distribution of D. connectens, body colour shows extreme variation. In some populations, individuals may have mostly black bodies (for example, those in a population located at Spence Peak in Southland) whereas others may have a mix of red, grey and olive colours. alt= alt= Breeding The long legs of males compared to females suggest that like other members of this genus the scree wƒìtƒÅ has a scramble competition mating system, in which adult females signal and males search for mates. However, males of Deinacrida connectens appear to invest little energy into reproductive behaviours, and provide small spermatophores. During mating in experimental conditions, males remain beneath the female, with the pair facing the same direction and with their bodies creating an angle of 30¬∞. Copulation has been observed to last around 35 minutes. Mating would be concluded once the male walked away. There is a single observation in experimental conditions of a male scree wƒìtƒÅ attempting to separate a mating pair. Behaviour During the day, Deinacrida connectens remains under rocks and in crevices of scree slopes. They may nestle with other conspecifics during this time. During the night, D. connectens comes out of cover to feed on vegetation. When disturbed, D connectens will either remain motionless or attempt to run away and if they need to defend themselves, they will raise their legs in a threatening posture and produce soft sounds. These sounds have been described as ‚Äúsoft and sibilant, rather like that produced by brushing together the heels of one's palms‚Äù. D. connectens has been described as an aggressive species, and will bite if provoked (although they do not appear to be strong enough to break skin). After feeding, D. connectens will engage in ‚Äúperching‚Äù behaviour, where it stands at the peak of a rock for extended periods of time during the night. In experimental conditions, individuals appeared to maintain an ‚Äúindividual distance‚Äù from one another while out at night. This boundary was maintained by producing sound and using their hind legs to push and kick away other individuals that got too close. However, this boundary does not seem to be maintained during the day, when individuals may huddle together under rocks and in crevices. In laboratory conditions (at temperatures higher than they normally experience), large D. connectens have been known to travel nearly 6 metres per minute.  Phylogeography  Genetic diversity within Deinacrida connectens is quite high and partitioned between populations. In a phylogeography study of D. connectens, research found seven genetic lineages from mtDNA haplotypes, where each occupied a discrete geographic region. The average genetic difference between haplotypes was 4.8%, which is quite high for an insect. This phylogeographical structure combined with lineage age estimations suggests D. connectens radiated during the Pliocene mountain building that created the Southern Alps 5 million years ago. It was also suggested that subsequent glaciation may have helped foster isolation between population of D. connectens. Physiology Deinacrida connectens are adapted to be moderately freeze tolerant and are adapted to high elevation zones.  Cytogenetics  Sex determination of most wƒìtƒÅ species is by the number of large metacentric X-chromosomes; females have two X-chromosomes (XX) and males have one (X0). The scree wƒìtƒÅ is diploid with an even number of chromosomes in females, and an odd number in males, but populations within this species have different numbers of chromosomes. There are seven known karyotypes within D. connectens. These karyotypes vary in number of chromosomes from 2n = 17(X0) to 2n = 22(XX). Known locations of these karyotype races are listed below.

It was known in Genoese governmental circles that one of the reasons why the Dutch government had offered their help to the Franco- Savoyan army was so that they could \\"hit the bank of the King of Spain\\".Engels p.118 However, the Spanish fleet commanded by General √Ålvaro de Baz√°n, Marquis of Santa Cruz, came to the aid of Genoa and relieved the city. Returning its sovereignty to the Republic of Genoa and forcing the French to raise the siege, they consequently began a combined campaign against the Franco-Savoyan forces that had overrun the Genoese Republic one year before. The joint Franco-Piedmontese army was forced to leave Liguria and Spanish troops invaded Piedmont, thereby securing the Spanish Road. Richelieu's Invasion of Genoa and the Valtelline had resulted in his humiliation by the Spaniards.Stradling p.99 Background In northern Italy, Philip IV of Spain had followed his father's efforts to defend Catholics in the valleys of Valtellina against the Protestants in Graub√ºnden. In 1622 Richelieu had arranged an anti-Spanish league with Venice and Savoy. With his ascendancy, the French policy changed. The French claimed that due to the alliance between them and the Duke of Savoy, they had to help Savoy, which was attacking Genoa, by attacking Valtelline and diverting the resources of the Spanish, who were supporters of Genoa. In the autumn of 1624, using the pretext that papal forces had not been withdrawn from the Valtelline as agreed, French and Swiss troops invaded the Catholic valleys of the Grey Leagues and seized the forts, to protect them, Richelieu had established the Governors of the Duchy of Milan. Consequently, Spain formed an alliance with the Grand Duke of Tuscany, the Duke of Modena and Parma, and the republics of Genoa and Lucca, deciding to make a several action.Parker p.49 Fran√ßois de Bonne, Duke de Lesdiguieres, commander of the French army. The irony of a Cardinal attacking the troops of a Pope was not lost on Rome, Spain, and ultra-Catholics in France. In 1625 the French marshals Fran√ßois de Bonne, Duke of Lesdigui√®res and Charles de Blanchefort, Marquis de Cr√©quy, joined the Duke of Savoy, invaded the territories of the dominion of Genoa. An attack on Genoa would cut the southern end of the Spanish Road and knock out Spain's banker. The time seemed opportune, with the apparent convergence of Protestant hostility to the Habsburgs, and explains French participation in the London talks with Mansfeld. Richelieu hoped Britain and the Dutch would send a fleet to assist his own squadron in cutting the seaway between Spain and Genoa, while Venice attacked Milan. Fran√ßois Annibal d'Estr√©es, Duke of Estr√©es and 3,500 French troops crossed Protestant Swiss territory to join a similar number of Rhetians levied with French money. More subsidies and troops poured into Savoy, where the French formed a third of the 30,000-strong army that began operations against Genoa in February 1625. The attack caught the Genoese Republic unprepared. Most of the Republic was overrun, while 4,000 reinforcements from Spain were intercepted by French warships in March. By this time Cardinal Richelieu remarked: The Duke of Estr√©es quickly conquered the Valtellina, because the Papal garrisons offered no resistance except at Riva and Chiavenna. Richelieu's elaborate plan then began to unravel. The Valtellina operation placed France in direct opposition to an essentially Francophile papacy, incensing the d√©vots. Don G√≥mez Su√°rez de Figueroa, Duke of Feria sent 6,000 men and Tommaso Caracciolo, Count of Roccarainola as Maestro de Campo in order to reinforce the city of Genoa, which continued to resist the Franco-Savoyard siege. Venice abstained from the fighting, while British and Dutch support failed to materialize, enabling Spain to break through the relatively weak French fleet and relieve Genoa in August. Genoese doge Alessandro Giustiniani, wrote: France also sent financial help to the Dutch Republic, and subsidised the siege of Mansfeld.Pearce p.216 French threat The number of galleys of the Genoese republic were increased from eight to ten, and the republic was defended by around 11,000 soldiers consisting of German mercenaries and men raised within the walls of the republic. By February the invaders were within sight of the city and began to occupy the western riviera. In March Genoa was attacked by the combined army and the French fleet threatened to cut communications with Spain, capturing three Genoese ships carrying nearly 650,000 pieces of eight. Map of Genoa printed by Francesco Maria Accinelli, 18th century. Troops Embarking on a Galley in the Port of Genoa, engraving by Cornelis de Wael circa 1630. Yet while the strategic importance of the city and port of Genoa to the Spanish military system ensured that an attack would certainly succeed in drawing off Spanish troops, it presented France with military difficulties that were as considerable as those of the Valtelline theatre.Parrot p.87 Above all, Spanish naval superiority would make an effective seaward blockade of Genoa impossible, and greatly reduce the likelihood of success if the siege proved to be lengthy. Moreover, an attack on a third party, albeit a firm ally of Spain, was hard to reconcile with the rhetoric of liberating the peninsula from the yoke of Habsburg servitude; other secondary powers such as Mantua, Modena, Parma and especially France's habitual ally, Venice, drew the obvious conclusion and declined to join the Franco-Savoyard initiative. Despite these dangers the Duke de Lesdigueres and constable of France, moved down through Piedmont to blockade Genoa with an army of 23,000 men, one third of whom were French. At first, Richelieu sought to present the military situation to the king in the most optimistic light, maintaining in May 1625 that: Yet even this m√©moire could not avoid reference to the growing concern that Spain might widen the conflict by an attack from Flanders of up from Spain itself. Genoa entrusted the command of his army to the Carlo Doria, Duke of Tursi and his general field master Giovanni Gerolamo Doria, while the Marquis of Santa Cruz was ordered to relieve the city. Spanish infantry from Naples embarked, carrying a total of 4,000 soldiers among whom 2,000 were elite infantry tercios viejos from the Army of Flanders. Santa Cruz reached Genoa and was received with great joy by the decayed spirits of the citizens. Soon the tenacity and experience of the Tercios under the Duke of Feria obtained good results and the French army began to retreat, as they were besieged by two fronts and the situation was becoming unsustainable. After a month the Franco- Savoian retreated and the Spanish was able to capture the city, so very important for their economy. Santa Cruz also counter-attacked by sea, destroying three French warships at the Hyeres islands. Piedmontese theatre Genoese Star Fort Diamante. Richelieu arrived at Turin on 1 February 1625, and at the walls of Asti on the 4 March, between Genoa and Milan. After storming Capriata, Novi and Rossiglione, Lesigui√®res decided to slow his pace, capturing Voltaggio and preferring to lay siege to Gavi, against the advice of the Duke of Savoy. Gavi surrendered on the 22 April, but it was too late to take Genoa. In the Tyrol, an imperial army was preparing to intervene in the Valtelline valley, while the Spanish army under the Duke of Feria prepared to come to Genoa's aid. The Spanish took Acqui then marched against Casale, reclaiming Gavi and Novi, while Lesdiguieres beat a retreat to the Piedmont. The Duke of Savoy, joined by the Marquis de Cr√©quy, who replaced Lesdiguieres (who had returned to the Dauphine) beat a retreat to the Piedmont and entrenched their army at Verrua. The Duke of Feria was stopped on the 5 August 1625, and shortly afterwards he lifted the siege of Verrua and Lesdiguieres took his troops back to the Dauphin√©. Feria managed to rescue the panicked Genoese governors that were hidden inside the walls of Savona. French-Savoian policies were lying in ruins. At the end the force led by the Duke of Savoy and the Marquis of Cr√©quy met not easy victory but fierce resistance from the militia of the Genoese Apennines, supported by Spanish forces from Milan. The Invaders were forced to retreat, and returned across the Alps in November.Berc√© p.119 Reconquest of the French Riviera Map of the L√©rins Islands, circa 1630. After the Spanish had relieved Genoa, the Genoese allowed their troops to be placed under the command of the Count of Roccarainola, as suggested by the Spanish crown. Galeazzo Giustiani with four of the republic's galleys captured the Savoyard capitana and things seemed to be taking a turn for the better. Disillusion with Spanish management of the war came quickly, though. The Genoese were eager to recover their lost territories, but Santa Cruz, now with seventy galleys in the port, refused to leave the city.Kirk p.101 The reconquest was brought about that summer and the following autumn by a fleet of forty galleys under the joint command of the republic's general, Emmanuele Garbarino, Spanish admiral Santa Cruz, and the Duke of Tursi. By October the republic had recuperated all its lost territory with the exception of the castle of La Penna and had even added Oneglia, Ormea, and a number of localities in Piedmont to its possessions. Santa Cruz successfully stormed and captured the forts of Albenga, Port Maurice, Ventimiglia, Lovan, Gandore, Casanova, Oneglia, Triola, , Bigran, San Remo, Camporosso, conquering the biggest islets of the L√©rins Islands, √éle Sainte-Marguerite and √éle Saint- Honorat. The Spanish retained both islands until they were reconquered by the French admiral Philippe de Poincy, on 12 March 1637.Callo p.330 Aftermath The relief on Genoa lasted one month, but Spanish aid had been prompt and effective. The reversal of Genoese sorts when all seemed lost, the continued arrival of silver shipments even in Spanish galleys, and the unwavering behavior of Doria and his fellow asentistas de galeras all seemed to substantiate the positions of those who, like Doge Alessandro Giustiani in 1613, saw perfect union and harmony of intents in the alliance with Spain and the bonds between the Genoese nobility and Philip IV.Kirk p.102 All was not to go to the republic's liking, however, in 1625. In October, at the height of success against Genoa's northern neighbor, the Spanish and the French, without consulting their respective allies signed a six-month truce, which was imposed on Genoa and Savoy as well. Castle at Monz√≥n. In early 1626, as Savoy rearmed and the Republic of Genoa began to fear that it would again become the object of French and Piedmontese appetites, Santa Cruz proposed some modifications in the alliance between Spain and the republic. Given the events of the previous year, the Genoese were particularly well disposed toward Philip IV and accepted an alliance for the mutual defense of one another's states, the republic agreeing as well to maintain 14,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry, the expenses for which they were to be reimbursed through the alienation to the Genoese of equivalent sums from the royal revenue in Spain. Furthermore, the republic agreed to send 70,000 scudi a month to the governor of Milan against similar assignations to be specified at a later date. In the event of a Savoyard attack on the republic, Philip IV committed himself to attacking Piedmont on its exposed side from Milan. And should Milan be attacked, the Genoese would invade Piedmont from the south. The Recovery of Bah√≠a de Todos los Santos, by Fray Juan Bautista Ma√≠no, Museo del Prado. In March 1626 the French and Spanish concluded the Treaty of Monz√≥n, suspension of fighting between the Duke of Savoy and the Republic of Genoa being an integral part of the agreement. The Treaty on 5 March 1626, restored the pre-1618 situation with important qualifications. Jurisdiction was nominally restored over the Valtellina; this was now recognized as Catholic, which strengthened its autonomy and introduced doubt as to who could decide on transit through the valley. Papal troops replaced the French though the forts were supposed to be destroyed. Monz√≥n represented a serious reverse for Richelieu who blamed his envoy for the terms and feigned illness to avoid seeing the furious Savoyard ambassador. Abandoned, Savoy was obliged to make its own peace and now sought a Spanish alliance and intrigued with French malcontents against Richelieu, including possible involvement in the Chalais plot to murder the cardinal in 1626. The Valtelline valley was returned to the Vatican. Spanish forces scored a series of striking successes. In the spring of 1625 they regained Bahia in Brazil and Breda in the Netherlands from the Dutch. In the autumn they repulsed the English at Cadiz.Parker p.45 See also *Second Genoese‚ÄìSavoyard War *Annus mirabilis References Sources * Berc√©, Yves Marie.

Michael \\"Mike\\" Houston (born 1944) is a former mayor of Springfield, Illinois. He served as Springfield's mayor from 1979 to 1987 and from 2011 to 2015. Background The Houston family originally settled in Sangamon County in 1824. Houston was born in 1944, in Boston, where his father was stationed, in the U.S. Navy. After returning to Springfield following World War II, Houston attended Cathedral Grade School and Griffin High School. After one year at Springfield Junior College, Houston transferred to Illinois State University, where he graduated with a B.S. in business administration. He later completed an M.B.A. at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Following undergraduate school, Houston worked for Higbee's in Cleveland, Ohio, and then Cole National Corporation, where he ultimately became the general manager. During this time, he developed a desire to have his own business. While visiting his family back in Springfield, during the Christmas season in 1970, he found an ad for a chain link fence business, up for sale, which he decided to purchase. Political activities In addition to running his business, Houston also served as president of Springfield JayCees (SJC). This was also when he became involved first-hand, with local politics and elections, while advocating for education-related referenda. One of his colleagues from SJC then decided to run for school board, and asked Houston to run his campaign, which fell narrowly short of victory. Houston subsequently assisted with the campaigns of State Senator John Davidson and State Representative J. David Jones, both of whom were also past presidents of SJC. During the 1975 Springfield municipal elections, Houston began considering a future run for Mayor of Springfield. After serving in a leadership position within the local chamber of commerce, and being dissatisfied in the way city government was operating, especially insofar as economic development, Houston declared his candidacy for mayor, in 1978. After a five-candidate nonpartisan primary, in February 1979, Houston defeated Frank Madonia in the April general election, to be elected mayor. He was re-elected in 1983, finishing first, out of five candidates, in the primary, and then defeating James Dunham in the general municipal election. In 1986, Houston soughtEgler, Daniel.

Accessed December 22, 2010. and received the Republican nomination for Treasurer of Illinois, but lost the general election to Democrat Jerry Cosentino. The following year, Houston was defeated in his mayoral reelection bid. Post-mayoral career After leaving the office of mayor, Houston entered the banking business, joining LaSalle National Bank, to serve as a consultant to some municipalities and governmental bodies, throughout the state. He later joined a subsidiary of Marine Bank in Springfield, subsequently becoming CEO of that subsidiary, and continuing with the bank, after it became Bank One, and then J.P. Morgan Chase. In 2005, Houston became the president and CEO of Town and Country Bank, and continues to serve as the chairman emeritus. Houston also presently serves as the chairman of the Board of Trustees at Western Illinois University, and also holds the same position at St. John's Hospital. He was also the last chairman of the board of the Greater Springfield Chamber of Commerce, and is currently on the Board of Directors of the Downtown Springfield, Inc. Heritage Foundation, the Quantum Growth Partnership, and the Abraham Lincoln Council of the Boy Scouts of America. Houston ran for mayor of Springfield in 2003. He finished in third place in the primary election and did not qualify for the runoff. Re- election In November 2010, Houston entered the race for Mayor of Springfield, the office he previously held.

Cooperating with the other artist Xue Yongjun, they formed an \\"artists group\\" and started to create and paint together. Born in the 1970s when China was in economic reform and opening-up, Zhu Yiqing and Xue Yongjun have seen the invasion of western cultures and capitalism values, the prevailing of Japanese cartoon culture as well as the significant influence of computers and Internet on China. All those historical changes have inspired them with deep thinking towards art, inspiring them to study on modern cultural collision from the view of artists and finally choosing the traditional Chinese seal as the medium of creation.Picture Album of Zhu Yiqing & Xue Yongjun Fragility of Duplication Published by Mountain Art Beijing & Frank Lin Art Center in 2008 The subjects of Zhu and Xue‚Äôs creations mainly cover three aspects including the political images of national flag and politicians, traditional cultural images of classical paintings both eastern and western as well as the popular and consumption cultural images of the idol stars and products logos. Zhu and Xue with their artworks show a strong sense of duality on the selection of subjects, the usage of medium and skills and the formal expression, trying to eliminate the boundaries between the east and the west, the native and the foreign, the traditional and the modern, the handmade and the machinery as well as the perspective and the plane, thus creating any possible balance among those conflicts or contradictions and outlining the new image painting of digital era. Picture Album of Zhu Yiqing & Xue Yongjun Made in China Published by Mountain Art Beijing & Frank Lin Art Center in 2010  Art Review  As China‚Äôs traditional cultural symbol, seal stands for not only social status but also power, showing exactly the Chinese values. This is also why Zhu Yiqing and Xue Yongjun are determined to paint with seals: to respond to the complex collision of modern culture with the multi-meanings of seals from elementary language to token of status. As the artists explain how they choose images for painting, ‚ÄúWe choose those representative ones and deconstruct them to present the pixelized features of computer age. The deconstruction endows the images with internal connections, making them carriers of the subjects that the artists require for the artworks. As the images have been reduced of its original meanings with the variation, they exist in status of collision, shatter, variation and melting.‚Äù [ Extracted from the interview with the artists via email.] In other words, the composition of seals is in its simplest form what the artists try to express the process of cultural collision, shatter, variation and melting, appropriately expressing their unique perspectives towards cultural interaction. Given the concept of cultural collision, transforming the political flag and celebrities, classical paintings of great cultural meanings and celebrities in popular culture into seals designs of cultural and commodity symbols, Zhu Yiqing and Xue Yongjun are implanting those Chinese-style vocabularies into the paintings, expressing with which the resistance to foreign cultures. For example, the Made in China series, their latest creation in 2009 has built the totems of the two world powers of China and America from both the real and illusionary perspectives. The Chinese banner with both Chairman Mao Zedong‚Äôs portrait and the five-star red flag in Made in China ‚Äì Chinese Flag together with the symbol consisting of capitalism brand signs in another painting, though of totally different subjects, does not only satirize the current cultural problems of consumption, but also reflect the fact that China is drawing closer to capitalism. Seals were invented to reproduce images in great amount conveniently. However, Zhu Yiqing and Xue Yongjun cast off the convenient and simple nature of seals when painting with them, changing the features of seals from printing-like into painting with a complicated process. All of the seals they use are carved by themselves at a very slow speed, and are then overprinted on canvas one by one, revealing a brand new painting way completely different from Pop Art‚Äôs speed duplication. From plane surface to space, from characters to paintings, and from the images composition to illusions, the creation does not only show a new connection and balance between printing and painting, the plane and the perspective, as well as the machinery duplication and handmade production, but also implicate the two artists‚Äô perceptual explanation during the seemingly rational constructing. Conflicting yet merging on the visual experience, it is the dual nature of the two artists‚Äô artworks, which is also the impression they show to the audience.

Background  Baghdad, once the capital of Arab Abbasid Caliphate, was one of the most important cities of the medieval Muslim World. In the second half of the Medieval age the Turkic dynasties (Seljuks, Kara Koyunlu, Ak Koyunlu) and others tried to gain control over this prestigious city. From 1508 till 1534 it was ruled by the emerging Safavid dynasty of Iran, between that time led by shah Ismail I and shah Tahmasp I respectively. In 1534, the Ottoman sultan S√ºleyman I () captured the city without any serious combat during the Ottoman‚ÄìSafavid War (1532‚Äì55), which was confirmed in the resulting Peace of Amasya. However, 90 years later it was recaptured by Abbas I of Persia. Attempts of several Ottoman commanders () to retake the city following 1624, were fruitless. In 1638 Ottoman Sultan Murad IV (Suleyman I's Great-Great- Great Grandson) decided to recapture the city. According to legend, only the sultan in-person, could conquer the city. Murat was seen as a warrior hero and thus it seemed as his duty to campaign and regain Baghdad. He had been victorious against the Druze rebels a decade earlier and won a great victory at the Siege of Yerevan (1635) in 1635. According to the eyewitness account of Zarain Agha the Ottoman mobilization for the siege of Baghdad was 108,589 men composed of 35,000 infantry in part Janissaries, and 73,589 cavalry.Ottoman Warfare 1500-1700, Rhoads Murphey, 1999, p.36  The siege  The birds' flight distance between Istanbul and Baghdad is about . According to historian Joseph von Hammer the Ottoman army covered this distance in 197 days with 110 staging stations in between. The siege began on 15 November 1638. The Safavids had increased the garrison size of the city by around 4-5 times. There were four main gates of the city, the North Gate, Azamiye or Imam-i Azam, (of Ab≈´ ·∏§anƒ´fa), the South Gate Karanlƒ±k (dark), Ak (white) and K√∂pr√º (bridge) gates. The Ottoman observer Ziyaeddin Ibrahim Nuri described the city's fortifications as follows: the city walls were 25 meters tall and between 10 and 7 meters wide, reinforced by earthen ramparts to withstand artillery bombardment and protected by a wide and deep moat. The city walls featured 114 towers between the North and South Gate, and another 94 towers that ran parallel to the Tigris. The Safavid commander, Bektash Khan, had made extensive repairs to the fortifications. Two Pashas were deployed against the first two gates. But the Grand Vizier Tayyar Mehmet Pasha noticed that these two gates were very well fortified. So he chose to attack on the third (Ak) gate which seemed less fortified. During the siege the Safavids made sallies of around 6,000 men at a time, this was followed by a retreat into the city and a fresh 6,000 to attack. These types of attacks greatly increased the casualties of the Ottomans. The siege continued for 40 days. Towards the end, impatient Murat urged the Grand Vizier for a general attack. The attack was successful and the city was captured on 25 December 1638 (on the 116th anniversary of the capture of Rhodes by Suleyman I). But during the final clashes, the Grand Vizier was shot down.Joseph von Hammer: Geschichte der osmanischen Dichtkunst Vol II (translation: Mehmet Ata) Milliyet yayƒ±nlarƒ±, p 220-221  Aftermath  Although the defenders were given free passage to Persia, some resumed fighting after the capture of the city around Karanlƒ±k gate. The human loss during the after-capture fighting was severe. Nevertheless, soon after the capture, the new Grand Vizier Kemanke≈ü Mustafa Pasha and the Persian representative Saruhan began peace talks and on 17 May 1639 the treaty of Zuhab was signed, which became an important historical treaty. By this treaty the modern Turkey-Iran and Iraq-Iran frontier lines were drawn. Although there were some other wars after the treaty of Zuhab, the treaties following the wars were merely the ratification of the treaty of Zuhab.Prof. Ya≈üar Y√ºce-Prof. Ali Sevim: T√ºrkiye tarihi Cilt III, AKDTYKTTK Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, ƒ∞stanbul, 1991 p 81-82  Trivia  During the Baghdad campaign Murat lost two of his Grand Viziers. The first was Bayram Pasha on 17 August 1638, who died on the way to Baghdad and the second was Mehmet Tayyar who died on 24 December 1638. Tayyar Mehmet was also the third Ottoman Grand Vizier who died on the battle field (the first two being Hadim Ali Pasha in 1511 and Hadim Sinan Pasha in 1517). After this victory Murat had two magnificent kiosks built in the Topkapi gardens, one for his victory at Yerevan and the other for his victory at Baghdad.

MalCon is a part of Information Sharing and Analysis Center, in support with the Government of India. Executed in India by the UK based multinational media company UBM Plc that also owns the infamous Black Hat briefings, MalCon aims in bringing together Malware and Information Security Researchers from across the globe to share key research insights into building and containment of the next generation malwares. Unlike most hacker conventions, MALCON is opposed to the much debated ‚Äòzero day‚Äô and ‚Äòfull disclosure‚Äô. The first MalCon conference took place in December 2010 at Mumbai and Pune, India. Many of the attendees at MALCON include security professionals, Government employees, lawyers, researchers, journalists and hackers with interest in malwares and its global impact on economy. The event promotes ‚Äúproactive‚Äù research in malware coding and openly invites malcoders to come forward and demonstrate their creation.  History  Malcon was founded in 2010 by Rajshekhar Murthy, known as thebluegenius, is a science graduate and an ex-employee of Microsoft Corporation. Since the inception of MalCon, it has been widely backed by numerous government organizations such as NTRO. Eventually, MalCon became a part of Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC), a non-profit in support with the Government of India in 2011.  Philosophy  The event organizers have issued a FAQ that outlines their philosophy for MalCon, where they explain their objective as ‚ÄúOur Aim is to help the Security Industry as well as Software Industry, understand this fine ‚Äòart‚Äô of Malware Development (Which covers even exploits) so that they can build better and secure code, as well as work towards mitigating potential new attack vectors.‚Äù In an interview to kerbsonsecurity, he quoted \\"While a conference can be done by inviting the best / well known security experts who can share statistics, slides and ‚Äòanalysis‚Äô of malwares, it is not of any benefit to the community today except that of awareness. The need of MalCon conference is bridge that ignored gap between security companies and malcoders. They have to get on a common platform and talk to each other. Just like the concept of ‚Äòethical hacking‚Äô has helped organizations to see that hackers are not all that bad, it is time to accept that ‚Äòethical malcoding‚Äô is required to research, identify and mitigate newer malwares in a ‚Äòproactive‚Äô way\\". Rajshekhar Murthy coined new security term ‚Äúethical malcoding‚Äù to differentiate between malcoders who work in the background independently or with various security firms for research and those who do it for financial gain; and another term \\"GuuWare\\" to describe software‚Äôs that may have similar attributes of a malware but are used for defensive purposes.  Controversies  MalCon approach of openly inviting \\"ethical malcoders\\" gained a lot of International attention and faced criticism from notable security sites and bloggers. On its part, MalCon on its FAQ maintains that ‚ÄúIt is not about rapid analysis but about detection. Technology or not, MalCon conference or not, there are new malwares out there constantly being created. Even if the available handful of security vendors have their own team of researchers for analysis, this is not enough. Active and open participation by ‚Äòethical malcoders‚Äô will help advance the research and containment capability of our existing methods‚Äù  Event format  The MalCon convention has the following format: * Technical briefings: The main content of the submitted CFP, the 2010 MalCon revolved around \\"Malware creation in under two minutes\\" theme. * Workshops: Technical workshops related to Malwares. * The Big Talk (panel discussion): A subject for debate by experts, the Big talk in MalCon 2010 focused on 'Hiring hackers for National security', where both hackers and representatives of the Indian Government participated. * Capture the Mal: Announced for MalCon 2011, 'Capture the Mal' is proposed to be a variant of the popular Capture the Flag contest, where security professionals will try to capture and analyze an unknown malware in a limited time.  Publications  = The Malware Comic = The malware comic was announced by the MalCon team on day of Maha Shivaratri 20 February 2012 - and stated that they planned to release Zero-days using comics. The comic is expected in two formats - a web and a printed version, where the printed version is specifically for the Indian Government officials, Intelligence agencies and Law enforcement groups, who are regular attendees at the conference. = The Malware Journal = The creation of Malware Journal was formally disclosed at MalCon 2011. The quarterly journal is in collaboration with various hacker groups with the objective of helping coders understand the art behind malcoding for offensive defense and security. This journal is also seen as a remarkable and significant point in the history and evolution of hackers and cyber warfare capabilities of India.  Notable events  = MalCon 2012 = * Windows Phone 8 Malware Prototye - Indian Hacker Shantanu Gawde presented possibly the world's first Windows phone 8 malware prototype amid many discussions at the conference with live demonstrations.

His mother was Margaret, daughter of Sir John Byron of Clayton. In his seventeenth year he was one of the pages of honour to Henry VI, and at the same early age he married Margaret, the heiress of the Bartons of Middleton, and became the founder of the family that held the lordship there until the 18th century, when it passed by the female line to the holders of the Suffield peerage. His grandson Richard Ashton rebuilt St Leonard's church at Middleton in 1524. Offices Ralph Ashton was a man of influence, and in the reign of Edward IV he held various offices. He was High Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1472, and for his courage at the capture of Berwick upon Tweed he was made a knight banneret at Hutton Field. When his commander, the Duke of Gloucester, became Richard III, he rewarded Sir Ralph's adhesion to the Yorkist cause by extensive grants of land. In 1483 he was appointed vice-constable of England and lieutenant of the Tower of London. The date of his death is unknown, but he is traditionally said to have been shot at Ashton-under-Lyne, and the yearly ceremony known as the \\"Riding of the Black Lad\\" is regarded as a commemoration of that event. There is a very full rent-roll or custumal of the manor of Ashton in 1422, in which the various names and obligations of the tenants are set forth. Legacy Ralph Ashton is mentioned in a passage which Dr. Hibbert-Ware has explained with much ingenuity, though not with absolute certainty. According to this, corn marigold (Chrysanthemun segetum) grew so extensively in the low wet land about Ashton as to be inimical to the crops, and the lord of the manor had an annual inspection and levied fines on those tenants on whose lands it was seen. This power, delegated to Ralph Ashton and his brother Robert, is said to have been made the pretext of such tyrannical exactions that on one of these visitations the tenants rose in desperation and the \\"Black Knight\\" was slain. Others hold that it was whilst exercising in the northern parts his despotic powers as vice-constable that he excited the terror expressed in the legendary rhyme:‚Äî The effigy of the Black Knight is still paraded through the town of Ashton on Easter Monday.

While he competed on the Nike Tour, he became known especially for his long driving, where success is achieved by a golfer hitting a golf ball the farthest. In 1992 he won the National Long Driving Championship in the United States, and was the world long driving champion. Early life Scheinblum, who is Jewish, is the son of former Major League Baseball All Star outfielder Richie Scheinblum. His father played in the 1972 All Star Game while he was with the Kansas City Royals. As a child, he spent two years of his boyhood in Japan, where his father played baseball for the Hiroshima Carp. He then lived in Orange County, California, where he attended Villa Park High School. Scheinblum turned to professional golf after an injury to his pitching elbow in his freshman year of being a power pitcher in high school ended his dream of playing major league baseball as his father had. Golf A 6' 2\\", 190-pound athlete, Scheinblum is an accomplished golfer. Between 1993 and 1996 he competed on the second tier Nike Tour (now Korn Ferry Tour), where his best finish was a tie for fifth in the 1994 Monterrey Open. He also played in one PGA Tour event, the 1996 Michelob Championship at Kingsmill, missing the cut. Scheinblum has had his greatest success in long drive competitions.

It was formerly (and still is by some authorities) considered conspecific with the western black-eared wheatear. The breeding male has the forehead, crown, and mantle white or nearly white with a buff tinge, and the wings blacker than those of the northern wheatear. The underparts are white tinged with buff. The back, upper tail coverts and most of the tail are white. A black mask extends from the ear coverts to the bill. The throat can be either black or white. In autumn and winter the head and mantle are distinctly buff, as are the underparts (including the throat on non-black-throated individuals), but the buff varies in intensity. Except for the central pair, the tail feathers are much whiter than in the northern wheatear, the white on the inner web often extending to the tip. The female is a more gray-brown bird, but has the characteristic white lower back, and her seasonal changes are less marked. It is found breeding in the eastern Mediterranean , Southeast Europe to the Caspian Sea and Iran and migrates to winter quarters in the Sudan. The male eastern black-eared wheatear can be distinguished from the male western black-eared wheatear by its whiter, less buff-tinted upperparts than the latter species, giving it a more distinctly black-and-white appearance, as well as by having the black of the mask reaching just above the base of the bill. Black-throated individuals of this species have a greater amount of black on the throat and face than on the western birds, and the black generally terminates more abruptly or in a straighter line. Females of this species differ from their western counterparts in being overall colder- colored and duller.

It was opened in 1870 by the Thuringian Railway Company (). The line is about 67.1 km long. Regional-Express line 612 services operate every two hours on the line between G√∂ttingen and Chemnitz and Zwickau. Erfurter Bahn operates services every two hours using Regio-Shuttle diesel multiple units. The running time is 40 minutes (Regional-Express) and 65 minutes (Erfurter Bahn) each way. It is thus part of the fastest connection from Jena, Weimar and Erfurt to Hanover. History  Already in the 1840s proposals for a railway from Frankfurt to Bavaria via Thuringia was under discussion. When construction of the Hanoverian Southern Railway (Hann√∂verschen S√ºdbahn, Hanover‚ÄìG√∂ttingen‚ÄìKassel, opened in 1854) and the Werra Railway (Werrabahn, Eisenach‚ÄìMeiningen‚ÄìCoburg, opened in 1859) started, a connection was planned from these lines to M√ºhlhausen. From G√∂ttingen to Leinefelde the line was shared with the temporary western end of the Halle‚ÄìKassel line (Nordhausen‚ÄìLeinefelde‚ÄìArenshausen‚ÄìFriedland‚ÄìG√∂ttingen, opened in 1867). However, the countries involved (Hanover, Prussia, Saxe-Weimar and Saxe-Coburg and Gotha) for a long time could not agree on an alignment, in particular the southern terminus (Eisenach, Gotha or Erfurt) was controversial. In the end, they agreed on Gotha, allowing construction to begin in 1868. In 1870, it was opened to traffic. The line connected with the existing line from the east (the Thuringian Railway, opened in 1847) in Gotha station in order to connect with the Werra Railway. This means that passengers still usually have to change trains in Gotha to reach Erfurt. The originally planned extension from Gotha to the south was never built. However, progress has been made on other north-south routes. In 1876, part of the route later known as the North‚ÄìSouth railway opened between Friedland and Bebra (the Bebra‚ÄìG√∂ttingen line), which is shorter and can accommodate higher loads (it has grades of up to 1:80 compared to over 1:50 for the Werra Railway). As early as 1884, the line between Arenshausen and Friedland was abandoned, so that trains from Gotha to G√∂ttingen had to be change direction in Eichenberg. In 1880 the Leinefelde‚ÄìSilberhausen section of the line became part of the Cannons Railway (Kanonenbahn) and this section was duplicated. As a result of the Treaty of Versailles, the Leinefelde‚ÄìSilberhausen section was reduced to one track in 1919/20. By 1945 the railway the Leinefelde-Gotha line was mainly used for regional services with a few D-trains (D-Z√ºgen, long distance express trains) between Erfurt and Hanover. During the period of East Germany‚Äôs existence (1945‚Äì1990) there were no direct services between Erfurt and the Eichsfeld district. Following German reunification the line between Arenshausen and Eichenberg was re-opened in 1990, with services operating to Kassel. Since the completion of the Eichenberg curve in 1998, services have run to G√∂ttingen. From 1993 to 1997 direct services ran on the Gotha curve between Gotha Ost and Erfurt, bypassing Gotha station. The Gotha‚ÄìLeinefelde line is now served by tilting trains operating at 160 km / h.

Prior to joining the Ukrainian Navy she was a former KGB Border Guard patrol ship named Dnepr. In March 2014, she was seized by Russian soldiers and de facto came under control of the Russian Black Sea Fleet. The ship was returned to the Ukrainian Navy from Crimea on 19 April 2014.  Class and role  Vinnytsia is a 1124P project corvette (NATO reporting name: Grisha II class, Soviet classification: Albatros class ). In Soviet service she was designated as a Border Guard Patrol Ship, modified versions of the naval Small Anti- Submarine Ship design. The Grisha-class anti-submarine ships were designed to search for and destroy enemy submarines found in coastal areas. They were equipped with a variety of anti-submarine warfare (ASW) weapons. All were fitted with retractable fin stabilizers. The Grisha II class were modified variants built for the border guard between 1972 and 1983. These ships had a second gun mounting replacing the SA-N-4 missile system forward.  Service  The corvette Dnepr was laid down on 23 December 1975 at the Zelenodolsk Shipyard, Zelenodolsk, Republic of Tatarstan. The ship was launched on 17 June 1976. The corvette was moved from Zelenodol'sk to the Sea of Azov along the Volga and Don. The corvette was initially based at Sevastopol for trials. On 24 December 1976 an act was signed adding the ship to the Border Guard Service of USSR. The Soviet Maritime Border Guard flag was raised on the ship on 31 December 1976. = Service in the Coast Guard = Dnepr saw service throughout the late 1970s and into the 1980s, guarding the state border and the economic zone of the USSR and patrolling off the coast of the Crimean peninsula in the Black Sea. In 1977 Dnepr patrolled the Black Sea between Zmiinyi Island and the Kerch Strait. In 1978, the ship was assigned to patrol between Odessa Port and Novorossiysk Port. In 1979, her patrol area stretched from Cape Tarkhankut to Novorossiysk Port. In 1980, Dnepr patrolled between Cape Tarkhankut and Ochamchire Port, and in 1981 along the southern coast of Crimea. In June 1992, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union Dnepr and her sister ship Izmail joined the Coast Guard of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine. = Service in the Ukrainian Navy = In late 1995 it was decided to transfer the Grisha-class vessels Dnepr and Izmail to the Naval Forces of Ukraine. The Ukrainian naval flag was raised on the ship on 19 January 1996. Dnepr was renamed Vinnytsia and reclassified as a corvette. Following her commissioning into the Ukrainian Navy, Vinnytsia participated in many joint training exercises with other nations. In July 1996 Vinnytsia participated in the naval multinational exercise Cooperative Partner‚Äî96 off Bulgaria. In August of the same year, the corvette was a participant in the strategic exercise Sea‚Äî96, following that up with the naval multinational exercise Classic‚Äî96 off Romania. In April 1998 the ship was among the vessels that took part in a Ukrainian-Russian naval exercise. She spend the better part of 1999 in naval exercises, the highlight being the Ukrainian-Russian naval exercise Farvater Miru‚Äî99 () in August. In 2000, again the ship participated in naval exercises, including the multinational Cooperative Partner‚Äî2000 in June. In 2002 Vinnytsia performed in a multitude of naval exercises including the naval multinational exercise Breeze‚Äî2002 and strategic exercise Farvater Forpost‚Äî2002. She repeated that a year later in 2003, participating in the naval multinational exercises Breeze‚Äî2003, Farvater Miru‚Äî2003, Cooperative Partner‚Äî2003, Black Sea Partner‚Äî2003 and the BLACKSEAFOR Activation. In 2007 the corvette took part in the strategic exercise Artery‚Äî2007, Morsky vusol‚Äî2007 (). Her captain in 2009 was Captain, 3rd rank Alexander Kostyuk. On 22 March 2014, during the Crimean Crisis, Vinnytsia was seized by Russian soldiers at her pier in the Southern Naval Base. Crimean separatist units lined up the crew and gave them the choice of remaining in Crimea and taking the oath of allegiance to the Republic of Crimea or leaving the peninsula. Half of the crew remained in Crimea, and on 19 April the corvette was towed to Odessa after Russia returned seized Ukrainian Navy ships. At Odessa, she became a training ship. By May 2016 the ship's complement numbered less than 30. Due to the need for major repairs and lack of spare parts for the ship, the Ukrainian Navy planned to decommission her in 2017, but the ship remained in service as of May 2016. In October 2017 the ship was placed in dry dock in order to evaluate her condition. Vice Admiral Ihor Voronchenko, the commander of Ukraine's Navy, commented that despite being over 40 years old the ship may be repaired and continue service as Ukraine's forces desperately need anti- submarine assets in order to counter Russia's growing submarine fleet in the Black Sea region.

The BFUA was founded as an amalgamation of three older societies: the Unitarian Book Society for literature (1791), The Unitarian Fund for mission work (1806), and the Unitarian Association for civil rights (1818 or 1819). Its offices were shared with the Sunday School Association at Essex Street, on the site of England's first Unitarian church. In 1928 the BFUA became part of the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches, still the umbrella organisation for British Unitarianism, which has its headquarters, Essex Hall, in the same place in central London. Dates The British and Foreign Unitarian Association was founded on 26 May 1825, at a meeting chaired by Thomas Gibson, father of Thomas Field Gibson. This was the same day as the American Unitarian Association was formed. (The AUA is one of two bodies that merged in 1961 to form the Unitarian Universalist Association.) The History of Essex Hall, written in 1959 by Mortimer Rowe, the Secretary (i.e. chief executive) of the General Assembly for its first twenty years, claims this was entirely coincidental.\\"By a happy coincidence, in those days of slow posts, no transatlantic telegraph, telephone or wireless, our American cousins, in complete ignorance as to the details of what was afoot, though moving towards a similar goal, founded the American Unitarian Association on precisely the same day - May 26, 1825.\\" Publishing Under the impetus of Theophilus Lindsey, the first minister of the Essex Street Chapel, and his colleague John Disney, in 1791 the \\"first organized denominational Unitarian society\\" was formed, with the cumbersome name of The Unitarian Society for promoting Christian Knowledge and the Practice of Virtue by the Distribution of Books. The earliest notable publication was Thomas Belsham's The New Testament in an Improved Version Upon the Basis of Archbishop Newcome's New Translation (1808), which was continued by the British and Foreign Unitarian Association. At the end of 1826 the Association acquired the Monthly Repository magazine, formerly edited by Robert Aspland. The Association contracted the French historian Gaston Bonet-Maury to write a history of French radical Protestantism. In March 1876 Robert Spears resigned from the Association in objection to proposals to publish the works of Theodore Parker. Spears started the Christian Life as a rival magazine to the London Inquirer, becoming the voice of conservative late Biblical Unitarianism with Samuel Sharpe, till the two publications were merged in July 1929, and ran for a short time as The Inquirer and Christian Life. Another magazine, the Unitarian Herald, ran from 1861 to 1889. Mission work The Unitarian Fund \\"for the Promotion of Unitarianism by means of Popular Preaching\\" was founded in 1806, largely by laypeople. It gave money to congregations that needed it and employed Richard Wright as an itinerant missionary. Foreign Secretaries of the Association included Sir John Bowring, till 1832, then Edward Tagart. Civil rights It took about 150 years from the Great Ejection of 1662 to the passage of the Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813, which granted toleration for Unitarian worship; the so-called Act of Toleration 1689 had only worked to the favour of those Protestant dissenters who accepted the Trinity.Dudley Julius Medley, A Student's Manual of English Constitutional History.

The complex was known as Distrito C or Distrito de las Comunicaciones (\\"Communications District\\") until 2011. Design The project was designed by Rafael de La-Hoz. It was built in 36 months on 370,000 square metres in Las Tablas, a growing area between Madrid and Alcobendas. This project has been acknowledged several times, due to the management of its Madrid Metro station (Ronda de la Comunicaci√≥n on Line 10) and the different roads. The buildings cover 140,000 square meters and they were, at the time, the largest project in Europe in terms of glass, even more so than the ones of Ciudad Financiera del Banco Santander (Financial City of Banco Santander) and Madrid-Barajas Airport. This district consists of twelve office buildings: four ten-storey buildings at each end and eight four-storey buildings in between. This complex also includes a shopping centre, which is open to the public and there are several other buildings for additional services. The purpose of Distrito Telef√≥nica is to gather in one place all the company‚Äôs resources to ensure significant savings in the structure of its management. The investment was over 500 million euros and has been mostly financed with the sale or rental of several properties owned by Telef√≥nica in Madrid.

In the issue of Billboard dated January 1, Taylor Swift was at number one with Speak Now, the album's seventh week in the top spot. Swift's album held the peak position for the first seven weeks of 2011 before being displaced by Jason Aldean's My Kinda Party. The latter album was the year's longest-running chart-topper, spending 12 weeks atop the chart in five separate spells between February and July. It was displaced from the top spot for the first time in the issue dated March 5 by Need You Now by the group Lady Antebellum, which returned to number one having already spent 29 weeks at the top of the chart the previous year. The group was the only act to achieve more than one number one during 2011, as it returned to the top spot in October with Own the Night, which spent five non-consecutive weeks atop the chart before the end of the year and was the final chart-topper of 2011. Half of the eighteen acts to top the chart in 2011 did so for the first time.

In July Justin Moore gained his first number one, and in August and September four consecutive chart-toppers were by acts which had not previously reached the top spot: Eric Church, Luke Bryan, Pistol Annies (although one member of the group, Miranda Lambert, had previously achieved number ones as a solo artist), and Jake Owen. Bryan, along with Jason Aldean, was associated with the so-called bro-country style, an emerging sub-genre which incorporated influences from rock music and hip hop and often featured lyrics relating to partying, attractive young women, and pick-up trucks. The final artist to reach number one for the first time was Scotty McCreery, who had won the tenth season of the TV singing competition American Idol earlier in the year. His album Clear as Day entered the chart at number one in the issue of Billboard dated October 22, and spent six weeks at number one before the end of the year in three separate spells. Chart history Ronnie Dunn had his first solo number one after many years of success as half of the duo Brooks & Dunn. American Idol winner Scotty McCreery topped the chart in October. Jason Aldean's My Kinda Party was the year's longest-running number one. Outlaws Like Me was the first number one for Justin Moore. { class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" !scope=colIssue date !scope=colTitle !scope=colArtist(s) !scope=col class=unsortableRef. - !scope=row  rowspan=7 Speak Now  rowspan=7 align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=2My Kinda Party  rowspan=2 align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=2Need You Now  rowspan=2Lady Antebellum align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row  Town Line  align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=2Stronger  rowspan=2 align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=3My Kinda Party  rowspan=3 align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=2Paper Airplane  rowspan=2 align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=4My Kinda Party  rowspan=4 align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=2This Is Country Music  rowspan=2 align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row  Ronnie Dunn  align=center - !scope=row  My Kinda Party  align=center - !scope=row  Outlaws Like Me  align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=2My Kinda Party  rowspan=2 align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=2Red River Blue  rowspan=2 align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=2Chief  rowspan=2 align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=2Tailgates & Tanlines  rowspan=2 align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row  Hell on Heels  Pistol Annies align=center - !scope=row  Barefoot Blue Jean Night  align=center - !scope=row  Here for a Good Time  align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=3Own the Night  rowspan=3Lady Antebellum align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=3Clear as Day  rowspan=3 align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row  Clancy's Tavern  align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=2Four the Record  rowspan=2 align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row  rowspan=2Clear as Day  rowspan=2 align=center - !scope=row align=center - !scope=row  Own the Night  Lady Antebellum align=center - !scope=row  Clear as Day  align=center - !scope=row  Own the Night  Lady Antebellum align=center } References 2011 United States Country Albums ","title":"List of Top Country Albums number ones of 2011"},{"id":"30165064","text":"Grobelno () is a settlement in eastern Slovenia.

In 1861 the company acquired the Golden Horn, which they used on the North Atlantic routes to the United States. The company later expanded to service routes to New Zealand, Australia and the Pacific Islands. From 1875 to 1880 the company worked with John T.

The Baths were added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 14 November 2003 and are also classified by the National Trust of Australia. Wylie's Baths was built in 1907 by Henry Wylie, the father of Mina Wylie who, along with Fanny Durack, were Australia's first female Olympic swimming representatives, and Australia's first woman gold and silver medallists respectively. From 1959 to 1978, the baths were called Sunset Pool. Owned by the City of Randwick, Wylie's Baths is run by a management committee established in 1978 comprising representatives from South Maroubra Dolphins Winter Swimming Club, Randwick & Coogee Amateur Swimming Club, the Coogee-Randwick RSL Diggers Swimming Club, and the Coogee Surf Life Saving Club.  History  =Indigenous history= Aboriginal people are believed to have inhabited the Sydney region for at least 20,000 years.Turbet, 2001. The population of Aboriginal people between Palm Beach and Botany Bay in 1788 has been estimated to have been 1500. Those living south of Port Jackson to Botany Bay were the Cadigal people who spoke Dharug,Randwick Library webpage, 2003. while the local clan name of Maroubra people was \\"Muru-ora-dial\\".City of Sydney webpage, 2003. By the mid nineteenth century the traditional owners of this land had typically either moved inland in search of food and shelter, or had died as the result of European disease or confrontation with British colonisers. Few religious beliefs of the people were recorded, but oral traditions have ensured that some have been carried on. Thus it is thought that the Wylie's Baths location may have been a special place for women's business, possibly associated with birthing, although more research needs to be done to confirm this.MLALC, 2003 There is now a sizable community of Aboriginal people living in the Randwick municipality, many to the south of Coogee in La Perouse. =Colonial history= One of the earliest land grants in this area was made in 1824 to Captain Francis Marsh, who received bounded by the present Botany and High Streets, Alison and Belmore Roads. In 1839 William Newcombe acquired the land north-west of the present town hall in Avoca Street. Randwick takes its name from the town of Randwick, Gloucestershire, England. The name was suggested by Simeon Pearce (1821‚Äì86) and his brother James. Simeon was born in the English Randwick and the brothers were responsible for the early development of both Randwick and its neighbour, Coogee. Simeon had come to the colony in 1841as a 21 year old surveyor. He built his Blenheim House on the he bought from Marsh, and called his property \\"Randwick\\". The brothers bought and sold land profitably in the area and elsewhere. Simeon campaigned for construction of a road from the city to Coogee (achieved in 1853) and promoted the incorporation of the suburb. Pearce sought construction of a church modelled on the church of St. John in his birthplace. In 1857 the first St Jude's stood on the site of the present post office, at the corner of the present Alison Road and Avoca Street.Pollen & Healy, 1988. Randwick was slow to progress. The village was isolated from Sydney by swamps and sandhills, and although a horse-bus was operated by a man named Grice from the late 1850s, the journey was more a test of nerves than a pleasure jaunt. Wind blew sand over the track, and the bus sometimes became bogged, so that passengers had to get out and push it free. From its early days Randwick had a divided society. The wealthy lived elegantly in large houses built when Pearce promoted Randwick and Coogee as a fashionable area. But the market gardens, orchards and piggeries that continued alongside the large estates were the lot of the working class. Even on the later estates that became racing empires, many jockeys and stablehands lived in huts or even under canvas. An even poorer group were the immigrants who existed on the periphery of Randwick in a place called Irishtown, in the area now known as The Spot, around the junction of St.Paul's Street and Perouse Road. Here families lived in makeshift houses, taking on the most menial tasks in their struggle to survive. In 1858 when the NSW Government passed the Municipalities Act, enabling formation of municipal districts empowered to collect rates and borrow money to improve their suburb, Randwick was the first suburb to apply for the status of a municipality. It was approved in February 1859, and its first Council was elected in March 1859. Randwick had been the venue for sporting events, as well as duels and illegal sports, from the early days in the colony's history. Its first racecourse, the Sandy Racecourse or Old Sand Track, had been a hazardous track over hills and gullies since 1860. When a move was made in 1863 by John Tait, to establish Randwick Racecourse, Simeon Pearce was furious, especially when he heard that Tait also intended to move into Byron Lodge. Tait's venture prospered, however and he became the first person in Australia to organise racing as a commercial sport. The racecourse made a big difference to the progress of Randwick. The horse-bus gave way to trams that linked the suburb to Sydney and civilisation. Randwick soon became a prosperous and lively place, and it still retains a busy residential, professional and commercial life. Today, some of the houses have been replaced by home units. Many European migrants have made their homes in the area, along with students and workers at the nearby University of NSW and the Prince of Wales Hospital. A view of the baths showing the covered sunbathing area =Coogee= Following the opening of the tram line to Coogee Bay in 1883, Coogee became a popular seaside resort. Coogee became well known for its beach and seaside entertainments, similar to Manly and Bondi. The Coogee Aquarium opened in December 1887 and included a ballroom and indoor swimming pool. Other beach amusements included swings, donkey rides, bandstand and an outdoor slide and toboggan rink. Later amusements included the Coogee Pleasure Pier built in 1928 (demolished in 1933), the shark net installed in 1929 (removed in 1939) and floodlights for night surfing. The late nineteenth century also saw the development of swimming as a competitive sport, in contrast to \\"bathing\\" as a therapeutic activity. The first British amateur swimming association was formed in 1869, and the Balmain Swimming Club was formed in March 1884. In 1891 the NSW Amateur Swimming Association was formed by men's swimming clubs and in 1906 women swimmers formed their own association. Fred Cavill arrived in Sydney in 1879 and, with his sons, managed a number of harbourside pools (for example, Lavender Bay) and helped to popularise competitive and long-distance swimming. His son, Dick Cavill introduced the crawl from the Solomon Islands which revolutionised swimming and another son, Sydney Cavill developed the butterfly stroke. A number of Sydney ocean and harbourside pools date from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, prior to the main construction phase of ocean and harbour pools in the 1930s and 1940s. Examples includes the Dawn Fraser Pool (1882), Bondi Beach Pool (), the original Manly Cove Baths (c.1890), the original Brighton Baths (c.1900), Watson Bay Baths (c.1905) and Dee Why Rock Pool (). Many of these pools were built as Olympic-sized pools with raised seating to cater for competitive swimming events. North of Wylie's Baths are two more rock pools: the Ross Jones Memorial Baths (built 1947) and the McIver Women's Baths. These occupy the site of a women's bathing spot since before 1876. The Women's Baths were built in 1886 and since 1922 have been managed by the Randwick Coogee Ladies Amateur Swimming Club, formed by Rose McIver and Mina Wylie. At the northern end of Coogee Beach is another rock pool: Giles Baths, which was built in 1902 for men only. By 1909 it was known as the Randwick Municipal Baths. While now in disrepair, the pool is still in use. =Wylie's Baths, 1900s-1959= In the early 1900s Henry Alexander Wylie, a champion long-distance and under-water swimmer - and an amateur builder - obtained a lease for the area below the high water mark (the area above high water mark being Crown Reserve). In 1907 Wylie constructed the present ocean pool, which opened on 12 December 1907. It was originally fenced with a metal hand rail along the eastern edge. At some stage the original fence was replaced with a timber and metal rail which enclosed the pool on three sides. In 1912 Wylie constructed the high timber boardwalk that encloses two sides of the pool, and two change rooms. The deck was elevated by a post and beam construction in blackbutt timber. The posts were embedded into sockets cut into the sandstone cliff face and into the large rocks at the base of the cliff. Wylie also constructed a concrete diving tower on the eastern wall. There was a slippery dip into the pool on the north-western corner. At some stage a second diving tower was located on the southern end. Night bathing and picnicking became popular when Wylie erected three lamp posts along the northern edge and also strung lights across the pool. None of these structures remain today, although the concrete wall on the eastern edge is still thickened at the location of the demolished diving tower, and the concrete bases of the lamp posts can still be seen along the northern edge. At a later date Wylie extended the timber platform, considerably increasing the size of the change rooms at either end. Entrance to the baths was from either Grant Reserve or Neptune Street. A fee was collected at the caretaker's cottage (which no longer exists) and swimming costumes issued. There were clothes lockers and possibly a refreshment outlet. The path wound down to timber stairs, which led to the change rooms (men's change room to the right and women's to the left). Wylie's daughter was the well-known Olympic swimmer Wilhelmina (Mina) Wylie (1891-1984) who grew up in South Coogee. Mina Wiley and Sarah (Fanny) Durack (1889-1956) were Australia's first two female Olympic swimming representatives when they competed in the Stockholm Olympics in 1912 (the first Olympic Games to admit female swimmers). In the 100-metre freestyle race, Durack won the gold medal and Wylie the silver medal. Mina Wiley competed in NSW and Australian championships from 1906 to 1934, winning a total of 115 NSW and Australian titles. As Australia's first Olympic female swimmers, Durack and Wylie inaugurated a long tradition of Australian female swimming champions. Another well-known swimmer closely associated with Wylie's Baths is long-distance ocean swimmer, Des Renford (1927-1999). Renford swam the English Channel 19 times, was a Papal Knight and is featured in the NSW Hall of Champions at the State Sports Centre. He was a regular all-year-round swimmer at Wylie's where he was always conceded the best lane \\"on the wall\\" and was a member of the Wylie's Baths Trust and active in the management of the baths. Other swimmers of note associated with Wylie's Baths include Fanny Durack, Bob Parry and Paul Gately. =Sunstrip Pool, (1959-1974)= On 5 November 1959 the lease for Wiley's Baths was transferred to Desmond Selby, who paid an annual rent of $500. Selby renamed the baths \\"Sunset Pool\\" and proceeded to upgrade the facilities. Selby removed the existing change rooms and increased the width of the boardwalk. He rebuilt the change rooms on a much smaller scale to provide a larger deck area, catering to the then fashion for sunbathing. At this stage the majority of the balustrade was fully boarded leaving only seven central sections with horizontal timber rails. The northern end of the boardwalk past the women's change room led to an open sitting area which became a popular picnic spot with views over Coogee Beach. Selby used tram parts to construct the building and installed hot showers. Both change rooms had cement roofing and wooden panelling and were externally painted in a checkerboard design in cream and brown. He also added a kiosk and store on the boardwalk. =Closure and re- opening of the Baths (1974-1978)= The buildings and pool were badly damaged in May 1974 by high seas and the pool was closed to the public. Another storm in 1977 caused further damage. In 1978 the baths were re-opened under the control of Randwick Municipal Council and reverted to the original name of Wylie's Baths. A Committee of Management was formed in September 1978, composed of representatives from the Randwick Council and various swimming clubs including the South Maroubra Dolphins (formed 1960), Randwick/ Coogee Amateur Swimming Club (formed 1896), Randwick Digger's Swimming Club (formed 1936) and Coogee Surf Life Saving Club. =Restoration of the Baths 1995= In 1994 Randwick City Council resolved to repair the baths in response to public pressure. The successful tenderers were architects Allen Jack+Cottier, and restoration cost approximately $750,000. The work was completed early in 1995. In 1995 Allen, Jack & Cottier were awarded the NSW Greenway Award for Conservation by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects for their restoration of Wylie's Baths. The work included restoring the boardwalk and building new amenities blocks. The work was praised by the RAIA for its sensitivity in recovering the essence of the original baths. While the nature and style of the new work was clearly modern, it paid attention to the genius loci of the baths, adding a new layer to its history. In 1996 Wylie's Baths Trust was established to manage the baths. The Trust consists of representatives of the four local swimming clubs, three local residents and a representative of the Randwick City Council. =Photography at the Baths= In recent years Wylie's Baths has become popular subject for both amateur and professional photographers. The dramatic cliff-hugging location of the baths is one aspect of their photographic appeal, as is the nostalgic seaside appeal of the wooden structures.  Description  Wylie's Baths is located on the rocks at the southern end of Coogee Beach with an entrance off Neptune Street via Grant Reserve. The pool is a rock and concrete pool by located on a natural rock shelf below the high tide mark with concrete walls around four sides. It measures long and wide (to provide a Olympic swimming length) and the depth of the pool varies from about in the south-west corner to about in the north-east corner. It is flushed twice daily by tidal action. A high prominent timber boardwalk supported on timber posts wraps around the rock face on two sides of the pool and is clearly visible from Coogee Beach. Three sets of timber stairs lead down to the pool and rock shelf from the boardwalk. Amenities include men's and women's change rooms, kiosk and store. A steel fence runs around the northern and eastern sides of the pool, preventing access to the rocks. = Condition = As at 30 January 2003, following extensive restoration in 1995, the baths are in good condition. Wylie's Baths have been repaired and altered over time. These alterations have been necessary for maintenance especially given the harshness of the marine environment. These alterations have tended to preserve the original vernacular nature of the buildings and contributed to a sense of continuity in the built forms. The extensive restoration by Allen Jack+Cottier in 1995 was praised by the RAIA for its sensitivity in recovering of the original essence of the baths while upgrading and modernising the facilities. Following the 1995 restoration, Wylie's Baths are in good condition. = Modifications and dates = *1907 Wylie's Baths opened on 12 December. *1912 high timber boardwork and change rooms constructed. *1959 change rooms replaced and boardwork increased in width, the familiar chequerboard walling added. Kiosk and store added. *1974 baths closed due to storm damage. *1977 further storm damage. *1991 stainless steel railing replaced old timber and chain railing. *1995 restoration work by Allen Jack+Cottier and baths re-opened.  Heritage listing  As at 29 October 2004, Wylie's Baths is of State significance as one of NSW's oldest, most intact and best-known ocean swimming pools. It is also significant for the possibility that its location was special to Aboriginal women's business. Built in 1907, Wylie's Baths survives as a turn- of-the-century bathing complex, including an Olympic-size pool, elevated boardwalk, change rooms, kiosk and store, which evidences the development of sport and recreational facilities in Sydney. Wylie's Baths has been used for many competitive and recreational events, including amateur swimming clubs, fitness training, learn-to-swim classes as well as for general swimming, sunbathing and as a popular gathering place. Wylie's Baths has been held in great affection by generations of Sydneysiders. Wylie's Baths is closely associated with the development of competitive swimming in Australia and with many swimmers of note, including Henry Alexander Wylie, Mina Wylie and Sarah (Fanny) DurackOlympic champions, Stockholm 1912 and Des Renford (long-distance ocean swimmer). It is one of a group of significant Sydney harbour and ocean pools associated with Australian swimming champions. Because of its association with the inaugural championship swimming of Mina Wiley and Fanny Durack at the Stockholm Olympics of 1912, Wylie's Baths is especially associated with Australian women's swimming. Wylie's Baths is a well-known Sydney landmark, clearly visible from Coogee Beach and making use of its spectacular ocean setting. It is a popular subject with photographers and makes a large contribution to Coogee's identity as a seaside destination. The elevated timber boardwalk is architecturally striking and rare in Sydney. It is a good example of vernacular architecture and an ingenious design solution to the problem of providing amenities on a steep cliff face. Recent restoration of the baths by Allen Jack and Cottier in 1995 won the RAIA Greenway Medal for Conservation and was praised for its sensitivity in preserving the integrity of the original swimming pool complex. Wylie's Baths may have significance and special meaning for Aboriginal groups, both pre and post-contact. There may be special associations with Aboriginal women and birthing but further research is required. Wylie's Baths was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 14 November 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. It is thought that the location for Wylie's Baths may be, or may be near a place that was special to Aboriginal women's business, possibly associated with birthing, although more research needs to be done to confirm this. Wylie's Baths survives as one example of the numerous seaside attractions built at Coogee Beach around the turn of the twentieth century to attract visitors and day-trippers, with other attractions including an aquarium, pier, shark net, floodlighting etc. The construction of Wylie's Baths in 1907 coincided with an emerging interest in seaside baths in Sydney. Wylie's Baths forms a group with the three other ocean pools at Coogee Beach which date from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries: McIver Women's Baths (built 1886); Giles, former men's only (built 1902); and the Ross Jones Memorial Pool (built 1947). It is claimed in the National Trust survey of ocean and harbour pools that Wylie's Baths is the oldest surviving communal sea baths in Australia. Wylie's Baths is also historically significant in the development of amateur swimming clubs in Sydney and the development of competitive swimming in Australia. It forms a group with a number of other early Olympic-sized harbour and ocean swimming pools in Sydney built between the 1880s and the First World War to cater to the popularity of competitive swimming. This group of early pools predate the main construction phase of ocean pools in the 1930s and 1940s. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Wylie's Baths is strongly associated with the Wylie family who were important in the development of competitive swimming in Australia. Wylie's Baths was built by Henry Alexander Wylie who was a champion long-distance and underwater swimmer. He managed the baths from 1907 until 1959. Wylie's Baths is closely associated with many swimmers of note including female Olympic champions, Mina Wylie and Sarah (Fanny) Durack, and long-distance swimmer, Des Renford. Wilhelmina (Mina) Wylie (1891-1984) was the daughter of Henry Alexander Wylie and an early female swimming champion. Together with Sarah (Fanny) Durack (1889-1956), Mina Wylie represented Australia at the 1912 Stockholm Olympics (the first Olympic Games to admit female swimmers). Durack won the gold medal and Wylie the silver for the 100 metres freestyle. In an extraordinary swimming career which spanned from 1906 to 1934 Mina Wylie won every NSW and Australian swimming title (a total of 115), making her and Fanny Durack the first in a long line of Australian female swimming champions. Mina Wylie was also important in promoting women's swimming. She, with Rose McIver, formed the Randwick Coogee Ladies Amateur Swimming Club which has managed the Women's Baths just north of Wylie's since 1922. Wylie's Baths is also strongly associated with long-distance ocean swimming champion, Des Renford (1927-1999) was swam the English Channel 19 times, was awarded an MBE, and was a regular swimmer at Wylie's and active in the management of the Wylie's Baths Trust. Wylie's Baths is one of a group of harbour and ocean swimming pools which have strong associations with an Australian swimming champion. Others include the Andrew (Boy) Charlton Pool in the Domain and the Dawn Fraser Swimming Pool in Balmain and the McIver Women's Baths in Coogee, the Lavender Bay Baths, now demolished (associated with the Cavill family). Wylie's Baths is also associated with the architects, Allen Jack and Cottier, whose conservation work was awarded the 1995 Greenway Award for Conservation by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Wylie's Baths, located on the rocks at the southern end of Coogee Beach, makes use of a dramatic ocean setting. The raised timber boardwalk is architecturally striking and wraps around the rock face on two sides. It offers uninterrupted views across the water and rocks to Coogee Beach. The baths are a popular swimming and picnic spot. The baths and the raised boardwalk are also very prominent and clearly visible from Coogee Beach. The baths have become a well-known Sydney landmark and closely identified with Coogee Beach as a holiday seaside destination. The baths, despite recent extensive conservation, survive as possibly the last intact example of a turn-of-the-century ocean swimming complex, complete with timber boardwalk, change rooms, kiosk and store. The raised boardwalk, in particular, is rare among Sydney ocean and harbour pools for its size and construction. It offers an ingenious design solution to the problem of providing amenities on a steep cliff face site and represents a good example of vernacular architecture. Wylie's Baths has also become a popular subject for amateur and professional photographers. Photographic studies typically feature the dramatic ocean setting, the stark architectural qualities of the wooden structures, and the nostalgic seaside appeal of the setting. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Wylie's Baths has social significance for the generations of Sydneysiders who have visited the baths since they opened in 1907. The baths are held in great affection for their associations with seaside holiday memories and recreational swimming. The baths have been used for many competitive and recreational events, including amateur swimming clubs, fitness training, learn-to-swim classes as well as for general swimming, sunbathing and as a popular gathering place. Wylie's Baths is also significant to a number of local Coogee amateur swimming clubs: South Maroubra Dolphins (formed 1960), Randwick / Coogee Amateur Swimming Club (formed 1896), Randwick Digger's Swimming Club (formed 1936) and Coogee Surf Life Saving Club. These clubs have had a long involvement with the site and were instrumental in re-opening Wylie's Baths after the storm damage in the 1970s. Wylie's Baths is highly significant to the Coogee community as a local landmark and as contributing to the sense of place and identity of Coogee of a seaside resort. The high esteem in which it is held is demonstrated by the community agitation for its conservation and re-opening following the damage by storms in the 1970s. The local community continues to be involved in the ongoing management of the baths via the Wylie's Baths Trust, which consists of representatives from local swimming clubs, the general public and Randwick Council. Wylie's Baths is also held in high regard by the wider Sydney Community as a landmark and for its historical significance as an ocean pool. This esteem is demonstrated by the numerous heritage listings for the baths (Randwick City Council LEP, National Trust of Australia (NSW), Australian Heritage Commission - interim). The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Due to the harshness of the marine environment and the European occupation of the site since the 1900s, Wylie's Baths is unlikely to yield any archaeological evidence of former Aboriginal occupation or European occupation in the nineteenth century. Nor is the site likely to yield further scientific information in relation to the natural environment. The pool and the unusual timber boardwalk, despite various modifications over time, have potential to yield further information on turn-of-the-century vernacular construction techniques and as such are of technical and research significance. The baths may have significance and special meaning for Aboriginal groups, both pre and post-contact. Further research is required to investigate this possibility. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Wylie's Baths can be considered rare among Sydney's ocean and harbour pools in surviving as a complete turn-of-the-century swimming complex that includes an Olympic-sized pool, boardwalk, men's and women's change rooms, kiosk and store. The sensitivity of the recent conservation works, completed in 1995, has respected and preserved the integrity of the original swimming complex. The size and height of the timber boardwalk at Wylie's Baths is possibly unique amongst Sydney ocean and harbour pools. The boardwalk is a well-known Sydney landmark and survives where other once-common timber boardwalks have not. As such, it is rare. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Wylie's Baths is a good representative example of an ocean swimming pool built around Sydney's ocean beaches and harbour foreshores in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In being built of rock and concrete, the pool shares construction features with a number of other Sydney pools, including Bondi, Fairlight and Narrabeen Pools. These pools largely rely on tidal flushing to clean the water and pre-date the use of chlorination. Wylie's Baths also has a timber boardwalk in common with a number of pools, including the Dawn Fraser Pool in Balmain, Northbridge Baths and Redleaf Pool in Double Bay. Because of the need for ongoing repair and maintenance of these timber structures, some others have not survived.

Work Joost Cornelisz Droochsloot was a versatile painter who was known for his village scenes, landscapes, genre pictures, moral allegories and biblical stories. His early works reflects the influence of Pieter Brueghel the Elder, Pieter Brueghel the Younger, David Vinckboons and Esaias van de Velde. He stood in the tradition of Flemish landscape painting, particular of the village scenes as developed by Pieter Brueghel the Elder. His village scenes usually depict a broad village street leading into the distance and houses on both sides. The villages are populated with crowds of coarse peasant figures, dispersed somewhat at random. These figures are individualised and depicted in expressive poses. Droochsloot paid a lot of attention to the details in his compositions. His village scenes often carried a moral message. He had a preference for a reddish-brown palette. The early Dutch artist biographer Arnold Houbraken recounts that Droochsloot's scenes of village kermisses (Boerekermisstuk) were as popular as flower pieces by Bartholomeus Assteyn.

El Consejo de los Dioses was written by Rizal when he was only nineteen years old, and reveals the humanistic education of the Philippines at the time and his answer to scholasticism. Summary The play exposes how an Asian teenager look unto the cultural elements of the Western humanistic tradition, overcoming not only its formalism, but at the same time laying the foundations for an effort toward self-knowledge. Depicting Olympian deities discussing Western literary standards, it becomes a reference text of literary criticism in the Philippines. Rizal further explores the true meaning of human desire for knowledge and designs the guidelines for a Filipino speculative thought.CCP Encyclopedia of Philippine Art, Vol 7., Cultural Center of the Philippines, 2015. Awards The play won the first prize award in an 1880-1881 literary contest commemorating the death of Cervantes sponsored by the Liceo Artistico Literario de Manila. ‚ÄúCon el recuerdo del pasado entro en el porvenir‚Äù (‚ÄúI enter the future remembering the past‚Äù), was Rizal's epigraph for the award.

Association team allocation  A total of 39 teams from 39 CAF associations qualified for the tournament after winning their respective premier domestic cups. Of the 39 teams that qualified for the tournament 4 would not participate in it while 1 withdrew and was replaced by another club from its association; * Teams from the Central African Republic were all disqualified from CAF's competitions because their federation was in debt to CAF. This meant TP USCA Bangui, who were slated to participate in the Preliminary Round, were not allowed to fulfill their fixtures. * Congolese club AS Vita Club, who were also due to appear in the Preliminary Round, withdrew before the tournament started. * The Senegalese Football Federation withdrew its representative before the tournament began. The name of the club that was to represent Senegal was never given * Gambian club Hawks, who were set to appear in the First Round, withdrew before their first leg tie with U.S.M. Alger. * Kaizer Chiefs were originally set to represent South Africa but they withdrew before the tournament started. Their place was taken by the team they defeated in the cup final that qualified them for the tournament, Mamelodi Sundowns.  Format  The tournament consisted of five rounds preceding a two-legged final. * Preliminary round - The 14 lowest ranked teams - whose rankings were determined by their association's performances at previous CAF club tournaments - were drawn against each other in 7 matches consisting of two-legs each. * First round - The 7 winners from the preliminary round were then drawn against the remaining 25 clubs, resulting in 16 matches consisting of two-legs each. * Second round - The 16 winners from the first round were then drawn against each other, resulting in 8 matches consisting of two-legs each. * Quarter-finals - The 8 winners from the second round were then drawn against each other, resulting in 4 matches consisting of two-legs each. * Semi-finals - The 4 victorious quarter- finalists were then drawn against each other in 2 semi-finals consisting of two-legs each. * Final - The victorious semi-finalists contested a two-legged final to determine the champion. The away goals rule was used to determine the victors in the event of a match being tied over the two-legs. If it was not possible to determine a winner using the away goals rule, the tie went to a penalty shootout to determine the winner. Preliminary round The first legs were played from 30 January-2 February, and the second legs were played from 13‚Äì15 February 1998. = Matches = } Notes: : Due to the Central African Republic's football federation's debt with CAF, all of their clubs were disqualified from CAF's competitions resulting in TP USCA Bangui being removed from the Preliminary Round of fixtures.

Although in 1977, when the communist regime favoured technical education and the school was transformed into The Industrial High School No.2, the theoretical education never stopped in Mangalia as there were classes with this profile functioning in the new high school. In 1990, there was the opportunity for The Industrial High School No.2 to get back its name and structure but the Teachers‚Äô Council decided to transform it into an economical school due to the touristic potential of the town. The same year at the proposition of the School General Inspector, Gheorghe Andrei and the Minister of National Education at that time, the Government approved the reopening of the Theoretical High School. The High school functioned for eight years in a dormitory of the Ion Banescu Industrial High School and in 1998 a new building became the headquarters at 36, Rozelor Street. At the same time the school changed its name into Callatis Theoretical High School, and the inauguration took place in the presence of PhD.

The Mausoleum of Helena is an ancient building in Rome, Italy, located on the Via Casilina, corresponding to the 3rd mile of the ancient Via Labicana. It was built by the Roman emperor Constantine I between 326 and 330, originally as a tomb for himself, but later assigned to his mother, Helena, who died in 330. History The area where the mausoleum is located is part of a late-Roman complex of building known as Ad Duas Lauros,Ad Duas Lauros website which, according to ancient sources,Liber Pontificalis, 314 AD extended from the Porta Maggiore until the third mile of the ancient Via Labicana. They include the Catacombs of Marcellinus and Peter and the Palaeo-Christian basilica with the same name; of the latter, little remains today, as it was used as the base for the modern church of Santi Marcellino e Pietro ad Duas Lauros. Access to the mausoleum and the catacombs is to the left of the church. Before the construction of the mausoleum, the area was used as a cemetery of the Equites singulares. This has been attested by numerous inscriptions mentioning the Equites at ad Duas Lauros, although the exact location of the necropolis has not been discovered. It has been supposed that the necropolis was deliberately destroyed by Constantine as a revenge against the Equites who, in the battle of Ponte Milvio, sided with Maxentius against him. After the death of Helena, Ad Duas Lauros was assigned to the Roman popes. The mausoleum was damaged by the use of its materials for other constructions. In the 8th century it became a defensive fortress. However, it continued to house Helena's tomb until the 11th century, when the sarcophagus was brought to the Lateran (currently it is in the Vatican Museum). Sarcophagus of Helena.

The original height was , while today it has reduced to some . Internally, the lower cylinder has an octagonal shape. At the vertexes are niches, alternatively rectangular and semicircular; one of them housed the entrance. In correspondence with the niche, in the upper ring, were eight arcaded windows. In order to obtain a lighter dome, it included fragments of amphorae (such as in the Temple of Romulus or the Mausoleum of Villa Gordiani), which are now visible after the vault has collapsed. This led to the medieval name of the mausoleum, Torpignattara (Torre delle pignatte, meaning \\"Tower of the Vases\\"), today also used for the quarter which has grown around. The rectangular niche facing the entrance most likely contained the sarcophagus of Helena, in red porphyry. The external walls of the sarcophagus are decorated with war scenes, as it was probably originally to be used for Helena's son, the emperor Constantine.

The primary purpose of the program is the rehabilitation of the offender and secondarily the prompt disposition of charges, eliminating the need for costly and time-consuming trials or other court proceedings. Accordingly, Defendants are generally required to waive certain constitutional rights in exchange for consideration of their case for ARD. The aim of the program is to intervene at an early state, so that steps can be taken to prevent future incidents of a similar nature. Candidates admitted into the program are closely screened by the district attorney‚Äôs office. To be accepted into an ARD program the defendant has to agree to certain conditions such as making restitution or completing substance abuse treatment. While in an ARD program, defendants are placed under supervision, similar to probation. They may also be ordered to do community service. The defendant doesn't have to admit to any wrongdoing when applying for ARD, but must plead guilty to any summary offenses, usually violations of the motor vehicle code. The court may impose costs and assessments, but not a fine. Roughly 90% of the people in the ARD program have been arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance. The maximum period of supervision for someone on ARD is two years. After successfully completing the program, the ARD offender may petition the court to have the charges dismissed and the case expunged. If the offender does not comply with the conditions of the program, he or she may be removed from the program and the case will be placed back on the trial list.

Dmitri Bantysh-Kamensky (5 (16) November 1788, Moscow - January 25 (February 6) 1850, Saint Petersburg) was a Russian statesman and historian who studied under pioneering 18th century historian G. F. M√ºller He served as Governor of Tobolsk Province between March 1825 and 20 July 1828 and then later became Governor of the Vilna Province between May 1836 and 1838. Dmitri Bantysh-Kamensky is considered the first true historian of the Cossacks. Biography Dmitri Bantysh-Kamensky was the son of noted archivist and historian Nikolai Nikolaevich Bantysh-Kamensky. Bantysh-Kamensky who was educated at home, became a cadet in 1800 the Cadet Corps and gained a place in the Moscow archive of the Foreign College whose director was his father. Being sent to Serbia, Bantysh-Kamensky had the opportunity to survey Ukraine and the countries lying along the way, which he described in his \\"Journey to Moldavia, Wallachia and Serbia\\" (M., 1810 ). In 1812, Bantysh- Kamensky accompanied his father to Nizhny Novgorod, where the archive was temporarily removed. Upon his return to Moscow, Bantysh-Kamensky attended lectures at the Moscow University. Soon after the death of his father in 1814, he went to the service in St. Petersburg for the College of Foreign Affairs. The excellent knowledge of languages opened up for him a wide field of diplomatic activity, but he did not take advantage of this, but first he became an official of special assignments, and then the ruler of the chancellery to Prince H. G. Repnin, appointed in 1816 by the military governor of Ukraine. A five-year stay here gave him the opportunity to once again indulge in his favorite archival pursuits, the fruit of which is his \\"History of Ukraine from joining it to the Russian state until the hetman's abolition, with a general introduction, the application of materials and portraits\\" (4 volumes, 1822 ; Tomas, Moscow, 1830 ; 3rd edition, 1842 ) The work undertaken on behalf of Prince Repnin, who even took an active part in the compilation of the first volume. Sources for the author were his father's handwritten work on the same subject, numerous documents of the Moscow archive, materials from the archive of the Little Russian Collegium (with the provincial government in Chernihiv), the archives of Prince Repnin and many local materials. This work, not devoid of shortcomings, for a long time remained the only whole history of Ukraine. In March 1825, Bantysh-Kamensky was appointed governor of Tobolsk. In this position, he cared much about the improvement of the city, the improvement of the life of exiles and local aliens, contributed to the abolition of dowry among the Mansi people. Despite, however, for such a useful activity, Bantysh-Kamensky in 1828 became a victim of a senatorial audit, for which the investigation and trial in the Court of St. Petersburg was prolonged, until 1834. With regard to these persecutions, he compiled a detailed note entitled \\"Shemyakin Court in the Nineteenth Century\\"; Part of it was printed in the Russian antiquity of 1873. Taking advantage of his involuntary leisure, Bantysh-Kamensky again gave himself to his favorite literary pursuits. By this time belongs his \\" Dictionary of the memorable people of the Russian land \\" (5 volumes, Moscow, 1836, additions in 3 volumes, St. Petersburg, 1847 ), based on a variety of archival sources, family documents and oral reports. In May 1836, Bantysh-Kamensky was appointed governor of the Vilna province. Here he drew attention to the improvement of charitable institutions and hospitals, the organization of cities, but in 1838 was recalled and assigned to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Then he was a member of the council of this ministry ( 1839 ) and a member of the department of destinies ( 1810 ), and in 1841 was granted secret councilors. During the last period of his life, Bantysh-Kamensky owned his \\"Biographies of Russian Generalissimo and General-Field Marshals\\" (4 parts, St. Petersburg, 1840 - 1841 ), for the publication of which Emperor Nicholas I granted 2000 rubles. Tombstone of Dmitri Bantysh-Kamensky in the Donskoy Monastery Bantysh-Kamensky died in Petersburg on January 26, 1850, and was buried in Moscow, within the Donskoy Monastery. He was married three times and left a significant family, but neither service nor literary works enriched him, so that to repay his debts the emperor Nikolai Pavlovich granted his estate 10,000 rubles.

Opened in 1873, it forms part of the Rome‚ÄìSulmona‚ÄìPescara railway. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Train services to and from the station are operated by Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. Location Chieti railway station is situated in Piazza Guglielmo Marconi in the Chieti Scalo district, about 4‚Äì5 km west of the city centre. History The station was opened on 1 March 1873, upon the inauguration of the Pescara‚ÄìPopoli section of the Rome‚ÄìSulmona‚ÄìPescara railway. Features View of the main platform The passenger building consists of three sections, each with two levels. The entire passenger building is made of brick, and the upper level is painted white. At ground floor level, all three sections have three arches. Upstairs, there are three single-light windows accompanied by a cornice. The walls of the central section extend somewhat higher than those of the two lateral sections. Adjacent to the passenger building is a single-storey brick building, built at a later date than the main building. It houses the station bar. The station yard consists of three passenger tracks: the first is the main track, and the other two are used for overtaking, or for trains terminating in Chieti. Each of these tracks has a platform, and the platforms are connected by an underpass. There are other tracks used for the storage of goods trains. In 2010, thanks to a joint investment of RFI and Centostazioni amounting to ‚Ç¨400,000, the station underwent a restructuring process involving the following: cleaning and finishing of the front of the passenger building, replacement of fixtures, compliance of the structures with legal standards, removal of architectural barriers and the resurfacing of the roof. Train services The station is served by the following service(s):Abruzzo region train timetables *Regional services (Treno regionale) Pescara- Chieti - Sulmona - Avezzano - Tivoli - Rome *Regional services (Treno regionale) Teramo - Giulianova - Pescara - Chieti - Sulmona - Avezzano Interchange Left the passenger building are taxis and a parking lot.

Before being secretary of Melbourne, Manzie held the same role at Richmond Football Club for five years. Early life Born on 30 November 1863, Manzie grew up in Richmond and was educated at Central State School. Richmond Football Club Taking over from George Beachcroft, Manzie became secretary of Richmond in 1907, a year before the Tigers were elevated from the Victorian Football Association (VFA) to the Victorian Football League (VFL). In 1909, Manzie was made a life member of Richmond, at the time only the 15th person to be awarded with the honour. Despite this, at Richmond's annual general meeting in 1911, a \\"reform group\\" attempted to remove him from the role of secretary. An \\"overwhelming majority\\" defeated the motion, but Manzie was still disappointed by the behaviour of many at the meeting and he left Richmond at the end of the season. After it became known that Manzie had decided to leave Richmond, a petition was circulated among Richmond supporters, in an attempt to keep him at Richmond and stay on as secretary, but Manzie did not return. Melbourne Football Club Manzie joined fellow VFL club Melbourne for the 1912 season, taking over from G. W. Lamb, the same year that William C. McClelland became president of the club. McClelland and Manzie set about rebuilding the Melbourne side, which had been performing poorly over the previous few seasons, a task that was made more difficult when Melbourne was forced to withdraw from the VFL from 1916 to 1918 due to World War I. Many Melbourne players died in the war and Manzie was once again forced to rebuild. Although Melbourne did not play finals again until 1925, Manzie's work paid off when Melbourne their second VFL premiership in 1926. He retired from his role as secretary in 1931, after 20 years in the job, having for many years been known by his nickname \\"the Old Sec\\". He was succeeded by Charlie Streeter. For his contributions to the club, Manzie was made a life member. He remained a passionate supporter of the Demons until his death. Victorian Football League In 1915, Manzie was the honorary secretary of the VFL and was also on numerous VFL committees, often presiding when the VFL president was absent. Manzie was made a life member of the VFL for his services to the Australian National Football Council (ANFC). Personal life Manzie was described as \\"a commanding personality, a finely-built handsome six footer, a wonderful organiser; a brilliant after-dinner speaker and a man of outstanding character and integrity\\". His wife, Monica (n√©e Bellew), was known as the \\"mother of the Richmond Football Club\\" and even after Manzie moved to Melbourne, her passion for the Tigers never wavered. The couple lived on Punt Road near the home grounds of both Melbourne and Richmond. Monica had \\"family connections with show business\\" and they entertained many famous guests in their house. Manzie died on 9 September 1943, at his home in Burnley. He was survived by his wife, Monica, who died on 27 December 1951, and their three children; F. Keith Manzie, film critic for The Argus newspaper; Rupert Andrew Manzie, a manager of the London Assurance Company; and Elsie Ann Cranswick, who also lived in Burnley.

Background Bending strings during an electric guitar solo can change a string's tension, causing it to go out of tune. Stringed instruments, particularly guitars, have a tendency to get out of tune during playing, especially if strings are bent. In the late 1980s,Citation Needed Gibson developed a system called the Gibson Robot Guitar which used an onboard computer, motors, and a battery to keep the instrument in tune, but the system was complex and did not gain much marketplace acceptance, according to one report. Guitarist and engineering student Cosmos Lyles came up with a device to keep his guitar in tune, and with the help of engineer Paul Dowd produced a prototype of the EverTune bridge, which uses a spring and lever system that maintains string tension. The invention The EverTune mechanism keeps a string's tension constant by using a spring and lever system. The EverTune bridge keeps a guitar in tune despite changes in tension. The mechanical device maintains a constant state of tension despite changes in temperature or humidity or the exertion of pressure on the string. On a guitar, the bridge has six springs and levers, one for each of a guitar's six strings, such that \\"when a string stretches or slips, the springs apply the opposing force necessary to compensate for the shift, thus maintaining the correct tension and tuning.\\" In theory, the device can work with any stringed instrument, according to the inventors. The mechanism has been patented. A guitar with one installed is no longer tuned by turning the pegs at the end of the guitar's neck but rather with a screw on the bridge. Marketing The chief executive officer is Mark Chayet who had previously founded a manufacturing firm named Evermark which made CDs and DVDs. Chayet provided some of the initial financing for the firm, and other executives and entrepreneurs include David Weiderman, William Quigley, and Brock Pierce. The firm raised $800,000 in cash in May 2010, according to one report. One of the first guitars to have an EverTune bridge fitted in the factory is the VGS Radioactive TD-Special. A Tommy Denander signature guitar was created by the German luthiers of VGS. The EverTune bridge has hit the market in North America in October 2010 but the first series is by installation only. The unit was displayed at the Consumer Electronics Show in 2010. The product was highlighted in a feature in The New York Times entitled The Year in Ideas. In August 2011, the product was not yet ready for sale. One report suggested that EverTune will be available on a \\"wide range of electric guitars\\" in the near future and will be available as an installation kit. One report suggested there were 35 guitars with Evertune installed or about to be retrofitted with them. There are talks with guitar makers of electric guitars and basses to have the device embedded into new models and it is featured on the Ola Englund signature series of Washburn Guitars.

This type of project is often linked to higher sustainability benefits, but are too small to pay back the transaction cost involved in the CDM process. It was expected to allow African countries a higher participation in the CDM in particular. Historical background The PoA idea originated from a decision made at the December 2005 Conference of the Parties/Meeting of the Parties in Bonn, Germany where it was decided that local/regional and national policies or standards cannot be considered as CDM project activities, but project activities under a PoA can be registered as a single CDM project activity. By its thirty-sixth meeting (November 2007), the CDM Executive Board approved the official templates for Project Design Documents suitable for Programme of Activities (titled PoA-DD), its constituent activities (CPA-DD), and issued procedures to register PoAs and issue CERs.Meeting Report of the 36th Meeting of the UNFCCC - CDM Executive Board http://cdm.unfccc.int/EB/archives/meetings_07.html#036 It also amended small- scale CDM methodologies to make them suitable for programmatic activities. By its forty-seventh meeting (May 2009),Meeting Report of the 47th Meeting of the UNFCCC - CDM Executive Board http://cdm.unfccc.int/EB/archives/meetings_09.html#047 an improved version of PoAs guidance was published. The new guidance, along with a grace period that allowed retroactive PoAs to be submitted before 31 December 2009, had allowed more submission of PoAs to the EB, which rose to around 40 by the end of 2009. As of November 2010, after the 57th meeting of the CDM Executive Board, a total of 54 PoAs were under validation and 5 were registered. Current structure The classical structure of CDM uses a project-by-project process for registering and verifying projects. This approach involves very high transaction costs, a long time to market, and a high risk of non-registration. It is also very difficult to implement such a process in least developed countries and small island states where average project sizes and the scale of national markets tend to be smaller, so relative transaction costs are higher. In order to reduce transaction costs in CDM and expand the mechanism‚Äôs applicability to micro project activities, the CDM Executive Board launched the Programme of Activities modality. Under this modality, a PoA Coordinating/Managing Entity (CME), which can be (for examples) a government agency, NGO or business, develops a PoA which defines broad parameters for project activities (referred to as CDM Programme Activities or CPAs) that are eligible for inclusion in the PoA. Whereas stand-alone CDM projects must be approved individually by the CDM Executive Board, a PoA needs to be registered only once by the CDM Executive Board. After that, it can include an unlimited and unspecified number of individual CPAs without recourse to the CDM Executive Board.PoA - Developing CDM Programmes of Activities: A Guidebook by South Pole Carbon Asset Management, https://www.southpolecarbon.com/_downloads/PoA_Guidebook_SouthPole.pdf Examples Projects that distribute compact fluorescent lamps, efficient cook-stoves, Building refurbishment or solar water heaters, are some examples where PoAs, as defined by CDM, can be used. The modality is also applicable for larger scale activities such as small hydro power plants or composting.UNFCCC Registry, list of validated PoAs http://cdm.unfccc.int/ProgrammeOfActivities/Validation/index.htmlUNFCCC Registry, list of registered PoAs http://cdm.unfccc.int/ProgrammeOfActivities/registered.html German Development Bank (KfW) Blue Book on PoAs http://www.kfw.de/kfw/en/KfW_Group/Sustainability_and_Climate_Protection/PDF/PoA_BlueprintBook_Nov2010.pdf Advantages, criticism Projects conducted using PoA offer several advantages over alternative prevailing project-based approaches: *Individual CPAs have a drastically shorter time to market for project operators who wish to secure CER revenues since the inclusion of CPAs in a registered PoA no longer require approval from the CDM Executive Board in Bonn. *Adding CPAs leads to substantially lower transaction costs that stand-alone CDM projects because the registration and verification processes for CPAs are streamlined. *Full scalability: In contrast to a standard CDM project, a PoA does not need to define beforehand the scale and location of each project activity. *Opportunities to convert future carbon revenues into upfront carbon finance by reducing the risk of nonregistration and shortening the lag before CDM income is realized. This point is particularly important, as this can improve the factual additionality of CDM projects, by making carbon-related revenues tangible at the point of financial closure. Projects utilizing PoA may also have several disadvantages over projects utilizing the prevailing, project- based approaches: *Higher transaction cost for the initial registration of the PoA and first CPA *Longer time to initial registration for the initial PoA and first CPA *Unsolved Designated Operational Entity (DOE) Liability issue on CPA levelPoA - Developing CDM Programmes of Activities: A Guidebook by South Pole Carbon Asset Management, https://www.southpolecarbon.com/_downloads/PoA_Guidebook_SouthPole.pdf =DOE liability= In a PoA, the DOE is given the ability to decide whether or not to include a CPA within the PoA. This responsibility transfer from the CDM Executive Board to the DOE has not been conceded without any guarantees taken by the Executive Board. To avoid wrong inclusion of CPAs within the PoA, the Board has prepared a set of rules Annex 37 of the 55th Meeting of the UNFCCC - CDM Executive Board http://cdm.unfccc.int/EB/archives/meetings_10.html#055 that allows the DNA (Designated National Authority) or the Executive Board itself to challenge the decisions from the DOE. Other characteristics are: *The process of erroneous inclusion can be launched if there is a suspicion that a CPA does not meet the eligibility criteria. *A single EB member or the DNA can request the initiation of a process for erroneous inclusion. *The process for review of erroneous inclusion of a CPA can be initiated throughout the entire lifetime of a CPA *If the EB determines that a CPA has been erroneously included then all issued CERs from this erroneous CPA must be transferred by the DOE. *The process of erroneous inclusion can be extended to other CPAs The DOE liability as currently framed is considered inoperable for the following reasons: *A CPA can be put under review at any time, even many years after its inclusion into the PoA. *It is also not clear what constitutes an erroneous inclusion. It can be anything, from wrong coordinates to severe DOE misconduct or fraudulent information. *Under current rules a DOE could be liable for returning many years of issued CERs that would have to be obtained at a market price that could be vastly higher than current prices. Many PoAs that are currently in validation have been launched in anticipation that the issue of DOE liability would be resolved, as also requested by CMP5. If the corresponding rules are not reformed then many of these PoAs will not be viable since DOEs will either be unable to include CPAs or the DOE fees charged will be too high. As a consequence, DOE liability has not contributed to make PoAs popular among DOEs. Many DOEs are unwilling to validate PoAs and reluctant to include new CPAs. To date, only one PoA has managed to perform CPA inclusion (PoA 2767).PoA - Developing CDM Programmes of Activities: A Guidebook by South Pole Carbon Asset Management, https://www.southpolecarbon.com/_downloads/PoA_Guidebook_SouthPole.pdf PoA pipeline Out of 59 PoAs, 9 are located in Africa (15%), 1 in the Middle-East (2%), 38 in Asia (64%) and 9 in Latin America (19%).

Ltd., was a general in the Royal Burmese Army of Konbaung Dynasty of Burma (Myanmar). The general is best known for conquering the Ayutthaya Kingdom, along with Gen. Maha Nawrahta, in April 1767. Career The general began his military career as one of the sixty eight elite commanders, chosen by King Alaungpaya in 1752. He became one of the \\"most distinguished soldiers\\" during Alaungpaya's reunification campaigns (1752‚Äì1757). =Laos and Siam (1765‚Äì1767)= In 1764, King Hsinbyushin decided to renew the war against Siam. The king selected Thihapate and Maha Nawrahta as joint commanders to lead another invasion. Thihapate was to lead the northern invasion route from Chiang Mai while Maha Nawrahta was to lead the southern route from Martaban (Mottama). In early 1765, Thihapate with a 20,000-strong force began his operations by starting with the Lao states. The Kingdom of Vientiane agreed to become Burmese vassal without a fight. Luang Prabang resisted but Thihapate's forces easily captured the city in March 1765, giving the Burmese complete control of Siam's entire northern border. Thihapate then invaded Siam via the Chao Phraya valley, down towards Ayutthaya. His forces reached the outskirts of Ayutthaya on 20 January 1766, joining up with Maha Nawrahta's forces. The Burmese then began what turned out to be a 14-month siege. Around March 1767, Maha Nawrahta died of illness, and Ne Myo Thihapate became the commander-of- chief of the entire operations. His forces breached the city's defenses on 7 April 1767, and sacked the entire city. The Burmese gains did not last long as Hsinbyushin ordered most of the Burmese troops in late 1767 to return in the face of the Chinese invasion that threatened Ava. The Siamese resistance retook their lost territories in 1768 and 1769. =Command at Chiang Mai (1773)= In early 1773, Ne Myo Thihapate was posted with a sizable army at Chiang Mai. King Hsinbyushin had wanted to renew the war with Siam but he was hamstrung by the Chinese threat up north. (The Sino-Burmese war had ended with an uneasy truce in December 1769. The Chinese kept a heavy military lineup at the border in an attempt to wage another war.) While at Chiang Mai, Thihapate became embroiled in the local politics. The new Burmese governor of Lan Na, Thado Mindin mistreated many local chiefs. Ne Myo Thihapate actually sided with the chiefs.Phayare, p. 205 Hsinbyushin ultimately decided against opening a major front. Ne Myo Thihapate was recalled. =Siam (1775‚Äì1776)= Three of the chiefs defected to the Siamese, and came back with Siamese help to drive out the Burmese governor there in January 1775. In response, Hsinbyushin, who had been in a long illness that would eventually take his life, now ordered an invasion. Thihapate again was given the northern command, under the overall commander Gen. Maha Thiha Thura. In October 1775, Thihapate led his army based in Chiang Saen down to Chiang Mai. His army captured Chiang Mai but faced tough resistance by the Siamese forces. He evacuated Chiang Mai back to Chiang Saen when Maha Thiha Thura ordered a pullout of the invasion after Hsinbyushin's death in June 1776. The Burmese would lose control of Lan Na. However, because of good performance in the war, he was honored with a new upgraded title Ne Myo Thenapati, and given the office of Wungyi (minister) by King Singu.

It has been made into an opera entitled A Scholar Under Siege. Background Governor Talmadge's first political interference was in 1935, when he supported a 1935 bill that would have given the governor additional control over funds appropriated to the Georgia Board of Regents, transferred the titles to all Board of Regents property to the state, and absorbed any trust funds or investments held by the university system.McMath, p.193 In addition to the obvious disadvantages for the university system, this would have made it difficult or impossible to fund building projects (such as the construction of a new gym at Georgia Tech) as the state could not take on Public Works Administration (PWA) loans. A compromise deal was reached; if the bill passed with the support of the regents, the state would provide funding to cover projects that would have been supported by PWA loans; however, Talmadge's effort to control the regents and the university system was relatively clear at the time.McMath, p.194 Firing Talmadge fired Walter Cocking, who was dean of the College of Education at the University of Georgia. Talmadge accused Cocking of championing integration, in this case the admission of African-American students to historically all-white educational institutions. Talmadge declared that he would fire anyone who stood for \\"communism or racial equality\\". Among others, Talmadge fired Marvin Pittman, president of Georgia Teachers College (later known as Georgia Southern University) for supporting Cocking against Talmadge. Consequences As a result of the firings, all Georgia universities lost their accreditation. Students rallied, and Pittman and Cocking were eventually rehired. This incident also contributed to Talmadge's loss in the subsequent election to Ellis Arnall.

It served throughout the war in the western theater, in the Confederate Army of Tennessee, seeing action in the Kentucky, Tennessee and Georgia campaigns. Following its depletion in numbers, the regiment was consolidated several times with other Arkansas regiments, finally merging in 1865 into the 1st Arkansas Consolidated Infantry Regiment. The regiment has no connection with the 2nd Regiment, Arkansas State Troops, which participated in the Battle of Wilson's Creek, and is also separate from the 2nd Arkansas Consolidated Infantry Regiment, which was formed in 1864 from remnants of regiments surrendered at Vicksburg and Port Hudson.  Organization  The regiment was organized at Helena, Arkansas, in the spring of 1861 at the expense of Thomas Carmichael Hindman, who had only recently resigned from the United States Congress with Arkansas's secession and the formation of the Confederate States of America. By June 1, 1861, Hindman had raised ten companies from eastern and central Arkansas which would eventually become known as the 2nd Arkansas Infantry.

A new Company C was recruited from Marianna, Arkansas and a new Company E was formed from members of the 11th Arkansas Infantry Regiment who had escaped capture at the fall of Island Number Ten.

Officers who did not choose to stand for re-election were also offered a discharge. The reorganization was accomplished among all the Arkansas regiments in and around Corinth, Mississippi, following the Battle of Shiloh. In the reorganization of Confederate forces before the start of the Kentucky Campaign, the 2nd Arkansas, now under the command of Colonel Daniel C. Govan was assigned to Brigadier General St. John Richardson Liddell's 1st Brigade of Major General Simon Bolivar Buckner's 3rd Division of Major General William Joseph Hardee's Corps of the Army of Mississippi. The regiment participated in Battle of Perryville, Kentucky, in October 1862. In November 1862, following the Kentucky Campaign, General Bragg united his Army of Mississippi and General Kirby Smith'sArmy of Kentucky to create the Army of Tennessee. In the reorganization, Liddell's brigade of Arkansas troops was assigned to Cleburne's Division and fought in the Battle of Stones River, December 31, 1862 ‚Äì January 3, 1863. The regiment lost 15 killed, 94 wounded, and 9 missing at Murfreesboro. The regiment took part in the Tullahoma Campaign in June, 1863; and the Battle of Liberty Gap, June 24‚Äì26, 1863. According to the report Brigadier General St. John R. Liddell, the regiment lost its colors during the fighting at Liberty Gap. The Thirty-eighth Illinois captured the colors of the Second Arkansas Infantry, and were given credit for breaking the Confederate line and forcing their retreat.OFFICIAL RECORDS: Series 1, vol 23, Part 1 (Tullahoma Campaign) Page 590 KY., MID.

The consolidated unit participated in all the battles of the Chattanooga-Ringgold Campaign including the Siege of Chattanooga September to November 1863; Battle of Chattanooga, the Battle of Ringgold Gap. When General Joseph E. Johnston assumed command of the Army of Tennessee to oppose General Sherman's Atlanta Campaign, Govan's Brigade was reorganized and only the 2nd and 24th were united. The 2nd/24th Arkansas participated in the battles of Dalton, Resaca, New Hope Church, Kennesaw Mountain, Atlanta, and the Siege of Atlanta.

The regiment and it colors were captured, along with much of Govan's Brigade at the Battle of Jonesboro, Georgia, on Sept. 1, 1864. Due to a special cartel between Union General Sherman and Confederate General John B. Hood, the unit was quickly paroled and exchanged for Union prisoners held at Andersonville Prison. The regiment re-entered service approximately a month later. The 2nd Arkansas and the rest of Govan's Brigade were released and exchanged just in time to participate in General John B. Hood's disastrous Franklin-Nashville Campaign. Due to the appalling losses suffered by Govan's Brigade during the Atlanta Campaign, the 1st/15th, 5th/13th and 2nd/24th Arkansas Regiments were consolidated into one regiment, which was commanded by Colonel Peter Green of the 5th/13th (specifically of the 5th). The other officers of the consolidated regiment were Major Alexander T. Meek, of the 2nd/24th Arkansas, Captain Mordecai P. Garrett and Sergeant Major Thomas Benton Moncrief of the 15th Arkansas. The consolidated regiment fought under the colors of the consolidated 5th/13th Arkansas Regiment, because this was one of the only colors not captured when Govan's Brigade was overrun at the Battle of Jonesboro. The flag of the combined 5th/13th Arkansas was issued in March 1864 and was captured by Benjamin Newman of the 88th Illinois Infantry at the battle of Franklin.Wernick, John. \\"Re: 5th Arkansas Infantry\\", The Civil War Flags Message Board, Posted 10 January 2008, Accessed 15 February 2012, http://history-sites.com/cgi-bin/bbs53x/cwflags/webbbs_config.pl?read=5234 The consolidated regiment numbered just 300 rifles and sustained 66% casualties during the Battle of Franklin.White, Lee \\"Re: Govan‚Äôs Brigade at Franklin\\", Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 28 August 2004, Accessed 26 June 2012, Archived from the original on 10 December 2012.
