AB 962 was set to take effect on February 1, 2011, but was ruled unconstitutional by Fresno Superior Court Judge Jeffrey Hamilton on January 18, 2011, in Parker v. California. AB 962 would have required that all transfers of ownership of \\"handgun ammunition\\" be done in a face-to-face transaction, with the deliverer or transferor being provided bona fide evidence of identity of the purchaser or other transferee. As part of every \\"handgun ammunition\\" transfer, AB 962 would have required vendors to record and maintain, for a time period no less than five years: the transaction date, the ammunition brand and caliber, the processor's name, as well as the purchaser's driver license number, signature, name, right thumbprint, residential address, phone number, and date of birth. The bill also aimed to stop felony gang crimes by making it a misdemeanor to possess ammunition while associating with a criminal street gang. On August 19, 2010, the NRA-CRPA Foundation Legal Action Project filed a lawsuit challenging AB 962. The lead plaintiff in the lawsuit was Tehama County Sheriff Clay Parker. The lawsuit alleged that the mandates in AB 962 were incomprehensible, and that the definition of \\"handgun ammunition\\" was unconstitutionally vague. On January 18, 2011, Fresno Superior Court Judge Jeffrey Hamilton ruled, in Parker v. California, that the definition of \\"handgun ammunition\\" was indeed unconstitutionally vague.

He was the grandfather of Jane Seymour (c. 1508‚Äì1537), the third wife of King Henry VIII, and was thus great-grandfather of King Edward VI. Origins Seymour was the eldest of the three sons of John Seymour (c. 1425‚Äì1463), Knight of the Shire for Wiltshire and High Sheriff of Wiltshire, by his wife Elizabeth Coker (born about 1436), daughter of Sir Robert Coker of Lydeard St Lawrence, Somerset. Seymour's father predeceased his own father John Seymour (died 1464), and thus in 1464 Seymour succeeded to his grandfather's estates. Career As warden of Savernake Forest, Seymour tried to restore the ancient boundaries of his bailiwick. At the forest eyre at Marlborough in 1464, and at the following eyre in 1477, he made wild claims. In June 1485 he was able to obtain letters patent to establish \\"the bounds of the Forest of Savernake before the perambulation of Henry III\\", and at the eyre of 1491 he used this to claim that the Farm and West bailiwicks of the forest extended from the Ridgeway and Pewsey in the west to the edge of Hungerford in the east.'Royal forests', in A History of the County of Wiltshire volume 4 (1959), pp. 391‚Äì433, accessed 19 January 2011 In 1489, on the death of his cousin Margaret Coker, the wife of Sir Reynold Stourton, Seymour inherited the Somerset manors of West Bower in Bridgwater, Moorland in North Petherton, and Cokers in Wembdon.Douglas Richardson, Kimball G.

They portray the lives of four photojournalists active within the townships of South Africa during the Apartheid period, particularly between 1990 and 1994, from when Nelson Mandela was released from prison to the 1994 elections. It is a film adaptation of the book The Bang-Bang Club: Snapshots from a Hidden War co-written by Greg Marinovich and Jo√£o Silva who were part of the group of four photographers known as Bang-Bang Club, the other two members being Kevin Carter and Ken Oosterbroek. Plot The film tells the story of four young men and the extremes they went to in order to capture their pictures in the days prior to the downfall of apartheid in South Africa.

According to The Numbers, the film was only shown in nine theatres in the US where it earned $124,791. Reception Judith Matloff, a veteran foreign correspondent and contributing editor at Columbia Journalism Review said in her review of the film that it is \\"the latest Hollywood production to get the role of the conflict correspondent wrong\\". Matloff wrote: \\"But the reporters and photographers stationed in South Africa at the time were also compassionate human beings who exposed themselves to danger because they wanted to record history. This doesn't particularly come through in the film. Instead, Silver plays to the Hollywood stereotype of journalists as heartless outsiders. After a fun day taking pictures of black people massacring each other, the lads go back to the white suburbs and party ‚Äî the implication being that the bloodshed is a game to them.\\" Matloff worked with Marinovich and knew Silva, as she was a member of the Johannesburg press corps in the early 1990s. She wrote in her article for the Columbia Journalism Review of her experiences, \\"The film depicts the photographers as reckless thrill-seekers, swaggering into newsrooms like rock stars and canoodling with babes, when not jumping into cars to chase 'Bang Bang' (violence)\\". In her review Matloff said that Marinovich had disassociated himself from the film version. \\"It has the same title but it is not the same story. It's not my life. I don't see the character as me.\\" Miriam Brent in her review for The Guardian said \\"Frustratingly, though, while the film poses pertinent questions about when to put the camera down, it shies away from delving deeper into these moral dilemmas and the emotional strain faced by combat photographers. Instead we're introduced to a testosterone-fuelled world in which dodging bullets is just another way of getting kicks before the partying starts. ‚Ä¶ It's just a shame the accomplished cinematography isn't matched by a script that lets the true bravery and accomplishments of combat photojournalists shine through, as they deserve.\\" Some more reviewers critiqued the missing of the real characters of the members of the Bang-Bang Club in the film. Jo√£o Silva was asked in an interview for the French magazine Paris Match about the film. His answer described Michel Peyrard with the words: The Bang Bang Club received mixed reviews. , it holds a 49% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 47 reviews, with an average rating of 5.89/10.

The film opens like a World War Two documentary with a narrator explaining the action, before becoming a more traditional Formby vehicle. Synopsis Mechanic and Home Guard lance corporal George Singleton (Formby) has an adversary in a fellow Home Guard Everett Manley (Shiner). When the rival Home Guard units of Major Wallop and Minor Wallop are sent on battle manoeuvres, George launches his own unique style of commando raid against neighbouring Major Wallop to steal a Vickers machine gun. The raid fails and Singleton loses his lance corporal stripe, so he and a little evacuee girl named Irene decide to build their very own tank. The venture is such a success that George is made a sergeant. The film includes three songs from Formby: 'Under the Blasted Oak', 'Home Guard Blues' and 'Get Cracking'. Production The film was released on 17 May 1943 and runs for 96 minutes in black and white. It was written by L. du Garde Peach, Michael Vaughan and John L.

Born in 1938 in Pakse (then a part of the French protectorate of Laos within French Indochina), Saysangkhi earned a secondary education degree in mathematics in 1960, attended a public works engineering school in Laos, and then studied law and economic science in Paris from 1964 to 1965. After returning, he became chief of the Communication and Transport Service of the Royal Government of Laos (RLG). At the same time, however, he is said to have \\"participated in the revolution\\" on behalf of the opposition Lao People's Revolutionary Party, which was then locked in a civil war with the RLG. It is believed that he worked as an \\"underground\\" activist, opposing the RLG from within its ranks. Just before the LPRP came to power, he became the RLG's Director General of Public Works. After the LPRP assumed power in 1975 and established the Lao People's Democratic Republic (LPDR), he worked as the Director for Materials and Equipment in the Ministry of Public Works and Transport until 1981, when he was appointed to be Director General of the LPDR Representation at the Vietnamese port of Da Nang. In 1982, he returned to Laos to become Acting Minister of Equipment in the LPDR cabinet. He remained in this post until 1985, when he became Vice Minister of Communications, Transportation and Post. In 1990, a few months before his resignation from the LPRP and arrest, he became Vice Minister of Science and Technology, a post which he also resigned along with his party membership. Near the end of summer in 1990, he was arrested after resigning from the Government and the party and calling for political and economic change. Also arrested with him were Latsami Khamphoui (born 28 May 1940 in Pakse) and Feng Sakchittapong (born 2 August 1940 in Khong District). All three were held without trial for two years, before being sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment. In his resignation letter to Kaysone Phomvihan, then the general secretary of the party's central executive committee and head of state, Thongsouk Saysangkhi said, \\"I oppose the dictatorial power of personal cliques, which are precisely what the Party and the State apparat are; and I am demanding the holding of free elections, the putting into practice of popular liberties and democracy, and the existence of democratic institutions opposed to the maintenance of a system of communist feudalism and Politburo dynastism. ... The history of humankind has now confirmed that a single-party system relying exclusively on coercion and deception is incapable of ever bringing prosperity and happiness to our people.\\" According to Amnesty International, Thongsouk Saysangkhi is believed to have either died in Xam Khe prison around from Vientiane, or in Forced Labour Camp No 7 in Houaphanh Province in February 1998. Amnesty says it was alerted to the poor prison conditions and Thongsouk Saysangkhi's poor state of health, but was told by Lao authorities that all three were well.

He should not be confused with his contemporary Domnicus, Praetorian prefect of Illyricum (term 535‚Äì540).. Biography Domnicus is first mentioned in 536. He was a member of the Byzantine Senate. Procopius records that Domnicus was sent to the Praetorian prefecture of Africa, alongside Germanus and Symmachus. The three were tasked with facing the military rebellion of Stotzas. Domnicus took over command of the infantry forces of the area, succeeding the deceased John of Epidamnus. He served in command of the infantry at the Battle of Scalae Veteres (537). The battle was a victory for Germanus and his forces.. Germanus, Domnicus, and Symmachus were recalled to Constantinople in 539. Documents of 540 have Domnicus listing his own titles: comes domesticorum, former consul (honorary consul), and patrician. During his service in Africa, Domnicus likely held the rank of magister militum. He obviously no longer held any military tile in 540. That year, Emperor Justinian I assigned Domnicus and Maximinus as his new envoys to the court of Vitiges (reigned 536‚Äì540) in Ravenna. Domnicus also delivered a letter of Emperor Justinian to Pope Vigilius (term 537‚Äì555). He returned to Constantinople, transporting letters from Vigilius to Emperor Justinian and Patriarch Menas of Constantinople. The letters addressed matters of faith. Domnicus added his own signature to them \\"by way of approval\\". The letters of Vigilius have survived. They support the decisions of a council of Constantinople in 536. Said decisions confirmed adherence to the rules of the Council of Chalcedon (451) and opposition to Monophysitism. Domnicus's approval of their content indicates that the patrikios was an adherent of Chalcedonian Christianity. There is no further mention of him.

The United States does not recognize the State of Palestine, but accepts the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as a representative of the Palestinian people and the Palestinian National Authority as the authority legitimately governing the Palestinian territories under the Oslo Accords. The United States does not officially maintain any diplomatic office in the Palestinian territories nor provide consular services to Palestinians, and since the closure of the PLO mission in Washington D.C. in October 2018, the Palestinians have had no diplomatic representation in the United States. The United States has designated a Palestinian Affairs Unit within the US Embassy in Jerusalem to handle relations with the Palestinian Authority but Palestine is presently maintaining a public policy of noncooperation with the office and with the United States in general. Since 2011 at least, the PLO's diplomatic effort has focused on the Palestine 194 campaign, which aims to gain full membership for Palestine in the United Nations. It seeks to effectively gain international recognition of the State of Palestine based on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. The US minimal conditions for relations with the Palestinians were Palestinian acceptance of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, the recognition of Israel‚Äôs right to exist, and renunciation of terrorism. Establishing relations The PLO, established in 1964, did not receive any official recognition from the U.S. government. However, an unofficial PLO Information Office was permitted to establish in New York in 1964 and was run by Sadat Hassan, who served as Permanent Representative of Yemen to the United Nations. It operated until 1968, when it was closed. On May 1, 1978, the PLO was allowed to open the Palestine Information Office (PIO) in Washington DC. The PIO was registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent. In 1987, the United States Congress adopted the Anti-Terrorism Act, which declared the PLO a terrorist organization, with a consequential ban on assisting it in any way,U.S. Code TITLE 22 - CHAPTER 61 - ¬ß 5201. Findings; determinations, Legal Information Institute, Cornell Law School. Retrieved 5 December 2006.22 USC CHAPTER 61 ‚Äì ANTI-TERRORISM ‚Äì PLO , Office of the Law Revision Counsel (United States). Retrieved 5 December 2006. and the government ordered the closure of the PIO. The PIO appealed to the courts, but their objections were rejected.Palestine Information Office v. Shultz In 1988 a presidential waiver was issued to allow contact with the organization. A PLO office was reopened in 1989 as the Palestine Affairs Center.The Palestinian Diaspora: Formation of Identities and Politics of Homeland, By Helena Lindholm Schulz, Juliane Hammer, Routledge, 2003 p. 81 The PLO Mission office in Washington D.C. was opened in 1994. Following the establishment of the Palestinian National Authority in 1994 under the Oslo Agreement, the PLO office was renamed the PLO Mission to the United States. On 20 July 2010, the United States Department of State agreed to upgrade the status of the PLO Mission in the United States to \\"General Delegation of the PLO\\". The PLO Mission Office was ordered closed in October 2018. Why Trump's Closure of the Palestinian Diplomatic Mission in Washington Could Backfire Statement in Response to the Closing of the PLO General Delegation Office in Washington, DC Relations prior to 1988 Before the 1973 Yom Kippur War, the U.S. government considered the PLO and Fatah under Yasser Arafat's leadership as a terrorist organization, and did not support PLO aspirations at the UN.William Rogers (U.S. Secretary of State) to State Department, October 22, 1970, Foreign Relations of the United States 1969-1976, vol. V, p. 223 U.S. diplomats in the Middle East were explicitly ordered by the State Department never to make any contacts with Arafat or any representative on his behalf. However, despite the negative view of the PLO, State Department officials began to view the Palestinian factor as crucial enough to be taken into consideration when brokering an Israeli-Jordanian agreement on the West Bank. In contrast to the negative diplomatic view of the PLO, the intelligence community did not refrain from clandestine contacts with that entity, and as early as October 1970, a senior Fatah representative delivered the CIA message about willingness by Arafat to recognize the State of Israel in exchange for US support of a Palestinian state.Memorandum From Director of Central Intelligence Helms to the President‚Äôs Assistant for National Security Affairs (Kissinger), October 23, 1970, Foreign Relations of the United States 1969-1976, vol. 23 This trend of clandestine contacts produced some tangible results following the Yom Kippur War. On November 3, 1973, a secret meeting was held in Morocco between Deputy Director of the CIA Vernon A. Walters and Khaled al-Hassan, number two in the PLO at the time, and the two discussed the possibility of integrating the PLO into the peace process. Even though no tangible agreement was reached at that meeting, it led to the restraint of Fatah attacks on U.S. targets.Backchannel Message From the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence (Walters) to Secretary of State Kissinger, November 4, 1973, Foreign Relations of the United States 1969-1976, vol. 25, pp. 882-886 From 1974 onward, some circles in the Department of State were considering accepting the PLO as a partner in the Middle East peace process. In June 1974, U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Herman Eilts assessed that Arafat was looking for ways to integrate the PLO into the peace process. U.S. President Gerald Ford even alluded to that possibility in October 1974. In November 1974, Ford made a non-committal statement on U.S. position towards the PLO saying: > The Israelis have said they will never negotiate with the PLO. We are not a > party for any negotiations. I think we have to let the decision as to who > will negotiate to be the responsibility of the parties involved. However, due to U.S. support of the Israeli government Washington agreed in 1975 to demand PLO explicit recognition of the State of Israel as a precondition to any dealing with its representatives. Referring to this, Ford said in November 1975: > the Palestinians do not recognize the State of Israel. And under those > circumstances, it is impossible to bring the Palestinians and the Israelis > together to negotiate. So, unless there is some change in their attitude, I > think you can see a very serious roadblock exists. As the PLO did not make such recognition explicitly at that time, the U.S. government refrained from any official relations and the PLO was not allowed to maintain any offices in the U.S., except for the PLO Mission to the United Nations, which was immune from U.S. law. A certain change of attitude took place under President Jimmy Carter. Carter was the first U.S. president to advocate the creation of a Palestinian state, which he did in March 1977: > There has to be a homeland provided for the Palestinian refugees who have > suffered for many, many years. In addition to Carter's pro-Palestinian positions, the PLO leadership attempted to reach an agreement with the US government. In January 1978, Arafat delivered a secret message to Carter, stating he would settle for a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in exchange for US support of that objective. The administration's relatively positive position on the PLO also allowed that organization to establish on May 1, 1978, the Palestine Information Office in Washington DC. However, no real progress on the Palestinian issue was made under Carter, as he was preoccupied with reaching an Israeli-Egyptian agreement, and contacts with PLO were detrimental to that agreement. A harsher stance towards the PLO was taken by President Ronald Reagan. The Republican party platform approved in 1980 stated that: > Republicans reject any call for the involvement of the PLO as not in keeping > with the long-term interests of either Israel or the Palestinian Arabs. The > imputation of legitimacy to organizations not yet willing to acknowledge the > fundamental right to existence of the State of Israel is wrong. [- - -] We > believe the establishment of a Palestinian State on the West Bank would be > destabilizing and harmful to the peace process. Reagan continuously opposed the establishment of a Palestinian state or negotiating with the PLO. In September he proposed Palestinian autonomy under Jordanian supervision. Even though the plan did not call for any PLO participation, some PLO circles viewed this as a possible sign that the Reagan administration might consider accommodation with the PLO at a later date. An attempt to close down the Palestine Information Office was made following the passage of the Anti-Terrorism Act in December 1987. This act proclaimed the PLO a terrorist organization and prohibited all of its activities except for disseminating information. Reagan then stated: > I have no intention of establishing diplomatic relations with the PLO. The U.S. government attempted to close the Palestine Information Office on grounds that it was involved in terrorist activities, but various courts in the United States ruled against this line of action, but allowed stricter supervision of the office's activities. Also, Reagan downplayed the outbreak of the Intifada, viewing it an import into the Palestinian territories rather than an expression of the Palestinian popular rebellion. Reagan administration The Palestine Liberation Organization published the Palestinian Declaration of Independence in November 1988, and accepted United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, recognized Israel's right to exist, and renounced terrorism, the US conditions for an open dialogue between the PLO and the U.S. government. Reagan issued a presidential waiver to the Anti-Terrorism Act to allow contact with the PLO. George H.W. Bush administration The dialogue continued under President George H. W. Bush, but was suspended in June 1990 following PLO refusal to condemn an attempted attack on the Israeli coastline by the Palestine Liberation Front.Letter dated 22 June 1990 from the Permanent Observer of Palestine to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General In addition, relations strained after PLO leader Arafat supported Iraq‚Äôs Saddam Hussein, even after Iraq invaded Kuwait and during the 1991 Gulf War. When asked at a press conference immediately after the Gulf War about a possible dialog with the PLO, Bush stated: > to me, they've lost credibility. They've lost credibility with this office > right here. And the reason they have is that they behaved very badly to > those of their own fundamental faith. However, the Bush administration made efforts throughout 1991 to convene a general Middle East peace conference. In a news conference in early August, Bush stated: > In the Middle East, we're close to convening a conference this October that > will launch direct talks among Israel, the Palestinians, and the Arab > States. I welcome Prime Minister Shamir's statement that he supports our > proposal, and I call upon Israel and the Palestinians to clear away > remaining obstacles and seize this truly historic opportunity for peace. Bush's efforts culminated in the Madrid Peace Conference in October 1991, which for the first time accepted an official Palestinian delegation, even though without open PLO participation. Clinton administration Yitzhak Rabin, Bill Clinton, and Yasser Arafat at the Oslo Accords signing ceremony on 13 September 1993 President Bill Clinton altered the official U.S. position towards the PLO. He supported the goal of a Palestinian state, but refrained from expressing this in public until the closing months of his administration. On September 10, 1993, the eve of the signing of the Oslo Agreement between the Israeli government and the PLO, Clinton announced the resumption of the U.S.-PLO dialogue, suspended in 1990. The signing ceremony of the Oslo Accord on September 13, 1993, was held in Washington D.C. in the presence of Clinton, even though negotiations for the agreement took place under the auspices of the Norwegian government. Following that ceremony, Arafat became a regular visitor to the White House, the first Palestinian leader to be accorded that honor. The U.S. government also became more involved in Israeli-Palestinian talks and invited both parties to come to Washington on certain occasions to push forward the peace process. This way, the Clinton administration brokered the Israeli-Palestinian ceasefire agreement of October 1996, and in October 1998, Clinton brokered an agreement on Israeli further redeployment in the West bank. The Clinton administration also assisted materially to the formation of the Palestinian Authority by hosting the first donor conference for that purpose, held in Washington DC on October 1, 1993. In October 1993, Congress passed the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act of 1993, which authorized the U.S. government to monitor PLO compliance with international law. Following the Oslo Agreement and the establishment of the Palestinian National Authority in 1994, the PLO office was upgraded and renamed the PLO Mission to the United States. The U.S. government took an active part in lending technical assistance in building the institutions of the Palestinian Authority. On March 30, 1994, Clinton ordered the allocation of $4 million for the construction of a Palestinian police force, and on March 16, 1995 ordered additional $5 million to be allocated towards the same purpose. In July 1995, U.S. Congress passed the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act of 1995, which authorized the President to withhold funds from the Palestinian Authority in cases of what it viewed as in compliance with commitments made to the Israeli government under the Oslo Agreement. In December 1998, President Bill Clinton became the first U.S. President to visit the Palestinian Authority. George W. Bush administration George W. Bush and Mahmoud Abbas stand before an honor cordon of the Palestinian Presidential Guard in Ramallah on January 10, 2008 U.S. attitudes towards the Palestinian Authority changed following the inauguration of President George W. Bush. President Bush refrained from meeting Arafat, and refrained from referring to him as \\"President Arafat\\", as Palestinian officials insisted, but only as \\"Chairman Arafat\\". During the first year of his administration, Bush maintained relations with the Palestinian Authority on the technical level only. Following another round of violence in the Palestinian territories, in June 2002 Bush expressed support for a Palestinian state following a process of negotiations. On June 3, 2003, Bush met for the first time Palestinian prime minister Mahmoud Abbas at a multilateral conference at Sharm el-Sheikh, a format of meeting designed to avoid a direct meeting with Arafat, now viewed negatively by Bush and the Israeli leadership. On July 25, 2003, Abbas visited the White House for the first time. At that meeting, the two leaders established the Palestine Economic Development Group, a high level joint American-Palestinian committee to overlook economic ties. Following Arafat's death in November 2004, the new Palestinian president Abbas became a regular visitor to the White House. Bush now referred to him in official communications as \\"President\\" instead of \\"Chairman\\", as was done with Arafat. Abbas visited the White House while receiving the honors of a head of state on six occasions between 2005 and 2008. During the visit of May 26, 2005, Bush stated his support for the parameters of the Palestinian state: > Any final status agreement must be reached between the two parties, and > changes to the 1949 Armistice Lines must be mutually agreed to. A viable > two-state solution must ensure contiguity on the West Bank, and a state of > scattered territories will not work. There must also be meaningful linkages > between the West Bank and Gaza. This is the position of the United States > today; it will be the position of the United States at the time of final > status negotiations. Concerning the internal structure of the Palestinian Authority, Bush supported the Israeli demand for holding new presidential elections in January 2005 and parliamentary elections in January 2006. In January 2008 President George W. Bush visited the Palestinian Authority. Obama administration US Aid to Palestinian Authority Relations improved under President Barack Obama. From the beginning of his administration, Obama pledged his support for the establishment of a Palestinian state. Abbas visited the White House on at least four occasions between 2009 and 2014. In July 2010 the PLO mission was upgraded and renamed PLO General Delegation to the United States. During fiscal year 2011, the U.S. government gave the Palestinian Authority $200 million in direct budget support. = Tension in US-Palestinian relations = In 2011, relations worsened as the Palestinians sought UN membership for a Palestinian state, which the US government and Israel regarded as a unilateral act. Obama told Abbas that the US would veto any UN Security Council move to recognize Palestinian statehood. The Palestinian efforts shifted to the UN General Assembly, which voted in November 2012 to admit Palestine as an observer state, while the US voted against the resolution, and has continued not to recognise Palestine as a state. Obama, and Abbas in the West Bank in 2013 Short video of the meeting between Trump and Abbas in May 2017 Despite the passage on November 29, 2012, of the UN General Assembly resolution recognizing Palestine as a non-member observer state, Obama visited the Palestinian Authority for the first time as a President in March 2013. Also, Vice President Biden visited the Palestinian Authority twice. Trump administration Graffiti depicting President Donald Trump on the Israeli West Bank barrier in Bethlehen The Trump administration adopted a general stance of support for Israeli positions. On May 3, 2017, Palestinian President Abbas visited the White House for the first time during the Trump administration. According to Bob Woodward, citing as his source Rex Tillerson, Trump's early support for Israel wavered: he had began to wonder whether Netanyahu might not be the major obstacle to a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. On his visit to Israel on 22 May 2017 Trump met Netanyahu and was shown by the latter tapes that appeared to show Mahmoud Abbas advocating the killing of children. Netanyahu then asked him, 'And that's the guy you want to help?'. Trump was outraged by what he saw. After their meeting ended, Rex Tillerson was called in and shown the same material, a 'crudely forged video', and told the president the clips looked like fabrications. Trump remained convinced they were authentic. On the following day, at his meeting with Abbas in Bethlehem, Trump then lashed out at the Palestinian leader, calling him a liar and murderer. Woodward appears to suggest that this disinformation was behind Trump's decision to close the PLO office in Washington and cut off aid to the organization. 'Netanyahu Used Doctored Video of Abbas to Influence Trump's Policy, Woodward Reveals,' Haaretz 12 September 2020 'Book: Netanyahu showed Trump likely doctored clip of Abbas backing child murder,' The Times of Israel 12 September 20'20.Andrew Feinberg, 'The most outrageous revelations in Bob Woodward‚Äôs book ‚ÄòRage‚Äô aren‚Äôt the ones you‚Äôve heard about,' 12 May 2020. This occasion, on the 23 of May was Trump's first encounter with the Palestinian Authority. On December 6, 2017, Trump announced the U.S.'s recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, a move condemned by Abbas, who described it as indicating US withdrawal from its mediation role. On September 10, 2018, Trump ordered the closure of the Palestinian office in Washington D.C., citing the PLO's lack of progress in the peace process. The closure was condemned. The mission was closed on October 11, 2018 On October 18, 2018, United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the U.S. Consulate-General in Jerusalem would be merged into the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. Pompeo announced that the US would continue to conduct relations with the Palestinians through a special Palestinian Affairs Unit inside the Embassy. This announcement was criticized by Palestinian officials including Palestinian Authority chief negotiator Saeb Erekat as an endorsement of the Israeli claim to Jerusalem and \\"Greater Israel.\\" On 31 January 2019, the U.S. confirmed it stopped all aid to Palestinians following a request from the Palestinians to do so for fear of future court actions against them as a result of the Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act allowing Americans to sue those receiving foreign aid in US for ‚Äúacts of war‚Äù. On March 4, 2019, the Consulate-General ceased operating as an independent mission and was revamped as the Palestinian Affairs Unit, which will report to the Embassy. In response, Saeb Erekat, the secretary-general of the PLO's Executive Committee called for the international community to boycott the new Palestinian Affairs Unit, regarding it as a \\"downgrade\\" and \\"assault\\" on the peace process. Another Palestinian official Hanan Ashrawi claimed that the merger of the Consulate General into the Embassy represented an assault on Palestinian rights and identity. In November 2019, Donald Trump rejected the request by Benjamin Netanyahu to allow the transfer of $12 million to the security forces of Palestine Authority (PA). The request was made after the US State Department amid its aid cuts to the Palestinians realized that the amount in aid to PA forces was neither stopped nor transferred.

At the time of its foundation, the society had just 200 members but it grew fast, reaching 16,000 in 1890, and peaking at 26,342 members in 1955. The society built a total of almost 1,500 terraced houses at various sites around the city, including Kartoffelr√¶kkerne in √òsterbro and Humleby in Vesterbro, before it was dissolved in 1972. History =Background= The idea of providing good and healthy homes for the poorest part of the city's workforce originated among local politicians and medical doctors during the 1853 Copenhagen cholera outbreak which killed approximately 5,000 citizens. A major reason for the outbreak was the dismal conditions in the poorest parts of the city which suffered from overpopulation and lack of proper sanitary facilities. The Danish Medical Society was the first to take action with the construction of Brumleby, built between 1853 and 1872. =Foundation= Burmeister & Wain's iron foundry in 1885 as painted by Peder Severin Kr√∏yer The Worker's Building Society was founded in 1865 on the initiative of the medical doctors Emil Hornemann (1810‚Äì90) and Frederik Ferdinand Ulrik (1818‚Äì1917) who had witnessed first hand how far conditions could deteriorate, but it also drew on possible reforms in health care and housing. Ulrik had his clinic at Christianshavn and arranged some meetings for the workers at the nearby Burmeister & Wain plant, one of the largest work places in the city, and it was with them that the new building society was founded on 20 November 1865, with foundry worker N. B. Hallin as its first chairman and Ulrik as its deputy chairman. =Developments= The first terraces were built on Amager from 1867 to 1871. They were designed by Henrik Steffens Sibbern who also planned the next developments, 12 houses at Gammel Kongevej (1868-69) and 45 houses at Nyboder (1870-72). The third development, 45 houses at Nyboder built from 1870 to 1872, was designed by Frederik B√∏ttger and from 1874 he became the society's new resident architect, a position he held until 1903. During this 30-year period, the society built up the areas which are now known as Kartoffelr√¶kkerne, Humleby and Strandvejskvarteret. B√∏ttger was succeeded by Christen Larsen and it was to his design that the society built its last two developments, the so-called Lyngbyvejskvarteret with 324 houses, from 1906 to 1929, and another 105 houses on Amager between 1930 and 1938. =Late years= Gradually the price of land and the costs of construction became too high, making the houses inaffordable for ordinary workers. It was said that \\"...the Worker's Building Society was not for workers but for people of means\\" which undermined the original philosophy behind it. In 1972 it was dissolved. Scheme The Building Society members paid 35 √∏re a week. When they had saved up DKK 20, they could participate in the annual drawing for a house. After 10 years of repayments, they received the deed to the house, and after 24 years were the homeowners. For those who did not receive a house, the society worked as a savings bank. After a number of years they could withdraw their savings. Architecture Frederik B√∏ttger's houses are built in yellow brick with slate roofs. Christen Larsen's houses, in red brick and with red tile roofs, are built to an asymmetric National Romantic design. Considerably younger, they also demonstrate the general improvements in housing standards, with more practical floor plans and fittings, such as built-in China cabinets.

Kobasa in 1979. Kobasa described a pattern of personality characteristics that distinguished managers and executives who remained healthy under life stress, as compared to those who developed health problems. In the following years, the concept of hardiness was further elaborated in a book and a series of research reports by Salvatore Maddi, Kobasa and their graduate students at the University of Chicago. Definitions In the early days of research on hardiness, it was usually defined as a personality structure comprising the three related general dispositions of commitment, control and challenge that functions as a resistance resource in encounters with stressful conditions. The commitment disposition was defined as a tendency to involve oneself in activities in life and as having a genuine interest in and curiosity about the surrounding world (activities, things, other people). The control disposition was defined as a tendency to believe and act as if one can influence the events taking place around oneself through one‚Äôs own efforts. Finally, the challenge disposition was defined as the belief that change, rather than stability, is the normal mode of life and constitutes motivating opportunities for personal growth rather than threats to security. Lately, Maddi has characterized hardiness as a combination of three attitudes (commitment, control, and challenge) that together provide the courage and motivation needed to turn stressful circumstances from potential calamities into opportunities for personal growth. While acknowledging the importance of the three core dimensions, Bartone considers hardiness as something more global than mere attitudes. He conceives of hardiness as a broad personality style or generalized mode of functioning that includes cognitive, emotional, and behavioural qualities. This generalized style of functioning, which incorporates commitment, control, and challenge, is believed to affect how one views oneself and interacts with the world around. Historical roots Early conceptualizations of hardiness are evident in Maddi's work, most notably in his descriptions of the ideal identity and premorbid personality. In his 1967 article, Maddi argued that chronic states of meaninglessness and alienation from existence were becoming more and more typical features of modern life. Like other existential psychologists before him, Maddi believed that the feelings of apathy and boredom and inability to believe in the interest value of the things one is engaged in that characterised modern living were caused by upheavals in culture and society, increased industrialization and technological power, and more rigidly differentiated social structures in which people's identities were defined in terms of their social roles. Maddi went on to outline two distinct personality types, based on how people identify or see themselves. The premorbid personality sees him- or herself in fairly simple terms, as nothing more than ‚Äúa player of social roles and an embodiment of biological needs.‚Äù This type of identity thus stresses qualities that are the least unique for him or her as opposed to other species (biological needs) and to other people (social roles). According to Maddi, people with a premorbid identity can continue with their life for a long time and ostensibly feel adequate and reasonably successful. However, this personality type is also prone to being precipitated into a state of chronic existential neurosis under conditions of stress. This existential neurosis is characterized by the belief that one‚Äôs life is meaningless, by feelings of apathy and boredom, and by a lack of selectivity in actions ‚Äì a sense that one‚Äôs activities are not chosen. In stark contrast to the premorbid personality, one finds the ideal identity. Though still a player of social roles and an expression of the biological sides of man, this personality type also has a deeper and richer understanding of his or her unique psychological side ‚Äì mental processes like symbolization, imagination, and judgement. Whereas the premorbid personality accepts social roles as given, feels powerless to influence actions and merely tries to play the roles as well as possible, the ideal identity, through expression of his or her psychological side, does not feel powerless in the face of social pressure. This person is able to perceive alternatives to mere role playing, is able to switch roles more easily, and even redefine existing roles. As a consequence of this deeper psychological understanding of the self, the ideal identity is actively engaged in and interested in life, is willing to act to influence events, and is interested in new experiences and in learning new things. Resiliency mechanisms Hardiness is often considered an important factor in psychological resilience or an individual-level pathway leading to resilient outcomes.Bartone, P. T., & Hystad, S. W. (2010) Increasing mental hardiness for stress resilience in operational settings. In P. T. Bartone, B. H. Johnsen, J. Eid, J. M. Violanti & J. C. Laberg (Eds.), Enhancing human performance in security operations: International and law enforcement perspective (pp. 257‚Äì272). Springfield, Il: Charles C. Thomas Since 1979, a fairly extensive body of research has accumulated supporting the notion that hardiness has beneficial effects and buffers the detrimental effect of stress on health and performance. Although early studies relied almost exclusively on male business executives, over the years this buffer-effect has been demonstrated in a large variety of occupational groups as well as non- professionals, including military groups,Bartone, P. T. (2000) Hardiness as a resiliency factor for United States Forces in the Gulf War. In J. M. Violanti, D. Paton & C. Dunning (Eds.), Posttraumatic stress intervention: Challenges, issues and perspectives (pp. 115‚Äì133). Springfield, IL: Charles C Thomas Publisher Ltd teachers and university staff, firefighters, and students. Still, not every investigation has been able to demonstrate such moderating, or buffering, effects and there is a debate whether the effects of hardiness are interactive or primarily independent of levels of stress. The manner in which hardiness confers resiliency appears to be a combination of cognitive, behavioural mechanisms, and biophysical processes. Very simplified, as stressful circumstances mount, so does the physical and mental strain on the individual, and if this strain is sufficiently intense and prolonged, breakdowns in health and performance are to be expected. In short, the personality style of hardiness is proposed to have a moderating effect on this process by encouraging effective mental and behavioural coping, building and utilizing social support, and engagement in effective self-care and health practices. =Cognitive appraisals= According to Kobasa, individuals high in hardiness tend to put stressful circumstances into perspective and interpret them in a less threatening manner. As a consequence of these optimistic appraisals, the impact of the stressful events is reduced and they are less likely to negatively affect the health of the individual. Research on self- reported stressors, real-life stressful experiences, and laboratory-induced stress support this claim. For example, two studies used military cadets undergoing stressful training as participants and found that cadets that scored high on hardiness appraised the combat training in less threatening terms, and at the same time viewed themselves as more capable of coping with the training. =Behavioral coping= The coping style most commonly associated with hardiness is transformational coping, an optimistic style of coping that transforms stressful events into less stressful ones. At the cognitive level this involves setting the event into a broader perspective in which it does not seem so terrible after all. At the level of action, individuals high in hardiness are believed to react to stressful events by increasing their interaction with them, trying to turn them into an advantage and opportunity for growth, and in the process achieve greater understanding. In support of this notion, two studies have demonstrated that the effects of hardiness on symptoms of illness were partly mediated through the positive relation of hardiness to presumed beneficial coping styles and the negative relation to presumed harmful styles of coping. =Social resources and health- promoting behaviour= The concept of transformational coping can be extended to also include health-promoting behaviour and recruiting or making adequate use of social resources. One study has shown that in relation to work- environment stress, support from the boss but not support from home promoted health among executives high in hardiness. For those executives ranked low in hardiness, support from the boss did not promote health and family support worsened their health status. These results were taken to suggest that hardy individuals know what type of support to use in a given situation. Another study also found support for an indirect effect of hardiness through social support on post-traumatic stress symptomatology in veterans of the Vietnam War. Although several studies have found hardiness to be related to making good use of social resources, some studies have also failed to support this idea and rather found that the two concepts made independent contributions to positive health outcomes. Several investigations have found hardiness and physical exercise to be uncorrelated. On the other hand, one study examined a broader array of health-protective behaviours, including exercise, and found that hardiness worked indirectly through these behaviours to influence health. Another study also found that hardiness was negatively correlated with self- reported alcohol use and drug use obtained through both urine screens and self-report. =Biophysiology= Hardiness appears to be related to differences in physiological arousal. It is believed that hardiness helps decrease the ability of stressful events to produce arousal in the sympathetic nervous system. Some support for this notion can be found in studies demonstrating that participants that score high on hardiness exhibit lower cardiovascular reactivity in response to stress. Another study examined the functional efficacy of immune cells in participants scoring low and high on hardiness. This study examined in vitro proliferation of lymphocytes in response to invading microorganisms (antigens and mitogens), a process believed to mimic the series of events that occurs in vivo following stimulation by invading microorganisms. Results showed that participants scoring high on hardiness had significantly higher mean antigen- and mitogen- induced proliferative responses. Other studies have associated hardiness with cholesterol and hormonal variations. Bartone and associatesBartone, P. T., Spinosa, T., Robb, J., & Pastel, R. H. (2008, November) Hardy-resilient style is associated with high-density lipoprotein cholestrol levels. Paper presented at the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States annual meeting, San Antonio, Texas examined hardiness levels against a full lipid profile including high-density lipoprotein, usually considered a beneficial type of cholesterol. Findings from this study showed that participants high in hardiness were more than two times as likely to also have high levels of high- density lipoprotein compared with participants low in hardiness. Although it has been suggested that hardiness might be related with lower levels of the ‚Äústress-hormone‚Äù cortisol, one of the few studies that have investigated the two found that higher hardiness was associated with higher levels of cortisol. Measurement There are several instrument developed to measure hardiness, the most frequently used being the Personal Views Survey,Maddi, S. R. (1997) Personal views survey II: A measure of dispositional hardiness. In C. P. Zalaquett & R. J. Wood (Eds.), Evaluating stress: A book of resources (pp. 293‚Äì309). Lanham, Md.: Scarecrow Press, Inc the Dispositional Resilience Scale,Bartone, P. T. (1991, June) Development and validation of a short hardiness measure. Paper presented at the Annual Convention of the American Psychological Society, Washington, DCBartone, P. T. (1995, July) A short hardiness scale. Paper presented at the Annual Convention of the American Psychological Society, New York and the Cognitive Hardiness Scale. In addition to these, other scales based on hardiness theory have been designed to measure the construct in specific contexts and in special populations, such as for example parental grief and among the chronically ill. Similar to many personality variables in the field of psychology, hardiness is considered to measure a continuous dimension. Individuals will vary in their levels of hardiness along a continuum from low to high, with a relatively small percentage scoring at the extreme low/high ends. Given large enough samples, the distribution of scores on hardiness measures will approximate a normal, Gaussian distribution. Similarities with other constructs Hardiness has some notable similarities with other personality constructs in psychology. Chief among these are locus of control,Rotter, J. B. (1966) Generalized expectancies for internal versus external control of reinforcement, Psychological Monographs, 80 (Whole No.609) sense of coherence, (SOC) self- efficacy, and dispositional optimism. Despite their very different theoretical approaches ‚Äì hardiness arose from existential psychology and philosophy and SOC has its roots in sociology, whereas locus of control, self-efficacy, and dispositional optimism are all based on a learning/social cognitive perspective ‚Äì some striking similarities are present. Individuals with a strong SOC perceive life as comprehensible, cognitively meaningful, and manageable. Persons with strong SOC are more likely to adapt to demanding situations and are able to cope successfully with strenuous life events. Both SOC and the commitment dimension of hardiness emphasise an ability to feel deeply involved in the aspects of our lives. Furthermore, both SOC and control emphasise personal resources in facing the demands of stressful situations. The most notable difference between SOC and hardiness is the challenge facet, with the former highlighting stability whereas the latter emphasises change. Hardiness and the remaining constructs of locus of control, dispositional optimism, and self-efficacy all emphasize goal-directed behaviour in some form. For instance, in accordance with the theory of dispositional optimism, expectancies of the outcomes to our behaviour are important determinants of whether we respond to adversity by continuing efforts or by disengagement. Holding a positive outlook will lead to continuous effort to obtain a goal, whereas negative expectations towards the future will lead to giving up. Similarly, in Bandura's writings on self-efficacy, our beliefs about our capabilities to execute the courses of actions required to manage prospective situations highly influences the situations we seek out and the goals we set ourselves.

History  = Construction of the Castle = The Satomi clan, virtually independent rulers of all of the B≈çs≈ç Peninsula during the Sengoku period, erected the original ≈åtaki Castle in the early 1500s to guard the northern approaches to their domains, but fell into ruins by the end of the 16th century.

The Satomi were destroyed by the Tokugawa shogunate in 1614, but the Honda continued to rule as daimy≈ç of the 100,000 koku ≈åtaki Domain for the following three generations. Control of ≈åtaki Domain subsequently passed to daimy≈çs from the Abe, Aoyama, and Inagaki clans before being assigned to Matsudaira Masahisa, whose descendants continued to rule from ≈åtaki Castle until the Meiji Restoration. However, during this history, ≈åtaki Domain was reduced from 100,000 koku to 16,000 koku. = Disrepair and Ruin = In December 1672, an application was made to the Tokugawa shogunate for permission to rebuild the castle, stating that there was not even a single functional gate and that the 4-story donjon had fallen into ruins. The reconstructed donjon burned down in 1842 and was not rebuilt. = Reconstruction = The current donjon was reconstructed in 1975 to boost local tourism and to function as an annex to the local Chiba Prefectural Sonan Museum containing historical artifacts including a small collection of Japanese armor and swords. As there are no surviving records indicating the appearance of the original donjon, the current structure is a mock structure modeled after 1832 sketches of its last known appearance. An ≈åtaki Castle Festival is held in late September each year. The main event is a parade of people wearing samurai armor and costumes reflecting the Edo period.

In particular Redegalli is critical of Australian Muslims, of whom he has stated: > \\"it is very difficult for anyone who is Muslim to fit into any society, in > truth, because sooner or later, if there‚Äôs enough people that want to > instigate Islam in its most common form, it naturally then clashes with the > host society, full stop, it‚Äôs been proven through history\\". In September 2010 Redegalli painted a mural on his outer studio wall of a woman in a full-face Muslim covering with a strike symbol over her face and the words Say No To Burqas. The mural, visible from major train lines, has been defaced with paint countless times by protesters. Redegalli has claimed to have the support of the Marrickville community \\"10 to one\\". Community leaders have condemned the mural and former Mayor Sam Iskandar has stated that the mural, \\"goes against the values which the Marrickville community has believed in and practiced for generations\\". In December 2010, members of the far right political group, the Australian Protectionist Party, described in an Australian Newspaper headline as \\"anti Islamist\\", were encouraged to meet at the mural after being contacted by Redegalli. The intention was counteract a planned anti mural protest by persons whom Redegalli labelled as 'socialists' and 'renters'. The resultant protest lead to the arrest of seven anti-mural protesters. A complaint was lodged by a local Muslim woman with the NSW Anti- Discrimination Board claiming that the mural is feeding racist and sexist attitudes. The supporters of the mural have voiced their concerns about security and the rise of Islamic extremism in Australia. In a February 2012 radio interview Redegalli argued that Burqas are dangerous to wear while driving, and allow wearers to conceal their identities. To demonstrate his claims, Redegalli said that he had driven a car in a Burqa, and had gone to inappropriate locations including a female public toilet with other large men, without being challenged. Redegalli was criticized by a caller during the interview, who told Redegalli to \\"get a life\\" and suggested that Redegalli's motivation was less about the burqa and more about putting himself \\"in the spotlight\\". Redegalli reacted by dismissing the criticism as a \\"typical Muslim rant\\". Redegalli and his mural were featured on episode 1 of the ABC television program, Dumb, Drunk and Racist on 20 June 2012. While being interviewed, Redegalli was heckled by a passer-by offended by the artwork. As of September 2016, the mural has been removed from the wall of the building as seen from Google Street View.

Born in Bromley-by-Bow, London, he entered the Society of Mary (Marists), was professed on 29 April 1867, and was later ordained a priest. He became superior of the house of studies founded by the Marists at Paignton in Devon, England. The English-born Marist Francis Redwood (1839-1935), was appointed to be the second Catholic Bishop of Wellington, New Zealand in January 1874. He was consecrated bishop by Henry Edward Cardinal Manning at the Marist parish, St Anne's, Spitalfields, London, on 17 March 1874, and after touring France and Ireland to find funds and personnel, returned in November that year to New Zealand, where he had been raised for part of his childhood, to take up his new appointment. It was a crucial period in the development of the Catholic Church in New Zealand and in 1885 the first plenary council of Australasian bishops recommended the creation of a coordinated ecclesiastical province in New Zealand by the establishing of an archdiocese, of which the remaining New Zealand dioceses would become suffragan sees. The recomnmendation was that Dunedin become the new archdiocese, and that the appointment as archbishop go to a diocesan priest. Rome decided differently and while establishing an ecclesiatical province, centred it upon the city of Wellington, with the existing diocese of Wellington being raised to the rank of an archdiocese and a metropolitan see. The first archbishop was the incumbent Bishop of Wellington, Francis Redwood, appointed by a papal brief dated 13 May 1887.O'Meeghan, p. 101 Simultaneously, from the territory of the diocese of Wellington as hitherto defined there was created a new diocese of Christchurch. Redwood favoured the appointment as its first bishop the English Marist Father John Grimes, and his proposal was accepted by Rome and executed by a papal brief similarly dated 13 May 1887. Like Redwood over a decade earlier, Grimes was consecrated bishop at the Marist parish, St Anne's, Spitalfields, London, on 26 July 1887 by Herbert Vaughan, then Bishop of Salford, assisted by co-consecrators Bishop John Butt, Bishop of Southwark and James Laird Patterson Bishop of Emmaus in partibus and auxiliary bishop of Westminster. Bishop Grimes died in office on 15 March 1915. He was buried in a chapel adjacent to the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament. References * Catholic Hierarchy website, Bishop John Joseph Grimes S.M.

It would be located on the mainstream of the Lower Mekong River. The project is controversial for several reasons, including its possible impact on the fisheries, as well as other ecological and environmental factors. History In 2007, the Russian company Bureyagesstroy got a license to conduct a feasibility study on a dam. The feasibility study was carried out and the company asked permission to build the hydroelectric power station. However, on December 9, 2009, a memorandum of understanding was signed between the Cambodian Government and the Vietnam Industrial and Urban Area Investment Development Corp (IDICO) to conduct a new feasibility study on the dam. The results of this survey have not been released. In March 2020, due to ecological concerns, the Cambodian government halted all hydroelectric developments on the Mekong River until 2030, pushing back the Stung Treng dam project along with its neighbor the Sambor dam project. Description The Stung Treng Dam would be an earth core rockfill gravity dam. If completed, the dam's crest would be long and high. Its rated head would be . It would have an installed capacity of 980 MW, and would, on average, generate 4,870 GWh per year. The dam's reservoir, which would extend well beyond the mainstream canal, would have an active storage of , and would inundate an area of . The reservoir would be long. Impact Multiple independent agencies, including International Rivers, the Save the Mekong campaign and other have all raised concerns about the dam's construction. In addition, Cambodia is a member of the Mekong River Commission, which requires prior notification of hydropower construction on the river's mainstream ‚Äì i.e. plans for the Stung Treng will be subject to scrutiny by Laos, Thailand and Vietnam. A report authorized by the Mekong River Commission and released in January 2010 recommended that the Stung Treng along with the Sambor Dam be delayed for 10 years. The dam site lies within the Stung Treng Ramsar Site, which effectively obliges the Royal Cambodian Government to ‚Äòactively support' the three 'pillars' of the Ramsar Convention: * ensuring the conservation and wise use of wetlands it has designated as Wetlands of International Importance, * including as far as possible the wise use of all wetlands in national environmental planning, * consulting with other Parties about implementation of the Convention, especially in regard to transboundary wetlands, shared water systems, and shared species. It is expected that fish migration routes (which support the world's largest inland fishery on the Tonl√© Sap) will be essentially wholly impeded. The two proposed dams of the Sambor and the Stung Treng would have the Mekong river basin's highest sediment trapping efficiencies of all the Lower Mekong Basin's proposed mainstream projects, destabilising downstream channels between Krati√© and Phnom Penh and reducing overbank siltation in the Cambodian floodplain. If built, an estimated 21 villages with 2,059 households and 10,617 people will be displaced with the construction of the dam. Additional resources *Halls, A.S. and Kshatriya, M. 2009.

He is better known for his service in Sicily during the Gothic War.Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), p. 413  Name  Primary sources are inconsistent in the rendering of his name. The spelling \\"Domnentiolus\\" derives from Procopius. Menander Protector names him \\"Domenentiolus\\" (). John Malalas reports him as \\"Dometiolus\\", Theophanes the Confessor as \\"Domentziolus\\". Zacharias Rhetor names him \\"Domitziolus\\". A fragment of Theophanes of Byzantium, preserved by Patriarch Photios, calls him \\"Comentiolus\\".  Biography  Domnentiolus was born to an unnamed sister of Bouzes. The relation is reported by both Zacharias Rhetor and Procopius. His other maternal uncles included Coutzes and Venilus. His maternal grandfather was probably the general and rebel Vitalian.Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), p. 366 Domnentiolus is first mentioned in April, 531, at about the time of the Battle of Callinicum. The Iberian War was still ongoing. His uncle Bouzes was stationed at Amida, an illness preventing him from campaigning. He tasked Domnentiolus with leading an army to Abhgarsat. This location is only mentioned once by Zacharias. The Byzantine forces faced the Sassanid army and were defeated. Domnentiolus himself was captured by his enemies and transported to the interior of the Sassanid Empire. In 532, the Eternal Peace was concluded between the two powers. Domnentiolus was released \\"in an exchange of prisoners\\". He resurfaces in 543 as one of the commanders of the Byzantine army in Lazic War. Domnentiolus, Justus, Peranius, John, son of Nicetas and John the Glutton led their combined forces to Phison, near Martyropolis, and from there to the Persian border. Procopius reports: \\"And Justus, the emperor's nephew, and Peranius and John, the son of Nicetas, together with Domentiolus and John, who was called the Glutton, made camp near the place called Phison, which is close by the boundaries of Martyropolis. Thus then were encamped the Roman commanders with their troops; and the whole army amounted to thirty thousand men. Now all these troops were neither gathered into one place, nor indeed was there any general meeting for conference. But the generals sent to each other some of their followers and began to make enquiries concerning the invasion.\\" Procopius, History of the Wars, Book II, Chapter 24 Other Byzantine generals led an invasion into the Sassanid Empire from another location. Procopius continues: \\"Suddenly, however, Peter, without communicating with anyone, and without any careful consideration, invaded the hostile land with his troops. And when on the following day this was found out by Philemouth and Beros, the leaders of the Eruli, they straightway followed. And when this in turn came to the knowledge of Martin and Valerian and their men, they quickly joined in the invasion.\\" However, Justus decided against joining the others. Procopius reports on the movements of Justus, Domnentiolus and the others \\"And all of them a little later united with each other in the enemy's territory, with the exception of Justus and his men, who, as I have said, had encamped far away from the rest of the army, and learned later of their invasion; then, indeed, they also invaded the territory of the enemy as quickly as possible at the point where they were, but failed altogether to unite with the other commanders. As for the others, they proceeded in a body straight for Doubios, neither plundering nor damaging in any other way the land of the Persians.\\" Justus, Domnentiolus and the others led their forces to Taraunitis (Taron). They raided the area and then retreated. Procopius reports: \\"As for the forces of Justus and Peranius, they invaded the country about Taraunon, and after gathering some little plunder, immediately returned.\\" Procopius, History of the Wars, Book II, Chapter 25 Domnentiolus is next mentioned in 550, during the Gothic War. He was at the time the military commander of Messana in Sicily. When Totila led the Ostrogoths in an invasion of Sicily, Messana came under attack. Domnentiolus led his forces in meeting the enemy outside the walls of the city. He defeated them on the battlefield and stopped their advance. But then retreated within the walls of Messana and concentrated on the defense of the city. Procopius notes that the countryside was left unprotected. This is the last chronological mention of Domnentiolus.

It is a limited-production version of the Chevrolet Vega, with higher performance. Chevrolet developed the car's all-aluminum inline-four engine, and British company Cosworth Engineering designed the DOHC cylinder head. 5,000 engines were built. 3,508 cars were made. They were priced nearly double that of a base Vega and only $900 below the 1975 Chevrolet Corvette.Collectable Automobile-April 2000. Chevrolet's Vega History =Racing origin= Known at Cosworth Engineering as Project EA, a Cosworth racing engine based on the Vega aluminum block produced a reported and powered Chevron and Lola race cars to wins in the 2-liter class in their first outings. The ZO9 Cosworth Vega engine is a de- tuned version. Bore, stroke and valve sizes are identical but it lacks the EA engine‚Äôs dry sump lubricating system (unnecessary in a street use car), has a lower compression ratio and different valve timing, and uses Bendix electronic fuel injection instead of Lucas mechanical injection to cope with a wider range of operating conditions as well as emission controls.Road Test, December 1973 =Development= In March, 1970 John DeLorean, GM‚Äôs general manager and vice-president, sent engine designer Calvin Wade to England in search of cylinder head technology to improve the Vega's performance. Fuel injection would be needed to control emissions without power loss; also stronger internal parts to work with the existing block and the Cosworth head. That summer, DeLorean authorized Wade to build a prototype Cosworth Vega engine. A meager budget, and resistance from managers between Wade and DeLorean, meant low priority for the project, but once approved by DeLorean it could not be killed. In June, 1971 the prototype gave on dual Holley-Weber two-barrel carburetors. At Easter, 1972 GM President Edward Cole drove three Vegas for comparison: a base model, an all-aluminum small-block V8-powered prototype, and the Cosworth. He pledged approval from the Engineering Policy Group for DeLorean's request to initiate Cosworth production. Approval of development aimed at U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) certification soon followed, and Wade began a 12-car development program to accumulate test mileage in a range of environments including high altitude, heat and cold, to test the engine‚Äôs eligibility. At the GM desert proving ground, the car reached . In April, 1973 the design was frozen and two cars were built to accumulate mileage for EPA emission certification. The press was notified of the program and in August 1973 a Car and Driver feature alerted the public to an upcoming Cosworth Vega. The engine needed more dynamometer time, new cam profiles to trade some high-end power for more low-end torque, and a tubular header to replace the cast iron exhaust manifold. Although delayed, the project now received higher priority, more engineering manpower and more funding. Chevrolet dealers began accepting large deposits for early delivery. The design was frozen again in January, 1974. A stainless steel header was specified, to increase power between 2,000 rpm up and the 7,000 rpm redline. Camshaft lift and duration were eased back and the torque curve reshaped to a street-oriented peak of 5,200 rpm. Project coordinator William Large built two cars for durability testing. By April 1974, the engines ran ‚Äúclean‚Äù for , after which hydrocarbon curves on the first car rose far in excess of the permitted , owing to burned exhaust valves. For certification, five months‚Äô durability miles would have to be reaccumulated. Development resumed, to improve emissions durability and ready the engine for more stringent 1975 standards. The fuel injection was redesigned for better air distribution. High-energy electronic ignition and mandatory catalytic converter were added; also a Pulse Air system, functionally the same as an air pump but without the pump's six-horsepower loss. A larger catalytic converter further guarded against power loss. More advanced ignition timing, and the lead-free fuel required with the converter, prevented exhaust-valve failure. Chevrolet required all engines to survive 200 hours at full load. The Cosworth lasted over 500 hours. For a clutch burst test, Cale Wade revved the engine to 9,400 rpm under its own power without damage to clutch or engine. Three cars, in three different configurations, resumed mileage accumulation in September 1974. By January, 1975 the mileage was completed with no failures. One configuration stayed within 1975 California limits, making the Cosworth Vega the only GM car certified for all 50 states. On March 14, 1975 the EPA emissions certificate was issued, allowing sale of 1975 models. Production began immediately to fill the order backlog. 30 engines per day were hand- built -- two- and three-worker teams to each engine -- in the Tonawanda, New York engine plant's \\"clean room\\", originally devised for the ZL-1 all-aluminum V8. At the Vega's Lordstown assembly plant, Cosworth production was 1.6 cars per hour.Car and Driver.

Overview and changes 1975 Cosworth Vega All 2,061 1975 Cosworth Vegas were finished in black acrylic lacquer with gold \\"Cosworth Twin Cam\\" lettering on the front fenders and rear cove panel and gold pinstriping on hood bulge, body sides, wheel openings, and rear cove. (Black was unavailable on other Vegas until mid-1976.) Most have black interiors. The custom interior with perforated vinyl seat trim (RPO ZJ1) was standard, with black cloth seat inserts a $50 option. About 16 percent had white vinyl interiors. All Cosworths had a gold-colored engine-turned dash bezel, gold- plated dash plaque with build sequence number, 8,000 rpm tachometer, and Cosworth Twin-Cam Vega steering wheel emblem. 'Torque arm' rear suspension is like that of the Monza 2+2, and the axle, from the Monza 2+2, gives a 3.73:1 ratio from a ring gear. A limited slip differential was optional. Included were GT springs, shocks, and stabilizer bars (larger at the rear than the Vega GT's); exclusive BR70-13 BSW radial tires on British-made 6 inch, gold-painted cast aluminum wheels with Chevy center caps; black-finished wiper arms, H.D. radiator and provisions for ‚ÄúFast Steer‚Äù option. The Cosworth was the first Chevrolet passenger car with electronic fuel injection.GM Heritage Center, Generations of GM History Air conditioning, power steering and power brakes were not offered.1975 Chevrolet Cosworth Vega Service and Overhaul Manual Supplement A pilot line 1976 model was built in September 1975, and volume 1976 production began in December 1975. A 1976 facelift included wider grill, tri-color tail lamps and extensive body anti-rust improvements. A new Borg- Warner five-speed manual overdrive transmission with 4.10 axle was optional. The exhaust system had a single tailpipe instead of 1975‚Äôs dual outlets. Seat trim changed to grained vinyl, and the optional extra-charge cloth trim seat inserts were changed to a \\"houndstooth\\" type named sport-cloth. In January, a \\"Sky-Roof\\" with tinted reflectorized sliding glass and 8-track tape player options were introduced. In February, eight 1976 Vega exterior colors were added: Antique White, Dark Blue Metallic, Firethorn Metallic, Mahogany Metallic, Dark Green Metallic, Buckskin, Medium Saddle Metallic, and Medium Orange; plus two additional interior colors, Firethorn and Buckskin. 1,447 1976 models were built. In November 1975, it had been decided to discontinue the car after the 1976 model year. Total production of 3,508 cars ended in July 1976 with a Medium Saddle Metallic model delivered to a Cleveland, Ohio dealer. 190,321 Vega hatchback coupes were produced in the same period. Engine Cosworth Twin-Cam 16-valve 122 cu in (2.0 L) EFI I-4, 110 hp The Cosworth Vega Twin-Cam engine is a inline-four with die-cast aluminum alloy cylinder block and Type 356 aluminum alloy, 16-valve cylinder head with double overhead camshafts (DOHC) held in a removable cam-carrier that doubles as a guide for the valve lifters. Each camshaft has five bearings and is turned by individual cam gears on the front end. The camshafts, water pump and fan are driven by a fiberglass cord- reinforced neoprene rubber belt, much like the Vega engine. The cylinder head has sintered iron valve seats and cast iron valve seats. Race-bred forged aluminum pistons with heat-treated forged steel crankshaft and connecting rods enhance durability.Chevrolet 1975 Cosworth Vega Service and Overhaul supplement-General information The engine has a stainless steel exhaust header and Bendix electronic fuel injection (EFI), with four injector valves, an electronic control unit (ECU), five independent sensors and two fuel pumps. Some lighter than the SOHC Vega engine, it develops maximum power at 5,600 rpm and is redlined at 6,500 rpm, whereas the SOHC Vega engine peaks at 4,400 rpm and runs to 5,000 rpm. Final ratings are at 5,600 rpm, of torque at 4,800 rpm.Road & Track-March 1975. Chevrolet Cosworth Vega 3,508 of the 5,000 engines were used. GM disassembled about 500 and scrapped the remainder.Cosworth Vega Owners Association Reviews Car and Driver said in August 1973: \\"Cosworth Vega 16-Valve. More than an engine. A taut-muscled GT coupe to devastate the smugness of BMW 2002tii's and 5-speed Alfa GTV's. A limited run of 4000 machines, each one built away from the tumult of the assembly line to precision tolerances, as a show of technical force by Chevrolet. All of them will be collector's items.\\" The magazine's History of 0-60 article said a 1974 pre-production Cosworth Vega's time of 7.7 seconds was the fastest that year. Testing a 1975 model, the magazine said: \\"The outstanding feature of the Cosworth Vega is its excellent balance. Roll- stiffness distribution is ideal, with little understeer entering a turn, and just the right amount of drift from the tail as you put your foot down to exit . . . Through the woods or down a mountain, the Cosworth is a feisty aggressor willing, if not altogether able to take on the world's best GT cars.\\" Motor Trend magazine's test of a 1975 version said it \\"goes like the proverbial bat out of Carlsburg Caverns [...] At moderate speeds, the car is as close to neutral handling as any American car I have ever driven...\\" 1976 Cosworth Vega The Road & Track test of a 1976 model said: \\"The Cosworth Vega's handling is very good [...] All the drivers agreed that it is a far better handling car than those Vega derivatives such as the Monza that have been fitted out with V6 or V8 engines [...] We can't resist saying that with the Cosworth Vega engine, the Vega now runs the way it should have run all the time‚Äîeasy, smooth, good response, good handling: a nice balance between performance and economy. Sweet as it is however, the Cosworth Vega is still way down the excitement ladder from what it would be with another 30 or 40 bhp. Then it would really be something.\\" Road Test magazine, in its 1976 \\"Supercoupe Shootout\\"--Alfa vs. Mazda vs. Lancia vs. Saab vs. Cosworth Vega--said: \\"The results are in Figure 2. Read 'em and weep, all you foreign-is-better nuts, because right there at the top, and by a long way at that, is the Cosworth Vega. It had the fastest 0-60 time, the fastest quarter-mile time, and tied with the Saab for the shortest braking distance\\".The Great Supercoupe Shootout - Alfa Romeo Alfetta GT, Mazda Cosmo, Lancia Beta Coupe, Saab EMS, Cosworth Vega - Road Test magazine, October 1976\\"The Cosworth is American, and a collector's item, and it came close, damn close to winning the whole thing.\\"The Grand Finale.

Construction of the dam was completed in 1963, and its reservoir has suffered from very high levels of sedimentation resulting from erosion within its catchment area. Its function is mainly irrigation water supply, although it generates electricity as well. Siltation The land is tilled after harvesting and has become sensitive to sheet erosion. The area suffers periodically from floods and droughts. Increased erosion since forest clearance has led to the increase of sediment load in rivers draining into the reservoir. As a result, sediment deposition in the dam gradually decreased the water storage capacity from 150 million m3 in 1970 to 121 and 108 million m3 in 1983 and 1991 respectively. The suspended sediments in the water bodies also affect water quality and cause pollution because of various agrochemicals adsorbed by the sediments into the catchments. The sedimentation rates decreased gradually from the upstream to the crest of the dam. The high sedimentation rate may be due to the inflow from the tributary as well as eroded materials that come from the upland area to the dam.

The dam was originally constructed in 1974 for the purposes of irrigation and water supply but after 2002, its water storage also serves as the lower reservoir for the Lam Takhong pumped storage power plant, Thailand's first power plant of that type. Background Construction on the Lam Takhong Dam began in 1969 and was completed in 1974, while the pumped storage project was initially proposed in 1975. From 1989-1991, the Japan International Cooperation Agency funded a feasibility study. Khon Kaen University conducted an environmental impact assessment beginning in 1991 and by 1994, the project was approved for construction. The project was to be constructed in two 500 MW phases. The first phase began in December 1995 and was completed in 2001, with the first two 250 MW generators operational in August 2002. After the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Phase 2 never began. The power plant and its components were constructed underground to preserve the nature and scenery of the area. During construction, various complaints were raised about the blasting of the upper reservoir. The dust from blasting reportedly had negative effects on locals and their farms. Design and operation Lam Takhong Reservoir as seen from an express train on the northern shore The Lam Takhong Dam is a long and high earth-fill embankment dam. It creates a reservoir with a capacity of . The upper reservoir is located southwest of the main dam on top of a hill. The upper reservoir is created by an asphalt lining long and high. It has a capacity of and surface area of . The power station is a pumped-storage type and contains two 250 MW reversible pump-generators. Water is a first pumped to the upper reservoir and then during peak-demand hours, it is sent back down to the power station for power production. This process repeats itself. The power station is connected to the upper reservoir via two long, diameter penstocks. Water returning from the power station does so via two long, diameter tailrace tunnels. In September 2014, EGAT awarded a US$64.3 million contract to Voith Hydro to supply eletromechanical equipment for the expansion of the facility. The expansion will more than double Lam Takhong's current output capacity. When complete, total capacity of the pumped storage plant will be 1,000 MW‚Äî500 MW from two units installed in Phase 1 and 500 MW from two units installed in Phase 2. The expansion is expected to be completed in 2018.

Ordinarily, a contractual offer can be deemed to be accepted when it leaves the offeree and enters the postal system. In this case, the original offer clearly stipulated the method by which acceptance was to take place, and this superseded the normal operation of postal rule. Facts The defendant, Dr Hughes, had granted a call option with respect to his property at 571 High Road, Wembley to the claimants, Holwell Securities Ltd, giving the claimants the irrevocable right to purchase the property during the option period for the specified sum. It contained a clause stipulating that there must be notice (here, receipt of the offer) in writing within six months in order to exercise the option. The claimants sent a letter purporting to exercise the option. It was lost in the mail and was never received by the defendant. The defendant then refused to complete upon the purchase and the claimants sought specific performance. Judgment At first instance the claim was dismissed by Templeman J (reported at [1971] 1 WLR 757). On appeal it was held, dismissing the appeal, that the postal acceptance rule does not apply in every case, even if the parties involved consider the post to be an acceptable means of communication. Russell LJ applied the case of Hare v Nicholl [1966] 2 QB 130, and asserted on that authority that options represent a special case, and that the grantee (here, the plaintiff) must comply strictly with the conditions stipulated for exercise by the offeror (the defendant in this case). As this had not happened, the claim failed. He then went on to consider the position in relation to the postal rule generally (which he referred to as \\"the roundabout path to the same result\\"). In relation to this he concluded based upon earlier authorities that although the postal acceptance rule was a rule of general application, it did not apply when there are express terms in the offer which exclude, and this includes excluding it by implication where the offer specifies that acceptance must reach the offeror. The Court also suggested obiter dictum that the rule ought not to apply in cases where its application would produce manifest inconvenience and absurdity. More broadly, the Court states that the rule does not apply if when looking at all the circumstances, it is apparent that the parties could not have intended a binding agreement until notice of acceptance was communicated to the offeror. Russell LJ added that although the parties had had a telephone conversation, this did not constitute the requisite notice of acceptance as laid out in the offer. Lawton LJ gave a concurring judgment. Significance This case sets a precedent for overriding the postal rule.

The town of Moreh in particular has an estimated 17,000 Tamils. Tamils in Manipur have relatives and business contacts in Myanmar, which is a valuable network facilitating cross-border trade. History Tamils from Burma came back to India when General Ne Win nationalized banks, shops, and factories. Some of them found life in refugee camps in Tamil Nadu very hard, so they decided to return to Burma through land. They were stopped by Burmese immigration at the border town of Moreh and settled there as a result. Around 1992, there was clashes between the Tamil and Kuki communities due to attempts by Kuki militants to impose heavy taxes on Tamil businesses. Very recently, the Tamil community has been involved in a legal battle to prevent the Manipur government from giving up land occupied by Sri Angala Parameshwari Sri Muneeswarar temple to Myanmar. One of the gates of this temple is in Burmese territory. Religion Other than the Sri Angala Parameshwari Sri Muneeswarar temple mentioned, the Tamil Hindu temples in Moreh are Sree Veeramma Kali Temple, Sree Badrakaali Temple, and the Sree Periyapalayathamman temple. There is also a Tamil mosque, known as the Tamir-E-Millath Jamia Masjid, and a Tamil Catholic church, the St. George Church, in Moreh. The Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham has been involved in spiritual activities in Manipur. Entertainment Over the past several years, Tamil films have become slowly popular in Manipur partly due to a ban on Hindi language entertainment by militant groups such as the People's Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak (PREPAK).

It was the first hydroelectric power project developed in Thailand's northeastern area of Isan. The dam impounds the Nam Phong, which flows into the Chi River and thence to the Mun River, a tributary of the Mekong River. The dam was given its current name by royal permission in 1966, in honour of princess Ubol Ratana, the eldest child of King Bhumibol Adulyadej. Description The reservoir inside Nam Phong National Park The dam is multi-purpose: electricity generation, irrigation, flood control, transportation, fisheries, and as tourist attraction. It is an earth core rockfill dam, constructed in 1964. Its crest length is , and high. Its catchment area is . Its reservoir has a maximum storage capacity of . The dam is managed by the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT). Thirty thousand people were resettled to make way for the large reservoir accompanying the dam. This resettlement resulted in a sharp decrease in forested areas in the catchment areas and an increase in erosion. In 1984, the dam was modified to reinforce dam safety and to ensure better flood protection. Power plant The power plant at the dam has three turbines, each with an installed capacity of . The dam generates an average of a year. The operation of the turbines commenced on 4 February 1966, 14 March 1969, and 12 June 1968 respectively. History In April 2016 the dam ran dry for the first time since its construction. With no usable storage it cannot provide irrigation water, cannot generate electricity, and its fish population is dying. Its usable storage stands at minus 3.95 percent (as of (2016-04-04). Ubol Ratana Dam is the first of the royal dams to run dry. The other royal dams are: *Bhumibol Dam: opened in 1964 in the north on the Ping River. Capacity: 13,462,000,000 m3. *Sirindhorn Dam: opened in 1971 in the northeast on the Lam Dom Noi River. Capacity: 1,966,000,000 m3 *Chulabhorn Dam: opened in 1972 in the northeast on the Phrong River. Capacity: 165,000,000 m3 *Sirikit Dam: opened in 1974 in the north on the Nan River. Capacity: 9,510,000,000 m3 *Srinagarind Dam: opened in 1980 in the west on the Khwae Yai River. Capacity: 17,745,000,000 m3 *Vajiralongkorn Dam: opened in 1984 in the west on the Khwae Noi River. Capacity: 8,100,000 m3 Due to the ongoing drought, the royal dams are heavily stressed. According to the Hydro and Agro Informatics Institute, as of 3 April 2016, sixteen Thai dams are at critically low levels of usable reservoir storage. Of the other royal dams, Bhumibol Dam is at four percent, Sirindhorn Dam is at 10 percent, Srinagarind Dam is at 11 percent, Sirikit Dam is at 12 percent, Chulabhorn Dam is at 13 percent, and Vajiralongkorn Dam is at 14 percent.

Orders for the formation of the force were issued on 20 November 1915, under Major-General Alexander Wallace, C.B. The force concentrated at Mersa Matruh on the coast and began operations against the Senussi in late 1915. Organisational history In January 1916, during the Band of Oases campaign, a Southern Force was formed under Major-General William Peyton, who replaced Wallace two weeks later and then the force was taken over by Major-General J. Adye. On 31 March, the Southern Force merged with the Western Force that was then divided into a North-West Section and a South-West Section and Adye was made Adjutant-General of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF). Peyton was appointed to the command of the Western Frontier Force (WFF) but was reappointed while in England. On 11 May, Lieutenant-General Sir Bryan Mahon took over but got sunstroke and was invalided. Major-General Alister Dallas, in temporary command during Peyton's absence, resumed temporary command until 20 June, when Major-General Sir Charles Macpherson Dobell took up the appointment. The North-West and South- West sections were abolished and a Coastal Section formed. On 4 October, Major-General W. A. Watson took over from Dobell, who was sent to command the Eastern Force (EF) in Sinai. On 5 March 1917, the quiet on the frontier led to the WFF being amalgamated with the Delta Command (Brigadier-General H. G. Casson), comprising a Coastal and a Southern section.

Based in Belgium, it coordinates activities in the fields of trade, debt, foreign investment, human rights, governance and conflict resolution. LDC Watch undertakes lobbying, networking and advocacy with LDC governments and development agencies. Its aim is to implement a programme of action formulated at a UN Conference in Brussels in 2001, with the participation of civil society. History LDC Watch evolved out of the parallel NGO Forum at the Third UN Conference on the LDCs (UN LDC III) in Brussels in 2001 which adopted the Brussels Programme of Action (BPoA)Brussels Programme of Action: Addressing the needs of the Least Developed Countries. UN-OHRLLS ‚Äì United Nations Office of the High Representative for Least Developed Countries. United Nations, New York, 2006. for the LDCs for the Decade 2001‚Äì2010 (BPoA). The BPoA, based on 7 mutual commitments of the LDCs and their development partners, contains 30 international development goals, including those in the Millennium Declaration. The Fourth UN Conference on LDCs (LDC IV) in Turkey in 2011 was to assess the implementation of the BPoA, and marked the first decade of LDC Watch. Functions LDC Watch acts as a coordinating body for civil society in LDCs to advocate, campaign and network for the realization of the LDC Programme of Action (currently the BPoA) and other Internationally Agreed Development Goals (IADGs). It goes beyond the BPoA to address poverty, hunger, social injustices and human rights in the LDCs. LDC Watch, therefore, has been articulating civil society perspectives, engaging with the UN, LDC governments and their development partners, both as a partner and as a pressure group. Major activities LDC Watch has been engaging in the following activities in the past decade: * Increase awareness on the BPoA including all other IADGs amongst the general public, CSOs and governments in LDCs, development partner governments and agencies, and relevant multi-lateral institutions. * Promote increased attention and delivery of the specific requirements of the LDCs in global development processes. * Enhance the awareness and capacity of LDC CSOs to effectively advocate, lobby, campaign and network for the implementation of the BPoA including all other IADGs. * Engage with the UN, LDC governments, development partner governments and agencies, relevant multi-lateral institutions, political parties including parliamentarians, media and civil society on LDC- related issues and concerns. * Organize multi-stakeholder consultations in the LDCs aiming to assess the implementation of the BPoA and other IADGs in national development contexts and processes. * Organize national, regional and global CSO consultations for discussion and strategy-building aiming to develop enhanced LDC-oriented global development processes, by promoting a pro-poor development agenda in favour of the vulnerable and marginalized in the LDCs. * Organize parliamentary hearings on the issues and concerns of the LDCs both with national governments as well as development partner governments. * Build up a CSO network, both as partner and pressure group, to seek the political will of all stakeholders for the implementation of global development commitments. * Research on pro-poor agendas with focus on the key issues of debt, trade, food sovereignty, livelihoods, governance, aid and gender justice, and produce reports reflecting civil society perspectives on the implementation of the IADGs. * Mobilize political will of all development stakeholders towards building a pro-poor, next Programme of Action for LDCs at the LDC IV in Turkey in 2011. * Co-ordinate the civil society process towards the LDC IV that will culminate with the organisation of the Civil Society Forum to be held in parallel with it in Turkey in 2011. BPoA and UN LDC-IV The BPoA regards its success as dependent on effective follow-up, implementation, monitoring and review at the national, regional and global levels. In its resolution 63/227 of 2008, the UN General Assembly decided to convene the LDC IV that will assess the implementation of the BPoA, reaffirm the global commitment for LDCs and subsequently adopt the next-generation Programme of Action for LDCs. Preparations for LDC IV are underway at national, regional and global levels with a calendar of pre-conference events and two inter-governmental preparatory committee meetings that will be held ahead of the conference in 2011. The preparatory process and the conference itself will consist of an inter-governmental track, parliamentary track, international organisations track, civil society track and a private sector track. In the context of the civil society track, on 19‚Äì20 October 2010 at the UN Headquarters, the international steering committee of the civil society process was officially launched by Cheick Sidi Diarra, Under-Secretary-General and High Representative of UN-OHRLLS, and the Secretary-General of UN LDC IV. LDC Watch, entrusted by UN-OHRLLS with globally coordinating the civil society preparations towards and at the LDC IV, will be leading the Civil Society Steering Committee to Istanbul. The civil society process will culminate at the Civil Society Forum to be held in parallel with LDC IV in Turkey in 2011. Steering committee LDC Watch is managed by a steering committee comprising members from LDC CSOs in Nepal, Cambodia, Senegal, Ethiopia, and Belgium, representing development partner country CSOs. The alliance is coordinated by an international secretariat with support from the European Co-ordination Office and three regional focal points. The international secretariat is hosted by Rural Reconstruction Nepal (RRN) in Kathmandu, Nepal while the European Co-ordination Office is housed in Eurostep in Brussels, Belgium.

Genesis narrative  The story of Lot's wife begins in after two angels arrived in Sodom at eventide and were invited to spend the night at Lot's home. The men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and prompted Lot to offer up these men/angels; instead, Lot offered up his two daughters but they refused. As dawn was breaking, Lot's visiting angels urged him to get his family and flee, so as to avoid being caught in the impending disaster for the iniquity of the city. The command was given, \\"Flee for your life! Do not look behind you, nor stop anywhere in the Plain; flee to the hills, lest you be swept away.\\" While fleeing, Lot's wife turned to look back, and was turned into a pillar of salt. Composition The Hebrew verb used for Lot's wife \\"looking\\" back is , tƒÅ·∏áe·π≠. Her looking back at Sodom differs in word usage from Abraham \\"looking\\" , ≈°ƒÅqap toward Sodom in (18:16). Pillar of salt The Sodom and Gomorrah motif from the Nuremberg Chronicle by Hartmann Schedel, 1493. Lot's wife has already transformed into a salt pillar, in the center. The story appears to be based in part on a folk legend explaining a geographic feature. A pillar of salt named \\"Lot's wife\\" is located near the Dead Sea at Mount Sodom in Israel. The Mishnah states that a blessing should be said at the place where the pillar of salt is. (Talmud B. Ber. 54a) The term \\"Lots's wife\\" for such geographical features subsequently entered common parlance, as one of the outcrops comprising Long Ya Men was also nicknamed thus. The Jewish historian Josephus claimed to have seen the pillar of salt which was Lot's wife.Josephus. Antiquities of the Jews. Book I. Chapter 11. Verse 4. Its existence is also attested to by the early church fathers Clement of Rome and Irenaeus.Josephus. Antiquities of the Jews. Book I. Endnote Number 23 Jewish commentaries In Judaism, one common view of Lot's wife turning to salt was as punishment for disobeying the angels' warning. By looking back at the \\"evil cities,\\" she betrayed her secret longing for that way of life. She was deemed unworthy to be saved and thus was turned to a pillar of salt. Another view in the Jewish exegesis of Genesis 19:26, is that when Lot's wife looked back, she turned to a pillar of salt upon the \\"sight of God,\\" who was descending down to rain destruction upon Sodom and Gomorrah. One reason that is given in the tradition is that she turned back to look in order to see if her daughters, who were married to men of Sodom, were coming or not. Another Jewish legend says that because Lot's wife sinned with salt, she was punished with salt. On the night the two angels visited Lot, he requested that his wife prepare a feast for them. Not having any salt, Lot's wife asked her neighbors for salt, which alerted them to the presence of their guests, resulting in the mob action that endangered Lot's family. In the Midrash, Lot's wife's name is given as Edith. Islamic view Lut fleeing the city with his daughters; his wife is killed by a rock. Lut () in the Quran is considered to be the same as Lot in the Hebrew Bible. He is considered to be a messenger of God and a prophet of God. In Islamic tradition, Lot (Lut, ) lived in Ur and was a nephew of Ibrahim (Abraham). He migrated with Ibrahim to Canaan and was commissioned as a prophet to the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. Quote: Lut was a nephew of the Prophet Ibrahim. He migrated with Ibrahim from Iraq to Canaan in Palestine. He was commissioned as a prophet to the cities of Sodom and Gomarrah, situated to the east of the Dead Sea. The people of these cities were guilty of unspeakable crimes. They were addicted to homosexuality and highway robberies. Lut warned the people but they refused to listen to him. He prayed to Allah to punish the people. Lut left the city with his followers at night. As soon as he left, Allah raised a [shower of brim stones?]-end quote, text garbled. He was commanded by Allah to go to the land of Sodom and Gomorrah to preach monotheism and to stop them from their lustful and violent acts. Lut's messages were ignored by the inhabitants, prompting Sodom and Gomorrah's destruction. Though Lut left the city, his wife looked behind and was destroyed. In the Quran, surah (chapter) 26 Ash-Shu'ara (The Poets) ‚Äì Other biblical references Lot's wife is referred to in and mentioned by Jesus at in the context of warning his disciples about difficult times in the future when the Son of Man would return; he told them to remember Lot's wife as a warning to not waver at that time. Popular culture Lot's wife the subject of the poem \\"Lot's Wife\\" by Anna Akhmatova, which offers a more sympathetic view of Lot's wife's choice to look back. Lot's wife is mentioned in the opening chapter of Slaughter House Five by Kurt Vonnegut. Vonnegut also offers a sympathetic view and compares her looking back at Sodom, to him recalling the fire bombing of Dresden.Slaughter House 5 Gallery File:SaltPillarDeadSea.jpgA rock formation near the Sanctuary of Agios Lot venerated as Lot's wife as a pillar of salt File:MountSodom061607.jpg\\"Lot's Wife\\" pillar, Mount Sodom, Israel.

Retrieved March 10, 2011. The film was nominated for the Independent Spirit John Cassavetes Award for best feature film made for under $500,000. Plot Woodrow and Aiden migrate to Los Angeles from Wisconsin, constructing weapons and testing them out in empty lots. At a bar that hosts live acts, Woodrow volunteers to enter a cricket eating contest and meets Milly, who beats him in the contest. They exchange phone numbers, while Aiden talks to Milly's friend, Courtney. Woodrow and Milly decide they'll drive to Texas to eat at the scariest place Woodrow can think of. Woodrow gets in a fight with a local who disrespects Milly, is made sick by the day-old meatloaf, and trades his car for a motorcycle. Returning to California, Woodrow and Milly begin dating each other, despite Milly's ambiguously hostile roommate Mike. Woodrow finds Aiden has completed the flamethrower, and they successfully test it out. Aiden is impressed with the motorcycle, which is the second part of their three pronged plan to create a Medusa Gang which will reign over their imagined vision of an apocalyptic future, and now they only lack a flame blowing muscle car. Tensions between friends rise, when Woodrow and Milly spend more time together than they do with their best friends. Woodrow becomes more controlling and jealous of Milly, who is annoyed by his behavior. He returns home early to find Milly having sex with Mike. Woodrow and Mike scuffle, then Woodrow drives away on his motorcycle and is hit by a car, leaving him with serious injuries. When Aiden picks him up from the hospital, he's utterly despondent and blames Milly. Woodrow lies in bed for days and when Courtney drops in , they have sex despite that Aiden is interested in Courtney. Aiden purchases a 1972 Buick Skylark and works on turning it into the fire blowing Medusa, while Woodrow continues to have sex with Courtney. Mike comes to Woodrow's to retrieve Milly's personal items, but Aiden intercepts him and tells him not to come around again or he'll kill him. Woodrow takes Milly's personal items, puts them in a box, walks them over to her apartment court with his flame thrower strapped to his back, and lights them on fire in front of her door. This inspires Mike to seek revenge, and he finds the Medusa muscle car in front of Woodrow's house and breaks a window with a baseball bat. Aiden stops him from creating further damage by wrestling the bat from him, and when Mike tries to get the bat back Aiden strikes him in the head. When Mike stops moving, Aiden runs. Milly finds out what's happened and ambushes Woodrow, knocking him unconscious, and she and an unknown man tattoo Woodrow's cheeks, chin and upper-lip. Courtney confronts Milly about what she did to Woodrow and they fight, with Milly pulling a knife on her former best friend and forcing her to leave. When Woodrow wakes up and sees himself in the mirror he flies into a rage, tracks Milly down and has a screaming confrontation with her. When he tells her that he's been thinking of doing some \\"sick shit\\" to her all morning, she replies that she doesn't care and submits to his anger. This results in sex that turns increasingly violent, ending with Milly screaming out in pain. As Woodrow leaves Milly's house his shirt and hands are covered in blood, and he encounters Courtney in the street. She has a pistol and shoots herself in the head when he won't talk to her. The film then back- tracks to when Woodrow has put Milly's things in a box, and gives an alternate series of events, much less apocalyptic, where Woodrow and Aiden light Milly's things on fire at the beach and then leave town. The film flashes forward again to Woodrow in the street, where Milly has caught up with him and they hold each other as credits roll. Production =Cinematography= Reviewers noted the film's distinctive look, giving credit to cinematographer Joel Hodge's shooting style and the one-of-a-kind camera designed and built by Evan Glodell, who combined vintage camera parts, bellows and Russian lenses, around a Silicon Imaging SI-2K Mini Digital Cinema camera.Sundance Review: Bellflower. Film.com Movies Hodge was nominated for the 2012 Independent Spirit Award for Best Cinematography, losing to the significantly bigger budget The Artist. The award was announced the day before The Artist won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Eric Kohn of IndieWire criticized the inclusion of The Artist into awards that should recognize lesser known films, itemizing \\"innovative cinematographer\\" Hodge as one of the people harmed by the decision. Screen Junkies also included both cinematographers among three it named Best Cinematographers for 2012. =Effects= Glodell and crew were also inventive in the effects they used in the filming. Glodell constructed the flame thrower central to the theme, and modified the Medusa car. To get a propane tank explosion, live bullets were fired into the tank, narrowly missing engineer/editor Jon Keevil's head.

The play concerns the attempts of four men seeking to win over Penelope in the absence of her warrior husband, Odysseus, who has been away for the previous twenty years fighting the Trojan wars. Plot synopsis The play opens with the four men, Fitz, Burns, Dunne and Quinn, in an empty swimming pool, going about their daily lives with only Burns seemingly at odds with his environment. There is a blood stain on the wall which we learn was caused by the suicide of a fifth man, Murray, only the day before. Burns attempts to scrub away the blood to no avail. A barbecue stands towards the rear of the pool, it has never been lit and is the source of great curiosity and some fear by the men. In a shared dream they see it lighting heralding their death at the hands of Odysseus. Penelope, separated from the men, stands on a platform above and unseen from the pool. A television screen relays the successive addresses by the men for her perusal in a contemporaneous nod to reality television formats. Each man hopes to win her affections through their monologues. But as the day wears on signs and premonitions of Odysseus‚Äô return grow more ominous and they formulate a plan to work together in order that one of them may succeed in winning Penelope, thus saving the others from Odysseus‚Äô revenge.

Description The straightnose pipefish initially gives the impression of being a worm. The head is tiny and resembles that of a seahorse, to which this fish is closely related. The body is round in cross-section and the fins are tiny. The only fish with which it might be confused is the broadnosed pipefish (Syngnathus typhle) but that is more robust and has a hexagonal cross-section. The general colour of the straightnose pipefish is green with a yellowish belly. The female has pale blue markings on the head and body and both sexes become more colourful at breeding time when the male's snout turns yellow. The average size is about with a maximum of . Range This fish is found in the North-eastern Atlantic along the coasts of Europe, its range extending from southern Norway to Morocco. It is also present in the Baltic, the Mediterranean, and the Black Sea. It inhabits sandy bottoms and is part of the fouling community, at depths from . Biology The straightnose pipefish lives among eelgrass and seaweed with its tail wrapped around the vegetation and its head elevated. Here it is well-camouflaged, and feeds on zooplankton and copepods by sucking them in. This species of pipefish is used as a model to study mate choice and sex role- reversal. Like other species of pipefish and the closely related seahorses, the straighnose pipefish exhibits male parental care, meaning that female reproductive success is limited by her ability to court and mate with a suitable male. In the straighnosed pipefish, female-female competition and mate choice by males has resulted in female-specific coloration, female ornamental skin folds, and more active courtship in females.

In Midsummer term, 1681, when sixteen years old, Henry Brougham 'became a poor serving-child of Queen's College,' Oxford.

He was, with William Offley, domestic chaplain to Thomas Barlow, the bishop. On Barlow's death in the same year he bequeathed his Greek, Latin, and English Bibles, and his own original manuscripts, to Brougham and Offley. A condition of the gift was that Brougham and Offley were not to make public any of his writings after his decease; and in 1692, on Sir Peter Pett publishing what he called the bishop's 'Genuine Remains,' the two legatees 'delay'd no time' in issuing a vindication, calling Sir Peter Pett and the vicar of Buckden (where the bishop had died) 'confederate pedlars.'

Originally derived from the discipline of anthropology, ethnocinema is one form of ethnographic filmmaking that prioritises mutuality, collaboration and social change.Harris, Anne. \\"Race and Refugeity: Ethnocinema as Radical Pedagogy\\" in Qualitative Inquiry (ERA=B) Nov 1, 2010:16, pp. 768-777. http://qix.sagepub.com/content/16/9/768.short The practice's ethos claims that the role of anthropologists, and other cultural, media and educational researchers, must adapt to changing communities, transnational identities and new notions of representation for the 21st century. Ethno-cinematographers have also been associated with American historian James Clifford who has asserted that ‚Äúall ethnographic representations are partial truths‚Äù.Clifford, James and George E. Marcus, (eds). 1986. Writing culture: the poetics and politics of ethnography. Berkeley, CA: Univ of California Press., pg 7.

Of these, Rouch's films are closest to being the forerunners of contemporary ethnocinema. Many film theorists and ethnohistorians have helped to define an evolving ethnographic film in the late 20th century, among them American Bill Nichols.Nichols, Bill. 1994. Blurred Boundaries: questions of meaning in contemporary culture. Bloomington: Indiana University Press. Ethnocinema is typical of a shift toward destabilizing traditional notions of representation, both in the West/North and in cultures and communities which had historically been the subjects of such films, and in which indigenous and diasporic peoples are taking control of their own representations, or working (as in ethnocinema) in intercultural collaboration. In addition to Rouch, this includes the work of such ethnographers and intercultural filmmakers as Trinh T. Minh-ha,Minh-Ha, Trinh T, (ed) The Digital Film Event, Routledge, New York, 2005 Harald Prins,Prins. 2004. \\"Visual Anthropology\\". in A Companion to the Anthropology of American Indians, edited by T.

Faye Ginsburg, Timothy Asch and others. More recently, indigenous filmmakers such as Essie Coffey (Australia) are collaborating interculturally to create ethnocinematic works. Working against the observational cinema tradition, these filmmakers are all acknowledging and deconstructing Minh-ha's observation that ‚ÄúEverywhere we go, we become someone‚Äôs private zoo‚Äù,Minh-ha, T. (1996) \\"Woman, Native, Other: Writing Postcoloniality and Feminism\\". in Feminist literary theory: a reader. (ed.) Eagleton, Mary. Oxford: Wiley- Blackwell, pg 394. and theorists like Harris continue to draw on her work. Other examples of early attempts to define ethnocinema include the 1972 \\"ethnocinematic experiment\\" of Sol Worth and John Adair documented in \\"American Indians and the ethnocinematic complex: From native participation to production control\\",Prins, Harald E.L. 1989. \\"American Indians and the Ethnocinematic Complex: From Native Participation to Production Control\\". in Eyes Across the Water, edited by R. M. Boonzajer Flaes. Amsterdam: Het Spinhuis. Pp 80-90. in which seven co-participants of Navajo heritage were given video cameras and asked to make films which were ‚ÄòIndian‚Äô; these films, however, were framed by essentialising notions of Other and did not seek to go beyond the researcher/researched dichotomy. Tobing Rony (1996) and Sam Pack (2000) consider developments in Indigenous media in relation to the anthropological notion of ‚Äúnative authenticity‚Äù and why such essentialising notions are increasingly irrelevant in the 21st century's ethnocinematic context. Yet the ability to truly collaborate in ethnographic research remains a contentious notion in anthropological and other circles, as ethnographic documentary scholar Jay Ruby asserts; what he calls Ethnographic Cinema must, he claims ‚Äúbe the work of academically educated and academically employed socio-cultural anthropologists‚Äù.Ruby, J. Ethnographic Cinema (EC) - A Manifesto / A Provocation (n.d.) . (Retrieved on: 17 May 2009), para. 3. By Ruby's reckoning, what is emerging as ethnocinema has almost nothing to do with ethnographic films. By this definition, even Jean Rouch doesn't qualify. Conversely, Rouch encouraged the potential of ethnographic film as a ‚Äúcelebration of a relationship‚Äù between filmmaker and imaged, in which the ‚Äúrapport and participation‚ÄùRouch 2003, pg 12. between both parties enhances any end-product that is collectively achieved. Loizos's claim (like Ruby's) that contemporary filmmakers blur the lines between \\"authentic\\" ethnography and general documentary seems increasingly out of place. Traditional ethnographic filmmaking as a tool of anthropological researchers seeking to bring the stories of ‚Äúdistant peoples to audiences in North America and Europe‚ÄùHeider, Karl G. 2006. Ethnographic Film. Austin: University of Texas Press, pg 15. is increasingly outmoded in a culture of YouTube and social networking sites screaming for video content. = Toward a contemporary ethnocinema: some contradictions = The confusion continues. By 2006, there are still scant references to ethnocinema and they frequently conflict. One online blog characterises a Burmese festival as ‚Äúa surrealist anti- documentary, with no voice-over, odd visual juxtapositions, and none of the quasi-academic tone that afflicts so much official ethno cinema‚Äù.Davis, Erik. 2006. \\"Burmese Daze\\". Originally published in The Strange Attractor Journal, No. 4. http://www.techgnosis.com/chunkshow- single.php?chunk=chunkfrom-2007-04-01-1746-0.txt . (Retrieved on: 19 September 2009), para. 9. An abstract for an academic paper on the ritual branding of Andean cattle in Peru refers to the paper as an ‚Äúethnocinematographical study in which we reinterpret, with and in the film‚Äù the acts which they have recorded filmically, using the video cameras as ‚Äúobservation instruments‚Äù,Reyna, Carlos. 2005. Cinema e Antropologia: Novos di√°logos metodol√≥gicos na interpreta√ß√£o de um ritual andino. Biblioteca online de ci√™ncias da comunica√ß√£o. http://www.bocc.ubi.pt/pag/reyna-carlos-cinema- antropologia.pdf. (Retrieved on: 10 September 2009), pg 1. none of which characterizes contemporary ethnocinematic work. Several recent European film festivals list among their offerings the category of ethnocinema, without giving examples or defining the term. Still other contemporary film festivals appear to use the terms ethnographic and ethnocinematic interchangeably, which only adds to the confusion. In 2001, Notes From the Underground, Goran Gociƒá‚Äôs insider look at the filmmaker Emir Kusturica, appeared in which he discusses what he alternatively calls ethno-cinema and then just \\"ethno\\". A Modern Language Association Review article opined, \\"The appeal of Kusturica's films ‚Ä¶ is that of \\"ethno\\" cinema, a cinema rooted in local traditions but expressed in \\"Western\\" form. This liberal political engagement with exotic subject matter is nonetheless, argues Gociƒá, an empowerment of the marginal.\\"Haymes, Peter. 2004. \\"Review of Notes from the Underground: The Cinema of Emir Kusturica\\". The Modern Language Review, January. http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_7026/is_1_99/ai_n28245389/. (Retrieved on: 9 September 2009), pg 2. and from a far less favourable online book review: he invests considerably more time to embracing instead his own recurring but vague references to 'ethno-cinema' as a base context from which Kusturica is operating (and by which Gocic seems to mean to have it both ways: indulging in exoticism and critiquing others' supposed essentializing). The only specific examples he offers to define this category are a handful of big budget Hollywood films involving Native Americans.Karl, Brian Bernard. 2004. \\"Capturing Kusturica: On Gociƒá‚Äôs The Cinema of Kusturica\\", Film Philosophy, vol. 8, no. 12, 2004, para 24. http://www.film- philosophy.com/vol8-2004/n12karl. (Retrieved on: 20 September 2009). Gociƒá himself says that, ‚Äúinside film history itself, ethno cinema is the most exciting cinematic concept that the world has had to offer in the past two decades: aesthetically, it is difficult to argue against‚Äù.Gociƒá, Goran. 2001. The Cinema of Emir Kusturica: Notes from the Underground. London: Wallflower Press, p. 168. However, throughout the text his attempts to define ethnocinema contradict and obscure any practical working definition. Gociƒá identifies \\"ethno\\" as having been around since the 1950s and as being typified by a sense of the ‚Äúlocal‚Äù, including local motifs, but frequently made for a Western audience.Gociƒá, 2001, pg 120. Surprisingly, only nine pages later he locates the birth of \\"ethno cinema\\" ‚Äúin the late 1970s and early 1980s solely judging by the Cannes winners, which were Italian at the end of the 1970s‚Äù.Gociƒá, 2001, pg 129. Gociƒá does attempt to characterise and define his version of ethno cinema with the following: ‚Äúnostalgia,‚Äù (as a search for the ‚Äú‚Äòlost ‚Äòauthenticity‚Äô of primitivism‚Äù), ‚Äúintertextuality, openness and subjectivity (as postmodern characteristics), incredulity (or denial of ideology), and ‚Äòdouble coding' or unexpected, surrealist, incongruous elements‚Äù.Gociƒá, 2001, pg 158. Ethnocinema, then, suggests that the voices/images of \\"women/natives/others\\"Minh-ha, Trinh T. 1996. \\"Woman, Native, Other: Writing Postcoloniality and Feminism\\". in Feminist Literary Theory: A Reader, edited by M. Eagleton. Cambridge MA: Wiley-Blackwell. have something in common, and have agency in contributing to ethnographic film, whether independently or collaboratively, interculturally or intra-culturally. Current attempts to offer a working definition of ethnocinema may share more with the more recent movement of intercultural cinema which emerged around 1990. Laura Marks identifies this emergence as connected to three main factors: ‚Äúthe rise of multiculturalism ‚Ä¶ availability of funding ‚Ä¶ and an intellectual climate characterised by the disintegration of master narratives and a growing conceptualisation of knowledge as partial and contested‚Äù.Marks, Laura U. 2000. The skin of the film: intercultural cinema, embodiment, and the senses. Durham NC: Duke University Press, pg 2. Whatever its filmic and academic antecedents, ethnocinema is emerging, and ‚Äì as Rouch has repeatedly shown us ‚Äì \\"the other cannot be denied\\" as his/her image and means of production transforms. In ethnocinema there is the belief that in the relationship which emerges through the shared project, both self and Other are understood and represented in newly constructed ways. One way of disrupting traditional ethnographic documentary voyeurism is in making transparent the intercultural relationship normally shrouded behind the scenes. Foster's contention that controlling the means of production is \\"foregrounding subjectivity\\",Foster, Gwendolyn A. 1997. Women Filmmakers of the African and Asian Diaspora: Decolonizing the Gaze, Locating Subjectivity. Carbondale and Edwardsville: Southern Illinois University Press. is limited. It presumes a one-way relationship between the content and construction of all ethnographic films (including ethnocinematic ones), and assumes that by creating the films the subject is empowered and the gaze is recast. It ignores the complex relationship between reception and production, and classifies films created by marginalised filmmakers as more authentic, or even automatically transgressive in a dominant culture. This cannot be assumed, either in content or reception. We have moved well beyond orientalism and the temporary inability of the Other to represent her or himself, so that \\"they must therefore be represented by others\\",Said, E. 2000. Reflections on exile and other essays. Boston: Harvard University Press, pg 206. but similarly it cannot be assumed that self-representation is automatically \\"authentic\\" or an end in itself. In ethnocinema, relationship and process always take precedence over formal considerations. Obviously, to achieve a wide viewing audience, formal concerns cannot be completely ignored, but these aesthetic concerns are addressed together in the co-creation of the films. In ethnocinema, there is no perception of a conflict between its ethnographic and popular culture characteristics. It remains ethnographic because it is grounded in cultural specificity, which is not essentialist and can be always-changing. It does not seek to \\"document\\" a culture, as in ethnocinema culture is understood to be varied, diverse and always emerging. = Ethnocinema: new directions = In Picturing Culture: Explorations of Film and Anthropology, Ruby calls for places where ‚Äúcritical standards are debated and canons develop‚Äù,Ruby, Jay. 2000. Picturing Culture: Explorations of Film and Anthropology. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, pg 23. Original edition, 1975 article. and the need for ethnographic filmmakers to generate a set of critical standards analogous to those for written ethnographies. Harris agrees, and says that standards are needed, but diverges from Ruby's definition in two important ways: firstly as a call to ethnocinematic filmmakers (whether academic or non-academic) that films included in this category must prioritise a post-colonial collaborative relationship between makers and imaged; and secondly, that Ruby's so-called ‚Äúmarketplace considerations‚ÄùRuby 2000, pg 4. need not pollute the product which is made. Ruby proposed in 2008 that ‚Äúanthropologists should simply relinquish the term ethnographic to professional documentary filmmakers and seek another term to characterize their efforts‚Äù;Ruby, Jay. 2008. \\"Towards an Anthropological Cinema\\": a talk given at the 2008 Nordic Anthropological Film Association Meetings in √çsafj√∂rur, Iceland, June 6, 2008 (pg 3). www.media- anthropology.net/ruby_anthrocinema.pdf. (Retrieved on 10 September 2009). while Harris proposes that ethnographic is being superseded by ethnocinematic filmmaking.Harris, Anne. \\"Too Tall, Too Dark, Too Something: New Racism in Australian Schools\\" in Trauma, Media, Art: New Perspectives (Eds) Broderick, M & Traverso, A.

Locomotive production began in 1913, and in the 1930s absorbed the work of the August Borsig locomotive factory, being renamed the Borsig Lokomotiv Werke GmbH until 1944. After the Second World War the factory was nationalised in the German Democratic Republic and produced electric locomotives for home use and for export, mainly to Communist Bloc countries under the name Lokomotivbau-Elektrotechnische Werke (LEW). After German reunification in 1990, the plant returned to AEG ownership, becoming AEG Schienenfahrzeuge GmbH, and then passed through mergers of its parent companies to Adtranz (1996) and then Bombardier Transportation (2001). Under Adtranz's ownership production of locomotives ended, and the site now manufactures diesel and electric multiple units. History In 1910 the AEG company acquired a of land in Hennigsdorf near Berlin for the creation of a ceramics factory which began production in 1911. In 1913 AEG's locomotive works was relocated from Brunnenstrasse in Berlin to Hennigsdorf and began manufacturing electric vehicles. Between 1914 and 1918 the plant underwent a considerable change in production - being converted to the production of steam locomotives. In 1920/1 a joint venture Rosenthal-Isolatoren GmbH (Rosenthal Insulators) with Rosenthal & Co. AG as well as a steel plant were founded in Hennigsdorf. In 1921 the manufacturer of steam power plants for industry began, and in 1927 the first operational steam engine powered by powdered coal was built. South African Class 19D no. 2702 of 1938 In 1931 AEG merged with Borsig AG which had been bankrupted by the effects of the Great Depression. The locomotive company's production was moved from Borsig's factory in Tegel to the Hennigsdorf plant, in 1935 AEG acquired all of Borsig's shares and became sole owner. Production of locomotives as Hennigsdorf continue under the name Borsig Lokomotiv Werke GmbH as a subsidiary of the AEG group up till 1944. After then end of the Second World War 80% of the factory had been destroyed, and came under the control of the USSR being in the eastern part of Germany. In 1947 the factory was nationalised, becoming the \\"VEM Vereinigung Volkseigener Betriebe des Elektro-Maschinenbaus-Lokomotivbau Elektrotechnische Werke Hennigsdorf (Osthavelland)\\", and in 1948 production of electric locomotives began. In 1951 the plant was renamed VEB Lokomotivbau-Elektrotechnische Werke \\"Hans Beimler\\"Named after Hans Beimler, German anti-nazi, and member of the ReichstagVEB Volkseigener Betrieb (people-owned enterprise) shortened to LEW. DR 250-040 in Worms main station in 2009 In 1955 production of a wide range of rail vehicles including trams, diesel locomotives, underground and rack locomotives, and mineral wagons was underway, with 60% of the production for export. In 1960 the factory began to undertake the production of ultra-pure metals by electron beam furnace. In the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s the factory produced new classes of electric locomotive for the Deutsche Reichsbahn including the DR Class 250 (1974), the DR Class 243 (1982). From the mid-1980s, LEW began to cooperate with AEG, in which Daimler-Benz took majority control around the same time, in exports to third countries, peaking in the 601 Series (today Class 520) intercity diesel multiple units for Greece's OSE in 1989. In 1989 the two companies signed a memorandum of cooperation. In 1990, at the time of the German reunification, LEW was transformed from a combine into a non-public company as LEW Hennigsdorf GmbH, and talks about a takeover by AEG started the same year. In November 1991, AEG agreed with the Treuhand to purchase the rail core business parts of LEW and invest in the Hennigsdorf production facilities for altogether 600 million DM. From 1 January 1992, the works became a separate subsidiary under the AEG Bahnsysteme (AEG Rail Systems) business area of AEG Daimler Benz under the name AEG Schienenfahrzeuge GmbH. In 1992, AEG Bahnsysteme was reorganised into four business sub-areas, one for North America and the Fernverkehr (Long- Distance Traffic), Nahverkehr (Local Traffic) and Bahngesamtsysteme (Complete Rail Systems) areas for Europe, and concentrated and headquartered the Long- Distance Traffic business area at Hennigsdorf. thumb In January 1996, AEG Schienenfahrzeuge GmbH was integrated into the newly formed ABB Daimler Benz Transportation (Adtranz), a joint venture of ABB and Daimler-Benz formed by merging AEG Bahnsysteme and its subsidiaries with ABB Transportation. As Adtranz reorganised production among its factories, locomotive production ended at Hennigsdorf and was transferred to the former ABB Henschel works in Kassel in 1998. With the acquisition of Adtranz by Bombardier Inc. in May 2001, the Hennigsdorf works became part of Bombardier Transportation. As part of Bombardier transportation the plant manufactures passenger rail vehicles including the RegioSwinger and Itino DMUs, the DBAG Class 422, DBAG Class 424 and NS Sprinter Lighttrain EMUs and the Bombardier Talent, ICE 3 and MOVIA trains.

Biography According to some scholars Godilas was probably a Goth. The name has also been considered to be of Gothic origin (Gudila). Godilas is first mentioned in 518 as one of the officers involved in the proclamation of Justin I as Byzantine emperor. The ceremony is recorded in the De Ceremoniis, compiled by Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos () in the 10th century, and gives his rank as campiductor/campidoctor (\\"drill instructor\\") of the regiment of the Lanciarii ().. In 528, Godilas, along with Baduarius, led a military expedition from Odessus (modern Varna) against the Huns of the Crimea. Under their leader, Mougel, the Huns had reportedly captured Byzantine areas on the coasts of the Black Sea. Later that year, Godilas joined forces with Ascum and Constantiolus in facing an ongoing invasion of Huns/Bulgars in Thrace. The Byzantine army managed to defeat one group of invaders in battle, but they were then ambushed and routed by a second group of Huns/Bulgars. Both Constantiolus and Ascum were captured by their pursuing enemies through the use of lassoes, and only Godilas was able to break through and escape, as recorded by John Malalas and Theophanes the Confessor. His military rank at the time of these battles is uncertain. Both Ascum and Constantiolus held the rank of magister militum. As Godilas served alongside them, rather than act as their subordinate, it is likely that he held an equivalent rank, either as magister militum per Thracias or as magister militum vacans.

Expatica's founding was partially funded by the Dutch government (the Twinning Center under the Ministry of Economic Affairs) and Expatica now reaches expats in ten European countries and regions, including the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, Moscow, Luxembourg, the UK, Portugal and South Africa. The news and information Expatica supplies covers various aspects of expat life, including relocation, culture, education, tax, immigration, local events and politics. Expatica allows expats from any country to register as members free of charge, which has resulted in an online international community, comprising over 120,000 members. Via the ‚ÄúI am not a tourist‚Äù fairs organised annually in Amsterdam, Brussels and Madrid, along with regular meet- ups and social events, Expatica brings members of the international community together. Expatica assists academic institutions and independent researchers in carrying out research on expat-related subjects too.

Magnonics combines the study of waves and magnetism. Its main aim is to investigate the behaviour of spin waves in nano-structure elements. In essence, spin waves are a propagating re-ordering of the magnetisation in a material and arise from the precession of magnetic moments. Magnetic moments arise from the orbital and spin moments of the electron, most often it is this spin moment that contributes to the net magnetic moment. Following the success of the modern hard disk, there is much current interest in future magnetic data storage and using spin waves for things such as 'magnonic' logic and data storage. Similarly, spintronics looks to utilize the inherent spin degree of freedom to complement the already successful charge property of the electron used in contemporary electronics. Modern magnetism is concerned with furthering the understanding of the behaviour of the magnetisation on very small (sub-micrometre) length scales and very fast (sub-nanosecond) timescales and how this can be applied to improving existing or generating new technologies and computing concepts. A magnon torque device was invented and later perfected at the National University of Singapore's Electrical & Computer Engineering department, which is based on such potential uses, with results published on November 29, 2019, in Science. A magnonic crystal is a magnetic metamaterial with alternating magnetic properties. Like conventional metamaterials, their properties arise from geometrical structuring, rather than their bandstructure or composition directly. Small spatial inhomogeneities create an effective macroscopic behaviour, leading to properties not readily found in nature. By alternating parameters such as the relative permeability or saturation magnetisation, there exists the possibility to tailor 'magnonic' bandgaps in the material. By tuning the size of this bandgap, only spin wave modes able to cross the bandgap would be able to propagate through the media, leading to selective propagation of certain spin wave frequencies. Theory Spin waves can propagate in magnetic media with magnetic ordering such as ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. The frequencies of the precession of the magnetisation depend on the material and its magnetic parameters, in general precession frequencies are in the microwave from 1‚Äì100 GHz, exchange resonances in particular materials can even see frequencies up to several THz. This higher precession frequency opens new possibilities for analogue and digital signal processing. Spin waves themselves have group velocities on the order of a few km per second. The damping of spin waves in a magnetic material also causes the amplitude of the spin wave to decay with distance, meaning the distance freely propagating spin waves can travel is usually only several 10's of Œºm. The damping of the dynamical magnetisation is accounted for phenomenologically by the Gilbert damping constant in the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation (LLG equation), the energy loss mechanism itself is not completely understood, but is known to arise microscopically from magnon-magnon scattering, magnon-phonon scattering and losses due to eddy currents. The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation is the 'equation of motion' for the magnetisation. All of the properties of the magnetic systems such as the applied bias field, the sample's exchange, anisotropy and dipolar fields are described in terms of an 'effective' magnetic field that enters the Landau‚ÄìLifshitz‚ÄìGilbert equation. The study of damping in magnetic systems is an ongoing modern research topic. The LL equation was introduced in 1935 by Landau and Lifshitz to model the precessional motion of magnetization \\\\mathbf{M} in a solid with an effective magnetic field \\\\mathbf{H}_\\\\mathrm{eff} and with damping. Later, Gilbert modified the damping term, which in the limit of small damping yields identical results. The LLG equation is, :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\textbf m}{\\\\partial t}\\\\, =\\\\, -\\\\gamma \\\\,\\\\textbf m\\\\times \\\\textbf{H}_{\\\\mathrm{eff}}\\\\, +\\\\, \\\\alpha\\\\,\\\\textbf m\\\\times\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\textbf m}{\\\\partial t}\\\\,.\\\\qquad The constant \\\\alpha is the Gilbert phenomenological damping parameter and depends on the solid, and \\\\gamma is the electron gyromagnetic ratio. Here \\\\textbf m={\\\\textbf M}/{\\\\mathrm M_S}\\\\,. Research in magnetism, like the rest of modern science, is conducted with a symbiosis of theoretical and experimental approaches. Both approaches go hand-in-hand, experiments test the predictions of theory and theory provides explanations and predictions of new experiments. The theoretical side focuses on numerical modelling and simulations, so called micromagnetic modelling. Programs such as OOMMF or NMAG are micromagnetic solvers that numerically solve the LLG equation with appropriate boundary conditions. Prior to the start of the simulation, magnetic parameters of the sample and the initial groundstate magnetisation and bias field details are stated. Experiment Experimentally, there are many techniques that exist to study magnetic phenomena, each with its own limitations and advantages. The experimental techniques can be distinguished by being time-domain (optical and field pumped TR-MOKE), field-domain (ferromagnetic resonance (FMR)) and frequency-domain techniques (Brillouin light scattering (BLS), vector network analyser - ferromagnetic resonance (VNA-FMR)). Time-domain techniques allow the temporal evolution of the magnetisation to be traced indirectly by recording the polarisation response of the sample. The magnetisation can be inferred by the so-called 'Kerr' rotation. Field-domain techniques such as FMR tickle the magnetisation with a CW microwave field. By measuring the absorption of the microwave radiation through the sample, as an external magnetic field is swept provides information about magnetic resonances in the sample. Importantly, the frequency at which the magnetisation precesses depends on the strength of the applied magnetic field. As the external field strength is increased, so does the precession frequency. Frequency-domain techniques such as VNA-FMR, examine the magnetic response due to excitation by an RF current, the frequency of the current is swept through the GHz range and the amplitude of either the transmitted or reflected current can be measured. Modern ultrafast lasers allow femtosecond (fs) temporal resolution for time- domain techniques, such tools are now standard in laboratory environments. Based on the magneto-optic Kerr effect, TR-MOKE is a pump-probe technique where a pulsed laser source illuminates the sample with two separate laser beams. The 'pump' beam is designed to excite or perturb the sample from equilibrium, it is very intense designed to create highly non-equilibrium conditions within the sample material, exciting the electron, and thereby subsequently the phonon and the spin system. Spin-wave states at high energy are excited and subsequently populate the lower lying states during their relaxation path's. A much weaker beam called a 'probe' beam is spatially overlapped with the pump beam on the magnonic material's surface. The probe beam is passed along a delay line, which is a mechanical way of increasing the probe path length. By increasing the probe path length, it becomes delayed with respect to the pump beam and arrives at a later time on the sample surface. Time-resolution is built in the experiment by changing the delay distance. As the delay line position is stepped, the reflected beam properties are measured. The measured Kerr rotation is proportional to the dynamic magnetisation as the spin-waves propagate in the media. The temporal resolution is limited by the temporal width of the laser pulse only. This allows to connect ultrafast optics with a local spin-wave excitation and contact free detection in magnonic metamaterials, photomagnonics.

Built for indigent workers by the Danish Medical Association from 1854 to 1872, it is one of the earliest examples of social housing in Denmark and became a model for later projects. The development was designed by Michael Gottlieb Bindesb√∏ll in Neoclassical style and later expanded by Vilhelm Klein to a roughly similar design. History =Background= M. G. Bindesb√∏ll The idea of providing cheap and healthy homes for the poorest part of the city's work force originated among local politicians and medical doctors during the 1853 Copenhagen cholera outbreak which killed approximately 5,000 citizens. A major reason for the outbreak was the dismal conditions in the poorest parts of the city which suffered from overpopulation and lack of proper sanitary services. Copenhagen's population had almost doubled since 1800 but the city had still not been allowed to expand beyond its old fortification ring. =Construction phase= Plan of the area, fully developed The Danish Medical Association decided to take action, purchasing a piece of land on the Eastern Commons after raising funds privately. The prominent architect Michael Gottlieb Bindesb√∏ll was commissioned to design the houses, Construction began in 1854 and the first stage of the development, with 240 apartments, was inaugurated in 1857. Due to the intervention of the Second Schleswig War, a planned extension did not begin until 1866. After Bindesb√∏ll's death in 1856, he was replaced by Vilhelm Klein, one of his employees. By the time the second stage was completed in 1872, Brumleby had 550 apartments which housed approximately 2,500 inhabitants. =Later history= Brumleby in the 1900s Brumleby in the 1900s In 1878, still with Klein as the architect, the Medical Association continued its construction of apartments for workers at another site further from the city, next to the Eastern Gasworks, but these were later demolished. Over the years there were also numerous proposals to demolish Brumleby and replace it with more dense housing but in 1959 the area was listed. The name The area was not originally known as Brumleby, but simply as L√¶geforeningens Boliger (English: The Medical Association's Residences), but the name emerged colloquially towards the end of the 19th century and obtained official status in 1984. The prefix Brumle-, in the beginning also seen as Brumme-, most likely was a reference to the sound from the grazing cattle on the surrounding commons. The suffix -by simply means town or area, as in the English 'by-law' and place- names as such as Grimsby and Derby. Architecture Brumleby Brumleby consists of four rows of two-storey houses with bicoloured facades, ochre coloured ground floors and white first floors, and slate roofs. The inspiration for the design came from Italian agricultural workers' housing which Bindesb√∏ll had seen during his years in Italy. The apartments were no larger than those inside the city, just 25 sqm, often for families with many children, but their planning set new standards with its spacious layout, abundant light and fresh air as well as integration of common facilities such as wash houses, co-operative shops, a bath house, workshops and shared spaces. Brumleby today Brumleby still serves as social housing, part of K√∏benhavns Almindelige Boligselskab. Today, after mergers during a major renovation in the 1990s, the number of apartments has been reduced to 221. The renovation also fitted the apartments with private bathrooms and toilets, before that these facilities were shared. Notable residents Ilia Fibiger (1817‚Äì1867), writer and Denmark's first professional nurse, lived there with six orphans in the 1860s. The writer Martin Andersen Nex√∏ lived in the area as a child, from 1872 to 1877, and has portrayed it in the 1952 childhood memoires Et Lille Kr√¶.

Early life Born in Neufch√¢teau in the French department Vosges on 14 October 1809, Liez was the son of Marie Weber, a Luxembourger, and Jean-Joseph Liez, a cobbler. In 1812, when he was 3 years old, the family moved to Luxembourg, where his father took up Luxembourg nationality. After attending the local school, Liez studied drawing with Jean-Baptiste Fresez at the Ecole de Dessin where he was awarded the silver medal in 1827. He continued his studies at Charleroi and Mons in Belgium, where he learnt the art of lithography.Georgette Bisdorff, \\"Nicolas Liez\\", Ons stad, No 62, 1999. Retrieved 19 January 2011 Career Throughout his life, despite his unusual versatility, Liez had difficulty in earning a living from art alone. Despite his work as a painter, lithographer, sculptor and decorator, he still found it necessary to teach, even on Sundays for those who had jobs during the week. He renovated the facades of old buildings and sculpted monuments and gravestones. Liez is also credited with bringing photography to Luxembourg. Nicolas Liez: View of Clervaux, lithograph (1834) His collection of lithographs published in his \\"Voyage pittoresque √† travers le Grand Duch√© de Luxembourg\\" (1834) is considered to have been compiled when he was at the height of his artistic ability. The work may well have led to his employment at the Villeroy and Boch pottery factory in Luxembourg City. Here he decorated porcelain with the scenes shown in the lithographs. In 1860, he acquired his own porcelain factory in Audun-le-Tiche but it was a failure and he was forced to sell out. In 1870, he left Luxembourg for Dresden where he became artistic director at the Villeroy and Boch factory there. He died in Dresden on 30 August 1892, leaving four children.\\"Nicolas Liez\\" , Personnages Luxembourgeois. Retrieved 19 January 2011. Artwork Unlike his teacher Fresez, Liez did not master portrait painting but became Luxembourg's most talented graphic artist of the 19th century. His paintings range from his \\"Death of John the Blind\\" to landscapes but also include flowers, stations of the cross and horses in their stables. His landscapes depict scenes from Luxembourg, the French Ardennes and the surroundings of Dresden. His most famous work is his view of the City of Luxembourg from the Fetschenhof which he drew, painted and lithographed in 1870. It shows the city at the time when the demolition of the fortress had just begun. Despite his attempt to emphasise the fortifications by exaggerating the height of the cliffs and the railway bridge, the painting is a good representation of the city and its skyscape.

His most notable portrayal was as the barber in the Academy Award-winning film Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (1927). Born in Rochester, New York, Sipperly had a career in the Broadway theatre before breaking into silent films. His earliest known appearance was in a performance of A Prince There Was (1918), followed by The Meanest Man in the World (1920), Six Cylinder Love (1921), The Deep Tangled Wild-Wood (1923) and other (mostly) comedies. His first known film part was in the movie version of Six Cylinder Love (1923) in which he played the same character he had on-stage. During one theatrical performance of Six-Cylinder Love in New York in 1921, Sipperly, who played a high-powered car salesman, accidentally drove an actual automobile off the stage and into the first row of seats.

Background = Early years = Doda was born in 1860 in Orosh, Mirdit√´ District, the son of Bib√´ Dod√´ Pasha of the Gjonmarkaj clan. His father was given the title Pasha from the Ottomans due to his support in suppressing the Albanian Revolt of 1843‚Äì44 against the Tanzimat reforms. He spent his youth in Istanbul and returned to Mirdita in 1876. During the Great Eastern Crisis, Montenegro attempted to get Albanian tribes to revolt against the empire and Ottoman-Albanian officials of Shkod√´r attempted to counter those actions through negotiations with Doda. Doda later took two Ottoman negotiators hostage, closed access to roads passing through Mirdita and demanded the release of imprisoned Albanians in Shkod√´r's jail. French, British and Italian consuls attempted to mediate between the empire and Doda while the Ottoman governor moved troops into position. By mid-April Doda began his uprising against the Ottomans and the empire sent troops to quell the revolt. He was a contributor to the Albanian League of Prizren in 1878. Dervish Pasha ordered the arrest of some of Albanian League notables and tribal chieftains for disobedience which included Doda. = Exile = Doda was exiled to Anatolia by the Ottoman government and later given a post of Brigadier General in the palace of Sultan Abdul Hamid II. While in Istanbul, Doda had become a member of the Young Turks. He was released in 1908, after the Young Turk Revolution and the new Ottoman government thought that Doda's freedom would assist in gaining the support of the Mirdita tribe. Local Muslim and Christian Albanian highlanders (Malisors) viewed Doda's return as more important than the Ottoman constitution. The local Young Turk (CUP) branch in Shkod√´r, under pressure from local tribal chieftains, chose to obtain Doda's release for Mirdita in return for supporting the new constitutional government. =Return from exile = Prenk Bib Doda (1890s) Doda's return to Mirdita consisted of a visit to Shkod√´r meeting Young Turk members and wiring the Grand vizier that he would work toward gaining support of the tribes for the new government and to create a CUP branch in Mirdita. He also expressed uncertainties with his relationship with the tribe and the local vali while he advised the government to govern the region fairly. Back in the region, Doda accompanied by two CUP members met with members of Mirdita's five bajraktars (2,500 men) on 30 September at the church of St. Paul where the abbot gave a speech on the cessation of blood feuds until Ash Wednesday (28 March 1909) and he backed those pronouncements. Edith Durham, an English traveler present at the meeting noticed that Doda, dressed in an Ottoman fez and uniform felt unease and awkward around his surroundings after thirty years of exile such as recoiling in surprise at the sound of gun fire by fellow tribesmen hailing his arrival. During the Albanian alphabet Congress of Monastir of 1908, Doda sent a telegram of support for the Bashkimi Alphabet which he viewed practical for communication and commerce. Doda offered assistance from his tribe during the Ottoman countercoup of 1909 to quell the uprising and these sentiments where more due to fears that the Hamidian regime could return than loyalty toward the CUP. By 1911, Doda was a deputy in the Ottoman parliament and had expressed concerns to the Austro-Hungarian ambassador Johann von Pallavicini in Istanbul about possible partition of Albania by its neighbours Bulgaria, Montenegro and Serbia. Relations with the Young Turks broke down and Doda received overtures of support from Montenegro to establish an autonomous Catholic Albanian state provided he assisted Montenegrin forces during the Balkan Wars. Doda having fallen led rebellions against the empire, on October 26, 1911 he founded in Mirdita a Provision Government of Albania together with Terenzio Tocci, overruled by the Ottomans at that time. = Independent Albania = Prenk Bib Doda after his return from exile with an Ottoman Young Turk official (1909) In order to gain support of the Mirdita Catholic volunteers from the northern mountains during the Muslim Uprising in Albania in 1914 Prince of Wied appointed Doda to be the foreign minister of the Principality of Albania. The government was paying a force of 5,000 to 7,000 under Doda's command. Doda's volunteers and the International Dutch Gendarmerie were also joined by Isa Boletini and his men, mostly from Kosovo, as well as 2,000 tribesmen of Mat under the command of Ahmet Zogu. Dutch gendarmes together with Doda's northern Mirdita Catholics attempted to capture Shijak, but when they engaged the rebels on May 23, they were surrounded and captured, as well as another expedition from Durr√´s which attempted to release the captured gendarmes. Another expedition failed on June 23, around 15 miles north of Durr√´s near Slinz√´, where Prenk himself was captured by the rebels and then released on parole. There were rumors that he was a traitor to Prince Wilhelm, and he laid down arms and went voluntarily to the rebels. After World War I, he served as Deputy Prime Minister in the government of Turhan Pasha Permeti. In 1918, at the Congress of Durr√´s, Doda was elected vice president. He was in a very tense relationship with the Italian authorities established in Albania, and in a very good relations with the British diplomats. On 22 March 1919 he was killed in an ambush prepared by the Preng Gjeta Caku band, paid by the Italians, while traveling from Durr√´s to Sh√´ngjin in company of British diplomat Eden, who got wounded.

James Clifford was born in Muswellbrook in 1936 and in the sixties moved to Sydney, where he studied with Desiderius Orban and exhibited at Watters Gallery.Germaine, Max. Artists and Galleries of Australia. He worked in various styles and became distinctive early on, combining Hard-edge painting with landscape and seascape painting in kaleidoscopic perspectives, tropical landscapes, Art Nouveau borders and the surrealism of Gordon Onslow Ford, later incorporating collage, occasionally text art, Decalcomania. Clifford was openly same sex attracted however he described himself as a homophobic homosexual. His paintings of the human figure were usually male homoerotic nudes. His late paintings were Lyrical abstraction and have been compared to Ralph Balson's matter paintings of the early 1960s. The novelist Patrick White, famously associated with painters Ian Fairweather, Sidney Nolan, Brett Whiteley and Chris O'Doherty, was collecting Clifford's work from the mid sixties until the mid eighties. Both Clifford and White had family connections in the Hunter Region of New South Wales. James Clifford, Chris O'Doherty, Brett Whiteley and the painter /set designer Desmond Digby were the four young artists Patrick White collected most avidly, the novelist bequeathed the works to the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Curator Daniel Thomas remarked of White's \\"personal aesthetic\\": \\"It was obvious to me that he went with anything that had spiky forms\\". Clifford was a favourite of White, who described Clifford as one of the best two living painters in Australia. The author of Patrick White, Painter Manque, Helen Verity Hewitt has argued Sidney Nolan and Brett Whiteley were the main Australian artist influences on White's writing, although she compared Clifford himself him to a central character in White's 1961 novel Riders in the Chariot, Alf Dubbo, an emotionally uncertain young painter. Art historian Helen Verity Hewitt has noted that some observers felt White's interest in James Clifford was \\"misplaced\\". Curator Barry Pearce has said of White's art collection: \\"A lot of the reasons Patrick bought particular paintings died with him...He was slightly subversive, buying paintings to help out artists who were not sanctified by officials in museums\\". Hewitt quotes Elwyn Lynn musing on the painter's \\"fragile, diaphanous, lyric ephemerality\\"...\\"poised on uncertainty, their lyricism almost disguising their anxiety\\" (p. 87, Patrick White, Painter Manqu√©). Clifford received favourable mention from a small number of notable art critics: Bernard Smith, James Gleeson, Elwyn Lynn and Gary Catalano. Catalano wrote of Clifford as a casualty of the \\"provincial\\" Australian hard edged painting scene of the late 1960s, on which he commented: \\"Only a guilty provincial culture can so neglect its own, more native sources of renewal, and apply itself so assidiously to borrowed artistic fashions. And that The Field represented a fashion and not a convention is shown by the work of some artists who emerged at the same time as the exhibition....to Lynn the artist who seemed 'most defiantly bored with the canons of flatness' was the Sydney painter, James Clifford.\\" ...\\"His Cinematic Landscapes are a rapid series of takes: close-up shots mingle with distant vistas - there you see nothing but sky - and there was a forceful view of the ground. Despite their originality, they were not much admired by the critics, largely because they did not seem to be reflecting the going international concerns\\". The highly respected painter Richard Larter was an admirer of Clifford's skill in Marbleizing and Decalcomania. Larter wrote of Clifford's marbled paintings: \\"These works ranged from abstracts (like the ones in this exhibition) to paintings where waves, sandy beaches, cliffs, hills, swirling clouds in blue skies, expanses of seas and harbours with waves breaking and great sunsets were suggested. The paint used was mainly household enamel paint, the colours which ran into each other were usually cream, silver, white, ultramarine blue, pale blue, yellow, red and green. What was truly remarkable was that if you truly looked at the paintwork there was no sign of any brushwork. It was as if the paint had been magically placed on the canvas. Yet how spendidly had that paint been placed; one could discern white top waves breaking, sanded beaches, cliff faces, whole headlands with rolling hills beyond and turbulent water, not just breakers\\". The organic forms and psychedelic effects found in Clifford's art are in keeping with the trends in imagery associated with Psychedelic rock in the late Nineteen-sixties, which was happening in London. Later travels included time at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, Pondicherry, South India. Four years spent living in India during the 1970s came to an end when Clifford returned to Sydney in a poor state of health, tubercular and emotionally distraught. He spent the remainder of his life in Sydney and his art was collected by a few noted Sydney art collectors. Collectors of Clifford's work included Macquarie Galleries director Lucy Swanton, prominent art publisher Mervyn Horton, Gowings menswear store heiress Mollie Gowing and the painter Max Watters, whose collection is housed at the Muswellbrook Regional Arts Centre. A retrospective of Clifford's work was held at the Muswellbrook Regional Arts Centre in 2008. Eagles Preening circa 1980, by James Clifford.

It is south of Chandler, Minnesota, on the Buffalo Ridge in section 13 of Moulton Township, Murray County. It was closed in 1969. History In late 1951 Air Defense Command selected the site as one of twenty-eight radar stations built as part of the second segment of the permanent radar surveillance network. Prompted by the start of the Korean War, on July 11, 1950, the Secretary of the Air Force asked the Secretary of Defense for approval to expedite construction of the second segment of the permanent network. Receiving the Defense Secretary's approval on July 21, the Air Force directed the Corps of Engineers to proceed with construction. The 787th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was activated at Moulton, MN on 27 June 1951. The site was equipped with AN/FPS-3 and AN/FPS-4 radars, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. The site was named Chandler Air Force Station (AFS) on 1 December 1953. By 1959 these sets had been replaced by AN/FPS-20 and AN/FPS-6 radars, and the AN/FPS-20 set was upgraded and redesignated as an AN/FPS-64, and a second height-finder radar (AN/FPS-26) was added in 1961. During 1961 Chandler AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, initially feeding data to DC-11 at Grand Forks AFB, North Dakota. After joining, the squadron was redesignated as the 787th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 1 April 1961. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. Chandler AFS was later switched to SAGE Data Center DC-22 at Sioux City AFS, Iowa in 1963. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-18. In 1965 Chandler AFS was operating an AN/FPS-27 set, and the AN/FPS-64 was inactivated. The Air Force ordered radar operations to cease on 2 July 1969, and inactivated the 787th Radar Squadron on 30 September 1969. Air Force teams dismantled and removed the radars and communications equipment throughout the summer of 1969. The domes came down from the two height-finder radars, leaving only one dome remaining over the search radar. A small unit stayed behind for over a year to run that radar for the Federal Aviation Administration. The government subsequently sold the radar site to a developer and the housing area to a group of investors. Buyers removed the homes and the developer salvaged materials from the radar site, but was unable to find a commercial tenant or buyer, Today what was Chandler AFS has been obliterated, being demolished in June 1993 after sitting derelict for decades. A radio transmitter station now stands on the site, and what appears to be a large overgrown pile of concrete on the site which may be the remains of the Air Force structures. The site is located at 339 State Highway 91, Chandler MN 56122 under the county-wide 9-1-1 address system.

The date of establishment of a church on this site is unknown, but one 19th-century Anglesey historian says that it was about 450. The oldest parts of the present building (such as the nave and the chancel arch) are dated to about 1400, with the chancel dating from the late 15th or early 16th century. It is built from rough, small, squared stones, dressed with limestone. One of the windows on the south side is raised to illuminate the pulpit, a decision that in the eyes of one 19th-century commentator \\"disfigures the building.\\" According to local tradition, a standing stone about away is the petrified remains of a man who stole a bible from the church and was punished by St Tyfrydog as a result. The Welsh historian Gerald of Wales said that when the Norman lord Hugh of Montgomery was putting down the Welsh revolt led by Gruffudd ap Cynan in 1098, he kept his dogs in the church. The dogs had gone mad by the morning, and Montgomery himself was killed within a week. The church is still in use for worship, as part of the Church in Wales, as one of four churches in a combined parish. It is a Grade II* listed building, a national designation given to \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\", in particular because it is a \\"good Medieval rural church which retains much of its Medieval fabric\\". The circular churchyard walls and an 18th-century sundial in the churchyard have also been given listed building status. History and location St Tyfrydog's Church is in a wooded circular churchyard in the middle of the hamlet of Llandyfrydog in Anglesey, north Wales. It is about from the county town of Llangefni. Llandyfrydog takes its name from the church: the Welsh word ' originally meant \\"enclosure\\" and then \\"church\\", and \\"-dyfrydog\\" is a modified form of the saint's name. The 19th-century Anglesey historian Angharad Llwyd wrote that a church was supposed to have been first built here around 450; Samuel Lewis, writing in 1849, said that the original church was established by St Tyfyrdog himself. An upright stone about high, which stands in a field about from the village, is known as \\"the thief of Dyfrydog\\". It is said by local tradition to be a man turned into stone by St Tyfyrdog for stealing the church's bible; the lump near the top of the stone is said to be the sack on the man's shoulder. In his 1191 Itinerarium Cambriae (\\"Journey through Wales\\"), Gerald of Wales mentioned the church, saying that when the Normans were ransacking Anglesey during a Welsh revolt led by Gruffudd ap Cynan in 1098, Hugh of Montgomery, one of the Norman lords, had kept his dogs in Llandyfydog church. He added that the dogs had gone mad by the morning, and the earl had been killed within a week. A church was recorded here in 1254 during the Norwich Taxation, but the oldest part of the present building is the nave dating from about 1400. The chancel was rebuilt at the end of the 15th century or in the first part of the following century. Restoration work took place in 1823, and then again 1862, when the present porch (on the west end of the south wall) and the vestry (to the north) were added, along with other alterations. The church, which is still used for services as part of the Church in Wales, is one of four in the parish of Amlwch, the others being the churches of St Eleth, Amlwch, St Eilian, Llaneilian, and St Gwenllwyfo, Llanwenllwyfo. As of 2012, the priest in charge is H. V. Jones. The parish is in the deanery of Twrcelyn, the archdeaconry of Bangor and the Diocese of Bangor. People associated with the church include the Welsh botanist Hugh Davies, born in 1739 when his father Lewis was the rector; Thomas Ellis Owen, rector from 1794, who wrote anti-Methodist pamphlets; and James Henry Cotton (rector in 1814; appointed Dean of Bangor Cathedral in 1838). The priest and antiquarian Nicholas Owen was born in Llandyfyrdog when his father was the rector (from 1750 to 1785). Owen petitioned, unsuccessfully, on three occasions to be given the living, and he was eventually buried here. Architecture and fittings The interior of the church, showing the box pews St Tyfrydog's is built from rough, small, squared stones, dressed with limestone. The nave measures about 24 feet 9 inches by 23 feet 6 inches (about 7.5 m by 7.2 m); the chancel is about 23 feet 3 inches by 18 feet 9 inches (about 7.1 m by 5.7 m). The roof is made of slate, with a stone bellcote at the west end housing one bell. The roof timbers are visible from inside the church. There are buttresses at the east end of the nave and at the entrance to the porch. The oldest window is to the east side of the porch, on the south wall, which dates from about 1400; it has two lights (sections of window separated by a mullion) topped by trefoils, set in a rectangular window frame. It is echoed by a 19th-century window on the same wall, set slightly higher to illuminate the pulpit. The north wall has two rectangular windows, one with a pair of lights topped by cinquefoils, the other a single light with a trefoil at the top. One of the windows has been inserted into an opening previously used as a doorway. The east window, which has three lights, dates from the latter part of the 15th century, and is the only window to contain stained glass. Inside, the division between nave and chancel is marked with a pointed arch, dating from about 1400. Seating is provided in the form of painted box pews, dating from the 19th century, and possibly installed at the time of the restoration work in 1823. A survey by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire in 1937 noted an 18th-century communion table, an engraved Elizabethan silver cup and a silver paten dated 1721, and a memorial inside the church dated 1791. A 19th-century writer noted a seat near the altar with \\"R.B. 1630\\" upon it, said to mark it as belonging to the Bulkeley family (who were prominent and influential landowners, in Anglesey and elsewhere in north Wales, from the 15th to the 19th centuries). The churchyard contains a number of slate tombs and a sundial made from brass, dating from the 18th century, standing in the base of a medieval stone cross. Assessment The remains of a man who stole a bible from the church, according to legend The church has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II* listed building ‚Äì the second-highest of the three grades of listing, designating \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\". It was given this status on 12 May 1970, being regarded \\"as a good Medieval rural church which retains much of its Medieval fabric\\". Cadw (the Welsh Assembly Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and for the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists) also notes that the church still had \\"a rich vernacular character.\\" The churchyard's stone wall and the sundial have both been given listed building status, at the lower level of Grade II (for \\"buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them\\"). The 19th-century writer Samuel Lewis said that it was \\"a lofty and venerable structure, in excellent repair\\", and with \\"a remarkably large chancel.\\" Writing in 1859, the priest and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones said that the church was \\"one of the better sort\\" in Anglesey. At the time he saw the church, there was an old porch and the north door in the nave was still in use. He described the nave as \\"unusually high\\", and said that the window positioned to light the pulpit \\"disfigures the building.\\" He also thought that the \\"high\\" chancel walls gave \\"great effect\\" to the interior. A 2009 guide to the buildings of the region described it as a \\"handsomely proportioned church\\" It particularly noted the nave, describing it as \\"broad, almost a square\\", with the chancel arch \\"dying into the responds.\\" References External links * Photographs of the church * Church architectural plan from 1862 Llandyfrydog, St Tyfrydog Llandyfrydog, St Tyfrydog Category:14th-century churches Category:Rhosybol ","title":"St Tyfrydog's Church, Llandyfrydog"},{"id":"30531135","text":"El hombre y la Tierra (Spanish for The Man and the Earth) is a 1974 Spanish nature documentary television series produced by Televisi√≥n Espa√±ola.

Authenticity in art is manifest in the different ways that a work of art, or an artistic performance, can be considered authentic. The initial distinction is between nominal authenticity and expressive authenticity. In the first sense, nominal authenticity is the correct identification of the author of a work of art; of how closely an actor or an actress interprets a role in a stageplay as written by the playwright; of how well a musician‚Äôs performance of an artistic composition corresponds to the composer‚Äôs intention; and how closely an objet d‚Äôart conforms to the artistic traditions of its genre. In the second sense, expressive authenticity is how much the work of art possesses inherent authority of and about its subject, and how much of the artist‚Äôs intent is in the work of art. For the spectator, the listener, and the viewer, the authenticity of experience is an emotion impossible to recapture beyond the first encounter with the work of art in its original setting. In the cases of sculpture and of painting, the contemporary visitor to a museum encounters the work of art displayed in a simulacrum of the original setting for which the artist created the art. To that end, the museum visitor will see a curated presentation of the work of art as an objet d‚Äôart, and might not perceive the aesthetic experience inherent to observing the work of art in its original setting ‚Äî the intent of the artist. Artistic authenticity is a requirement for the inscription of an artwork to the World Heritage List of the Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation of the United Nations (UNESCO); the Nara Document on Authenticity (1994) stipulates that artistic authenticity can be expressed through the form and design; the materials and substance; the use and function; the traditions and techniques; the location and setting; and the spirit and feeling of the given work of art. Nominal authenticity =Provenance= Authenticity of provenance: The Yellow Dragon jar from the Jiajing period (1521‚Äì1567) of the Ming dynasty (1368‚Äì1644); a practical item in the 16th-century, and an objet d‚Äôart in the 21st century. The art of forgery: The Supper at Emmaus (1937), by Han van Meegeren, a Dutch master forger who deceived the Nazi leader H. G√∂ring that the painting was a genuine Vermeer painting. Mechanical reproduction of art: Facsimile of a 1611 woodcut of the Renaissance French composer Josquin des Prez (1450‚Äì1521) copied from an oil painting, the authentic work of art. The authenticity of provenance of an objet d‚Äôart is the positive identification of the artist and the place and time of the artwork‚Äôs origin; thus, art experts determine authenticity of provenance with four tests: (i) verification of the artist‚Äôs signature on the work of art; (ii) a review of the historical documentation attesting to the history of the artefact; (iii) scientific evidence (x-rays of the canvas, infrared spectroscopy of the paint, dendrochronological analysis of the wood); and (iv) the expert judgement of a conoisseur with a trained eye.Potter, Andrew. The Authenticity Hoax: How We Get Lost Finding Ourselves (2010) p. 86. In Sincerity and Authenticity (1972), the literary critic Lionel Trilling said that the question of authenticity of provenance had acquired a profoundly moral dimension, that regardless of the physical condition and appearance, the quality of workmanship of an artwork, it is greatly important to know whether or not a Ming vase is authentic or a clever art forgery. The preoccupation with the authenticity of provenance of an artwork is historically recent, and particular to Western materialism; in the Eastern world, it is the work of art, itself, which is important; the artist‚Äôs identity and the provenance of the of artwork are secondary considerations. =Art forgery= Consequent to a critically truncated career, the painter Han van Meegeren (1889‚Äì1947) earned his living as an art forger, by specifically producing fake paintings by 17th- century artists, such as Frans Hals (1582‚Äì1666) and Pieter de Hooch (1629‚Äì1684), Gerard ter Borch (1617‚Äì1681) and Johannes Vermeer (1632‚Äì1675). Van Meegeren produced masterly paintings that deceived critics and art experts, who then accepted and acclaimed the forgeries as genuine masterpieces, especially the Supper at Emmaus (1937) painting accepted as a real Vermeer by experts, such as Abraham Bredius. In the event, to survive the Second World War (1939‚Äì1945), van Meegeren dealt forgeries to the Nazi occupiers of the Netherlands (1940‚Äì1945). In the post‚ÄìWar reckoning among the nation, the Dutch authorities arrested van Meegeren as a Nazi collaborator who had sold national treasures to the enemy. To avoid a traitor‚Äôs death, the painter van Meegeren showed his artistic skills as a forger of paintings by the Old Masters, to prove he sold forgeries to the Nazis. To guard against unwittingly buying a forged work of art, sellers and buyers use a certificate of authenticity as documentary proof that an artwork is the genuine creation of the artist identified as the author of the work ‚Äî yet there is much business in counterfeit certificates of authenticity, which determines the monetary value of a work of art. The inauthenticity of forged painting is discovered with documentary evidence from art history and with forensic evidence gleaned from the techniques of art conservation, such as chronological dating, to establish the authenticity of provenance of paintings by the Old Masters. The potential monetary value represented by a certificate of authenticity can prejudice collectors and art dealers to buy recent-period artworks with determined provenance, sometimes established by the artist. =Forgery as art= Critical interest in a forgery as a work of art is rare; yet, in the essay ‚ÄúThe Perfect Fake‚Äù (1961), the critic of architecture and art Aline B. Saarinen asked what ‚ÄúIf a fake is so expert, that even after the most thorough and trustworthy examination, its authenticity is still open to doubt, is it or is it not as satisfactory a work of art as if it were unequivocally genuine?‚Äù In The Act of Creation (1964), Arthur Koestler concurred with Saarinen‚Äôs proposition of ‚Äúforgery as an art‚Äù, and said that if a forgery fits into the body of work of an artist, and if the forgery produces the same aesthetic pleasure as the authentic artworks, then the forged art should be included to exhibitions of the works of the plagiarised artist. In the art business, the artistic value of a well-executed forgery is irrelevant to a curator concerned with the authenticity of provenance of the original work of art ‚Äî especially because formally establishing the provenance of a work of art is a question of possibility and probability, rarely of certainty, unless the artist vouches for the authenticity of the art. Nevertheless, to the arts community, a forgery remains a forgery, regardless of the excellent artistic execution of the forgery, itself; regardless of the artistic talent of the forger; and regardless of critical praise when critics and public believed the forgery was authentic art. =Mechanical reproduction= Relief printing is a form of mechanical reproduction of art; thus (i) an artist created a drawing; (ii) a craftsman used the drawing to create a woodcut block for relief-printing, usually destroying the original artwork when cutting the drawing into the block of wood; and (iii) the woodblock, itself, was discarded when worn-out for relief printing copies of the drawing. From that three-step process for the production of art, the printed copies of the original drawing are the final product of artistic creation, yet there exists no authentic work of art; the artistic copies have no authenticity of provenance. In the essay ‚ÄúThe Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction‚Äù (1935), Walter Benjamin discussed the then-new visual media of photography and cinematography as machines capable of producing art that can be reproduced many times ‚Äî yet no one version of the image is the original, artistically authentic image. As visual media that reproduce ‚Äî but do not create ‚Äî original images, photography and the cinema shift the concept of artistic authenticity from ‚Äúart as ritual‚Äù to ‚Äúart as politics‚Äù and so make works of art accessible to the mass population, rather than just the aficionado. A contemporary extension of Benjamin‚Äôs observations is the perpetual authenticity of the sculpture Sunbather (1971), by the artist Duane Hanson (1925‚Äì1996), who gave permission to the conservators of the life-sized sculpture (a woman sunbathing whilst reclining in a chaise longue) to replace parts of the sculpture (cap, swimming suit, towel, etc.) that became faded and worn. Likewise, in light of the artistic production and mechanical reproduction capabilities of computers and the internet, the media artist Julian H. Scaff said that the authenticity of provenance of a digital image (painting, still photograph, cinema frame) cannot be determined, because a digital work of art usually exists in more than one version, and each version is not created, but authored by a different digital artist with a different perspective of what is art. Authenticity of experience Tara (Sri Lanka, 8th c.) in a secular setting (a museum) is unlike the aesthetic experience of beholding the statue-as-goddess in the original setting (a temple). Authenticity of experience is available only to the spectator who experiences a work of art in the original setting for which the artist created the artefact. In another setting, the authenticity of experience (purpose, time, place) is impossible; thus, in the Western world, the museum display is an approximation (literal, metaphoric) of the original setting for the which the artist created the work of art. Isolated exhibition in a museum diminishes the aesthetic experience of a work of art, although the spectator will see the work of art. Lacking the original context (place, time, purpose ) limits aesthetic appreciation than experience of the work of art in the original setting ‚Äî where the art and the setting are the aesthetic intent of the artist. Recognizing that authenticity of experience is unique and cannot be recaptured, the curator of a museum presents works of art in literal and metaphoric displays that approximate the original settings for which the artists created the artworks. Realised with artifice and lighting, the museum displays provide the spectator a sensory experience of the works of art. In that commercial vein, the tour business sells ‚Äúthe experience of art‚Äù as a facsimile of the authenticity of experience of art. The tourist consumes ‚ÄúCulture‚Äù by attending an opera at La Scala, an 18th-century opera house at Milano. The natural audience, informed opera aficionados, lose interest and cease attending regularly, but the opera house is a business, and continues presenting performances for aficionados of culture and for tourists with, perhaps, an understanding of the opera ‚Äî the art being experienced. Likewise, to earn a living as artists, Pacific islander dancers present their ‚ÄúPacific islander culture‚Äù as entertainment for and edification of tourists. Although the performances of Pacific-islander native culture might be nominally authentic art, in the sense of being true to the original culture, the authenticity of experience of the art is questionable. Cultural authenticity Cultural authenticity: An Haitian Vodou fetish statue of a devil with twelve eyes. Cultural authenticity: A carved-wood bulul is a stylized representation of an ancestor that gains power from the presence of an ancestral spirit. Dating from the 15th century, bulul figurines guarded the community‚Äôs rice crop, feature in traditional ceremonies, and are souvenirs sold to tourists to the Philippine Islands. The authenticity of provenance establishes the material existence of the work of art; the identity of the artist; and when and where the artist created the work of art. Cultural authenticity ‚Äî genre and artistic style ‚Äî concerns whether or not a work of art is a genuine expression of artistic tradition. Concern with the cultural authenticity of a work of art usually originates from romanticism about the greater artistic value of artefacts created in ‚Äúthe pure tradition‚Äù of the genre; such an idealistic perspective usually derives from nationalism and racism and tribalism, and misunderstandings of aesthetics. A work of art is authentic when executed in the style, with the materials, and by the production process that are essential attributes of the genre. Cultural authenticity derives from the artistic traditions created by the artists of the ethnic group. A genre artwork is authentic only if created by an artist from the ethnic group; therefore, only the Inuit people can create authentic Inuit art. The philosophic and sociologic perspective of the authenticity of expression is what protects artists from the art thefts inherent and consequent to cultural appropriation; nonetheless, in the essay ‚ÄúRace, Ethnicity, Expressive Authenticity: Can White People Sing the Blues?‚Äù Joel Rudinow disagreed and defended cultural appropriation, and said that such protectiveness of cultural authenticity is a form of racism. =The art business= In the West, the market for ‚Äúprimitive art‚Äù arose and developed at the end of the 19th century, consequent to European explorers and colonialists meeting and trading with the cultural and ethnic groups of Africa, Asia, and Oceania. Artistically, the native peoples who dealt with the explorers and colonists quickly incorporated to their production of art new materials from Europe, such as cloth and glass beads. Yet European collectors and art dealers would not buy ‚Äúinauthentic‚Äù, mixed-media primitive art made with native and European materials. To overcome resistance to inauthentic primitive art, the art dealers produced artefacts, made with local materials, which Westerners would accept and buy as authentic native art. The 19th-century business model of artistic production remains the contemporary practise in selling authentic objets d‚Äôart to Western collectors and aficionados. Usually, the artefacts are designed and modified to give the impression of possessing popular attributes and authentic provenance, such as religious-ritual use, antiquity, and association with aristocracy and royalty. In the 20th century, during the 1940s, Haitian artists created commercial reproductions of ‚Äúvoodoo images‚Äù provided to them by foreign businessmen, to sell as ‚Äúauthentic voodoo art.‚Äù To the Haitian artists, the foreign representations of Haitian artistic culture, which they were paid to make, demonstrated the art-theft inherent to cultural appropriation and how White foreigners truly saw Haitian Vodou art as a commercial commodity, and not as religious art. =Deities and souvenirs= To distinguish a work of art from a crude artefact made for tourists, art collectors consider an artwork to be artistically authentic when it meets recognised standards of artistic production (design, materials, manufacture) for an original purpose. In the Philippine Islands, throughout their history, the Igorot people have used carved-wood bulul figurines to guard the rice crop; the bulul is a highly stylized representation of an ancestor that gains power from the presence of an ancestral spirit. Although still used in traditional ceremonies, the Igorot people now produce souvenir bulul figurines for tourists; a secondary purpose that does not devalue the bulul as art. Within the culture, an Igorot family might use a souvenir bulul as suitable and acceptable for traditional ceremonies ‚Äî thereby granting the souvenir bulul an artistic and cultural authenticity otherwise absent. From that perspective, ‚Äútribal masks and sculptures‚Äù actually used in religious ceremonies have greater commodity value, especially if authenticity of provenance determines that a native artist created the artefact by using traditional designs, materials, and production techniques. Such Western over- valuation of native art is predicated by the artefact being an authentic example of a tradition or style of art practised by a primitive people. =Invented traditions= The artistic evolution of the Maroon people of French Guiana, shows that contemporary artistic styles developed through the interaction of art and commerce, between artists and art businessmen. The long history and strong traditions of Maroon art are notable in the forms of decoration of everyday objects, such as boat paddles and window shutters, art of entirely aesthetic purpose. To sell Maroon artworks, European art collectors assigned symbolism to the ‚Äúnative art‚Äù they sold in the art markets, to collectors, and to museums; a specific provenance. Despite the mutual miscommunication betwixt artists and businessmen about the purpose, value, and price of works of art, Maroon artists used the European semiotic language to assign symbolic meanings to their works of native art, and make a living; yet young Maroon artists might mistakenly believe that the (commercial) symbolism derives from ancestral traditions, rather than from the art business. Expressive authenticity The singer Tina Turner and the guitarist Eric Clapton are known for the expressive authenticity of their arts, rather than authenticity of tradition. Authenticity of expression derives from the work of art possessing the original and inherent authority of the artist‚Äôs intent, that the work is an original product of aesthetic expression. In musical performance, authenticity of expression can conflict with authenticity of performance when the performance of the musician or the singer is true to his or her artistry, and is not an imitation of another artist. The greater popularity of the performer, rather than of the composer of the song and the music, is an historically recent development that reflects the public‚Äôs greater interest in the expressive authenticity of charismatic musicians who possess a distinctive artistic style. In the fields of art and of aesthetics, the term expressive authenticity derives from the psychological term Authenticity, as used in existential philosophy, regarding mental health as a person‚Äôs self-knowledge about his or her relation to the real world. In that vein, the artistic production of Abstract Expressionists, such as Jackson Pollock (1912‚Äì1956), Arshile Gorky (1904‚Äì1948)), and Willem de Kooning (1904‚Äì1997), have been understood in existentialist terms about the artists‚Äô relation with and to the world; likewise the cinematic art of the cin√©astes Jean-Luc Godard and Ingmar Bergman (1904‚Äì1997). Expressive authenticity derives from the artist‚Äôs authenticity of style and tradition, thus an outsider‚Äôs appropriation of voice is disallowed because the cultural group already have native artists producing authentic art. In the American music business, the Hip hop genre originally was musical art created by poor Black people to address their discontents about the poverty, ignorance, and racism imposed upon them in American society. Artists debate if Hip hop‚Äôs profitable transition from the artistic underground to the commercial mainstream has voided the authenticity of expression of the music. In ‚ÄúAuthenticity Within Hip Hop and Other Cultures Threatened with Assimilation‚Äù, the academic Kembrew McLeod said that the cultural authenticity of Hip hop is threatened by assimilation into the music business, where commercialism replaces expressive authenticity. Authenticity of performance Authenticity of performance: A Baroque music ensemble playing Baroque period instruments, using period techniques, whilst dressed in contemporary garb. In the theatre and in music, the performers (actors, actresses, musicians) are responsible for realising a performance of the respective work of art, a stageplay, a musical concert. An historically informed performance of a play by Shakespeare, the women characters would be portrayed by actors, not actresses, as was the custom in the Elizabethan era (1558‚Äì1603) and the dialogue would be enunciated and pronounced in the Elizabethan style of speech. In an historically informed performance, the actors and the musicians replicate the time period of the work of art they are performing, usually by way of period-correct language and costumes and styles of performance and musical instruments. The musicians would consider inauthentic any performance of the Elvira Madigan piano concerto that the pianist played on a contemporary grand piano, an instrument unknown to the composer W.A. Mozart (1756‚Äì1791).

The Crescendo team organise an annual festival in Saint-Palais- sur-Mer (Charente-Maritime, France), which has taken place every third weekend of August since 1999.La capitale du rock progressif dans Sud-Ouest The idea is to introduce the audience to Progressive Rock music and to please its loyal fans whilst focusing on the quality of the performances rather than on a commercial purpose. Historical background Crescendo was created in 1999 by two Progressive Rock music fans from Saint-Palais-sur-Mer : Sebastien Monteaud and Jean-Claude Adelmand. The very first festival welcomed three bands on stage, playing for over five hours in an auditorium in Royan (Charente- Maritime, France). Although the event was very encouraging, Crescendo faced an unsecured future due to financial issues and had to redirect its goal. That's why the current festival is now free and runs over three days in the open air, on the Conci√© Esplanade in Saint-Palais-sur-Mer, where tourists and fans meet in the month of August. Its increasing success is attracting more and more people every summer, with between 3000 and 5000 visitors in 2010. The Conci√© Esplanade turns into a huge stage, welcoming ten Progressive Rock bands with musicians coming from many different countries such as Ukraine, Canada and South America. For example, in 2009, Antony Kalugin and Valentina Chalaydyuck, from Kharkiv (Ukraine) introduced their band \\"Sunchild\\" and travelled back the year after just to be part of the 2010 festival., dans Sud Ouest, 21 ao√ªt 2010.

The unit was a General Surveillance Radar and Ground Control Intercept (GCI)squadron providing for the air defense of the United States. Its call sign was Rollerskate and was the primary controller site for the 54th Fighter Interceptor Squadron (FIS), call sign Campaign. Rollerskate controllers guided three different Air Force fighters during intercepts while in operation.

Rollerskate intercept controllers were distinguished for being the first GCI site to successfully intercept and technically shoot down Major General Jarred V Crabb during a surprise evaluation of Rollerskate by senior CADF officers. Major General Crabb, who had assumed command of Central Air Defense Force, was flying an F-102 when three of 13 F-86D's were successfully guided to the \\"SPLASH.\\" General Crabb was on his way to Great Falls AFB with orders for any operational unit to try an intercept him on his route. Rollerskate knew they were to scramble one alert bird in an effort to intercept the general, what they didn't know was four additional flights of three were scrambled without their knowledge. As each flight of three were taking off, an Operational Readiness Inspection (ORI) team ordered the gate guard not to call the operations room until they entered the radar ops building. This left the officer on duty, Lt. Frank Imel and his Intercept Control Tech S/SGT Charles Diaz, to successfully control all the 13 Dogs. The evaluation officers were amazed by Lt. Imel and his crews performance during the mission. When General Crabb heard the three \\"SPLASHES\\" he decided to land at Ellsworth and by saying, \\"Bullsxxt, I want to see the camera film.\\" After reviewing the gun camera film, General Crabb commended the three pilots and gave a special well done to Lt. Imel. General Crabb agreed he had in fact been shot down. Rollerskate had some of the best GCI controllers in ADC.

It is located entirely within the Parkside ward, to which the park lends its name, bound by Abbey Road, Park Drive, Greengate Street and Park Avenue. Barrow Park was designed by Thomas Mawson in 1908 and was constructed in stages over the following two decades. Originally sited on the outskirts of Barrow, the park is now more or less central due to rapid growth of the town northwards during the early 20th century. It is designated by Historic England as Grade II on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. The park contains a large boating lake, mini railway, skate park, various playgrounds and The Park Leisure Centre. The Barrow Parkrun takes place within the park every Saturday. Large sections of Barrow Park were redeveloped in 2005 to include a new pavilion, caf√©, bandstand and display glasshouse. The park has since gained Green Flag status. Features =The Park Leisure Centre= The multi- functional leisure facility is located in the eastern perimeter off Barrow Park and is home to two large swimming pools, a gym, exercise studios and a sports hall. The Park Leisure Centre as with the park itself is owned and operated by Barrow Borough Council and offers numerous classes while also accommodating for groups and the general public. The leisure centre also maintains a number of outdoor artificial pitches for various sports. =Cenotaph= The most iconic feature of Barrow Park is the town's principal cenotaph; commemorating almost 900 Barrovians who lost their lives in various wars.

The earliest record of the name dates from 1317 when William Saket of Southborough, St Peter in Thanet, was in a legal dispute with the Abbot of St Augustine, Canterbury.David Oliver, Late Medi√¶val Thanet and the Cinque Ports (Broadstairs, Kent: The Author, 1997). The Sacketts were among the first colonists of America, with Simon Sackett arriving at the Massachusetts Bay Colony a few months after the Winthrop Fleet of 1630, and John Sackett, possibly a nephew of Simon, arriving at the New Haven Colony sometime before 1641.Charles H. Weygant, The Sacketts of America: Their Ancestors and Descendants, 1630‚Äì1907 (Newburgh, NY: The Author, 1907).Robert Anderson, The Great Migration Begins ‚Äì Immigrants to New England 1620-1633 (Boston: New England Historic Genealogical Society, 1995).  Variants  Early variants were Sakt and Saket. Later records are of Sacket, Sackett, Sackette. The only extant forms are Sacket and Sackett, with Sackett predominating.  Origin of the surname  Several derivations of the surname Sackett have been proposed: * descent from Adam le Sackere, a \\"sacker\\" and exporter of wool; * manufacturer of sacks, being a diminutive of either Old English sacc or Norse-Viking Sekkr; * a nickname from Middle English sa(c)ket ‚Äòsmall sack, purse‚Äô, perhaps for a maker of purses;Oxford Dictionary of Family Names, 2016 * an \\"adversary\\", from French Sacquet and Old German Sacco, meaning to dispute, strive, blame;Henry Harrison, Surnames of the United Kingdom: a Concise Etymological Dictionary (London: Eaton Press, 1912). * a \\"cottager by the sea\\", the early form \\"Saket\\" meaning \\"sea\\", then pronounced \\"say\\", and \\"cot\\", on the analogy of Beckett, \\"bee\\" and \\"cot\\" indicating a cottager who kept bees.Alfred Barrett Sackett, MC, MA, (1895‚Äì1977), private papers. The word \\"sacket\\" has two dictionary definitions: a bag; and a term of reproach or abuse.Oxford English Dictionary. None of these possible derivations of the surname is likely. Any would have resulted in the name arising independently in different places; but such is the concentration of the name in early records in a small area of Thanet that it may be supposed that the name originated in a single family. Certainly, the surname, first found in 1317, is seen to predate the earliest recorded use (c1440) of the word \\"sakett\\" meaning a bag.  Notable Sacketts  * Albert M. Sackett (1920-2016), Rear Admiral, US Navy, fought in three wars (World War II, Korea and Vietnam) and served 40 years of active duty. * David Sackett, OC, FRSC (1934‚Äì2015) is a Canadian medical doctor and a pioneer in evidence- based medicine. * Frederic Mosley Sackett (1868‚Äì1941) was US Ambassador to Germany during the collapse of the Weimar Republic and Hitler's rise to power. * Delos Bennett Sackett (1822‚Äì1885) was a commander in the American Civil War and became Inspector General of the United States Army. * William A.

History =As Sining Makulay Inc.= The origins of Home Cable can be traced its origins to Sining Makulay, Inc.

SMI was owned by Roberto Benedicto, a businessman and one of political cronies of then-President Ferdinand Marcos. Back then, it used to be carrying clear- quality channels to residents living in exclusive villages and hotels in Metro Manila. In 1987, when President Corazon Aquino issued Executive Order No. 50 which ended the monopoly of SMI and the company ceased operations. In the 1990s, SMI was eventually bought by Unilink Communications Corporation. =As Home Cable, merger with Sky and closure= After the acquisition by Unilink Communications Corporation, SMI resumed its cable operations as Home Cable, competing with rival Sky Cable.

These acts forced a part of the local Croat population to leave the area in 1992. Most of them were resettled in Croatia. The affected locations included Hrtkovci, Nikinci, Novi Slankamen, Ruma, ≈†id, and other places bordering Croatia. According to some estimates, around 10,000 Croats left Vojvodina under political pressure in three months of 1992, and a total of 20,000 fled by the end of the year. The U.N.-backed International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) later indicted Vojislav ≈†e≈°elj for these events. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison for persecution on political, racial or religious grounds, deportation and forced transfer as a crime against humanity, making it the only conviction of the Tribunal in relation to Yugoslav Wars on the territory of Vojvodina. Description Vojvodina is a province of Serbia. According to the 1991 census, its population was 2,012,517. Serbs comprised 57.2%, Hungarians 16.9% of its population, or 1,151,353 and 430,946 members, respectively. Croats numbered 74,226 members or 3.7% of Vojvodina's population (down from 109,203 from the 1981 census). In 1991, Hrtkovci was an ethnically mixed village with Croatian plurality (40.24%), located roughly 40 miles west of Belgrade. Vojislav ≈†e≈°elj, the leader of the Serbian Radical Party, made numerous public threats to Croats in May 1992. Radicals replaced all Latin signs with Cyrillic ones and even renamed Hrtkovci to \\"Srbislavci\\" - 'place of Serbs' - though only for a short amount of time. ≈†e≈°elj personally visited Hrtkovci on 6 May 1992 and gave a hate speech by publicly reading out a list of 17 Croat \\"traitors\\" who must leave the village. Incoming Serb refugees labeled Croats as \\"fascists\\". Following the threats, one part of local Croats rushed to Croatia to see the houses which were offered to them in the planned population transfer. One Croat was even murdered by the radicals. ≈†e≈°elj's party even crafted a slogan for their campaign: \\"All Croats out of Hrtkovci\\".Final report of the United Nations Commission of Experts, established pursuant to UN Security Council resolution 780 (1992), Annex III.A ‚Äî M. Cherif Bassiouni; S/1994/674/Add.2 (Vol. IV), 27 May 1994, Special Forces , (paragraph 1091). Accessdate January 20, 2011 In 1991, Hrtkovci had 2,684 residents, including 1,080 Croats (40.2%), 555 Serbs and Montenegrins (20.7%), 515 Hungarians (19.2%), and 445 Yugoslavs (16.6%). By the end of 1992, 75% of its residents were Serbs. The number of Croats who left from the village of Hrtkovci was between 722 and 1,200. Their empty homes were settled by Serb refugees from Croatia and Bosnia. Likewise, some Serbs tried to protect their Croatian neighbors. After the events, Yugoslav authorities arrested five radicals who were responsible for harassment of Croats. In its 1993 report, published during its 49th session, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights wrote that Hungarians and Croats in Vojvodina were subjected to \\"verbal and physical threats and other acts of intimidation, including setting houses on fire and destroying cultural and religious monuments\\", and thus left their homes in large numbers after Vojvodina lost its autonomy. Another reason for their departure was that many were refusing to be drafted in the Yugoslav army, fearing they might be sent to the battle front. Besides Hrtkovci, the report documented an exodus of Croats from Kukujevci and Novi Slankamen, as a result of threats and the bombing of their houses. The villages of Be≈°ka and Golubinci were said to have lost their entire respective Croat population. Other means of intimidation included threatening telephone calls and letters. The report alleged that \\"the police have acquiesced in some of the incidents which have been attributed to individuals.\\" On 23 February 1993, the Commission adopted a resolution expressing its \\"grave concern\\" at the \\"violations of human rights occurring in Sand≈æak and Vojvodina, particularly acts of physical harassment, abductions, the burning of homes, warrantless searches, confiscation of property and other practices intended to change the ethnic structure in favour of the Serbian population.\\" On 29 August 1992, the BBC reported bombings of Croatian homes in the village of Nikinci. In Golubinci, twenty cases were recorded where bombs were planted inside Croat houses. A 28-year old Croat woman was killed in her home on 7 February 1994. The Serbian Humanitarian Law Centre, based in Belgrade, has documented at least 17 instances of killings or disappearances of Croats from Vojvodina from 1991-1995. In many instances, entire Croat families were abducted and murdered. On the 20 April 1992, the Matijeviƒá family, consisting of Ana and Jozo Matijeviƒá and their underage son, Franjo, were kidnapped by unknown Serb militiamen from the village of Kukujevci. From there, they were taken to Mohovo, then occupied by Croatian Serb forces, where the family was then murdered and buried in the village cemetery. In July 1993, another Croat family from Kukujevci, consisting of Nikola and Agica Oksomiƒá and 87-year-old Marija Tomiƒá, Agica's mother, were murdered by two local Serb volunteers fighting for Croatian Serb forces in Croatia. According to different sources, between 20,000 and 25,000 Croats left Vojvodina in the 1990s. Some sources even place the number at up to 50,000. Sedamnaest godina od proterivanja Hrvata iz Hrtkovaca, Zoran Glavonjiƒá Another 6,000 left Kosovo and 5,000 Serbia Proper, including Belgrade. Legal prosecution In 2003, Vojislav ≈†e≈°elj was indicted by the U.N. established International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). On 11 April 2018, the Appeals Chamber of the follow-up International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals (IRMCT) sentenced him to 10 years in prison under Counts 1, 10, and 11 of the indictment for instigating deportation, persecution on political, racial or religious ground (forcible displacement), and other inhumane acts (forcible transfer) as crimes against humanity due to his speech in Hrtkovci on 6 May 1992, in which he called for the expulsion of Croats from Vojvodina.

Cheryl and Neville Williams and business partner John Minion purchased the site in 2008 with funding from Lloyds TSB Commercial, private investment, and a Yorkshire Forward grant. The site was renovated over the 20082009 winter, and officially opened by Justin Fletcher, MBE (also known as Mr Tumble from CBeebies) on 4 April 2009. In February 2010, the park rescued 13 lions from a Romanian zoo and, after their quarantine period, released them into the newly built Lion Country enclosure. In 2011, the zoo opened Land of the Tigers, which contains two pools and a waterfall and was created next to a wetland reserve. Visitors view the tigers from a long raised walkway, with the tiger enclosure on one side of the walkway and the wetlands on the other. In March 2012, the park opened Leopard Heights, a ¬£300,000 open-topped enclosure that lets visitors view the Amur leopards from an viewing tower or from ground level through a long glass wall. The enclosure is claimed to be the largest leopard enclosure in the world. In July 2014, the park opened a large enclosure for polar bears, named Project Polar, with the first bear being 500 kg male Victor; a second arrived in March 2015 called Pixel, who is Victor's grandson. On 15 April 2015, Yorkshire Wildlife Park announced that one of its Amur tigers had given birth to three cubs on 29 March 2015. The park's popularity surged soon after its opening, starting in 2009 with only 66,000 visitors; it hosted 323,000 in 2011. Animals and exhibits =Lion Country= Lion Country was opened in May 2010 to house 13 African lions, which were acquired from Oradea Zoological Garden in Romania in February 2010. The lions had been kept in small enclosures and poor living conditions, and were in poor health as the Romanian zoo could not adequately care for them. Ten years on there are six lions in Lion Country: Simba, Maria, Carla, Crystal, Julie and Ares. =Lemur Woods= Lemur Woods is a walk-through enclosure with many trees, housing groups of ring-tailed and red-bellied lemurs. The lemurs can often be seen climbing high in the trees, or sunbathing on the ground. Twice a day, visitors can stand and watch the keepers feed the Lemurs. They get very close - within touching distance - and it's one of the popular areas of the park. =Meerkat and Mongoose Manor= Located close to the entrance to the park, this small exhibit houses the zoo's meerkats and yellow mongoose groups. =Into Africa= The centrepiece of the Into Africa zone is African Plains, a large multi-species paddock themed around the African savannah. Species in the enclosure include ostriches, a mixed group of Rothschild's giraffe and Reticulated giraffe, lechwe, grevy's zebra and common eland. The giraffe group have a separate paddock for the winter months, with regular access to the much larger savannah themed exhibit. Opposite is an enclosure for the critically endangered black rhinoceros. Themed around the scrublands of East Africa, the enclosure has space for two rhinos and features several mud wallows and a large, open grassland space. =Land of the Tigers= Land of the Tigers houses three Amur tigers: three adults, named Sayan, Vladimir, and Tschuna. The enclosure features two pools and a waterfall, as well as a 150-metre walkway for visitors. The tigers can often be seen playing together or even climbing trees, which they seem to enjoy a lot. =Project Polar= Opened in August 2014, Project Polar houses three male polar bears named Pixel, Nissan and Nobby. These are the only polar bears in an English zoo. The largest enclosure is ten acres in size and features two pools, the largest of which is eight metres deep and contains 25.5 million gallons of water. This is one of the largest polar bear enclosures in the world and the only zoo to house the species in England as of 2020. =South America Viva= South America Viva is a walk-through enclosure displaying several South American species, including Patagonian mara, white-faced saki monkey, Azara's agouti and capybara. There are also separate enclosures housing six-banded armadillo, Venezuelan red howler, giant anteaters, cotton-top tamarins and giant otters, which are situated near a South America-themed restaurant called \\"iCaramba!\\". =Baboon Reserve= right Opened in Easter 2013, the Baboon Reserve houses a troop of Guinea baboons which came from Edinburgh Zoo. =Leopard Heights= Leopard Heights houses two leopards Amur leopards:, named Drake and Freya. The enclosure is 6000 square metres in size, features climbing frames up to ten metres tall, and cost ¬£300,000 to build. =Hyenas of Harar= The first part of Yorkshire Wildlife Park's 2020 expansion to open, Hyenas of Harar is home to a breeding clan of Spotted Hyenas. =Simien Mountains= Opened in 2020, Simien Mountains is themed around the foothills of Ethiopia and is home to a large troop of Geladas. =Himalayan Pass= The third 2020 expansion, Himalayan Pass, has a mountainous theme and includes exhibits for Red Pandas and a family of Smooth-coated Otters. =Sea Lions= In late 2020, YWP confirmed that a new colony of six California sea lions would be joining the collection in spring 2021, from ZSL Whipsnade Zoo as part of the ongoing expansion. =Rehabilitation Centre= The Rehabilitation Centre is an educational facility aimed at educating visitors on the park's global conservation efforts and rescue work focused on animals held in poor conditions in other collections. The Centre has exhibited several rescued species over the years in a series of large, temporary exhibits. The rescued species are often held until they can move elsewhere in the park, or until new homes in other zoos are found. The first residents were four Ussuri Brown Bear rescued from a zoo in Japan. However, all four were elderly and in poor health upon their arrival and died within a year of coming to the park. The next resident was a fifth male Polar Bear, called Rasputin, who arrived in late 2019. Rasputin is soon to be moved to another zoo in Estonia to create a breeding pair with an eligible female there. =Other animals= Other notable animals in the park's collection include Bennett's wallabies, African wild dogs, visayan warty pigs, Bactrian camels, okapi, roloway monkey, african spurred tortoise, emu, kirk's dik-dik and various species of birds, reptiles and invertebrates featured in handling and educational displays.

The Hidden Reality: Parallel Universes and the Deep Laws of the Cosmos is a book by Brian Greene published in 2011 which explores the concept of the multiverse and the possibility of parallel universes. It has been nominated for the Royal Society Winton Prize for Science Books for 2012. Content In his book, Greene discussed nine types of parallel universes: * The quilted multiverse conditions in an infinite universe necessarily repeat across space, yielding parallel worlds. * The inflationary multiverse says that eternal cosmological inflation yields an enormous network of bubble universes, of which our universe would be one. * The brane multiverse states that in M-theory, in the brane world scenario, our universe exists on one three-dimensional brane, which floats in a higher dimensional expanse potentially populated by other branes ‚Äì other parallel universes. * The cyclic multiverse is saying that collisions between braneworlds can manifest as big bang-like beginnings, yielding universes that are parallel in time. * The landscape multiverse states that by combining inflationary cosmology and string theory, the many different shapes for string theory's extra dimensions give rise to many different bubble universes. * The quantum multiverse creates a new universe when a diversion in events occurs, as in the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. * The holographic multiverse is derived from the theory that the surface area of a space can simulate the volume of the region. * The simulated multiverse implies that technological leaps suggest that the universe is just a simulation. * The ultimate multiverse is the ultimate theory, saying the principle of fecundity asserts that every possible universe is a real universe, thereby obviating the question of why one possibility ‚Äì ours ‚Äì is special. These universes instantiate all possible mathematical equations. Reception *Timothy Ferris reports in the review in The New York Times Book Review that ‚ÄúIf extraterrestrials landed tomorrow and demanded to know what the human mind is capable of accomplishing, we could do worse than to hand them a copy of this book.‚Äù *Anthony Doerr, in his On Science column of the Boston Globe, wrote that \\"Greene might be the best intermediary I‚Äôve found between the sparkling, absolute zero world of mathematics and the warm, clumsy world of human language.\\" Doerr praised Greene's use of analogies to explain the complex phenomena of parallel universes. *John Gribbin, in the Wall Street Journal, declared that The Hidden Reality was \\"Mr. Greene's weakest book\\", but conceded that Greene's earlier books \\"left him with such high standards to live up to that this is not really surprising.\\" Gribbin also criticized the lack of depth on certain subjects, such as M-theory and the interactions of three-dimensional universes. *Publishers Weekly hails The Hidden Reality ‚ÄúAn in-depth yet marvelously accessible look inside the perplexing world of modern theoretical physics and cosmology . . .

Life  Anzac Cove Mehmed Esad was born into an Albanian Muslim family in Yanya (now Ioannina) on October 18, 1862, the son of Mehmed Emin Efendi, who had served as mayor of the city.Kayaloff p.14 According to Jacques Kayaloff, he was of Albanian origin. His brother, also an Albanian Mehmed Wehib (1877‚Äì1940), also became a distinguished general. Esad spent the first seventeen years of his life in Yanya and later attended the military school at Monastir (modern Bitola). While there Esad's knowledge of Ottoman Turkish was limited and he took additional lessons to broaden his competency in the language. He would reflect later in life that local Muslims of Yanya barely had any knowledge of Turkish. Having polished up his skills in Ottoman Turkish Esad attended the Ottoman Military Academy, graduating in 1884. After a period of service in a regiment, he was selected for the Ottoman Military College in 1887, graduating as a General Staff officer in 1890. His excellent performance led to his immediate dispatch to attend the Prussian War Academy in Berlin, from where he graduated in May 1894.Erickson (2007), pp. 51‚Äì52 After a stint at the General Staff, he was promoted to Lt Colonel and given a teaching position at the War Academy. By the time the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 broke out, he had been promoted to Colonel, and he commanded a regiment during the war. In 1899, he was placed as head of training at the War Academy. In 1901 he was promoted to Mirliva (Brigadier) and to Ferik (Major General) in 1906. From 1907 he served as Chief of Staff of the Third Army at Thessaloniki.Erickson (2007), p. 52 In 1911, he commanded the 5th Regular (Redif) Division at Gallipoli for a short period before returning to Yanya to command the 23rd Regular Division. It was at this post that the outbreak of the First Balkan War found him. Esat was immediately detached from divisional command and placed in charge of the provisional Yanya Corps, tasked with defending the well-fortified city and the wider region of Epirus. Esad succeeded in defending Yanya for several months against the Greek Army, but was finally forced to capitulate after the Battle of Bizani on 4‚Äì6 March 1913. Esat remained in Greek captivity as a prisoner of war until 2 December 1913. His defence of Yanya however had earned him the status of a popular hero, as well as the honorific title of \\"Pasha\\". Almost immediately upon his return, on 10 December, he was appointed commander of the III Corps at Gallipoli, which he would lead into battle during the Gallipoli Campaign. The III Corps quickly established itself as one of the most combat- worthy formations in the Ottoman army, as most of its units and soldiers had recent fighting experience from the Balkan Wars. It is indicative that when the Ottoman Army mobilized upon its entry in World War I, Esad's corps was the only one to do so within the prescribed timeframe. Although most accounts of the Battle of Gallipoli tend to focus on the role of Fifth Army's commander, German general Liman von Sanders, and on Mehmed Esad's subordinate, Mustafa Kemal Pasha (better known as Atat√ºrk, the founder of modern Turkey),Erickson (2007), pp. 28, 51 it was Mehmed Esad who prepared the Ottoman defences during the battle, and who actively commanded the Ottoman army in the Gallipoli peninsula during the battle.cf. Erickson (2007), pp. 53‚Äì54 In October 1915, Esad was appointed as CO of First Army, succeeding Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz, who was dispatched to the Mesopotamian front. In late 1917, Esad visited Germany and toured the German fronts. In February 1918 he was placed in command of the Fifth Army, and in June, of the Third Army on the Caucasus front. After the Armistice of Mudros, and until his retirement on 22 November 1919, he served as Inspector-General of the mostly demobilized Second Army. In 1920, Esad Pasha served as Navy Minister in the short-lived cabinet of Hulusi Salih Pasha. In 1934, due to the Surname Law he adopted the name \\"B√ºlkat\\". He died in Istanbul in 1952. A selection of his memories was published in 1975 under the title Esat Pa≈üa'nƒ±n √áanakkale Anƒ±larƒ± (Esat Pasha's √áanakkale Memoirs).

It is located 6.3 miles northwest of Sundance, Wyoming. It was closed in 1968. History Sundance Air Force Station came into existence as part of Phase III of the Air Defense Command Mobile Radar program. On October 20, 1953 ADC requested a third phase of twenty-five radar sites be constructed. The station became operational with the activation of the 731st Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 1 December 1960, feeding data to DC-19 at Minot AFB, North Dakota. Operational status was delayed at Sundance AFS to allow testing to determine if atomic energy could be used to produce sufficient power to operate a radar station. A Portable Medium 1 (PM-1) transportable nuclear power plant developed by the US Army Nuclear Power Program was designed and installed on the site. The tests succeeded, and the site became operational in 1962 with the activation of AN/FPS-7C search radar and the AN/FPS-6 and AN/FPS-26 height-finder radars as the United States' first nuclear-powered radars. The radar squadron provided information to the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction, altitude, and speed, and to evaluate whether aircraft were friendly or hostile. The radars were operated until 1968 when Air Defense Command closed the station as part of a draw down of assets and budget reductions. The PM-1 plant was operated by Air Force, Army and Navy personnel, and it produced electricity for 4,101 hours without incident. It was dismantled after the site was inactivated. The reactor site remains fenced, marked as \\"US Government Property, No Trespassing\\".

Description  The Arnhem was built by the Dutch East India Company (Dutch: Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie or VOC) chamber of Amsterdam at their wharf in 1654. Arnhem, 1654, De VOCsite. Retrieved 4 August 2015. It was named after the city of Arnhem in the Netherlands. The sailing ship was an East Indiaman or spiegelretourschip. It had a capacity of 1,000 tons.  Fate  Captained by Pieter Anthoniszoon, the Arnhem was one of seven VOC ships that left Batavia on 23 December 1661, homeward bound via the Cape of Good Hope. The other vessels were the Wapen van Holland, Prins Willem, Vogel Phoenix, Maarsseveen, Prinses Royal and Gekroonde Leeuw. On 11 February 1662, the fleet was scattered by a violent storm. The Wapen van Holland (920 tons), Gekroonde Leeuw (1,200 tons) and Prins Willem (1,200 tons) disappeared without trace. The following day Arnhem ran aground on the Saint Brandon Rocks (also known as Cargados Carajos), a group of atolls and reefs some 200 kilometres north-east of Mauritius. Volkert Evertsz and other survivors of the wreck survived by piloting a small boat to Mauritius, and are thought to have been the last humans to see live dodos. They survived the three months until their rescue by hunting \\"goats, birds, tortoises and pigs\\". Evertsz was rescued by the English ship Truroe in May 1662. Seven of the survivors chose not to return with the first rescue ship.

It was commanded by Colonel and served mainly as defence unit in the French-ruled Ionian Islands. It was disbanded in 1814.  History  = Background = In 1804, after Ali Pasha of Ioannina conquered their homeland, some 3,000 Souliotes settled in the Ionian Islands‚Äîfrom north to south the islands of Corfu, Paxoi, Lefkada (Santa Maura), Ithaca, Cephalonia, Zakynthos (Zante) and Kythira (Cerigo)‚Äîthen comprising the Russian-dominated Septinsular Republic. In view of the rapprochement between the Ottoman Empire and Napoleon's French Empire, the Russians began to recruit the Souliotes, both for local defence, as well as for a potential offensive against Ali Pasha. Soon the Souliotes, along with Himariotes, Acarnanians, and Moreotes, were recruited into the so-called \\"Greek Legion\\", which was placed under the command of the Greek-born Major-General Emmanouil Papadopoulos. In autumn 1805 the Greek Legion participated in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Naples, and in 1806 it fought against the French at the Bay of Kotor. However, in the Treaty of Tilsit, Russia returned the Septinsular Republic to France and the legion was disbanded on 30 August 1807. = Establishment = The return of French rule found some 3,000 armed members of the Legion and other Greek military formations in the Ionian Islands. As they were mostly recruited from mainland refugees, they posed a problem for the new authorities. To keep them disciplined and maintain order, the new French Governor-General, C√©sar Berthier, recruited these men into French service, but the exact manner of their employment was left open. Berthier initially suggested to create independent Greco-Albanian companies to serve alongside regular French line infantry regiments as skirmishers (tirailleurs) or mountain infantry (chasseurs de montagne), and even proposed that two such companies be attached to the royal guards of Napoleon and his brother Joseph Bonaparte, the King of Naples. Christoforos Perraivos This plan was soon shelved, and Berthier decided to form a single corps, under the command of Christakis Kalogeros from Preveza. This choice provoked much opposition from the former Legion members, however. This agitation may have resulted in part because the Souliotes, whose loyalty was determined by ties of kinship rather than any formal military hierarchy, were unwilling to accept being subordinated to a commander not of their own clan; the French scholar Auguste Boppe also adds an element of ethnic rivalry, since the Souliotes were Albanian-speakers and Kalogeros was Greek, but this is unlikely to be the main reason when the Greek Papadopoulos had commanded the same men for over two years. A prominent member of the corps, Christoforos Perraivos, provides an entirely different explanation in his memoirs, whereby Kalogeros had incurred the enmity of his fellow officers after denouncing his previous allegiance to the Russian Emperor to the French. The Souliotes in particular saw this as contrary to their code of honour; according to Perraivos, having once sworn allegiance to the Tsar, they intended to honour that promise, and insisted that they would fight for the French against all enemies, except Russia. The French authorities initially tended to view this mutiny with hostility, and the difficulty of dealing with the intransigent former Legion members led to Berthier having a very low opinion of them. In the end, on 12 December, the French established the Albanian Regiment (R√©giment albanais)The terms \\"Greek\\" and \\"Albanian\\" were used somewhat indiscriminately by the French at the time and are not an accurate reflection of the ethnic make-up of the units in question, which included Albanian-speaking Souliotes, Greeks from the mainland, and even Dalmatians and Italians. , . with a nominal strength of 3,254 men in three battalions of nine companies each, and a 14-member command staff. The first three battalion commanders were the Moreote Anagnostaras, the Himariote Konstantinos Androutsis (a veteran of the Neapolitan Army), and Kalogeros, although by February 1808 he was replaced by the Souliote Fotos Tzavellas. To command the regiment, the French chose Colonel , a veteran of the campaigns of Italy and Egypt, who approached his task with zeal and diligence, investigating the qualities and loyalties of each of the officers under his command. However, the French failed to attach to the regiment any Greek officers serving in the French regular regiments, who might have been able to better handle matters of discipline, language, and customs, and help integrate the unit better with the regular forces. In part this is probably due to the relative scarcity of such men in the French army, unlike the Russians who had a longer history of Greeks serving in their army. Kalogeros was moved to command the eight companies of Greek Foot Chasseurs (Chasseurs √† pied Grecs), also known as Pandours of Albania (Pandours de Albanie), comprising eight companies with 951 men in total. According to the historian Nicholas Pappas, this act may suggest that their creation was solely a means of separating the supporters of Kalogeros from his opponents. At any rate, this distinction did not last long, for the Chasseurs √† pied Grecs were again amalgamated into the Albanian Regiment in a reorganization July 1809. In its new form, the Albanian Regiment numbered 150 officers and 2,934 other ranks in six battalions, an organization very similar to that of the former Legion. Each battalion was placed under the command of a prominent chieftain: Konstantinos Androutsis, Christos Kalogeros, Fotos Tzavellas, Christakis Kalogeros, Kitsos Botsaris, and Anagnostaras. Surviving lists of the members of the battalion of Fotos Tzavellas show that, in line with Souliote customs, the officers comprised the main members of his clan and allied or related families. Auguste Boppe mentions that the regiment had a chaplain (\\"Arsenio Yanucco\\" from the Morea) and a surgeon (Ducca Zappa). =Service= A Souliote warrior in Corfu From the outset, the Albanian Regiment was intended for garrison duties on the Ionian Islands, so as to minimize the need to deploy French troops, apart from Corfu itself. For this purpose, the Regiment was complemented with the \\"Septinsular Battalion\\" (Battaillon Septinsulaire), drawn from the native militia of the Ionian Islands, and a 146-strong cavalry unit, the \\"Ionian Horse Chasseurs\\" (Chasseurs √† cheval ioniennes). From 1809, to these were added the remnants of the earlier Chasseurs d'Orient regiment of Greek volunteers. Plans for employment against Ali Pasha As their relations with Ali Pasha deteriorated over his ambitions against the mainland exclave of Parga, the French twice considered using the men of the Regiment to against the mainland, but nothing came of these plans. The first and more ambitious plan is related in the memoirs of the Greek chieftain Theodoros Kolokotronis, subsequently one of the main leaders of the Greek War of Independence: the Albanian Regiment, along with French artillerymen and Cham Albanians to be recruited by his Muslim Albanian blood brother, Ali Farmaki, were to land in the Morea and overthrow Ali Pasha's son Veli. In his place they would instal a mixed Christian-Muslim government, while the French mediated with the Porte to secure its approval. According to Kolokotronis, the plan was about to be carried out in 1809, when it was thwarted by the British occupation of Zakynthos, Cephalonia, Kythira, and Ithaca. The second attempt involved a detachment of 25 men of the Regiment, under Lt. Colonel Androutsis, who were sent to aid the Himariotes against Ali Pasha's forces in October 1810. Their ship foundered near Porto Palermo, however, and when attacked by Ali's forces, they were captured and taken prisoner to his capital, Ioannina. According to Pappas, this expedition may have been a reconnoitring action in view of then current French designs for an invasion of the Balkans. The French applied diplomatic pressure to have Androutsis and his men released, but Androutsis was found dead, allegedly after falling from his cell window, just after the French secured his release. Ali Pasha was also suspected to be behind the deaths of Fotos Tzavellas, who died on 4 November 1810 of a sudden illness, as well as the murder of Kitsos Botsaris by Gogos Bakolas in Arta in 1813. According to Souliote custom, Tzavellas was succeeded in his rank and command by his twenty-year firstborn old son, Nikolaos Tzavellas. The rapid rise of the young man to this post, over older and more experienced men, caused problems both with the other officers and men, and with Colonel Minot. In the end, in December Nikolaos was replaced by the veteran Thanasis Fotomaras. British landings on the southern Ionian Islands and defections In October 1809, the British attacked and captured Zakynthos, Cephalonia, Kythira, and Ithaca. These islands were defended by small garrisons, with a few dozen regular French soldiers and larger numbers of men of the Albanian Regiment (400 on Zakynthos, 145 on Cephalonia, 46 on Ithaca, and 27 on Kythira) on each island. These forces were completely inadequate to offer anything but a token resistance; the captured men were transferred to Italy as prisoners of war, but more than a few of the Regiment's men‚Äîabout half in Zakynthos‚Äîsimply scattered into the countryside and resumed their traditional guerrilla habits. Most of these escapees, as well as those taken prisoner, were soon induced to enter British service in what eventually became the 1st Regiment Greek Light Infantry. Over 70% of the Albanian Regiment's men on the four islands switched to the British, including most of the officers. Fall of Lefkada These defections made the French increasingly distrustful towards the remaining men of the Regiment, doubts which were enhanced further after the entire detachment of 823 men on Lefkada, apart from 13 men the French held as hostages, defected to the British when the latter landed there in March 1810. The remaining officers of the Regiment justified this desertion by the neglect shown to their colleagues by the local French commander, General Camus, who had retired with his French troops to the Castle of Santa Maura, while leaving the Albanian Regiment men outside to confront the British. This decision not only left the lightly equipped men of the Albanian Regiment exposed to the elements, but Camus also refused to give shelter to their families in the fortress. Indeed, from the reports of the British and the memoirs of the Greeks already enlisted to fight in their ranks, it is clear that the men of the Albanian Regiment resisted the initial offer to defect, and only surrendered after their situation had become hopeless. After the fall of Lefkada, Colonel Kitsos Botsaris, as the senior native Regiment officer, was court-martialled on suspicion of contacts with the British, but acquitted. Departure of Minot and reduction of the Regiment Nevertheless, these events led Napoleon to order the splitting of the Regiment in October 1810, with 1,000 men kept in the remaining French possessions (Corfu, Paxoi, and Parga on the mainland) and the rest either sent with their families to serve in southern Italy or to return them to the mainland. This decision was not implemented, as neither the Neapolitan government was willing to accept them, nor did the members of the Regiment accept bing moved to Italy, citing their previous terms of service agreed with the Russians and confirmed by General Berthier. With the capture and subsequent death of Androutsis at that time, the senior native officer once again became Christakis Kalogeros. His appointment again proved a source of discontent, as did Colonel Minot's increasing dissatisfaction with his \\"most distasteful command\\"; his ambitions were to command regular troops, but his attempts to impose strict discipline on his men only served to alienate them. This was in stark contrast to Minot's British counterpart, Richard Church, who enjoyed the respect and admiration of his men; his reputation was such that he was held in high esteem even mong the men of the Albanian Regiment. In 1812, Minot proposed splitting the unit in two, with an \\"elite\\" 500-man detachment intended for Napoleon's Imperial Guard (and which Minot hoped to accompany to the Emperor's presence) and the remaining men, about a thousand, either reduced to depots or returned to the mainland. The proposal was not supported by the French Governor-General, Fran√ßois-Xavier Donzelot, who preferred to keep the Regiment on Corfu, albeit reducing it to the \\"best\\" elements, with the remainder used to form a depot. The possibility of merging the regiment with another, older Greek unit in French service, the Chasseurs d'Orient, was also raised. By late 1813/early 1814, the Regiment was re-organized and its force was reduced from six to two battalions of men each, while the remainder were placed in a reserves depot. Minot was also transferred away with Kalogeros assuming interim command. Unlike Minot, Donzelot was keen to attend to the welfare of the Regiment's men, even going as far as taking a personal loan of 100,000 francs (for which he was never fully repaid by the French government) to cover their arrears in pay. Defence and surrender of Parga and Paxoi Depiction of the fortress of Parga, from a painting by Francesco Hayez (1791‚Äì1882) In the meantime, two companies of the Regiment had been deployed in Parga, defending the exclave against Ali Pasha's forces, along with a small number of French and Italian regulars and a local militia, all under the command of Colonel Nikolaos Papazoglou, the former commander of the Chasseurs d'Orient. Despite some successes in skirmishes around the town, by the end of 1813 the Pasha's men had reduced the defenders to the town itself, while British ships blockaded it from the sea, giving rise to hardship and dissension among the defenders during the first months of 1814, especially once the French and Italians withdrew to the town's fortress and left the native troops outside. In February 1814, the British, including elements of the Greek Light Infantry Regiment landed on Paxoi. 35 men of the Albanian Regiment were sent to reconnoitre the British force, but in the meantime, the Greek troops in the garrison of the fortress mutinied and handed it over to the British. Caught between vastly larger British forces, the detachment, under Apostolis Levantakis and Andreas Ninas, surrendered and entered British service as well. Soon after, in early March, the British at Paxoi were contacted by the men of the Albanian Regiment and the Pargians and offered the surrender of Parga. After two British frigates appeared outside the town, the Albanian Regiment detachment and the Pargian militia stormed the fortress, captured the defenders and raised the British flag. =Disbandment and aftermath= The loss of Paxoi and Parga left Corfu as the sole French possession. The island was heavily garrisoned, but after the abdication of Napoleon and the restoration of Louis XVIII in April 1814, Donzelot sought terms with the British. The British initially sought to disband the regiment, as with all the French forces on the island, and repatriate its men. Donzelot, however, intervened with the British, suggesting to either take the men of the Albanian Regiment into their service, or at least undertake to maintain them for two months, during which they could return to their homelands. The British commander, Sir James Campbell, provisionally agreed to provide the same rations as for the two Greek Light Infantry Regiments already in British employ. The British kept their promise, but in late June they disbanded more than half of the remaining men of the Regiment, with the remainder incorporated as a battalion in the 2nd Greek Light Infantry Regiment. Finally, in September 1814, the two Greek Light Infantry Regiments were also disbanded, although the process lasted into 1816. This was not only because the French military threat had been removed, but also in reaction to Ottoman protests at the existence of Greek armed units, and the British hopes to secure their control over the Ionian Islands with the diplomatic assistance of the Sublime Porte. Conversely, the Islanders, including the members of the disbanded Albanian Regiment, turned to Russia for assistance. A three-man delegation comprising Perraivos, Major Dimos Doukas, and Kitsos Tzavellas, set out to meet the Corfiot noble Ioannis Kapodistrias, who had served with them in the defence of Lefkada in 1807 and now was the principal advisor on foreign affairs to Tsar Alexander I of Russia in the Congress of Vienna. However, they were intercepted by the Austrian authorities, and Kapodistrias' own proposals for the restitution of the Septinsular Republic foundered due to Austrian opposition. As a result, on 5 November 1815, the Ionian Islands passed under British rule as the protectorate of the \\"United States of the Ionian Islands\\". All non-British military formations were disbanded and even forbidden, with the exception of police and militia, while the large proportion of mainlanders active in the various regiments raised by the Russians, French, and British were prohibited from holding any position in them by restricting eligibility to native Islanders. This left them not only destitute and forced to seek other means of providing for their livelihood but, especially in the case of the Souliotes, it left them exposed to the reprisals of Ali Pasha, abetted by the harassment of the British authorities, who were eager to please the Ottomans and secure recognition of their rule. Nevertheless, left with no alternative, many former members of the Regiment made their peace with Ali Pasha and entered his service, including even some of the Souliotes. Other veterans of the Albanian Regiment, as well as the Greek Light Infantry Regiments, served in the Neapolitan army under Richard Church, who established the Battaglione dei Cacciatori Macedoni for the purpose, until its disbandment in 1820. Still others entered the armed bodyguards of the Phanariote rulers of Moldavia and Wallachia. Notable members of the Regiment According to Boppe the Albanian Regiment deserves some attention only because it had in its ranks many heroes of the subsequent Greek Revolution of 1821 (Boppe, p. 3). Among the persons noted by this author and others are: * Christoforos Perraivos, officer (major) and author, fighter of the Greek Revolution (1821-1829) (Boppe, p. 11)(Perraivos, p. 77). * Konstantinos Androutses from Cheimarra. Commander of the 1st Battalion. He had served the French since 1799 when they occupied Naples as a commander and instructor. He recruited other Cheimariotes for the French army. He was given the rank of lieutenant colonel. He was arrested by the forces of Ali Pasha while aboard a French ship. The French authorities requested from the Ottoman Porte his release but he was murdered in an Ioannina prison. Ali Pasha tried to present his death as suicide. (Pappas, p. 48)(Boppe, p. 13, 15, 20) * Kitsos Botsaris, the leader of the Botsaris souliotic clan, commander of the 5th Battalion (Boppe p. 15, Kallivretakis p. 193). * Fotos Tzavellas, colonel, commander of the 3rd Battalion. A leader of the Tzavellas Souliote clan. Before the Regiment had participated in many battles of the Souliotes ‚Äì Ali Pasha wars. He had also served in Corfou under the Russians. He was assassinated by agents of Ali Pasha in Corfou in 1809 (Boppe, p. 15). * from Souli, second lieutenant of the 5th Company (\\"lochos\\") of the 1st Battalion, awarded the Saint Helena Medal (.Konstantinos N.

As a result, the best formulated education plans and policies can often fall short of their targets. UNESCO‚Äôs 2-year $15 million Capacity Development for Education for All (CapEFA) Programme ‚Äì financed by the governments of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Switzerland and Italy - recognizes that technical inputs to sector-wide and sub-sector education planning cannot ignore the operational implications. Upstream advisory support goes hand-in-hand with targeted capacity strengthening strategies - with a focus on reinforcing the institutional processes, organizational structures and professional skills and competencies needed to carry out the core Education for All (EFA) tasks that will lead to agreed quality and equity targets. Since 2002, the CapEFA programme has enabled UNESCO to work with Member States in translating global advocacy on EFA into concrete action. An explicit emphasis on, and approach to, capacity development has evolved over the years in alignment with development practice and in consultation with international partners such as the UNDP and the EFA Fast-Track Initiative. The thematic focus has also gradually narrowed to specific areas where UNESCO itself can add value to Member States own EFA efforts ‚Äì namely sector-wide policy and planning, literacy, teacher education policies, technical/vocational and secondary education. The CapEFA Programme is now a key driver in the UNESCO Education Sector Strategy, and acknowledged as such in the C/5, as it provides extra-budgetary support to the Sector‚Äôs 20 priority countries for education.  CapEFA intervention framework and processes  In relation to the national entry points for CapEFA, the programme responds to Member State demands for capacity strengthening within existing sector and sub-sector strategies, and national development frameworks. At the same time, it aims to harmonise capacity development action plans with those of sister UN agencies and bilateral technical partners working in the country. In addition, Field Offices and Headquarters work closely with, and encourage, multi-stakeholder partnerships in pursuit of national education goals. Sector-wide analysis, needs assessment and resource/stakeholder mapping (which are undertaken by national stakeholders themselves) are usually the first step in embedding ownership of capacity development processes, and in ensuring that national and local actors recognize and ‚Äòbuy-in‚Äô to the benefits of institutional and organizational innovation. In an age of decentralized education decision making, coordination and communications are also being strengthened between different levels of governance implicated in delivering on the 6 Dakar goals. The balance of thematic and capacity development expertise needed to respond to national priorities is achieved by leveraging the expertise already available to UNESCO through its Regional Bureaux, Specialized Institutes, Communities of Practice and networks. A mapping exercise of UNESCO‚Äôs delivery capacity was carried out in 2008 to facilitate this work, outlining the kinds of expertise and services available across the Education Sector, including the IIEP, UIS, UIL, UNEVOC, IBE/RB & HQ.  Results and achievements  The CapEFA programme has already had a significant impact on UNESCO‚Äôs responsiveness to the needs of Member States. A flexible and continuously evolving intervention framework is however critical to ensuring that the skills and expertise assembled by UNESCO remain relevant in the future. To this end, Regional Bureaux and Cluster Offices play a pivotal role in dialoguing with Member States, quality assurance and programme monitoring, as well as knowledge generation and information sharing beyond participating countries.  The case of Ethiopia: From advocacy to action  In Ethiopia, the CapEFA programme has been operational since early 2009. UNESCO‚Äôs International Institute for Educational Planning (IIEP) has worked closely with the Ethiopian Education Core Planning Team, as well as technical teams at Federal and Woreda levels and other development partners, to reinforce the skills and processes needed for the review of the Education Sector Development Plan (ESDP) III and the elaboration of the ESDP IV. Early results point to better understanding among federal ministry staff on strategic planning processes and the generation of solid baseline information regarding key capacity gaps at national and Woreda levels. Guidelines and tools for capacity building are in preparation, along with a detailed nationwide situation analysis on current education system performance levels, measuring progress in relation to the launch of the current Education Sector Plan. Activities are also advanced in Ethiopia towards reinforcing the capacities of teacher education institutions (TEIs) in four regions: Oromiya, Amhara, SNNPR, and Tigray. The design of a Teacher Information Management System (TMIS) is considered a critical pillar of teacher education support systems in the country - as it will facilitate teacher-training performance monitoring and the development of quality assurance systems.

G. Wodehouse, and features the young gentleman Bertie Wooster and his valet Jeeves. The story was published in The Strand Magazine in the United Kingdom in December 1927, and in Liberty in the United States that same month. The story was also included as the third story in the 1930 collection Very Good, Jeeves.Cawthorne (2013), p. 74. In the story, Bertie has fallen in love with the mischievous Roberta \\"Bobbie\\" Wickham, though Jeeves has misgivings about her. Bertie wants to get revenge on \\"Tuppy\\" Glossop for playing a trick on him, and Bobbie suggests a scheme involving a long stick, a darning needle, and a hot water bottle.  Plot  Lady Wickham has invited Bertie to her home, Skeldings Hall, for Christmas. Bertie and Jeeves had originally planned to go to Monte Carlo, but Bertie takes up Lady Wickham's invitation, which disappoints Jeeves. Bertie's Aunt Agatha calls and tells Bertie to behave himself at Skeldings, since Lady Wickham is her friend. Sir Roderick Glossop will also be there, and Aunt Agatha has convinced him to give Bertie another chance to demonstrate that he is not mentally unsound. At Skeldings Hall, Bertie encounters Lady Wickham, her daughter Bobbie Wickham, and Sir Roderick Glossop, who is surprisingly cordial to Bertie. Bertie sees that Jeeves is upset about missing Monte Carlo, and explains his three reasons for coming to Skeldings: first, there is more Yule-tide spirit in Skeldings; second, Bertie wants to get revenge on Tuppy Glossop, Sir Roderick's nephew, because Tuppy once tricked him into falling into the Drones Club swimming pool; third, Bertie is in love with Bobbie. Jeeves says that Bobbie, though a charming young lady, is too volatile and frivolous for Bertie. Jeeves also believes that Bobbie's vivid red hair is a dangerous sign. Bertie dismisses Jeeves's concerns. Later, Bertie tells Jeeves that Bobbie proposed a clever scheme for his revenge. Bertie will tie a large darning needle to the end of a long stick, then sneak into Tuppy's room at night and puncture Tuppy's hot water bottle while he is asleep. Jeeves objects, but Bertie insists that Jeeves prepare the stick and needle. Jeeves informs Bertie where Tuppy sleeps. At half-past two on Christmas morning, Bertie sneaks into Tuppy's room and punctures the hot water bottle. Then the door loudly falls shut, which wakes the occupant of the bed, who, to Bertie's surprise, is not Tuppy, but Sir Roderick Glossop. Angry, Sir Roderick tells Bertie that he and Tuppy had changed rooms. He had asked Jeeves to tell this to Bertie. Bertie feels betrayed by Jeeves. His bed ruined, Sir Roderick leaves to sleep in Bertie's bed instead. Defeated, Bertie sleeps on an armchair. Bertie wakes to see Jeeves standing with tea. Jeeves greets him, \\"Merry Christmas, sir!\\".Wodehouse (2008) [1930], chapter 3, p. 82. When asked, Jeeves confesses he knew about Tuppy's room change, but had allowed Bertie's plan to proceed in order to ruin any chance of Glossop approving a marriage between his daughter and Bertie. Bertie is instantly moved, and feels he has wronged Jeeves. Jeeves adds that a second incident occurred during the night: while in Bertie's bed, Sir Roderick's hot water bottle was pierced by Tuppy, who thought Bertie was in the bed. As a joke, Bobbie had suggested this idea to Tuppy, after she had suggested the idea to Bertie. Bertie is stunned by Bobbie's betrayal, and does not love her anymore. To avoid Sir Roderick and Aunt Agatha, Jeeves suggests that Bertie go to Monte Carlo, since Jeeves already booked accommodations there and forgot to cancel them. Bertie agrees.  Literary and Biblical allusions  Wodehouse invariably has Bertie Wooster using ‚Äì or misusing ‚Äì many literary and Biblical allusions. In this short story, Bertie makes these references: * \\"As Shakespeare says, if you‚Äôre going to do a thing you might just as well pop right at it and get it over\\": refers to \\"If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well it were done quickly\\" in Macbeth, Act I, scene vii, by William Shakespeare. * \\"Makes him realise that life is stern and life is earnest\\": refers to \\"Life is real!

Publication history The story's title is sometimes written as \\"Jeeves and the Yule-Tide Spirit\\" or \\"Jeeves and the Yuletide Spirit\\". It was illustrated by Charles Crombie in the Strand and by Wallace Morgan in Liberty.McIlvaine (1990), p. 151, E36.33, and p. 185, E133.138. It appeared in the periodical Scholastic in 1939.McIlvaine (1990), p. 159, D61.2. The story was included in the 1932 collection Nothing But Wodehouse, and in the 1949 collection The Best of Wodehouse.McIlvaine (1990), pp. 113‚Äì114, B2a, and p. 118, B8a. The collections Selected Stories by P. G. Wodehouse, published in 1958, and Vintage Wodehouse, published 1978, also featured the story.McIlvaine (1990), p. 120, B11a, and p. 124, B19a. The anthology The Fireside Treasury of Modern Humor, published by Simon and Schuster in 1963, included the story.McIlvaine (1990), p. 196, E77. Bertie Wooster's tendency to abbreviate words caused confusion with printers when this story was printed in Very Good, Jeeves. Wodehouse wrote in August 1930 to Arnold Bennett about a mistake he noticed in the galley proof of the book, stating in his letter to Bennett: > In one place I had written 'festive s.', meaning 'festive season', & they > printed it 'festives'. So I wrote on the margin of the galley as follows: ‚Äì > \\"Not 'festives'. Please print this as two words 'festive s.', ‚Äì 'festive' > one word, 's' another. Bertie occasionally clips his words, so that when he > means 'festive season' he says 'festive s.' This is quite clear, isn't it? > 'Festive' one word, 's' another?\\" And so the book has come out with the > thing printed as 'festives'. I see now that I didn't make it clear enough. \\"Festives\\" was used for the 1930 British edition of Very Good, Jeeves, and became \\"the festivities\\" in the American edition. It was changed to \\"Christmas\\" in the 1931 Jeeves Omnibus. \\"Festives\\" appears in the 2008 Arrow Books (British) edition: \\"'We have here a communication from Lady Wickham. She has written inviting me to Skeldings for the festives.'\\"Wodehouse (2008) [1930], chapter 3, p. 63. Adaptations  =Television= This story was adapted into the Jeeves and Wooster episode \\"Tuppy and the Terrier\\", the second episode of the first series, which first aired on 29 April 1990. There are some changes in plot, including: * The episode does not take place during Christmas. Instead, Bertie tries to impress Bobbie during the annual Drones Club golf tournament, where Bertie faces off against Barmy Fotheringay-Phipps, who uses an illegal golf club. * In the episode there is no mention of the Drones Club pool incident, and Bertie does not want to get revenge on Tuppy; instead, he wants revenge on Barmy for defeating him with an illegal golf club. * In the original story Jeeves was not informed in advance of Tuppy's intentions to use a darning needle and stick like Bertie; in the episode, Barmy asks Jeeves for a darning needle and stick. * Sir Roderick Glossop does not appear in the episode. He is replaced by a Romanian couple. * There is no mention of Monte Carlo in the episode; instead, Jeeves disapproves of Bertie's plus sixes. =Radio= A reading of \\"Jeeves and the Yule-tide Spirit\\" by actor Martin Jarvis in front of an invited theatre audience was first aired on BBC Radio 4 as part of the Jeeves Live series on 17 December 2017.

She began composing at an early age and made her debut as a composer in 1893 with a symphonic poem. Casagemas' opera Schiava e regina won a prize at the World Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1892; it has to be performed in 1893 at Gran Teatre del Liceu, Barcelona; it would be the first opera by a woman performed there. However, an anarchist attack with a bomb interrupted the opera season and the theatre was closed for months. So, the opera was not performed; as a compensation for the author, several fragments were performed before the Spanish royal family in Madrid in 1894. After, it was forgotten and never performed nor recorded.

The temple is located in the hill town Tijara, in the Alwar district of Rajasthan, India. It is an Atishaya Kshetra (English: Place where Miracles happen). It is from Alwar and from Delhi. The location is a tirtha (pilgrimage site) for the Jains and a tourist attraction. History The temple was established in 1956 following the recovery of an idol of Chandraprabha on 16 August 1956. The white stone idol was retrieved from underground, reinforcing the belief that this place was once a Dehra, a place where Jain idols are worshipped. After the setting up of the Jain temple, the place has regained its former importance as a pilgrimage centre. Main temple and idol The main deity of the temple is Chandraprabhu, the eighth tirthankara of present cosmic age. The idol of Chandraprabhu is 15 inch in height made of white stone. According to the inscription on the idol, it was installed on the third day of Vishakha Shukla 1554. There is another idol which is made up of black stone, 8 inch in height, in the lotus position. Both the idols, with others, are installed in a rectangular temple decorated with pinnacles. The temple hall has a total of capacity of 2,000 persons.

It is located north of Gettysburg, South Dakota. It was closed in 1968. History In late 1951 Air Defense Command selected Gettysburg, South Dakota as one of twenty- eight radar stations built as part of the second segment of the permanent radar surveillance network. Prompted by the start of the Korean War, on July 11, 1950, the Secretary of the Air Force asked the Secretary of Defense for approval to expedite construction of the second segment of the permanent network. Receiving the Defense Secretary's approval on July 21, the Air Force directed the Corps of Engineers to proceed with construction. Gettysburg Air Force Station was activated on 1 January 1956 with the assignment of the 903d Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron. The station was initially equipped with an AN/MPS-7 search radar and an AN/MPS-14 height-finder radar, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. In 1958 an AN/FPS-20A search radar replaced the AN/MPS-7, and an AN/FPS-6A height-finder radar was installed. During 1960 Gettysburg AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, initially feeding data to DC-11 at Grand Forks AFB, North Dakota. After joining, the squadron was re-designated as the 903d Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 15 January 1960. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile The search radar subsequently was upgraded and redesignated as an AN/FPS-66 in 1961. In 1963 an AN/FPS-90 joined the AN/MPS-14 in performing height-finder duties. The station was re-designated as NORAD ID Z-29 on 31 July. In 1964 an AN/FPS-27 was installed, and the AN/FPS-66 was retired. The Air Force inactivated the 903rd Radar Squadron on 18 June 1968. The FAA continues to operate long-range radar there today using an AN/FPS-67B search radar atop the old AN/FPS-27 radar tower as part of the Joint Surveillance System (JSS).

Located in Kampong Thom Province, it is a major tributary of the Tonl√© Sap Lake (\\"Great Lake\\"), which joins the Tonl√© Sap River at the downstream end in the larger Mekong basin. Somewhat unusually the river is looped back into the same river system, which accounts for its length of , leaving Tonl√© Sap lake and entering its river again downstream. The prehistoric archaeological site of Samrong Sen is located on the river bank.Kyoto (1997), pp. 23‚Äì31 Water resource projects, commencing in 1971 and in 2003, have had various measures of success. The river is an important trade route.

Its main lake is Bung Real Lake. The main city along the river is Santuk District Capital. Samrong Sen, a prehistoric archaeological site of Neolithic Age is located on its right bank. Climate According to the data sourced to the Hydrologic Water Year Book of Mekong Committee, the basin's climatic parameters recorded at the Kampong Thmar station, are; an average annual temperature of with a minimum of in December and maximum of in March. The average annual evaporation rate is with a standard deviation of per month.Kyoto (1997), p. 27 The average annual precipitation recorded is with heavy rains recorded from April to October.

At Phnom Takho, the river drains a catchment area of , using storage of (gross capacity 500 million cubic metres and effective capacity of 391 million cubic metres). The dam planned at Phnom Takho was to provide irrigation benefits with canal systems planned on both banks of the river, and also for power generation. A pumping station was also planned at Kampong Thmar to provide irrigation for an area of . Power generation envisaged was 4.5 MW using a net head of and effective storage of 391 million cubic metres for the purpose for rural electrification supply and lift irrigation. The project was also anticipated to bring in changes in the fish production both upstream and downstream of the dam location.Kyoto (1997), p. 30 The project was to cover the districts of Santuk and Baray in the Kampong Thom Province. It was partially implemented between the 1970s and the 1980s, with the main diversion structure and the main canal with head regulators built during the Khmer Rouge regime using forced labour. Some of the structures that were built, were subsequently damaged by regime soldiers who were \\"grenade fishing\\". The project only partial irrigation as the canal system was built for only a short length of . The system was found to be lacking in proper planning and design concepts, and also dubious construction methods were adopted in many respects, which caused frequent flooding and damages to structures and canal systems. =2003 public works project= Consequent to this, a fresh start was made by launching The Stung Chinit Irrigation and Rural Infrastructure Project (SCIRIP), with technical and financial inputs of US$ 23.8 million equivalent from the Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Agence Fran√ßaise de D√©veloppement and the beneficiaries. The objective was to increase agricultural productivity and to stimulate the rural economy in the province. In the initial phase, an area of was proposed to be developed, apart from rehabilitation of about that been previously developed. An additional dry season irrigation system in an area of about was also planned. The project, launched in 2003, was implemented over a six-year period. It included improvements to the drainage infrastructure, of rural roads, six markets, and extension services. Stakeholder participation occurred through Water User groups. By 2007, three communes and 24 villages in one district had benefited from the public works project. According to a 2008 ADB report, \\"The resettlement plan included three phases to cover the irrigation/drainage canal infrastructure, the reservoir area and the Otchork tributary area. All phases have been satisfactorily implemented but some longer-term income restoration activities are still ongoing and require post-project monitoring\\". Navigation Inland navigation is practiced to a very limited extent due to shallow draft. Fishing and community boats are plied by villagers who reside on the banks of the river, for fishing and to transport goods to the markets. Land use The Chinit River basin land use distribution is 75.5% under forest cover, 14.8% under paddy cultivation and the balance area is under other agricultural uses.Kyoto (1997), p. 23 Agricultural farming, mostly during the wet season of rice cultivation (seasonal rice and floating rice) is the major economic activity of the people living in the valley. Rice is also grown during the non-rainy season, but its acreage is limited to 10% of the cultivated area. White corn, green beans and tobacco are also grown in the higher elevations of the valley.Kyoto (1997), p. 31 Aquafauna The Chinit River has been a subject of studies on fish migration. Movement of fish has been studied on Chinit and also on other rivers in the Mekong through sampling techniques carried out in stretches upstream of the flooded areas, to identify larval and fry fish in five tributaries. Seventy-one species belonging to 17 families have been recorded in the Chinit River. It was also noted during these studies that the species recorded were distinctive for each tributary but the fish fauna found in Chinit and Stung tributaries were identical.

The lowest fee is ¬£1 (for a school screening in e.g. Sierra Leone) and the highest ¬£12,000 (for a multinational corporation screening to 1,000 or more people in e.g. the United States). Good Screenings charge a one-off licensing fee and make no claims on any profits made from screenings. Channel 4 said of Good Screenings,‚Äúthat's the beauty of the system - you screen the film, raise awareness of the key issues, help the film-makers earn a living to go on to make their next film for good, and then you get the cash you make on the night.‚ÄùChannel 4 : Good Screenings launch Speaking in The Guardian Beadie Finzi, director of Channel 4 BRITDOC Foundation, says Indie Screenings could prove a catalyst as more social action film-makers join up and enjoy a wider audience for their films. Indiescreenings is now only licensing films by Spanner Films.

The central library is part of the ‚ÄòKulturquartier‚Äô (a cultural hub) near the Neumarkt. It is located at the Josef-Haubrich-Hof, with the new Rautenstrauch- Joest-Museum (cultures of the world) in its immediate neighbourhood. Since 2008, Dr. Hannelore Vogt has been the director of the library.Dr. Hannelore Vogt wird neue Leiterin der Stadtbibliothek press release, 05.08.2008 The library system The library system is made up of the central library, 11 branch libraries, a mobile library and several special collections. Within the local authorities, the library is affiliated to the department of art and culture. The library provides the residents of Cologne (about a million inhabitants) with information resources for education and training; in addition, there are many users from the region around Cologne and from neighbouring countries (Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg).Annual report 2011 =The central library= It provides access to all sorts of printed items (also printed music and maps), CDs, CD-ROMs, DVDs (also interactive DVDs), Blu-rays, audio books, games, language courses, software and multi media packages. There are PCs on all floors, which can be used for searching the internet, the catalogue or databases. Furthermore, there are W-LAN-areas, photocopiers, CD listening stations, space for private study and meeting rooms for training sessions. On the third floor, a zone has been created which can be used by pupils for private study or group work. Patrons can practise playing the piano, as there is an e-piano and ‚Äì in a separate room ‚Äì a grand piano. In the entrance area there is an information centre with national and international newspapers, exhibition catalogues and a window projection on cultural events (images on back-projected in-window display). A large reading room is a venue for events. There are several special collections: the library for the blind (providing access to a great number of items by ‚ÄòMedibus‚Äô), the Heinrich-B√∂ll-Archiv (Heinrich B√∂ll Archive) and the collection ‚ÄòLiteratur in K√∂ln‚Äô (literature in Cologne). There is an exhibition space with the last work room (completely furnished) of Heinrich B√∂ll and a photo exhibition of authors from Cologne.Kunze, Gabriele: Heinrich B√∂ll als Highlight: ¬ªLiteraturwelt¬´ pr√§sentiert K√∂lner Autoren in der Stadtbibliothek.

There are branches in Bocklem√ºnd, Chorweiler, Ehrenfeld, Kalk, M√ºlheim, Neubr√ºck, Nippes, Porz, Rodenkirchen and S√ºlz. The branch in the S√ºdstadt (Haus Balchem) is something special: it is housed in a building, which was reconstructed in 17th century baroque style after the second world war. The branch library in Bocklem√ºnd is something like a junior company: it is managed by apprentices under the supervision of a young library employee. The mobile library serves another 18 neighbourhoods in Cologne.Lesefutter in der ‚ÄûJuniorfirma‚Äú In: K√∂lner Stadtanzeiger, 01.02.2010Branch libraries and archives of the Cologne Public Library Service Among a range of other items, current bestsellers are provided (fiction, non-fiction, pop music, films). The library offers various library education programmes and cooperates with schools. The interlibrary loans department procures items from other libraries, if they are not available in Cologne. There are training sessions on how to conduct searches in databases and on the internet. The school service offers educational programmes designed for various age groups using methods to encourage pupils to be active, thus promoting media and information literacy.Daniel, Frank: Richtig recherchieren lernen: Methodentraining der StadtBibliothek K√∂ln.

Intercultural meeting place As a multicultural meeting place, the public library of Cologne opens up many opportunities for language acquisition and cooperates with agencies which run integration courses. The integration project Bi-IN is about making teachers of integration courses see the advantages of using a library and making the participants of the courses familiar with the library.Daniel, Frank; N√∂tzelmann, Cordula; Volz, Markus: Ohne Bildung keine Kultur: Aktuelle Projekte der StadtBibliothek K√∂ln. In: Buch und Bibliothek 2010, Band 62, Heft 11/12, S. 784-786. Cooperations There is cooperative networking with ‚ÄòLit.Cologne‚Äô (a literature festival), the ‚ÄòLiteraturhaus K√∂ln‚Äô (House of Literature), the ‚ÄòSK Stiftung Kultur‚Äô (the cultural foundation of the municipal savings bank of Cologne), the ‚ÄòBelgisches Haus‚Äô (the ‚ÄòBelgian House‚Äô), Cologne University and the ‚ÄòK√∂lner Freiwilligen-Agentur‚Äô (a volunteer agency in Cologne), the ‚ÄòHochschulbibliothekszentrum‚Äô (a service centre for academic libraries) and the ‚ÄòVolkshochschule K√∂ln‚Äô (the municipal adult education centre). The library has also been involved in cooperation with many schools in Cologne,Daniel, Frank: Schulen als Bildungspartner - auch f√ºr Gro√üstadtbibliotheken?

In the course of time, several Volksbibliotheken (people‚Äôs libraries) and Lesehallen (reading halls) were established by donations and municipal funds. In 1931, a mobile library was introduced in Cologne. After World War II numerous book donations from abroad helped to restock the Volksb√ºchereien, as they were called by then. In 1966 the city council decided to rename them; the name Stadtb√ºcherei K√∂ln was chosen. The central library, opened in 1979, was modelled on the Anglo- American public library. In Cologne, there are two institutions having ‚ÄòStadtbibliothek‚Äô in their name: The ‚ÄòUniversit√§ts- und Stadtbibliothek K√∂ln‚Äô (University and City Library of Cologne), being originally funded by the city of Cologne, adopted this name in 1920; the ‚ÄòStadtBibliothek K√∂ln‚Äô (the former Stadtb√ºcherei K√∂ln) is the public library, the upper-case ‚ÄòB‚Äô making it easier to help tell them apart.Robenek, Brigitte: Geschichte der Stadtb√ºcherei K√∂ln von den Anf√§ngen im Jahre 1890 bis zum Ende des Zweiten Weltkrieges.

The play helped to create and nationalize the genre of Down East humor, and made Golden one of the celebrated comedians of his generation. Born in Bangor, Maine, the son of an Irish immigrant and dry goods merchant, Golden joined a Mexican circus (Allie's Allied Shows) touring the U.S. at the age of 13.Obituary, New York Times, August 11, 1909. He later married actor and singer Dora Wiley, and initially toured with her as a member of the \\"Dora Wiley Opera Company\\". The company became stranded in Albany, New York in 1885 when it experienced financial difficulties and Golden contracted malaria.\\"Opera Company Stranded\\", New York Times, August 11, 1885. The couple's fortunes had turned by 1888 when Wiley sang \\"Home, Sweet, Home\\" in front of President Grover Cleveland at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York,\\"Will Sing to the President\\", New York Times, May 19, 1888. and, the following year, Golden impressed audiences in New York, and soon the country, for his portrayal of Old Jed Prouty in his original play of the same name. Wiley had a singing part in the production, and came to be known as \\"The Sweet Singer of Maine\\". Golden's Old Jed Prouty, which he wrote with William Gill, premiered in New York's Union Square Theatre on May 14, 1889, and moved to the Harlem Opera House later that same year.Notes of the Stage, New York Times, November 24, 1889. Prouty was a comedic Maine yankee tavern keeper living in the coastal town of Bucksport, the birthplace of his wife Dora Wiley and not far from Golden's own home-town of Bangor. The play began touring nationally in 1890 to rave reviews. Golden would go on to other plays and other parts, but would continually revive Prouty in the course of his career, ultimately playing it over 3,000 times in venues all over the eastern half of the U.S. Wiley divorced Golden in 1892, married her (much younger) business manager, and returned to her home in Bangor.\\"Dora Wiley Married Again\\", New York Times, December 13, 1893. With Dora gone, Golden shut down Old Jed Prouty by 1893 and joined the Pauline Hall Opera Company at the Tremont Theatre in Boston.New York Times, July 23, 1893. By 1895 Golden was broke, and appeared in debtor's court declaring he had \\"not a cent in the world\\".\\"Golden Takes Poor Debtor's Oath\\", New York Times, June 8, 1895. The following year (1894) found Golden in the alcoholic's ward at Bellevue Hospital, but by the end of the year he had returned to the stage with a revival of Jed Prouty.\\"Richard Golden in Bellvue\\", New York Times, March 21, 1894. Through the rest of the 1890s newspapers alternately reported him \\"critically ill\\" (usually in a hotel room), and drawing huge and appreciative crowds in a variety of comic roles. By the end of the decade he was one of the most celebrated stars of American comic opera. Around 1908 he also took a part in the London production of The Dollar Princess, a German light opera. Golden died suddenly in 1909 on a friend's houseboat in Gravesend Bay, New York, while preparing to return to Maine. He is buried in Bangor's Mount Hope Cemetery. Golden's daughter Bernice also became a professional actress. She was seriously injured by a piece of falling scenery while playing in The Greyhound at the Astor Theatre in New York, and could not work for several years, but returned to the stage in 1915, first in Chicago, and then in Alice in Wonderland at New York's Booth Theatre.New York Times, March 25, 1915. A historic hotel in the town of Bucksport, Maine, is named \\"The Jed Prouty Tavern\\" in honor of Golden's character. Golden himself briefly worked there as a clerk long before he'd become a professional actor, when the hotel was called The Robinson House.

Opened in 1926, it forms part of the Bologna‚ÄìAncona railway. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Train services are operated by Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state- owned rail company. Location Forl√¨ railway station is situated at Piazzale Martiri d'Ungheria, to the east of the city centre. History Forl√¨'s original station was opened on 1 September 1861, together with the rest of the Bologna‚ÄìForl√¨ section of the Bologna‚ÄìAncona railway. Just over one month later, on 5 October 1861, the new line was extended, from the original Forl√¨ station to Rimini. In 1926, the original station was closed and replaced by the present station. A project of the engineer Enzo Bianchi, the present station is about 100 metres (or yards) to the east of the original station. Features The passenger building is rectangular in shape, and has three levels, but only the ground floor is open to the public. The building consists of three sections. The central part has three arched entrances on either side. There are also two turrets on the Piazzale side, at each end of the section. Extending laterally from the central section are two symmetrical wings. Adjacent to the passenger building is the station yard. It has three tracks used for passenger services. In detail: *Track 1: on the main line, is used by odd-numbered stopping trains (southbound); *Track 2: also on the main line, is used by even-numbered stopping trains (heading north); *Track 3: a loop siding, is generally used for overtaking trains. All passenger tracks have a platform sheltered by a canopy. The platforms and connected with each other by a pedestrian underpass. There are also many other tracks (without platforms) that are used for goods services. Train services The station is served by the following service(s): *High speed services (Frecciarossa) Milan - Bologna - Ancona *High speed services (Frecciabianca) Milan - Parma - Bologna - Ancona - Pescara (- Foggia - Bari) Passenger and train movements The station has about 2.8 million passenger movements each year. The passenger trains calling at the station are regional, express, InterCity, Frecciabianca services and one daily Frecciarossa high speed train pair. A total of about 105 passenger trains serve the station each day. Their main destinations are Bologna Centrale, Ancona, Rimini, Milano Centrale and Piacenza.

It is located west of Opheim, Montana. It was closed in 1979. History In late 1951 Air Defense Command selected Opheim, Montana as one of twenty-eight radar stations built as part of the second segment of the permanent radar surveillance network. Prompted by the start of the Korean War, on July 11, 1950, the Secretary of the Air Force asked the Secretary of Defense for approval to expedite construction of the second segment of the permanent network. Receiving the Defense Secretary's approval on July 21, the Air Force directed the Corps of Engineers to proceed with construction. On 1 March 1951 the 779th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was activated at Opheim AFS with AN/FPS-3 and AN/FPS-4 radars, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. An AN/GPS-3 radar operated between 1957 and 1961. In 1958 and 1959 AN/FPS-6 and AN/FPS-6A radars replaced the AN/FPS-4 height-finder radar. The AN/FPS-3, operational until late 1961, was replaced by an AN/FPS-7C search radar. The FPS-3 along an FPS-8 were the primary search radars. The FPS-8 was used as a backup for the FPS-7C until mid to late 1962. The spare IFF unit from the FPS-8 was salvaged and used in the FPS-7C. Also, the MIT unit from the FPS-3 was salvaged and used in the FPS-7C since its MIT was not operational until after the spring of 1964 due to design problems. SAGE utilization required both the IFF and MIT to be operational. During 1961 Opheim AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, initially feeding data to DC-20 at Malmstrom AFB, Montana. After joining, the squadron was re-designated as the 779th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 15 July 1961. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 to the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction, altitude, speed, and whether aircraft were friendly or hostile. In 1963 the squadron operated the AN/FPS-7C search radar along with AN/FPS-26A and AN/FPS-90 height-finder radars. The FPS-26A heightfinder was not operational until after the spring of 1964. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-26. The AN/FPS-90 was damaged by a fire in 1966, but was repaired; it was removed sometime in the early 1970s.

It followed a proclamation by Edward I that all esquires eligible for knighthood should come to Westminster to be knighted in turn by their future king, and to march with him against the Scots. The King first knighted his son Edward II who in turn knighted the 266 others. At the feast that followed the king had two swans brought in. He swore before God and the swans to avenge the murder of John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch and the desecration of Greyfriars Church in Dumfries by the Earl of Carrick Robert Bruce and his accomplices earlier in the year, and to fight the infidels in the Holy Land. Among those knighted were Piers Gaveston, Hugh le Despenser, John de Warenne, 7th Earl of Surrey, Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March and his uncle, Roger Mortimer of Chirk.

Luca Ciamberlano (born circa 1580) was an Italian painter and engraver of the Baroque period. Biography He was born at Urbino. In the early part of his life he applied himself to the study of civil law, in which he had taken a doctor's degree, when he abandoned the study of jurisprudence to devote himself to painting and engraving, particularly the latter. He became the leading graphic artist of his day. From 1599 to 1641 he resided at Rome, where he executed a great number of plates from his own designs, as well as after the works of the most celebrated Italian painters, in the style of Agostino Carracci. He codified and engraved Carracci's teaching system in a work published in Rome in 1626 by Pietro Stefanoni, called Scuola perfetta per imparare a disegnare tutto il corpo umano. Ciamberlano collaborated with Guido Reni between 1610 and 1612, when he made engravings based on Reni's drawings of the Life of St Philip. He engraved the anatomical drawings of Pietro da Cortona between 1618 and 1620. He created a nine-part series of engravings depicting the Passion of Christ, dated 1621 and probably published by Johannes Eillarts.Zeitler, Kurt, \\"Luca Ciamberlano's Passion Series for Scipione Borghese\\", Print Quarterly (September 2014) Volume 31, Issue 3, pp. 269‚Äì279 Of his plates, 114 are known, but as many as 331 have been conjectured. They were entirely executed with the graver, which he handled with neatness and intelligence; his drawing of the figure is tolerably correct. He sometimes signed his plates with his name, and sometimes marked them with the cipher LC. Among them are the following: *Thirteen plates of Christ and the twelve Apostles; after Raphael. *St. Jerome dead, lying upon a stone; after the same. (pictured) *St. Thomas; after Bassano. *Nine plates of Angels carrying the instruments of the Passion. *Duke Francesco Maria II of Urbino. *Christ on the Mount of Olives; after A.

It is a colourless volatile liquid. Cycloheptanone is used as a precursor for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals.  Synthesis  In 1836, French chemist Jean- Baptiste Boussingault first synthesized cycloheptanone from the calcium salt of dibasic suberic acid. The destructive distillation of calcium suberate yields calcium carbonate and suberone: :Ca(O2C(CH2)6CO2) ‚Üí CaCO3 \\\\+ (CH2)6CO Cycloheptanone is still produced by the cyclization and decarboxylation of suberic acid or suberic acid esters. This reaction is typically conducted in the gas phase at 400‚Äì450 ¬∞C over alumina doped with zinc oxide or cerium oxide. Cycloheptanone is also produced by the reaction of cyclohexanone with sodium ethoxide and nitromethane. The resulting sodium salt of 1-(nitromethyl)cyclohexanol is added to acetic acid and shaken with hydrogen gas in the presence of W-4 Raney nickel catalyst. Sodium nitrite and acetic acid are then added to give cycloheptanone. Cycloheptanone is also prepared by ring expansion of cyclohexanone with diazomethane as the methylene source.  Uses and reactions  Cycloheptanone has no direct applications, but is a precursor to other compounds. Bencyclane, a spasmolytic agent and vasodilator is produced from it, for example. Pimelic acid is produced by the oxidative cleavage of cycloheptanone. Dicarboxylic acids such as pimelic acid are useful for the preparation of fragrances and certain polymers. Several microorganisms, including Mucor plumbeus, Mucor racemosus, and Penicillium chrysogenum, have been found to reduce cycloheptanone to cycloheptanol. These microorganisms have been investigated for use in certain stereospecific enzymatic reactions.

Not much is known about this Saint other than he was martyred between 300 A.D - 350 A.D. and his apparently incorrupt body is still on display 17 centuries after his death. It appears that Silvan was very young when he was martyred, showing his devoutness to Christianity from a young age. In his tomb, an embroidered cross on the front of his garment indicating that he may have been a priest or some other cleric possibly indicating that he was a fairly high ranking in his time. The incorrupt body of Saint Silvan is located in the Church of Saint Blaise in Dubrovnik, Croatia. A number of Silvans have been canonized as saints, and it is unclear which Saint Silvan is entombed at the Church of Saint Blaise. Most sources claim the Saint Silvan at Dubrovnik was martyred in the 4th century ‚Äî a gruesome wound on his neck suggests the manner of his martyrdom ‚Äî which may indicate he was Saint Silvanus, Bishop of Emesa, Phoenicia, martyred c. 311. Other Saint Silvans died in various ways (e.g., thrown off a cliff or of natural causes) or at an age suggesting they cannot be the Saint Silvan at Dubrovnik. Still others are believed to be buried elsewhere.

One night, ranchera singer Rosario Guerrero sees Emiliano at the doors of Plaza Garibaldi, a mariachi bar. He has an air of vulnerability and signs of having been robbed, so she decides to help him. What she does not know is that he is a wealthy young Mexican who has reached Bogot√° fleeing from justice for a crime he did not commit. The friendship they develop completely transforms their lives. He is astounded by Rosario‚Äôs selfless support, a rare commodity in the world of wealth he comes from. Thanks to her, he manages to survive as a mariachi singer in the bar while eluding the zealous pursuit of Interpol and the police in Colombia and Mexico. In this world, he discovers the widespread influence of mariachi music in Colombia. Above all, in Rosario he finds the great love of his life. She also finds love thanks to Emiliano. With him, she begins to fit together the scattered pieces of her life. The happiest and yet most painful parts of Rosario‚Äôs life are related to the memory of her father. He was a mariachi singer, bohemian and passionate, and an affectionate man. Yet he filled his family‚Äôs life with sadness because he spent his nights with work, liquor, and women. In a desperate attempt to erase the memory of a turbulent childhood, Rosario is struggling to earn a degree in Business Management. Despite the sadness, the image of her father is linked to joy and passion, so preserved as a relic of mariachi attire. A dress without a master, a pain that only fades when Rosario unwittingly falls in love with Emiliano and lends him the suit for him to sing in the bar Plaza Garibaldi. Emiliano S√°nchez-Gallardo, a member of one of the most powerful families in Mexico, never imagined he would end up as a singer in a Mexican music bar, middle class, in the Colombian capital. He believed that his legal status in Mexico would be cleared in a few weeks, so he never told Rosario the truth. But the trouble is serious: they are blaming him for a massive money laundering operation actually operated by his partners. The uncertainty of trying to be someone else and the distress that it causes, causes the collapse of his family and his life, need to add the little control he has over his own feelings, to withstand the fierce opposition of their opponents, and the pitfalls put in his path by other women who desire Emiliano and want to separate him from Rosario.  Criticisms of the two versions  The telenovela garnered a big audience in Colombia and Latin America. Given these facts, Colombia decided to record more chapters. Criticism of U.S. and Chilean versions have not been too positive, because the story is resolved in a fast manner, leaving some unfinished business. On the other hand, the Colombian version explained in more detail the resolution of the plot and keeps the spirit that took the soap during its course. Cast *Mark Tacher‚Ä¶.

Both share the script and actors, as well as the main plot. The difference is found between the version issued in Colombia and issued in Chile and the United States. Up to episode 118 both versions are identical. In Colombia, due to the success, decided to extend the story in twenty episodes. The show was sold to other countries while still in the process of recording, with a number of episodes. To fulfill this contract, the producer made two final stories. The version issued in Chile and the U.S. has 124 episodes in the story resolved only six episodes from the aforementioned 118. However, in Colombia the story is much more delayed up to 146. Remake *In 2012, Televisa produced Qu√© bonito amor, a Mexican remake, written by the executive producer Salvador Mej√≠a Alexandre. Jorge Salinas and Danna Garc√≠a are the main protagonists. Pablo Montero and Mallilany Marin are the main antagonists. This remake soap opera wasn't successful and in many countries was cut off or even taken off from television due low ratings.

The sector's principal defense against an advance from Germany was the Rhine itself, which could be crossed only by boat or by seizing a bridge crossing. The frontier with Switzerland was not regarded as a high-risk location, save for a possible advance by German forces through Switzerland. Originally planned as a full extension of the Maginot Line with artillery ouvrages, the sector's fortifications were scaled back and chiefly took the form of casemates and blockhouses. The SF Altkirch adjoined the Fortified Sector of Mulhouse to the north and the Fortified Sector of Montb√©liard to the west.  Concept and organization  The region bordering Switzerland was treated as a low-priority area, but received a substantial number of casemates and blockhouses nonetheless. Initial plans floated in 1934 proposed four artillery ouvrages at Stetten, Ranspach-le-Haut, Bettlach and Trois-Maisons, with four more infantry ouvrages at Uffheim, Helfrantzkirch, Ranspach-le-Haut, Bettlach and Oltingue.Mary, Tome 1, p. 15 These were to be supported by 68 casemates. The project was cancelled in 1936 and were replaced by a more modest program that created three centers of resistance at Sierentz, Bettlach- Oltingue and at Roedersdorff-Blochmont. A total of six blockhouses were built, each housing two 75mm guns, with six more blockhouses armed with two 47mm guns, two machine guns and two automatic rifles. Three more resistance centers were proposed at Stetten, Ransbach-le-Haut and Trois-Maisons in 1937, but were replaced by more casemates, prepared for mobile 155mm and 240mm howitzers to cover the bridges at Basel and Huningue. Thirteen blockhouses, four observation positions and fourteen infantry shelters were planned for the Glaserberg, along the Swiss border.Mary, Tome 3, p. 36 Insignia of the 171st RIF  Command  Cloche at the Casemate des Vernes Until 16 March 1940, the Altkirch sector was part of the Fortified Region of Belfort. Afterwards, the Altkirch sector was under the command of the 44th Army Fortress Corps under General Tence, which was in turn under the command of the French 8th Army, General Garchery at the Fort de Giromagny, part of Army Group 3 under General Besson.Mary, Tome 3, p. 146 The 44th Corps' headquarters was at Dannemarie. The 67th Infantry Division, commanded by General Boutignon, provided infantry support. The 67th DI was a series B reserve division, not suitable for heavy or sustained combat Following to its reorganization, the sector was called the Defensive Sector of Altkirch. The SF/SD Altkirch was commanded by General Salvan. Fortress troops were provided by the 12th and 171st Fortress Infantry Regiments. Artillery support was provided by the third and fourth battalions of the 159th Position Artillery Regiment. At the midpoint of the Battle of France on 1 June 1940, the fortress troops of the SF Altkirch amounted to two fortress infantry regiments in five battalions, comprising 165 officers and 3,300 men.Mary, Tome 3, p. 189  Description  The sector includes, in order from north to south, the following significant casemates and blockhouses in each sub-sector: = Sub-sector of Franken = 171st Fortress Infantry Regiment (171e R√©giment d'Infanterie de Forteresse (RIF)), Lt.

Battle of France  Panorama of the Casemate des Vernes The German offensive (Operation Kleiner B√§r) across the Rhine was concentrated in the area near and to the north of Colmar, with little fighting in the Altkirch sector. The offensive, launched on 15 June, was rendered unimportant when the German XIX Corps under General Heinz Guderian reached the Swiss border on 17 June, behind the main French line.Mary, Tome 3, p. 200 The 12th RIF was deployed on the heights of the Jura until 17 June, when it was called back to Belfort for the defense of the city. The second battalion was captured the next day, while the first battalion, retreating to Masevaux, was captured on the 19th at Chapelle-sous-Rougemont.Mary, Tome 1, p. 88 The 171st RIF began a retreat toward the Dollar Valley and Masevaux on 18 June. Fighting ensued at Sentheim on the 19th, with Colonel Lavelle's detachment and the 21st battalion captured there. The remainder retreated to the Lauw-Mortzwiller area. The second and third battalions were captured at Masevaux, while the remainder of the regiment, now amounting to about one hundred men, retreated through the Stiftkopf forest, ending up at the T√™te-de-Neuf-Bois. On the 26th the regiment was ordered to the Charbonniers village, where it was captured.Mary, Tome 1, pp. 136-137  Notes  References  Bibliography  *Allcorn, William. The Maginot Line 1928-45.

Standard Fare were named after a sign Emma saw on a bus in Newcastle. The band's sound draws on their influences of soft rock and punk but is often linked to the sounds of C86 era bands. History Emma, Dan and Andy are all from north Derbyshire. After practising in Buxton for a couple of years the trio moved their rehearsals to Yellow Arch Studios in Sheffield, in 2007. The band received their first national radio play in early 2008 after the BBC's Huw Stephens received a copy of their demo Get On Board through the post. This was followed by them playing a showcase gig for Huw Stephens a few months later at The Social in London. In summer 2008, Standard Fare were signed to Thee SPC, an independent Sheffield label. A recording session followed and March 2009 saw the band's first release, a split single on 7‚Äù vinyl with Sheffield band Slow Down Tallahassee, featuring the song \\"Dancing\\". A second 7‚Äù single, \\"Fifteen\\" was released on Thee SPC in January 2010. An agreement was signed with the Manchester-based label, Melodic to co-release the band‚Äôs debut album The Noyelle Beat. The album was released in both the UK and US in March 2010, with the US release under Bar None Records. This was followed by a 7‚Äù release of \\"Philadelphia\\". The Noyelle Beat featured songs recorded at Stockport's LP Studios, and at 2Fly Studios in Sheffield with Alan Smyth. A second split single, this time with Boston-based band One Happy Island was released in January 2011. Standard Fare's second studio album, Out Of Sight, Out Of Town, was released in December 2011. Reviews were positive, with the BBC's Darren Loucaidis describing the record as \\"clear cut fun\\", Drowned In Sound's Alex Yau noting the record's new found \\"maturity\\", and musicOMH's Helen Clarke claiming it to be \\"a late contender for indiepop album of the year\\". In January 2013, the band announced they were to split up, issuing a statement which said that \\"after nine years of playing together, we are finishing Standard Fare on a high\\". They also said they parted on friendly terms, and would play two final gigs in Sheffield and London in February and March.

Jnan Prakash Ghosh provides music for the 5 min 35 second film, which was produced at the National Film Board of Canada. The film's technique was inspired by the beadwork of Inuit women. The increasing aggression shown by the creatures in Bead Game was intended as a cautionary tale about human hostility and nuclear weapons. Patel made the film as a response to India's development of nuclear weapons.  Director  Ishu Patel is an acclaimed Indian animation film director, producer and educator who has devoted his life to animation and photography. Born in Gujarat (India), Patel graduated from the University of Baroda Faculty of Fine Arts, completed his graduate studies in Visual Communication at the National Institute of Design of Ahmedabad, and advanced Graphic Design at the Basel School of Design in Switzerland. A Rockefeller Foundation Scholarship brought him to the National Film Board of Canada, a country and a center to which he was linked for over 20 years.  Plot  A single bead multiplies into two beads. From there, they continue to expand, turning into Atoms which eventually transform into creatures. These creatures magically ingest each other then mutate into other mythical beings. For example, a monster eats a dinosaur then transforms into a seal. This sequence displays how creatures deal with conflict without the control of brain power. As the cycle continues, the beads eventually turn into humans. The chronological arrangement demonstrates how civilization has dealt with conflict inspired by creatures of the past, only now, with the advancement of technology in terms of the weapons used. For example, in its earliest sequence, it shows humans blasting cannons into enemy territory. It then moves on to humans shooting rifles during war.Internet Archive The entirety of the short film is based on how different time periods dealt with competition, this case, it is displayed through malicious actions shown through the evolution of the beads. To accentuate the seemingly unbroken chain of evolution over centuries, Patel chose to film the beads themselves growing in a constant flow of movement into larger and more complex creatures and images, with the camera continuously zooming out to accommodate the escalation; this requires him to film on a continual basis without deviating from whatever path he had taken once filming began, and cuts had to be kept to an absolute minimum.  Mythical Concepts as Film Identity  The use of mythical creatures became part of Patel's film identity. From his first film for the National Film Board of Canada, How Death Came to Earth (1971), based on Indian creation myths, through The Bead Game (1977), where thousands of beads are painstakingly arranged and manipulated into constantly changing shapes (Academy Awards nomination for animated short; BAFTA for short fiction film), Afterlife (1978), which offers an impressionistic view of death and dying (Canadian Film Award; Montr√©al World Film Festival Grand Prize for short film), to Divine Fate(1993) and The Tibetan Book of the Dead: The Great Liberation (1994), Ishu Patel has pursued his project of animating religious/mythical concepts and tales with great beauty and style.  Significance of Final Scene  The last image is a hopeful one, or at least one that holds a hopeful possibility. After showing the culmination of humanity's military brilliance in a burst of Atomic Bomb, the scene is echoed with trees in place of mushroom clouds, with a central character ultimately placing the atom in the middle of a cat's cradle. It's a peaceful image, but a fragile one, too, without the inevitability of the earlier apocalypse.  Jnan Prakash Ghosh  Jnan Prakash Ghosh created the musical background to the Bead Game. The music creates a more intense dynamic that complements the overall theme of the short film. The animation ties perfectly with the beat of the music, producing smooth transitions when the creatures transform. Ghosh was born in a family with musical background in Kolkata, India. He was the grandson of Dwarik Ghosh, inventor of the Dwarkin harmonium, popular in West Bengal, India. He was first class first on graduation from Calcutta University in the Pali language. He was trained in vocals by Girija Shankar, Mohammed Sagir Khan and Mohammed Dabir Khan. He underwent tabla lessons from Ustad Masit Khan of the Farukkabad Gharana and Ustad Feroze Khan of the Punjab Gharana. He worked for 15 years in All India Radio as a music producer. He made significant contributions in classical music, light music, modern, orchestral, choral and percussion styles. Lastly, he began the \\"Ramayangeeti\\" a fusion of traditional and modern Indian music.  Awards  Awards for Bead Game include a BAFTA Award for best short fictional film, a Bronze Plaque in the art and culture category at the Columbus International Film & Video Festival, a Golden Gate Award for outstanding achievement at the San Francisco International Film Festival, and a Special Prize for Animation at the International Leipzig Festival for Documentary and Animated Film. The film was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film at the 50th Academy Awards, losing to another NFB animated short, The Sand Castle.

Shimano Nexus is a brand of bicycle components which includes products such as epicyclical gear hubs, cranksets, shifters, brake levers, hub brakes, hub dynamos, and a CPU for automatically changing gears. The series is primarily aimed at the \\"comfort\\" market such as urban commuters and tourers, and as such is not made to withstand the rigours of off-road or mountain biking. The free-wheeling Nexus internal gear hubs are compatible with Shimano's \\"roller brake\\", its version of a drum brake,Shimano tech doc for Nexus Inter 3 with \\"roller brake\\" installation instructionsShimano product spec page for Nexus Inter 7 indicating \\"roller brake\\" compatible Shimano product spec page for Nexus Inter 8 indicating \\"roller brake\\" compatible but not with the Shimano disc brakes used with the higher-end Shimano Alfine internal gear hubs. History In 1995, Shimano rolled out its Nexus line of seven- and four-speed internal hubs. These had a new rotary actuator that did away with externally protruding gear shifting elements in the rear wheel. Also, the gear units were able to be shifted under moderate pedaling loads. Shimano had manufactured three speed hubs prior to that, and these hubs were at that point re-branded Nexus. In the early 2000s the 8-speed Nexus hub gear was introduced, having two stepped planetary series mounted downstream of each other. The hub was operated with a twist shifter. By November 2006, The Nexus range came in several ranges (Inter 3, Inter 7 and Inter 8) providing 3, 7 and 8 speed models respectively. Internal gear hubs Shimano Nexus Inter 3 hub laced with spokes and mounted on a bicycle. Inter 3 - This hub has three speeds with 36% intervals and an overall gear range of 186%. It weighs 1220 grams stripped in its basic version (without built-in brake). Other versions include coaster, roller or disk brake. Starting from around 2011 Shimano offers a model with a rotary shifting mechanism similar to the one originally developed for the Inter 7 instead of the push rod/bell crank mechanism. Auto 3 - The hub is fitted with a 3 speed automatic gear system, which utilizes a front hub dynamo to power a CPU that automatically changes the three speed internally geared hub. A similar system was built for the nexus 4.Shimano Assembly Manual for Nexus Auto-D 4 Inter 4 - Nexus Inter 4 hubs had four speeds, but the same 186% range as the Inter 3. It only geared up, so a relatively large rear sprocket was necessary to give a reasonable development when combined with a normal front sprocket.Sheldon Brown about internal gear hubs It has been discontinued and spare parts have become hard to source. Inter 5 - Apparently in 2012 Shimano has started making Nexus Inter 5 hubs. A forum discussionmtbr forum thread - New Shimano 5-speed IGH contains a link to oneNEXUS 5-Speed Internal Hub SG-5R35 parts list of twoNEXUS 5-Speed Internal Hub SG-5R30 parts list parts lists at Shimano.

Shimano Nexus Inter 7 Hub GearInter 7 - The Inter 7 comes in two versions with either a steel or aluminium shell, weighing 1860 and 1460 grams respectively, the latter more expensive yet relatively reasonably priced. The gear mechanisms are operated with a Revo Twist Shifter or a simple non-ratcheting trigger shifter and are identical in the two versions, offering a range of 244% with non-even interval percentages of 17,14,17,16,17,16. Inter 8 - The Inter 8 has interval percentages between the gears of 22,16,14,18,22,16,14, and a total range of 307%, comparable to a road bike derailleur gear systems, but as the other Nexus products, it is designed and intended for urban commuter use. The hub comes in a variety of versions, weighing between 1550 and 2040 grams stripped. The newest high end models are internally very similar to the Alfine model.Sheldon Brown about the Inter 8 The Inter 8 is more tolerant of shifting under load than the Inter 7. Nexus front hub with attached roller brake. Roller brakes The Shimano-invented \\"roller brake\\" works similarly to a drum brake, but is fitted to the side of the hub with a special adaptor ring. To provide better cooling the roller brake comes with an integrated cooling disc.

It was filmed in the Kootenay region of Southeastern British Columbia and stars Jessica Biel. The film is set in a small former mining town where poverty is rife and children are disappearing on a regular basis. The abductions are blamed on a local legend called \\"the Tall Man.\\" Jessica Biel plays a widowed nurse whose child is abducted, leading her on a desperate chase to recover him.  Plot  Julia lives in a small town in Washington called Cold Rock. She is the town's local nurse, widowed by her husband, who was the town's doctor. Cold Rock was formerly a prosperous mining town, but has become poverty-stricken. There is little work, the school has been closed and the town has virtually vanished from the map. During her day, Julia visits several families. Jenny and Carol live with their mother and her violent, alcoholic boyfriend, who has impregnated Carol. Despite this, their mother did not kick him out, drawing Julia's ire. Instead, she sends away Carol and her baby, whom Julia helped to deliver. Because of her rough life, Jenny is selectively mute, communicating through a journal she carries. She also sketches things she's seen, including \\"the tall man\\". This is a local legend or urban myth surrounding a being who abducts local children who are never seen again. Julia returns to her large home on the outskirts of Cold Rock, which she shares with her son David and his nanny. She eats dinner, puts David to bed, and falls asleep on a couch. She awakes to a noise downstairs, followed by a loud radio sermon. She finds the nanny bound and gagged, then rushes to her son's bedroom, finding him gone. While in pursuit of what the viewer believes is \\"The Tall Man\\", it is gradually revealed that David is not her son at all, but rather one of the kidnapped children. The kidnapper is actually the real mother of the boy, attempting to take back her child. The rest of the town, skeptical of the mother's accusations, agree to give her a chance to prove her claims. Julia, with the help of Jenny, pursues the mother, reacquires David, and hands him off to \\"The Tall Man\\" in the tunnels which run under the town, left over from the defunct mine. Jenny begs her to send the Tall Man to take her, too. Julia initially refuses but then relents, cautioning her to remain silent about it until the Tall Man comes for her. Julia then waits in her house. The police and FBI arrive, as does an angry mob. The nanny hangs herself, and Julia is taken to jail, where she is despised and threatened as a child killer. Julia admits to kidnapping and murdering the children, but the confession is later revealed to be a lie. Julia is part of an organization which \\"rescues\\" young children from bad homes and places them with good ones, in an attempt to break the cycle of poverty and abuse which passes from one generation to the next. Soon after, Jenny watches her mother engage in a drunken fight with her boyfriend, before laughing with him over it. Disgusted, Jenny walks off into a nearby field, where she finds the Tall Man waiting for her‚ÄîJulia's husband, who is not dead after all. He takes her to an empty house in a nearby city, providing her with new clothes. He then delivers her to a new family, with a new identity. The Tall Man refuses payment, saying that the organization faces massive risks to rescue each child, with Julia martyring herself to save the organization. In Cold Rock, Jenny's birth mother grieves over her runaway daughter, the town continues to decline, and Julia sits in prison. The police have given up on finding the children, thinking that Julia buried them in the tunnels which run for miles and are dangerous to traverse because of cave ins, etc. In comparison, Jenny lives in a beautiful home, where her art is encouraged, and she has the best of everything. She has begun to talk and seems well-adjusted and happy. As she walks to an art class, she gives a voice-over expressing love and gratitude toward her three mothers: her birth mother, whom she misses; Julia, who gave her a chance at a new life; and her new mother, who is providing her with everything she could ever want. As she crosses a park, she sees David with his new family, which he now accepts as his own. (Jenny thinks he and the other younger ones have forgotten and do not recognize her, but the visual cues leave it decidedly open-ended). Despite getting her wish of a better life, she sometimes wishes to return. Jenny's closing thoughts question society's implication that her new life is better.

Davis as Sheriff Chestnut * Samantha Ferris as Tracy * Colleen Wheeler as Mrs. Johnson * Eve Harlow as Christine * Jakob Davies as David Johnson  Production  Star Jessica Biel said that she enjoyed Pascal Laugier's previous film, Martyrs, and loved the script for The Tall Man, which impressed her with its unpredictable plot twists. She became enthusiastic about the project and wanted to work with him. Principal photography began in September 2010. The film is Pascal Laugier's first English production.  Release  In 2012 The Tall Man premiered at South by Southwest, where it was acquired by Image Entertainment. It received a limited release on August 31, 2012, and was released on Blu-ray Disc and DVD 25 days later on September 25, 2012.  Reception  Reviews were mixed; Rotten Tomatoes reports that 41% of 29 surveyed critics gave it a positive review; the average score was 5.24/10. Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times wrote that Biel's performance was believable and the film atmospheric, but the story becomes ridiculous and nonsensical. Jeanette Catsoulis positively compared it to Stephen King's early work, and designated it as a New York Times Critics' Pick. Chris Packham of The Village Voice called the film implausible and deceptive in its narrative twists. Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club rated the film B and described the film's plot as unpredictable but unwieldy, though Biel's performance and a final plot twist save the film from the expected mediocrity of a direct-to-video release. Scott Weinberg of Fearnet wrote that the film's increasingly unpredictable plot twists and acting by Biel cause it to defy expectations and may encourage discussion among viewers. Elizabeth Kerr of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that, like Martyrs, the film had arresting imagery but a leaden narrative.

She was the founding chairwoman of Ny Musikk (1938-1961) and served as president of the International Society for Contemporary Music (1952‚Äì53). Background Pauline Hall was born at Hamar in Hedmark, Norway. She was the daughter of Isak Muus Hall (1849-1914) and Magdalena Catharina Agersborg (1854-1934). Her father was a pharmacist who operated several pharmacies in Hamar, at Kabelv√•g in Lofoten and in Troms√∏. From 1908 she studied piano with composer and pianist Johan Backer Lunde (1874-1958) in Kristiania (now Oslo). From 1910-1912 she studied the theory and composition of classical composers and music educator Catharinus Elling. She also had a study stay in Paris 1912-1914. Career Pauline Hall with board of NyMusikk, 1958 Hall‚Äôs debut as a composer came in 1917 with a full-length concert evening in Oslo featuring solely her works. Hall was initially known as a composer of romances, but today her orchestral works, and in particular 1929‚Äôs Verlaine Suite, stand out as centerpieces of her compositional output. French impressionism and literature would prove to be key sources of inspiration for Hall, an influx that would not necessarily resonate well with the prevailing national romanticism sentiment of 1930s Norway. Throughout her compositional career, Hall would find it challenging to introduce new stylistic impulses to the Norwegian music scene. In addition to her orchestral output, Hall also composed a number of choral works and music for stage productions. Theatre remained close to her heart, and Hall translated a number of major works into Norwegian including Igor Stravinsky‚Äôs Soldier‚Äôs Tale and Arthur Honegger‚Äôs Le Roi David. In 1930, she translated, staged and directed The Threepenny Opera (Die Dreigroschenoper) by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill. Hall also served as instructor and conductor for its Oslo premiere. She wrote music for radio and started Pauline Hall's vocal quintet in 1932. From 1934 to 1964, she worked as music critic for the Oslo daily newspaper Dagbladet. Hall was known for criticism of dilettantism and superficial national composers and her promotion of modern music. In 1938 she was the founding chairwoman of Ny Musikk, the Norwegian section of the International Society for Contemporary Music (ISCM). She also served as president of ISCM International from 1952‚Äì53, and took over management of the ISCM International Music Festival in Oslo in 1953. She served as chair of Ny Musikk until 1961 when she was succeeded by composer Finn Mortensen. Personal life Pauline Hall received the King's Medal of Merit (Kongens fortjenstmedalje) in gold in 1938. She died in Oslo and was buried at Vestre gravlund. Selected Works Hall composed orchestral works, theater and film music, chamber music and vocal works.

He is remembered above all for his almost photographic images of the City of Luxembourg.\\"Frenez, Jean-Baptiste\\", Luxemburger Lexikon, Editions Guy Binsfeld, Luxembourg, 2006. Early life Born in Longwy on 10 July 1800, Fresez came to Luxembourg City with his parents in 1802 when his father started to work at the Sept-Fontaines porcelain factory in the Rollingergrund. He attended the Luxembourg Drawing School where he was awarded the first prize when he was just 14, before continuing his art studies at the Royal Academy in Brussels.Georgette Bisdorff, \\"Jean-Baptiste Fresez\\", Ons stad No 61, 1999. Retrieved 19 January 2011. In 1848, Fresez acquired Luxembourg nationality. Career Jean-Baptiste Fresez: Vianden near the Bridge (c. 1857) After graduating, he worked as an engraver and painter at the Villeroy and Boch porcelain factory in Mettlach on the River Saar. There he was also charged with giving art lessons to Fran√ßois Boch's children. When his father died in 1817, he returned to Luxembourg where he obtained employment in an architect's office. This allowed him to save up for his education in painting and sculpture at the Royal Academy in Brussels where he received a diploma allowing him to become an art teacher. From 1824, he taught first at the Luxembourg Drawing School, then at the prestigious Ath√©n√©e. Among his most notable students were the painter and photographer Pierre Brandebourg and the illustrator Michel Engels. He spent all his holidays in Antwerp, studying the grand masters leading in 1826 to a diploma from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. At the Ath√©n√©e he developed an innovative method of art teaching which, welcomed by the school, became a compulsory course for most of the students.A. Namur, \\"Notice sur feu J.-B. Fresez, professeur de dessin et de peinture √† l'Ath√©n√©e Royal Grand-Ducal de Luxembourg\\", Imprimerie V. Buck, 1967. Fresez published views of Luxembourg City, helped Nicolas Liez with his album and, in 1857, published his own Album pittoresque du Grand-Duch√© dedicated to Prince Henry of the Netherlands. The album contains a collected of lithographs based on 30 of his finest drawings, all considered to be of great documentary value. As a result, Fresez became a member of the Grand-Ducal Archeological Society (Soci√©t√© arch√©ologique du Grand-Duch√©) and of the Brussels Institute of Fine Arts (Institut des Beaux-Arts de Bruxelles). He died on 31 March 1867 in Luxembourg City. Artwork Fresez not only produced fine landscapes but also portraits clearly depicting not just lively facial features but also the figure's clothing including, for example, the transparency of the lace. They represent mainly members of the grand-ducal family and other notable local figures. In 1841, he presented a series of watercolour portraits to King William II who was visiting Luxembourg. It was so highly appreciated that the king asked for a copy for his wife. His landscapes, which he began to publish as early as 1826, were also of considerable artistic merit. A similar publication followed in 1833 and in 1855, he published his famous Album pittoresque du Grand-Duch√© de Luxembourg. The landscapes are extremely detailed, many of them depicting Luxembourg's most beautiful scenes which can usually still be easily identified today. As a result, the works are of great documentary value, especially those of the fortress of Luxembourg before it was dismantled.

Because of its apparently poor preservation its ordinal and familial position is uncertain. It could be included in either the Plectronocerida, family Plectronoceratidae, or the Ellesmerocerida, family Ellesmeroceratidae (Flower, 1954). On the other hand, Teichert (1964) included Shungtangendoceras in the Ellesmoerocatidae. Shungtangendoceras has a small, marginal siphuncle, presumed ventral (Flower, 1954). the central siphuncle in Sun's analysis turns out to be an adventitious feature. Also, according to Flower (1954) there are no endocones in this fossil, eliminating it from the Endocerida. Moreover, the earliest endocerids have been shown to be derived from the Ellesmerocertidae in the Early Ordovician. Shungtangendoceras comes from the Wanwankou Member of the Fengshan Formation which is now recognized as late Upper Cambrian in age (Chen and Teichert, 1983; Teichert, 1988; Landing and Kroger, 2009) rather than Lower Ordovician as thought by Flower (1954) and Teichert (1964). Chen and Techert (1983) do not list Shungtangendoceras among the Cambrian cephalopods, which brings up the question of its possible synonymy. References *Flower, R. H, 1954, Cambrian Cephalopods.

(23 March 1565 ‚Äì 2 June 1621) was a German Lutheran theologian and philosopher, also known as a classical scholar, mathematician and cartographer. He was an influence on Comenius. Eilhard Lubinus Life His actual name is Eilhard L√ºbben. Born in Westerstede in 1565, Lubinus was son of a pastor in the Duchy of Oldenburg. He studied at Leipzig and other universities, and in 1595 became Professor of Poetry in the University of Rostock. In 1605 he transferred to the Chair of Theology there. Phillip II of Pomerania in 1610 commissioned him to make a map of Pomerania. He died in 1621 in Rostock. 1618 map of Pomerania by Lubinus Works Lubinus published works including editions of the Epistolae of Apollonius, the De Vanitate Mundi of Bernard, the Greek Anthology in a literal Latin version, and the Epistolae of Hippocrates. In his Phosphorus, sive de prima causa et natura mali tractatus (Rostock 1596), he taught (following a neo-Platonist position) that there are two primordial principles, Being and Nothing. This position was considered heretical, and he was attacked for it by Albert Grauer and others. He published a trilingual edition of the New Testament in 1617. With it as a Preface was a Discourse against the contemporary methods of teaching Latin; it advocated the use of pictures and techniques treating it as a living language. Comenius later acknowledged the influence of Lubinus on his own educational thinking.Daniel Murphy, Comenius (1995), p. 197.

It is a semi-synthetic derivative of staurosporine, an alkaloid from the bacterium Streptomyces staurosporeus. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication.  AML and MDS  Midostaurin was found to be active against oncogenic CD135 (FMS- like tyrosine kinase 3 receptor, FLT3), in preclinical studies. Clinical trials have primarily focused on relapsed/refractory AML and MDS and have included single agent and combination agent studies. After successful Phase II clinical trials, midostaurin was found to prolong survival of FLT3-mutated AML patients when combined with conventional induction and consolidation therapies in a randomized Phase III clinical trial. On April 28, 2017, midostaurin was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed AML who are positive for oncogenic FLT3, in combination with chemotherapy. The drug is approved for use with a companion diagnostic, the LeukoStrat CDx FLT3 Mutation Assay, which is used to detect the FLT3 mutation in patients with AML.  Systemic mastocytosis  Over 95% of patients with adult onset systemic mastocytosis and approximately 40% of children with cutaneous mastocytosis are positive for the D816V c-Kit activating mutation, which renders c-Kit resistant to currently available tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Midostaurin is an investigational treatment in patients with advanced forms of systemic mastocytosis and D816V c-Kit mutation with a subset of patients achieving clinical response. In an open-label study of patients with mastocytosis-related organ damage (89 eligible patients meeting inclusion for the primary efficacy population), midostaurin showed efficacy in patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis, including the highly fatal variant mast cell leukemia.  Side effects  Common side effects include immune system related problems (fever, febrile neutropenia), blood clotting problems (bruising, nosebleed), and unspecific symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea and headache. Upper respiratory tract infections can be dangerous.Drugs.com: overview.

The village was founded in 1892 by Tyrolean immigrants from the former Austrian Trentino (today part of Italy). Santana (village) also represents the Tyrolean colony in Piracicaba. History By the end of 19th century, the Austria-Hungary empire faced several regional conflicts resulted from economic hardships and cultural differences. This crisis resulted in poverty and high unemployment rates compelling many families to immigrate. During this period, immigration was intense in Brazil: large numbers of Europeans, especially Italians, started to be brought to the country to work in the harvest of coffee and then replace the slavery workforce (abolished in 1888). From 1877 to 1903, almost two million immigrants arrived in Brazil.Maria Stella Ferreira Levy . p.51 During the Austria-Hungary empire, Tyrol was divided in two regions: North Tyrol and Trentino-Alto Adige/S√ºdtirol. Tyrolean immigrants who settled in Santa Ol√≠mpia came from Etschtal (Italian: Val d'Adige), name given to that part of alpine valley of the Adige in Italy. In the end of World War I and following the fall of the Austria-Hungary Empire, the southern parts of Tyrol, i.e. Trentino and South Tyrol, were annexed to Italy while North Tyrol became part of the new Austrian Republic.

This list represents routes that traveled through the state but are no longer in operation, have been decommissioned, or have been renumbered. __TOC__ State Route 1E State Route 1E (SR 1E) was a route in Floyd County extending along present-day Old Cedartown Road, Park Avenue, Maple Avenue, East Sixth Street, and 2nd Avenue from US 27/SR 1 to US 27/SR 1, as well as US 411/SR 53\\\\. Originally part of US 27/SR 1, it was originally designated as SR 1 before being reassigned as SR 1E in 1955. US 27/SR 1 had been relocated along former SR 1 Spur, which is present-day US 27/SR 1 from Old Cedartown Road to present- day US 411 in 1938 with the old route remaining as SR 1 through Lindale. When US 27 was upgraded and relocated in 1968 to the Rome Connector, SR 1E was truncated to end at the present-day interchange of Maple Avenue. Essentially a business route for an unincorporated community south of Rome, the state no longer saw the value in retaining an old alignment and transferred control to Floyd County in 1985.

It, along with US 41 Temp., followed US 19 on Spring Street, then traveled west on 14th Street and resumed the Northside Drive path. By April 1949, US 41 Temp./SR 3E's southbound lanes traveled on Hemphill Avenue. By the middle of 1950, US 41 Temp./SR 3E was shifted off of US 19 on Spring Street and 14th Street, and traveled on Hemphill Avenue again. In 1952, US 41 Temp. was redesignated as part of the US 41 mainline. In 1985, SR 3E was decommissioned. State Route 3S (Marietta) State Route 3S (SR 3S) was a state highway that existed in the city limits of Marietta in Cobb County, Georgia. By the end of 1965, it was designated from SR 3 to SR 5.

It began at the Alabama state line, traveled to the east-southeast and intersected SR 1 in Rome. It then curved to the southeast and reached its eastern terminus, an intersection with SR 3 in Cartersvile. By the end of 1921, SR 4 was extended southeast into the main part of Cartersville, on a concurrency with SR 3 and headed north-northeast to an intersection with SR 2/SR 53 in Fairmount. By the end of 1926, almost all of the Alabama‚ÄìRome segment, and the southern half of the 1921 extension, had a \\"sand clay or top soil\\" surface.

In July 1981, as the extension of SR 400 had reached SR 60 south-southeast of Dahlonega, this designation was decommissioned. The routing that was followed by SR 9E starts where Hopewell Road splits from the current SR 9 north-northeast of Coal Mountain in Forsyth County, and parallels SR 400 very closely. The road changes names to Lumpkin Campground Road as it enters Dawson County, passes by the North Georgia Premium Outlet Mall, then crosses SR 53 and SR 400 in rapid succession. Just before intersecting with SR 136 the road changes names again to Harmony Church Road, then is called Auraria Road as it becomes SR 136\\\\. The road crosses SR 400 once more to its west, parts ways with SR 136, then travels north through the community of Auraria into Lumpkin County to its northern terminus at SR 9/SR 52 west of Dahlonega. State Route 11E State Route 11E (SR 11E) was a state highway that existed entirely within Bibb County in the Macon metropolitan area.

The portion from southeast of Warrenton to northwest of Wrens was redesignated as SR 16 Conn., while the portion from northwest of Wrens to north of Louisville was redesignated as SR 16 Conn. State Route 20 (1919‚Äì1921) State Route 20 (SR 20) was a very short-lived state highway that traveled from Gray to Sparta. It was formed at least as early as 1919 and was decommissioned in 1921 and redesignated SR 22. It began at an intersection with SR 11 in Gray. It traveled to the east-northeast and entered Milledgeville, where it intersected SR 24 and SR 29\\\\. It then went northeast to Sparta, where it met its eastern terminus, an intersection with SR 15 and SR 16\\\\. SR 20 was reused that same year on a different road (see below). State Route 20 (1921‚Äì1929) State Route 20 (SR 20) was a state highway in the east-central part of the state. At least as early as 1919, part of SR 24 was established from Louisville to Waynesboro. By the end of September 1921, the path of SR 24, from Waynesboro to Louisville, was shifted northwestward. The former path of SR 24 was redesignated as SR 20. Between October 1926 and October 1929, the path of SR 24, from Augusta to Louisville, was reverted to the Waynesboro‚ÄìLouisville path, replacing SR 20\\\\. SR 24's former path, on US 1, was redesignated as part of SR 4. SR 20 was reused on that same day as a redesignation of most of the original SR 4. State Route 26E State Route 26E (SR 26E) was a state highway that existed in the eastern part of Chatham County, in Savannah Beach, which is what Tybee Island was known as at the time. The roadway that would eventually become SR 26E was established between June 1963 and the end of 1965, as SR 26 Loop, between two intersections with US 80/SR 26 in the southern part of the city. In 1969, it was redesignated as SR 26E. In 1985, SR 26E was decommissioned. State Route 27S State Route 27S (SR 27S) was a state highway that existed in the central part of Dodge County, southwest of Eastman. Between June 1963 and the end of 1965, it was established from US 341/SR 27 west of Eastman to US 23/US 341/SR 27 southeast of the city. In 1977, it became the new route of US 341/SR 27. State Route 28 (1919‚Äì1937) State Route 28 (SR 28) was a state highway that traveled from Georgetown to Vienna. It was established at least as early as 1919 and was decommissioned in 1937. It began at an intersection with SR 39 in Georgetown. It traveled to the northeast and intersected SR 1 in Lumpkin. It curved to the east-southeast through Preston. In Americus, the highway intersected SR 3 and SR 26\\\\. It headed to the east and entered Vienna, where it met its eastern terminus, an intersection with SR 7\\\\. By the end of 1926, a segment just east of Preston was under construction. The eastern half of the Preston‚ÄìAmericus segment had a completed hard surface. The Dooly County portion of the highway had a sand clay or topsoil surface. By the end of 1929, a segment just east of Lumpkin and a segment just west of Preston had a sand clay or topsoil surface. By the middle of 1930, SR 28 was extended northeast from Vienna to Hawkinsville. A few months later, the Richland‚ÄìPreston segment was under construction. By 1932, US 280 was designated on the Richland‚ÄìAmericus segment. Near the end of the year, the entire Vienna‚ÄìHawkinsville segment had a sand clay or topsoil surface. By the end of 1937, s segment just southwest of Hawkinsville had a completed hard surface. Just a few months later, all of SR 28 had been redesignated as SR 27. This was done so that SR 28 could be reused on former SR 52 and SR 105 to match South Carolina. State Route 34 (1919‚Äì1926) State Route 34 (SR 34) was a short-lived state highway in the western part of the state. It was established at least as early as 1919 and was decommissioned in 1926. When it was established, it extended from SR 1 and SR 16 in Carrollton to SR 8 in Villa Rica. In 1926, its entire length consisted of a \\"sand clay or top soil\\" surface and was redesignated as a southern branch of SR 8. Within three years, US 78S had been designated along the path of SR 8's southern branch. A decade later, US 78S had been redesignated as US 78 Alt. Nearly another decade later, SR 8 had been redesignated as SR 8 Alt. By the beginning of 1953, US 78 Alt. had been decommissioned. By the middle of 1954, SR 8 Alt. had been redesignated as SR 166 from Carrollton to northeast of the city and SR 61 from that point to Villa Rica, as they travel today. SR 34 was reused in 1930 along part of its current route. State Route 36 (1919‚Äì1941) State Route 36 (SR 36) was a state highway that originally existed from Danielsville to Elberton, when it was established at least as early as 1919. By the middle of 1930, its western terminus was shifted southwestward into Athens. By the end of the year, the western terminus had been reverted to Danielsville and extended northwest to Commerce. The Athens‚ÄìComer segment was redesignated as SR 82. In 1941, SR 82 west of Comer and the Comer‚ÄìSouth Carolina segment of SR 36 had been redesignated as SR 72, while the Commerce‚ÄìComer segment of SR 36 had been redesignated as an extension of SR 98\\\\. That same day, the old SR 72 was redesignated as SR 36. State Route 42A State Route 42A (SR 42A) was a state highway in Atlanta. It was entirely concurrent with US 29/US 78/SR 8/SR 10/SR 12 (Ponce de Leon Avenue). It was formed in 1941 and decommissioned only five years later, in 1946. It began at an intersection with US 19/SR 9 in the northern part of the city. From there, US 29/US 78/SR 8/SR 10/SR 12/SR 42A traveled to the east to an intersection with SR 42\\\\. Here, SR 42A ended, and US 29/US 78/SR 8/SR 10/SR 12 continued to the east. State Route 43 (1919‚Äì1941) State Route 43 (SR 43) was a state highway that originally existed from a point north-northwest of Gainesville, north-northeast to Cleveland, and then northwest to Turners Corner, when it was established at least as early as 1919. Its original southern terminus was at SR 11 north- northwest of Gainesville, and its original northern terminus was at SR 9 in Turners Corner. By the end of 1921, SR 11 and SR 43 were swapped in this area. SR 11 took over the entire route of SR 43, while SR 43 was shifted to travel from a point north-northeast of Gainesville northwest to SR 9 just northeast of Dahlonega. By the end of 1926, the southern part of the new path had a sand clay or top soil surface, and the rest of it had a completed semi hard surface. By the end of 1929, the Lumpkin County portion of the highway had a completed hard surface. By the middle of the next year, all of the highway was completed. In 1941, SR 43 was redesignated as SR 52. Note that SR 43 was reused on former SR 70 to match South Carolina that same day. State Route 44 (1919‚Äì1921) State Route 44 (SR 44) was a short-lived state highway that only existed from the Alabama state line, northwest of Jakin, to Brinson. It was established at least as early as 1919, and was decommissioned by the end of 1921. It was redesignated as part of SR 38. SR 44 was reused in 1921 along part of its current route. State Route 45 (1919‚Äì1926) State Route 45 (SR 45) was a short-lived state highway in the north-central part of the state. It was established at least as early as 1919 on a path from SR 8 and SR 13 in Lawrenceville, south-southeast to Loganville, east-southeast to SR 11 in Monroe, and east-northeast to SR 15 in Watkinsville. By the end of 1921, the Lawrenceville‚ÄìLoganville segment was redesignated as a southern extension of SR 13, the western terminus was extended west-southwest to what was known as \\"Ingleside\\" (now known as Avondale Estates), and the eastern terminus was shifted to the northwest to end at SR 8 west-southwest of Athens. By the end of 1926, the segment from Ingleside (now labeled as \\"Avondale\\") to Loganville and the segment from Monroe to the Athens area were redesignated as US 78/SR 10, while the Loganville‚ÄìMonroe segment was also redesignated as US 78 and SR 13 (and possibly SR 10). SR 45 was reused in 1930 along part of its current route. State Route 46 (1919‚Äì1921) State Route 46 (SR 46) was a short-lived state highway that started at SR 32 and SR 33 in Sylvester to SR 7 and SR 35 in Tifton. It was established at least as early as 1919. By the end of 1921, the entire highway was redesignated as part of SR 50. SR 46 was reused in 1921 along part of its current route. State Route 50N State Route 50N (SR 50N) was a state highway that existed in the city limits of Albany, within Dougherty County. The roadway that would eventually become SR 50N was established at least as early as 1919 as SR 32 from Dawson through Albany and into Sylvester. By the end of 1921, SR 50 was designated across the state. This truncated SR 32 at Ashburn. By the end of 1926, the portion of SR 50 in the eastern part of Albany had a \\"completed hard surface\\". By the middle of 1930, from west of Albany to the Worth‚ÄìTift county line, the highway had a completed hard surface. The western half of the Dougherty County portion of the Dawson‚ÄìAlbany segment had a completed semi hard surface. In January 1932, the Dawson‚ÄìAlbany segment had a completed hard surface. Between February 1948 and April 1949, US 82 was designated on SR 50 through the Albany area. Between June 1960 and June 1963, the path of SR& 50 through Albany was split into SR 50N and SR 50S. SR 50N used Broad Avenue and Sylvester Road, while US 82/SR 50S used Oglethorpe Avenue and Albany Expressway. In 1973, SR 50N was redesignated as SR 50 Conn., while SR 50S was redesignated as the SR 50 mainline. State Route 50S State Route 50S (SR 50S) was a state highway that existed in the city limits of Albany, within Dougherty County. The roadway that would eventually become SR 50S was established at least as early as 1919 as SR 32 from Dawson through Albany and into Sylvester. By the end of 1921, SR 50 was designated across the state. This truncated SR 32 at Ashburn. By the end of 1926, the portion of SR 50 in the eastern part of Albany had a \\"completed hard surface\\". By the middle of 1930, from west of Albany to the Worth‚ÄìTift county line, the highway had a completed hard surface. The western half of the Dougherty County portion of the Dawson‚ÄìAlbany segment had a completed semi hard surface. In January 1932, the Dawson‚ÄìAlbany segment had a completed hard surface. Between February 1948 and April 1949, US 82 was designated on SR 50 through the Albany area. Between June 1960 and June 1963, the path of SR& 50 through Albany was split into SR 50N and SR 50S. SR 50N used Broad Avenue and Sylvester Road, while US 82/SR 50S used Oglethorpe Avenue and Albany Expressway. In 1973, SR 50N was redesignated as SR 50 Conn., while SR 50S was redesignated as the SR 50 mainline. State Route 51 (1919‚Äì1921) State Route 51 (SR 51) was a state highway in Fannin County. Between 1919 and 1920, SR 51 was designated from Blue Ridge to the Tennessee state line. By the end of 1921, the entire highway was redesignated as part of SR 5. Note that the SR 51 number was reused in 1921 along part of the current highway. State Route 52 (1921‚Äì1937) State Route 52 (SR 52) was a state highway in Columbia and Richmond counties, in the Augusta metropolitan area. Between 1919 and 1921, SR 52 was designated from the South Carolina state line, northwest of Augusta, and the South Carolina state line again on the northeastern edge of the city. Before 1926 ended, the entire length of SR 52 had a \\"sand clay or top soil\\" surface. By the middle of 1930, in an area northwest of Augusta, SR 52 was shifted to a more western alignment. This segment was located about half of the distance from the Columbia‚ÄìRichmond county line and the original segment. The original part northwest of the split did not have a highway number. The highway had a \\"completed hard surface\\" from there to Augusta. The year ended with all of SR 52 having a \\"completed hard surface\\". The original part's Richmond County portion did, too. By February 1932, the entire length of the highway had a completed hard surface. Near the end of the year, the northwestern part of SR 52 was shifted back to its original alignment and re-signed as SR 52\\\\. The western extended part was re- designated as SR 104. Before 1938, all of SR 52 was redesignated as the southern segment of SR 28. State Route 54B State Route 54B (SR 54B) was a state highway just south of Atlanta. When it was established in between 1919 and 1921, it extended from an intersection with SR 16 in Sharpsburg northeast to an intersection with SR 54 in Fayetteville. By the end of 1926, the northern half had a sand clay or top soil surface. Nearly a decade later, the entire length of SR 54B was redesignated as a re-routing of the SR 54 mainline. State Route 56 Spur State Route 56 Spur (SR 56 Spur) was a spur route that existed entirely within the southeastern part of Richmond County. Its route was entirely within the city limits of Augusta. Its west‚Äìeast section was part of Tobacco Road. It was known as Doug Barnard Parkway for the rest of its length. Its entire length was within the city limits of Augusta. Its southern terminus was at an intersection with the SR 56 mainline (Mike Padgett Highway). Its northern terminus was at an intersection with US 1/US 25/US 78/US 278/SR 10/SR 121 (Gordon Highway) in downtown Augusta. Here, the roadway continues as Molly Pond Road. The highway was decommissioned in 2014. State Route 60 (1921‚Äì1926) State Route 60 (SR 60) was a short-lived state highway in the southeastern part of the state. When it was established between 1919 and 1921, it extended from SR 27 in Sterling northeast to an intersection with SR 25 south-southwest of Darien. By the end of 1926, the highway was removed from the state highway system. This short segment of highway would later be used as part of SR 131 in 1939, in which this section became part of SR 99, and SR 131 was shifted further north. State Route 60 (1930‚Äì1940) State Route 60 (SR 60) was a very short state highway that existed entirely within Walton County. The roadway that would eventually become SR 60 was built between 1921 and the end of 1926 as an unnumbered road from SR 11 in Social Circle to SR 12 southeast of the city. The entire length of the highway had a \\"sand clay or top soil\\" surface. In 1930, this road was designated as SR 60. At the end of 1940, SR 60 was redesignated as SR 181. It later became SR 213 one year later. This portion became part of SR 229, which along with SR 213, was decommissioned in the 1980s. SR 60 was reused as a renumbering of former SR 86, and SR 86 was reused to renumber the duplicate SR 160. State Route 62 (1926‚Äì1929) State Route 62 (SR 62) was a short-lived state highway in the northeastern part of the state. It was proposed between 1919 and 1921 on a path from SR 11 at a point northwest of Jefferson, at approximately the location of Talmo, northeast to SR 15 in Homer. By the end of 1926, SR 62 was established on this same path, with US 129 having been applied onto SR 11. Within three years, this short highway had been decommissioned. State Route 63 (1921‚Äì1967) State Route 63 (SR 63) was a state highway that existed in the east-central part of the state. When it was established between 1919 and 1921, it only extended from SR 30 in Ellabell to SR 26 at a point that approximates today's location of Eden. By the end of 1926, its termini were shifted to SR 30 in Lanier to US 80/SR 26 in Blitchton. By the end of 1929, the highway's western portion had a \\"sand clay or top soil\\" surface, while its eastern portion was under construction. Also, the western terminus was shifted again, to Pembroke. The next year, the eastern portion had a sand clay or top soil surface. At the end of the year, US 280 was designated along the entire path of SR 63. Before 1934 ended, the western portion had completed grading, but was not surfaced. Just a few months later the eastern portion of SR 63 was under the same condition. About six months later, the eastern terminus area had a completed hard surface. Near the end of 1936, the rest of the highway also had a completed hard surface. About a year later, SR 30's length southeast of Pembroke was swapped with the entire length of SR 63\\\\. That meant that SR 63 easternmost terminus was now at US 17/SR 25 southeast of Clyde. The portion of this \\"new\\" path just southeast of Pembroke, as well as the entire segment southeast of Clyde, was under construction. Within a year, those under construction segments had completed grading, but were not surfaced. By the middle of 1939, a small portion of the highway farther to the southeast of Pembroke had the same conditions. Before the year ended, the rest of the highway's length also had the same conditions. A few months later, most of the highway's length that today is within the boundaries of Fort Stewart was under construction. Later in 1940, the segment from US 17/SR 25 to SR 144 southeast of Clyde had a completed hard surface. About five years later, Fort Stewart was established. Most of the state highways that traveled within the area now covered by the base were removed. Due to this, SR 63 was split into two short segments: one from the northern edge of the base to Pembroke and one from Richmond Hill to the southeastern edge of the base. By the end of 1948, state highways were re-established through the base, thereby reconnecting SR 63 as a single highway. One year later, the eastern terminus of the highway was extended south-southeast to Fancy Hall. Before 1953 ended, the Keller‚ÄìRichmond Hill segment was hard surfaced. In 1954, the segment from the northern edge of Fort Stewart to Pembroke was hard surfaced. At the end of the decade, the Fancy Hall‚ÄìKeller segment was paved. Before 1966 began SR 63 Spur had been established from SR 63 southeast of Richmond Hill east to Fort McAllister. In 1967, SR 67's path south of Pembroke was shifted to the east, taking over the entire path of SR 63; therefore, SR 63 Spur was redesignated as SR 67 Spur. =State Route 63 Spur= State Route 63 Spur (SR 63 Spur) was a short-lived spur route of SR 63\\\\. Before 1966 began, SR 63 Spur was established from the SR 63 mainline southeast of Richmond Hill east to Fort McAllister. In 1967, SR 67's path south of Pembroke was shifted to the east, taking over the entire path of SR 63; therefore, SR 63 Spur was redesignated as SR 67 Spur. In the middle 1970s, SR 144 was extended east and south-southeast, taking over the route of SR 67 southeast of Fort Stewart; therefore, SR 67 was redesignated as SR 144 Spur. State Route 63 (1968‚Äì1986) State Route 63 (SR 63) went from SR 144 to SR 196\\\\. This was cancelled in 1986. It does not show on any official GDOT state maps, but is on some online maps. The SR 63 was reused in 1989 along the current highway. State Route 65 (1921‚Äì1926) State Route 65 (SR 65) was a state highway that formerly exited in the extreme northeastern part of the state. At least as early as 1919, a local road was established between the North Carolina and South Carolina state lines in Rabun County. By 1921, this road was designated as SR 65. By the end of 1926, this was cancelled. In 1932, this route was restored as SR 105. This roadway would eventually be redesignated as the northern segment of SR 28. SR 65 was reused on an unrelated route (no longer part of the current route) in 1932. State Route 68 (1921‚Äì1932) State Route 68 (SR 68) was a short-lived state highway in the north-central part of the state. When it was established between 1919 and 1921, it extended from SR 9 in Cumming southeast to SR 13 in Buford. In January 1932, SR 68 was decommissioned and redesignated as part of SR 20. SR 68 was reused for part of its current route by March 1932. State Route 69 State Route 69 (SR 69) was a very short state highway located entirely in Towns County in the extreme northern part of the state. The highway traveled from US 76/SR 2 north to the North Carolina state line, where it became North Carolina Highway 69 (NC 69). SR 69 followed the roadway currently designated as the concurrency of SR 17/SR 515\\\\. It was formed in 1930, and was redesignated as part of SR 17 between 1957 and 1960. Between 1919 and 1921, the roadway that would eventually become SR 69 was established as an unnumbered road from SR 2 in Hiawassee to the North Carolina state line north of Hiawassee. By the end of 1930, this road was designated as SR 69, with a completed semi hard surface. A few years later, the highway's location was shifted a few miles to the west. Its southern terminus was still at SR 2, but began northwest of Hiawassee, as it currently travels. By the end of 1935, the highway had a completed hard surface. Twenty years later, SR 17 north of US 76/SR 2 was shifted to the west to travel concurrently with SR 69. Between 1957 and 1960, SR 69 was decommissioned, while SR 17 stayed on this segment of highway. State Route 70 (1932‚Äì1941) State Route 70 (SR 70) was a state highway that existed in the east-central part of the state. When it was established between 1930 and 1932, it extended from Lincolnton to the South Carolina state line. At this time, the highway was under construction. In early 1934, SR 70 was extended south-southwest to US 78/SR 10/SR 17 north- northwest of Thomson. By the end of 1937, the segment of SR 70 from Lincolnton to the South Carolina state line had a \\"sand clay or top soil\\" surface. In 1938, a small portion of the highway southwest of Lincolnton had a \\"completed hard surface\\". Late in 1941, all of SR 70 was redesignated as SR 43 to match South Carolina. SR 70 was not reused until 1968, when a county road and part of SR 74 was renumbered to SR 70. State Route 72 (1930‚Äì1941) State Route 72 (SR 72) was a state highway in the west-central and central parts of the state. It was established in 1930 on a path from US 19/SR 3 north-northwest of Thomaston to SR 18 in Barnesville. Later that year, the western terminus was shifted southward into Thomaston. At the end of 1933, SR 72 was extended northeast to Jackson. A few months later, it was extended again, this time north-northeast to Covington. Three years later, the entire length of the Thomaston‚ÄìBarnesville segment had a \\"completed hard surface\\". Later that year, SR 72 was extended southwest to SR 41 in Woodland. The next year, the eastern terminus was under construction. By the middle of 1939, the then-western terminus had a completed hard surface. At this time, the then-eastern terminus had a \\"sand clay or top soil\\" surface. Near the end of 1940, SR 72 was extended north-northwest along SR 41 to Manchester and then west-northwest to SR 85 in Warm Springs. It was possibly also extended west-southwest to US 27/SR 1 in Pine Mountain, but GDOT maps didn't show a highway number for this segment of highway. The entire extension had a completed hard surface. Meanwhile, the eastern terminus was under construction. By the end of the year, the eastern terminus had a completed hard surface. A few months later, the entire Newton County portion that didn't have a hard surface was under construction. By the end of 1941, the entire highway was redesignated as SR 36\\\\. The Newton County portion that didn't have a hard surface had completed grading, but was not surfaced. SR 72 was reused as a renumbering of most of old SR 36 and part of SR 82 to match South Carolina. The rest of SR 36 became an extension of SR 98\\\\. State Route 73W State Route 73W (SR 73W) was a state highway that existed in the southwestern part of Bulloch County. Between July 1957 and June 1960, it was established and paved between two intersections with US 25/US 301/SR 73\\\\. It traveled north-northwest to an intersection with SR 46 and then northeast to its northern terminus. In 1993, it was decommissioned. State Route 73E State Route 73E (SR 73E) was a state highway that existed in the southwestern part of Bulloch County. Between July 1957 and June 1960, it was established on US 25/US 301 as a redesignation of SR 73\\\\. It straddled the intersection with SR 46/SR 119. In 1993, it was reverted to be part of SR 73. State Route 85W State Route 85W (SR 85W) was a state highway that existed from south of Shiloh to Woodbury. The highway that would eventually become SR 85W was established in 1930 as part of SR 85 from south of Shiloh to SR 41 in Warm Springs. By the middle of 1933, the portion of the highway from south of Shiloh to Warm Springs had a \\"sand clay or top soil\\" surface. The next year, the segment of the highway just south- southwest of Warm Springs was shifted westward to a curve into the city. At the end of 1936, two segments were under construction: around Shiloh and just west-southwest of Warm Springs. By the middle of 1937, a portion from south of Shiloh to Warm Springs was under construction. Near the end of the year, part of the Waverly Hall‚ÄìWarm Springs segment had completed grading, but was not surfaced. By the end of 1939, the segment from south of Shiloh to Warm Springs had a completed hard surface. In 1940, SR 163 was built from Warm Springs to Woodbury. By the middle of 1941, SR 163's segment just northeast of Warm Springs was under construction. In 1942, a portion of SR 163 northeast of Warm Springs had completed grading, but was not surfaced. By the end of 1946, SR 85 was shifted eastward to a more direct path between Columbus and Manchester. Its old path between south of Shiloh and Warm Springs was redesignated as a southerly extension of SR 163. By the middle of 1950, US 27 Alt. was designated on SR 163 from south of Shiloh to Warm Springs. By 1952, SR 163 was redesignated as SR 85W. That year, SR 85W's segment south of Warm Springs was reverted to being designated as SR 163. The next year, this was undone. Also, the segment of SR 85W from Warm Springs to Woodbury had completed grading, but was not surfaced. Between 1960 and 1963, US 27 Alt. was shifted eastward onto SR 85E from south of Shiloh to Manchester. About thirty-three years later, SR 85W was redesignated SR 85 Alt. State Route 85E State Route 85E (SR 85E) was a state highway between south of Shiloh and Woodbury. In 1935, SR 85 was extended southeast on SR 41 to Manchester and then north-northeast through Woodbury. At the end of 1936, part of SR 85 around Shiloh was under construction. In 1940, SR 85, from Manchester to approximately halfway between it and Woodbury, was under construction. At the end of 1941, a portion of SR 85 just east-northeast of Manchester had a completed hard surface. At this time, a portion of the highway from south of Woodbury had completed grading, but was not surfaced. In 1943, a portion northeast of Manchester had a completed hard surface. The next year, a portion south of Woodbury had a sand clay or top soil surface. By the end of 1946, SR 85 was shifted eastward to a more direct path between Columbus and Manchester. Its old path between south of Shiloh and Warm Springs was redesignated as a southerly extension of SR 163\\\\. The entire length of SR 85 from south of Shiloh to Chalybeate Springs had a completed hard surface. A small portion north-northeast of Chalybeate Springs had a sand clay or top soil surface; the portion from there to Woodbury had a completed hard surface. Between 1946 and 1948, the Chalybeate Springs‚ÄìWoodbury segment had a completed hard surface. Between 1955 and 1957, SR 85 from south of Shiloh to Woodbury was redesignated as SR 85E. Between 1960 and 1963, US 27 Alt. was shifted eastward onto SR 85E from south of Shiloh to Manchester. About thirty-two years later, SR 85E was redesignated as part of the SR 85 mainline again. State Route 86 (1930‚Äì1940) State Route 86 (SR 86) was a short-lived state highway in the North Georgia mountains region of the north-central part of the state. In 1930, SR 86 was established from Blue Ridge northeast to the North Carolina state line west-northwest of Ivy Log. In January 1932, the entire length of SR 86 was under construction. The next month, the western terminus of SR 86 was shifted eastward to begin northwest of Morganton. By mid-1933, the portion of SR 86 from northwest of Morganton to Mineral Bluff had a \\"sand clay or top soil\\" surface. Later that year, the entire length of SR 86 had a completed semi hard surface. In 1936, the entire length of SR 86 was under construction. At the beginning of 1937, SR 86 was extended southeast to US 19/SR 9 in Porter Springs. A few months later, SR 86's original segment had completed grading, but was not surfaced. In late 1940, all of SR 86 was renumbered SR 60. About 37 years later, the original segment of SR 86, from Mineral Bluff to the state line was used for the path of SR 60 Spur, because SR 60 was rerouted over SR 245, which was cancelled. SR 86 was reused that same day as a renumbering of the duplicate SR 160\\\\. State Route 91W State Route 91W (SR 91W) was a state highway in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Georgia. It functioned like an alternate route of SR 91\\\\. Between the beginning of 1945 and November 1946, it was established from SR 91 south-southwest of Albany to SR 3W just west of the city. By February 1948, the entire length of the highway was hard surfaced. In 1973, SR 234 was extended to the east, absorbing all of SR 91W. State Route 105 (1932‚Äì1937) State Route 105 (SR 105) was a state highway that existed entirely within Rabun County in the northeastern part of the state. The road that would eventually become SR 105 was established at least as early as 1919 between the North Carolina and South Carolina state lines. By 1921, the highway was signed as SR 65. This SR 65 was cancelled in 1926. SR 105 was designated in late 1932. By the end of 1934, the entire length of SR 105 was under construction. By the middle of 1937, SR 105 had completed grading, but was not surfaced. Before 1938, all of SR 105 was redesignated as the northern segment of SR 28. SR 105 was reused on an unrelated route in 1938 (no longer part of its current route). State Route 131 State Route 131 (SR 131) was a state highway that was located in Glynn and McIntosh counties in the coastal part of the state. The highway that would eventually become SR 131 was established between 1919 and 1921 as SR 60 from SR 27 north-northwest of Brunswick to SR 25 south-southwest of Darien. By the end of 1926, it was decommissioned. SR 131 was established in 1936 on what is currently SR 99 on an eastern curve between intersections with US 17/SR 25 in Darien and Eulonia. Later that year, the portion from Darien to approximately Meridian was under construction. In 1938, this segment had a \\"completed hard surface\\". From approximately Meridian to approximately Valona, the highway had completed grading, but was not surfaced. In late 1939, SR 131 was established on a segment from US 84/SR 50 west-northwest of Brunswick to SR 32 northwest of Brunswick and on a segment from US 25/US 341/SR 27 southwest of Darien to US 17/SR 25 south-southwest of Darien. However, there is no indication if these were separate segments of the highway or extensions. The segment from approximately Valona to Eulonia was under construction. A few months later, the northern terminus of the southern segment was shifted eastward to a southwest‚Äìnortheast routing. Also, the western terminus of the central segment was shifted south-southwest to connect with SR 32 at US 25/US 341/SR 27 north- northwest of Brunswick. By the end of 1941, the southern segment was under construction. The central segment was indicated to be \\"on system‚Äìnot marked or maintained\\". The Valona‚ÄìEulonia segment of the northern segment had completed grading, but was not surfaced. In 1943, the entire length of all three segments of SR 131 were redesignated as an extension of SR 99\\\\. SR 131 was moved to an alignment from South Newport to east-northeast of it. The entire length of this new segment had a completed hard surface. By the end of 1946, the highway was extended east-southeast to the Harris Neck National Wildlife Refuge. This extension had a completed hard surface. By the end of the decade, SR 131 was extended west-southwest to Jones. In 1953, the entire length of this extension had completed grading, but was not surfaced. About a decade later, this segment was hard surfaced. In 1977, it was decommissioned. Twelve years later, the eastern part was decommissioned, as well. State Route 134 State Route 134 (SR 134) was a state highway that was located in Telfair and Wheeler counties. It was established in early 1937 from US 341/SR 27 southwest of Towns to SR 15 in Jordan. This segment of highway remained virtually unchanged for over a decade, when it was given a \\"sand clay, top soil, or stabilized earth\\" surface. By early 1949, SR 134 was established on a segment from SR 149 south-southeast of McRae to US 341/SR 27 northwest of Lumber City. However, there is no indication if the two segments were separate or were connected via a concurrency with US 341/SR 27 between them. By the middle of 1950, US 23 was designated on US 341/SR 27 between the two segments. In 1953, the original segment of SR 134 had completed grading, but was not surfaced. The next year, this segment was hard surfaced. Between 1957 and 1960, SR 15 at this segment's eastern end was shifted farther to the east. Its former path was redesignated as part of SR 19. Between 1960 and 1963, the newer segment of SR 134 was paved. It wasn't until 1988 that the entire length of the highway was decommissioned. State Route 143 State Route 143 (SR 143) was a state highway in the northwestern and north-central parts of the state. The roadway that would eventually become SR 143 was established at least as early as 1919 as part of SR 1 from LaFayette to Trenton. By the end of 1921, SR 1 west of LaFayette was shifted to the east and off its former alignment. SR 53 was indicated to be a \\"contingent road\\" from LaFayette to Calhoun, with a concurrency with SR 1 in LaFayette. By the end of 1926, a portion of SR 53 northwest of Calhoun had a \\"completed semi hard surface\\". The decade ended with SR 53's path west of Calhoun being shifted farther to the south. The segment of SR 53 that had existed from LaFayette to Villanow was redesignated as part of SR 2. In 1930, the portion of SR 2 from approximately Naomi to Villanow had a completed semi hard surface. In February 1932, this segment's eastern end was shifted slightly to the north. In 1934, SR 2 was extended to an undetermined point northwest of LaFayette. A few years later, SR 143 was established on SR 53's former path from Vilanow to Calhoun. Later that year, SR 2 was extended farther to the northwest. Its southeast part (northwest of LaFayette) was under construction, while its northwest part had completed grading, but was not surfaced. By the middle of 1939, SR 2 was extended northwest to its intersection with SR 157\\\\. The western two-thirds of its length in this area had completed grading, but was not surfaced. Near the end of the year, SR 2 was extended north-northwest to an intersection with US 11/SR 58 in Trenton. The eastern part of this extension was under construction. In early 1940, this last extension of SR 2 had completed grading, but was not surfaced. Around the middle of the year, the portions of SR 2 both north-northwest and east-southeast of the SR 157 intersection had a \\"completed hard surface\\". The next year, nearly the entire portion of SR 2 from just south-southeast of Trenton to just southeast of Cooper Heights had a completed hard surface. Later that year, SR 143 was designated on an eastern alignment from SR 53 east of Fairmount to SR 5 and SR 53 in Tate. By the end of 1946, SR 2 was extended to the Alabama state line. Also, its segment from LaFayette to Villanow was hard surfaced. By early 1948, all of SR 2 west- southwest of Trenton, the entire western segment of SR 143, and the eastern half of the eastern segment of SR 143, had a \\"sand clay, top soil, or stabilized earth\\" surface. The western half of its eastern segment was indicated to be \\"projected mileage\\". By the middle of 1949, SR 2 was shifted much farther to the north. Its former alignment from the Alabama state line to Villanow was redesignated as a western extension of the western segment of SR 143\\\\. A portion northwest of LaFayette was hard surfaced. By the middle of 1950, a portion just east-southeast of Trenton was hard surfaced. In 1953, the portion west-southwest of Trenton and the portion from Sugar Valley to Calhoun were hard surfaced. The eastern segment's portion east of the SR 156 intersection had completed grading, but was not surfaced. The next year, this last segment was hard surfaced. By mid-1955, the Gordon County segment of the western segment (from Villanow to Sugar Valley) and the portion of the eastern segment (west of the SR 156 intersection) had completed grading, but was not surfaced. By the end of 1960, the entire western segment was hard surfaced. Nearly the entire part of the eastern segment west of the SR 156 intersection was decommissioned. By the end of 1963, the decommissioned part of the eastern segment was re-instated. In 1970, a portion of the eastern segment southeast of the SR 53 intersection was hard surfaced. In 1973, the portion of the eastern segment was decommissioned was indicated to be \\"under construction or projected mileage\\". In 1977, all of the western segment from the Alabama state line to northwest of Sugar Valley was redesignated as part of SR 136\\\\. All of the western segment from northwest of Sugar Valley to Calhoun was redesignated as SR 136 Conn. The eastern segment from its western terminus to northeast of Sharp Top was redesignated as SR 379; northeast of this point to west of Tate was redesignated as part of SR 108; and from there to Tate was redesignated as SR 108 Conn. =State Route 143 Connector= State Route 143 Connector (SR 143 Conn.) was a connecting route in the northwestern part of the state. The roadway that would eventually become SR 143 Conn. was established between 1963 and 1966 as an unnumbered road from SR 143 northwest of Sugar Valley to Resaca. In 1972 it was designated as SR 143 Conn., ending at US 41/SR 3. In 1977, all of SR 143 west of a point northwest of Sugar Valley and all of SR 143 Conn. were redesignated as parts of SR 136. State Route 148 (1939‚Äì1949) State Route 148 (SR 148) was a state highway in the northwestern part of the state. The highway that would eventually become SR 148 was established between 1919 and the end of 1921 as an unnumbered road from SR 1 in Fort Oglethorpe to SR 3 in Ringgold. By the end of 1926, US 41 was designated on SR 3\\\\. The entire length of the highway had a \\"completed semi hard surface\\". In 1930, US 41W was designated on SR 1. By the end of 1934, US 41W was decommissioned. It was redesignated as part of US 27. By the middle of 1939, the unnumbered road was designated as SR 148. 1940 ended with the entire length of SR 148 having a \\"completed hard surface\\". By the end of 1949, SR 2 was shifted to the north, replacing the entire length of SR 148. State Route 148 (1955‚Äì1966) State Route 148 (SR 148) was a state highway in the central part of the state. SR 148 was designated between the middle of 1954 and the middle of 1955 from SR 18 east-southeast of Forsyth to SR 87 eas of Bolingbroke. Its entire length had a \\"completed hard surface\\". Between 1957 and 1960, Interstate 75 (I-75) and SR 401 were built on a northeastern bypass of Forsyth. The southern terminus of this bypass connected with the western terminus of SR 148. Between 1960 and 1963, I-75 (and possibly SR 401) was extended southeast to just northeast of Bolingbroke, replacing SR 148 northwest of this point. Between 1963 and the end of 1966, I-75 was extended southeast through the Macon area, replacing SR 148 from northeast of Bolingbroke to east of this community (between the I-475 interchange northwest of Bolingbroke and SR 19 Spur east of the community, I-75 was under construction). The remainder of SR 148 was redesignated as part of SR 19 Spur. State Route 154 (1940‚Äì1946) State Route 154 (SR 154) was a state highway in the north-central part of the state. It was established in late 1939 from an intersection with SR 156 in Blaine to SR 5 in Talking Rock. The next year, it was under construction. Before the year ended, it was established on an eastern alignment from SR 108 northeast of Jasper to SR 183 northwest of Dawsonville. Around the middle of 1941, this new segment was under construction. In 1942, the original segment had completed grading, but was not surfaced. By the end of 1946, both segments of SR 154 were redesignated as parts of SR 136. SR 154 was reused for a former section of SR 41 that same day. State Route 158 (1940‚Äì1941) State Route 158 (SR 158) was a state highway in the northwestern part of the state. In 1940, SR 158 was established from US 41/SR 3 in Tunnel Hill to SR 71 in Varnell. At the end of the next year, it was renumbered SR 201, because there was already another SR 158 elsewhere in the state. State Route 160 (1939‚Äì1995) State Route 160 (SR 160) was a state highway in northern Clayton and southwestern DeKalb counties. SR 160 was established from SR 54 in Forest Park to SR 42 south-southeast of Constitution. By the end of 1949, it was extended south-southeast on SR 54 and then west-northwest to US 19/US 41/SR 3. In 1995, the western segment was decommissioned completely, while the eastern segment was redesignated as SR 54 Conn. State Route 160 (1940‚Äì1941) State Route 160 (SR 160) was a state highway in the central part of the state. In 1940, SR 160 was established from SR 78 south of Adrian to SR 46 west of Oak Park. Later that year, SR 160's segment from south of Adrian to SR 56 northeast of Soperton had a \\"completed hard surface\\". The eastern part of the highway was under construction. By the end of 1941, all of SR 160 was renumbered SR 86, with the portion from northeast of Soperton to west of Oak Park having a completed hard surface, as there was already another SR 160 elsewhere in the state. State Route 161 State Route 161 (SR 161) was a state highway in central Polk County and southwestern Floyd counties. Its southern terminus was in Cedartown. It proceeded northwest to Cave Spring to an intersection with US 411/SR 53\\\\. It was established with a \\"completed hard surface\\" in 1939. Between 1960 and 1963, it was redesignated as part of an extended SR 100. State Route 163 State Route 163 (SR 163) was a state highway in the west-central part of the state. The highway that would eventually become SR 163 was established as SR 85 from south of Shiloh to SR 41 in Warm Springs. By the middle of 1933, the entire highway had a \\"sand clay or top soil\\" surface. The next year, the segment of the highway just south-southwest of Warm Springs was shifted westward to a curve into the city. At the end of 1936, two segments were under construction: around Shiloh and just west-southwest of Warm Springs. By the middle of the year, a portion from south of Shiloh to Warm Springs was under construction. Near the end of the year, the segment form south of Shiloh to Warm Springs had completed grading, but was not surfaced. 1939 ended with the segment from south of Shiloh to Warm Springs having a completed hard surface. In 1940, SR 163 was built from Warm Springs to Woodbury. By the middle of 1941, SR 163's segment just northeast of Warm Springs was under construction. In 1942, a portion of SR 163 northeast of Warm Springs had completed grading, but was not surfaced. By the end of 1946, SR 85 was shifted eastward to a more direct path between Columbus and Manchester. Its old path between south of Shiloh and Warm Springs was redesignated as a southerly extension of SR 163. By the middle of 1950, US 27 Alt. was designated on SR 163 from south of Shiloh to Warm Springs. By 1952, SR 163 was redesignated as SR 85W. State Route 167 State Route 167 (SR 167) was a state highway that existed on a southeast-to-northwest path from the Savannah metropolitan area to Millen. In early 1940, the highway was established on a path from US 17/SR 25 southwest of Savannah and then north-northwest to US 280/SR 26 west-northwest of the city. In 1942, US 280 was truncated to the west-northwest; its path through this area was redesignated as an east-southeast extension of US 80\\\\. SR 167 was extended west-northwest on US 80/SR 26 to just west-northwest of the Chatham‚ÄìEffingham county line and then on a solo path to the north-northwest to the Effingham‚ÄìScreven county line. The original segment was indicated to be \\"on system‚Äìnot marked or maintained\\". The entire concurrency with US 80/SR 26 and its solo trek from there to Guyton had a \\"completed hard surface\\". The next year, SR 167 was extended northwest to Millen. In 1944, a small portion of the highway north-northwest of Guyton had a completed hard surface. By the end of 1948, the original segment was indicated to have \\"projected mileage\\". A small portion between Guyton and Egypt had a \\"sand clay, top soil, or stabilized earth\\" surface. Another small portion northwest of that one had completed grading, but was not surfaced. By 1952, the segment northwest of US 80/SR 26 was redesignated as a southeast extension of SR 17, with a portion southeast of Millen having completed grading, but not being surfaced. By the middle of 1955, the original segment of SR 167 was decommissioned. State Route 170 State Route 170 (SR 170) was a state highway that was located in the northwestern part of the state, in Dade and Walker counties. At the end of 1940, it was established on a path from SR 157 south-southeast of Trenton east-south to a point just west of SR 193 southeast of the city. About a year later, the entire length was under construction. In 1945, the eastern terminus was shifted north-northwest to end at an intersection with SR 193 east- northeast of Trenton. By the end of 1948, the eastern terminus of the highway was truncated to end at a point east of Trenton. By the end of 1951, the eastern terminus was extended north-northeast and then northwest to end at another intersection with SR 157 west of Chattanooga Valley. This made the \\"eastern\\" terminus now the \\"northern\\" one. Most of this extension had a \\"sand clay, topsoil, or stabilized earth\\" surface. The northern part of it had completed grading, but was not surfaced. The portion east of the southern terminus was hard surfaced. In 1953, the entire extension had completed grading, but was not surfaced. By mid-1955, it had a sand clay, topsoil, or stabilized earth surface. By the middle of 1957, this extension had a \\"topsoil or gravel, unpaved\\" surface. Between 1960 and the end of 1963, the northern part of the extension was paved. At the end of the decade, the entire length of SR 170 was hard surfaced. In 1974, SR 157 was shifted eastward, replacing all of the north‚Äìsouth portion of SR 170, with the old alignment being redesignated as SR 189\\\\. The east‚Äìwest portion of SR 170 was simply decommissioned. State Route 175 State Route 175 (SR 175) was a state highway that existed in the south-central part of the state, in Lowndes and Lanier counties. In 1940, it was established from SR 122 and SR 125 in Barretts to US 84/SR 38 in Naylor. By the end of 1948, a portion of the highway from east-southeast of Barretts (at the Lowndes‚ÄìLanier county line) to west-northwest of the SR 31 intersection northwest of Naylor had completed grading, but was not surfaced. From this point to the second crossing of the county line it had a \\"sand clay, top soil, or stabilized earth\\" surface. About five years later, the western terminus was truncated to a point west-northwest of the SR 31 intersection. By the middle of 1955, it was further truncated to the intersection with US 221/SR 31. By the end of 1963, the entire remaining segment of highway had a \\"topsoil or gravel, unpaved\\" surface. In 1969, SR 175 was decommissioned. State Route 176 State Route 176 (SR 176) was a state highway in the northwestern part of the state. In late 1940, it was established from SR 120 in Lost Mountain to SR 92 in New Hope.

The next year, the southern part of the extension had a \\"completed hard surface\\". By the end of 1948, the entire length of the extension was hard surfaced. A portion of the original segment just west of Lost Mountain had a \\"sand clay, top soil, or stabilized earth\\" surface. By the middle of 1950, this portion was hard surfaced. In 1953, a portion west of Lost Mountain had completed grading, but was not surfaced. Two years later, the New Hope‚ÄìLost Mountain segment had a sand clay, topsoil, or stabilized earth surface. By the middle of 1957, this segment was indicated to have a \\"topsoil or gravel, unpaved\\" surface. Before the decade ended, the New Hope‚ÄìLost Mountain segment was paved. Also, an unnumbered road was built from Lost Mountain to US 41/SR 3 in Acworth. In 1969, the New Hope-to-Lost Mountain segment was shifted to the northeast onto this unnumbered road. Its former alignment was redesignated as SR 92 Conn. In 2010, SR 176 was decommissioned. This table shows the last alignment of the highway. State Route 179 State Route 179 (SR 179) was a state highway that existed in the southwestern part of the state. It traversed Grady and Baker counties. At the end of 1940, SR 179 was established from SR 111 in Calvary to US 84/SR 38 in Whigham.

Between July 1957 and June 1960, it was established from SR 211 north-northwest of Statham to US 129/SR 24 about halfway between Arcade and Jefferson. The entire highway was paved at this time. The highway was virtually unchanged for the next 30 years. In 1990, it was decommissioned. State Route 321 State Route 321 (SR 321) was a short-lived state highway that existed in the eastern part of the state. It traversed the northwestern part of Bryan County and the southeastern part of Bulloch County. Between July 1957 and June 1960, it was established from US 280/SR 30/SR 63 in Pembroke north-northeast to SR 119 west-northwest of Blitchton. The entire Bryan County portion was paved, while the entire Bulloch County portion had a \\"topsoil or gravel, unpaved\\" surface. By the middle of 1963, the Bulloch County portion was paved. SR 321 was designated on a separate segment from US 80/SR 26 south- southeast of Stilson, then northeast and north-northwest to SR 119 southwest of Guyton. From the southern terminus of this segment to the turn to the north-northwest had a topsoil or gravel, unpaved surface; while the rest of it was paved. There was no indication if the two segments were connected via concurrencies with SR 119 and US 80/SR 26 or if they were two separate segments. By the end of 1966, SR 119's segment at the northern terminus of the original segment was redesignated as part of SR 46\\\\. SR 321's southern segment was extended on a direct connection with the newer segment. The central portion of the newer segment was hard surfaced. In 1967, SR 119 was re-routed southward, replacing all of SR 321\\\\. The former path of SR 119 through Stilson was redesignated as SR 119 Conn. State Route 322 State Route 322 (SR 322) was a state highway in the central part of the state. Between 1957 and the end of 1960, it was established from US 1/SR 4/SR 46 in Oak Park then south- southeast to SR 292 east of Lyons. In the middle of the 1960s, its entire length was redesignated as an eastern extension of SR 86. State Route 333 (1963‚Äì1982) State Route 333 (SR 333) was a north‚Äìsouth state highway that existed in two separate segments in the state. The highway traversed portions of Thomas, Mitchell, Dougherty, Lamar, Pike, Spalding, Henry, and Clayton counties. Between June 1960 and June 1963, the highway was established on US 19 from the Florida state line to Camilla. This truncated SR 35, which was concurrent with US 19 from the Florida state line to Thomasville. The segment of US 19 between Thomasville and Meigs, with which SR 3 was concurrent was redesignated as US 19 Bus. SR 333 was established on a sole routing from Camilla to the eastern part of Albany, while US 19/SR 3 traveled on a slightly more western path. SR 333 was also established on US 19/US 41 from SR 16 in Griffin to an indeterminate location between Jonesboro and Hapeville. From Griffin to Lovejoy and in Jonesboro, SR 3 traveled on a more eastern path. Between Lovejoy and Jonesboro and from north-northwest of Jonesboro, US 19/US 41/SR 3/SR 333 traveled concurrently. By 1966, US 19 between Camilla and Albany was shifted eastward to travel concurrently with SR 333\\\\. It was unclear if the northern terminus of SR 333 was truncated to Lovejoy or not. That year, SR 333 was indicated to be \\"projected mileage\\" from an unnumbered road in the southern part of Barnesville, then west-northwest and north- northwest through Aldora, then north-northeast past US 41/SR 7, then north- northwest through Milner, then northwest and north-northwest past US 19/SR 3 south of Griffin, then north-northwest through the western part of Griffin to connect with the US 19/US 41/SR 3/SR 333 intersection with SR 92 in the northern part of the city. The next year, US 341's path through the Barnesville‚ÄìAldora area was shifted southwestward to travel concurrently with SR 333 from just south of Barnesville to US 41/SR 7 Conn. just north of the city. SR 333 was indicated to be projected mileage and under construction from this intersection to the US 19/US 41/SR 3/SR 92/SR 333 intersection in Griffin. In 1968, the highway was indicated to be projected mileage from the US 19/US 82/SR 50S/SR 333 and US 19/SR 3W intersections in Albany. The under construction segment from just north of Barnesville to south of Griffin was completed. The next year, the portion of SR 333 from just north of Barnesville to Griffin was decommissioned. In 1970, all of SR 333 north of Griffin was also decommissioned. In 1974, a freeway was built in Albany, with SR 333 designated on it. Three years later, US 19 through the main part of Albany was shifted northeast to travel concurrently with the SR 333 freeway. By March 1980, US 82 in Albany was also shifted onto the freeway. Later that year, the northern terminus of SR 333 was truncated to the US 19/US 19 Bus./US 82/US 82 Bus./SR 50/SR 50 Bus./SR 62/SR 333 interchange in Albany, with SR 50 shifted onto the freeway. In 1982, all of SR 333 that remained was redesignated as SR 300. SR 333 was reused in 1993 for part of the old alignment of SR 33, which was rerouted over part of SR 133. SR 133 took over part of the old alignment of SR 33 and took over a portion of SR 94. =State Route 333 Spur= State Route 333 Spur (SR 333 Spur) was a proposed spur route of SR 333 that was planned to be put inside the city limits of Albany.

State Route 344 State Route 344 (SR 344) was a state highway that existed in the northwestern part of the state. It traversed portions of Floyd and Bartow counties. The highway that would eventually become SR 344 was established at least as early as 1919 as part of SR 4 from Rome to Cartersville. By the end of 1926, a portion of the highway from just east of Rome to a point northwest of Cartersville was under construction. In the northwestern part of Cartersville and farther to the west, a portion of the highway had a \\"completed semi hard surface\\". Within three years, the segment of SR 4 was redesignated as part of SR 20, with US 41W designated on it. The portion of the highway just east of Rome had a \\"completed hard surface\\". The highway was under construction northwest of Cartersville. By the middle of 1930, the entire Rome‚ÄìCartersville segment had a completed hard surface. Before the end of 1934, US 41W between Rome and Cartersville was redesignated as part of US 411. In 1953, a small portion of SR 20 in the northern part of Cartersville was hard surfaced. A few years later, all portions of SR 20 that had been built were paved. Between 1960 and 1963, US 411 between Rome and Cartersville was shifted on a more southerly routing, concurrent with SR 344, which was commissioned at this time; SR 20 remained on the old alignment. In 1977, SR 344 was decommissioned, and SR 20 was shifted onto US 411 between Rome and Cartersville. SR 20's old alignment was redesignated as part of SR 293.

Between 1984 and 1991, US 76/SR 5/SR 515 was shifted onto the path of SR 734, replacing it. State Route 736 State Route 736 (SR 736) was a short proposed state highway that was planned in Augusta. In 1982, it was proposed to connect the eastern terminus of the John C. Calhoun Expressway (which would later carry SR 28), at 15th Street, with the western terminus of Greene Street, at SR 4 (13th Street). In 1985, SR 28 was shifted southwest, off of Broad Street northwest of 5th Street, and onto John C. Calhoun Expressway, the proposed path of SR 736, and Greene Street. State Route 741 State Route 741 (SR 741) was a proposed state highway that was planned in Crawfordville. In 1983, it was proposed as a western bypass of Crawfordville, from SR 22 southwest of the city to SR 22 northwest of it.

State Route 744 State Route 744 (SR 744) was a proposed state highway in the western part of Polk County. In 1987, it was proposed as an eastern bypass of Cedartown, from US 27/SR 1/SR 100 south-southwest of the city to US 27/SR 1 north-northeast of it. In 1991, the path of US 27/SR 1 through the area was shifted eastward, replacing the path of SR 744. =State Route 744 Spur= State Route 744 Spur (SR 744 Spur) was a proposed spur route of SR 744 that partially existed in the city limits of Cedartown. In 1987, it was proposed from US 27/SR 1/SR 100 in the city to the proposed path of SR 744 southeast of it.

State Route 746 State Route 746 (SR 746) was a state highway that existed in the east-central part of Floyd County, just to the east of Rome. In 1985, it was proposed from US 411/SR 20 southeast of Rome north-northeast and northwest to SR 53 at the eastern terminus of SR 53 Spur. In 1990, the portion of SR 746 between US 411/SR 20 and SR 293 was built. Two years later, all of the original completed and proposed portions of SR 746 from US 411/SR 20 to SR 53 and the entire length of SR 53 Spur were redesignated as parts of SR 1 Loop. At this time, a separate segment of SR 746 was proposed from SR 20 west- northwest of Rome south-southeast and southeast to US 27/US 411/SR 1/SR 53 just north-northeast of Six Mile, east-northeast to SR 101 south-southeast of Rome, and east-northeast and north-northeast to US 411/SR 20 at SR 1 Loop.

In 1618, a flood ruined the fort on Castle Island, but it was rebuilt in 1624 as Fort Orange.Howell and Tenney (1886, Vol. II), p. 775 Both forts were named in honor of the royal Dutch House of Orange-Nassau.Venema (2003), p. 13 Fort Orange and the surrounding area were incorporated as the village of Beverwijck () in 1652.Rittner (2002), p. 7Venema (2003), p. 12 New Netherland was captured by the English in 1664 and the name Beverwijck was changed to Albany, in honor of the Duke of Albany (later James II of England and James VII of Scotland).Brodhead (1874), p. 744 Duke of Albany was a Scottish title given since 1398, generally to a younger son of the King of Scots. The name is ultimately derived from Alba, the Gaelic name for Scotland. Pre-history and geography Prior to European settlement Albany was a forested location along the Hudson River with five kills (kill being early Dutch for creek, a name still used by Albanians today). These kills carved out steep ravines that separated the hills of Albany from each other. Further inland was the Pine Bush, an inland pine barrens that stretched from Albany to Schenectady. As settlement grew the Pine Bush was gradually cut down further and further inland. The kills, such as the Rutten, Vosen (Foxes), and Beaver kills, were diverted into pipes and covered over. Patroon Creek and the Normans Kill are the two that remain. Some of the ravines were filled in over time. Sheridan Hollow, carved by the now covered Foxen Kill, and Tivoli Hollow, carved by Patroon Creek, are two ravines that are still extant. The Empire State Plaza would in the 1970s fill the hollow created by the already-covered Rutten Kill. Lincoln Park is located in the hollow formed by the now covered Beaver Kill. Washington Park Lake is the result of damming up the only remaining part of the Rutten Kill that is above ground. The native inhabitants of Albany at the time of the arrival of the Dutch called the Normans Kill the Tawawsantha. The area of Albany had been given different names by the various native tribes of the area. The Mohegans called it Pem-po-tu-wuth-ut, which means \\"place of the council fire\\", and the Iroquois called it Sche-negh-ta-da, meaning \\"through the pine woods\\". The five kills were initially called First Kill, Second Kill, and so on. Normans Kill received its name from Albert Bradt, a Norwegian (Dutch: Noorman) and one of the earliest settlers, and the Rutten Kill was named for Rutgers Bleecker, an early land owner along its banks. Initial European settlement Map of Castle Island and Fort Orange in 1629 Albany is the oldest surviving European settlement from the original thirteen colonies. In 1540 French traders became the first Europeans to visit the area of the present-day city and built a primitive fort on Castle Island. This fort was built on a flood plain and was soon abandoned as a result of damage due to the annual freshet (flooding associated with spring thaw). Permanent European claims began when Englishman Henry Hudson, exploring for the Dutch East India Company on his ship the Halve Maen (\\"Half Moon\\"), reached the area in 1609. In 1614, the Dutch explorer Hendrick Christiaensen rebuilt the earlier French fort (referred to as a French chateau at the time) as Fort Nassau, the first Dutch fur trading post in the area. Upon Christiaensen's death Jacob Eelkens took charge of the fort. Commencement of the fur trade provoked hostility from the French colony in Canada and amongst the native tribes, who vied for control. The fort was again abandoned due to the freshet and a replacement was built in 1624 as Fort Orange, slightly to the north. Both forts were named in honor of the Dutch House of Orange-Nassau. Historical Marker - Broadway at foot of State Street In 1626 the Mohawk nation to the west of Albany and the Mohegan nation from the east bank of the Hudson River renewed their ongoing tribal conflict. The fledgling Fort Orange sided with the Mohegans and as a result lost six soldiers in an ambush in what is now Lincoln Park on Delaware Avenue. In 1628 the Mohawks defeated the Mohegans and pushed them to Connecticut. In 1642 a ferry was established to the east bank of the Hudson, at the native settlement of Tuscameatic. The Dutch would latter call this site Het Green Bosch (\\"the Green Woods\\"). This site is now the city of Rensselaer but the name lives on in the towns of North Greenbush and East Greenbush. The Director-General of New Amsterdam, Pieter Stuyvesant, came to Fort Orange in April 1652 and incorporated the areas surrounding the fort as Dorpe Beverwyck (the Village of Beverwyck). He established the first court at Albany around the same time. A court was needed to try a dispute between Stuyvesant and the patroonship of Rensselaerswyck over jurisdiction of the land surrounding the fort.

When New Netherland was captured by the English in 1664, the name Beverwijck was changed to Albany, in honor of the Duke of Albany (later James II of England and James VII of Scotland). Duke of Albany was a Scottish title given since 1398, generally to a younger son of the King of Scots. The name is ultimately derived from Alba, the Gaelic name for Scotland. The Dutch briefly regained Albany in August 1673 and renamed the city Willemstadt; the English took permanent possession with the Treaty of Westminster (1674). On November 1, 1683, the Province of New York was split into counties, with Albany County being the largest. At that time the county included all of present New York State north of Dutchess and Ulster Counties in addition to present-day Bennington County, Vermont, theoretically stretching west to the Pacific Ocean; the city of Albany became the county seat. Albany was formally chartered as a municipality by provincial Governor Thomas Dongan on July 22, 1686. The Dongan Charter was virtually identical in content to the charter awarded to the city of New York three months earlier. Dongan created Albany as a strip of land wide and long. Over the years Albany would lose much of the land to the west and annex land to the north and south. At this point, Albany had a population of about 500 people. In 1754, representatives of seven British North American colonies met in the Stadt Huys, Albany's city hall, for the Albany Congress; Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania presented the Albany Plan of Union there, which was the first formal proposal to unite the colonies. Although it was never adopted by Parliament, it was an important precursor to the United States Constitution. The same year, the French and Indian War, the fourth in a series of wars dating back to 1689, began; it ended in 1763 with French defeat, resolving a situation that had been a constant threat to Albany and held back its growth. In 1775, with the colonies in the midst of the Revolutionary War, the Stadt Huys became home to the Albany Committee of Correspondence (the political arm of the local revolutionary movement), which took over operation of Albany's government and eventually expanded its power to control all of Albany County. Tories and prisoners of war were often jailed in the Stadt Huys alongside common criminals. In 1776, Albany native Philip Livingston signed the Declaration of Independence at Independence Hall in Philadelphia. During and after the Revolutionary War, Albany County saw a great increase in real estate transactions. After Horatio Gates' win over John Burgoyne at Saratoga in 1777, the upper Hudson Valley was generally at peace as the war raged on elsewhere. Prosperity was soon seen all over Upstate New York. Migrants from Vermont and Connecticut began flowing in, noting the advantages of living on the Hudson and trading at Albany, while being only a few days' sail from New York City. Albany reported a population of 3,498 in the first national census in 1790, an increase of almost 700% since its chartering. In 1797, the state capital of New York was moved permanently to Albany. From statehood to this date, the Legislature had frequently moved the state capital between Albany, Kingston, Poughkeepsie, and the city of New York. Albany is the second oldest state capital in the United States. 1664‚Äì1744 In the period leading up to the Second Anglo-Dutch War, King Charles II of England granted the land from Maine to Delaware, which included all of New Netherland, to his brother James, Duke of York. In April 1664 four ships with a combined 450-men fighting force set sail for New Amsterdam. Fort Orange was surrendered to the English 16 days after New Amsterdam (the city of New York). Surrender terms at New Amsterdam were quite generous. Fort Orange was renamed Fort Albany, and the village of Beverswyck was renamed Albany, in honor of the Duke of York and Albany, who later became King James II of England and James VII of Scotland. Captain John Manning was given command of Fort Albany. The Dutch briefly regained Albany in 1673, during which time the town was referred to as Willemstadt, but the Dutch again lost control in November 1674. Fort Albany was renamed Fort Nassau during this time. It was called Fort Nassau instead of Fort Orange to avoid confusion with New York City's renaming as New Orange. After the English recapture of Willemstadt, all names were returned to their previous English names, but most Dutch political appointees from that period were retained. In 1676, Governor Edmund Andros of the Dominion of New England (of which the Province of New York was a part) had Fort Frederick built at the top of Yonkers Street, today the corner of State and Lodge streets, to replace Fort Albany, which was located by the Hudson River. Opening paragraph of the Dongan Charter creating the city of Albany, New York Albany was formally chartered as a municipality by Governor Thomas Dongan on July 22, 1686. At this time Albany had a population of only 500. The \\"Dongan Charter\\" was virtually identical in content to the charter awarded to the city of New York three months earlier. Pieter Schuyler was appointed first mayor of Albany the day the charter was signed. As part of the Dongan Charter the city's boundaries were fixed with Patroon Street (today Clinton Avenue) as the northern limit and the \\"northern tip of Martin Gerritsen's Island\\" as the southern limit, both lines extending to the northwest. Albany was given the right to purchase in \\"Schaahtecogue\\" (today Schaghticoke), and at \\"Tionnondoroge\\" (today Fort Hunter). In 1689 Albany became a center of resistance to Jacob Leisler who, during confusion over the Glorious Revolution, led Leisler's Rebellion and took de facto control over the colony. Leisler appointed a new mayor of Albany, but the replacement was not recognized by Schuyler or the other city fathers. Three sloops sailed from the city of New York to Albany under the command of Jacob Milborne. Milborne attempted to enter Fort Albany and arrest Mayor Schuyler but was forced to return to New York after a group of Mohawks threatened to intervene on Schuyler's behalf. On February 8, 1690 the nearby settlement of Corlear (today Schenectady) was attacked by the French and their native allies. Over 60 people were killed, with more taken prisoner. Simon Schermerhorn rode all night to Albany to warn of the French incursion. This incident (referred to as the Schenectady Massacre) is commemorated each year with a horse-ride by the mayor of Schenectady to Albany's city hall in addition to other local celebrations. Map of Albany in 1695 In 1694 Johannes Abeel succeeded Schuyler to become the second mayor of Albany. His term lasted only one year and in 1695 Evert Bancker was appointed Albany's third mayor. Due to increased pirate activity in the Hudson River, one of the City Fathers, Robert Livingston, partnered with New York Governor Bellomont to destroy the pirate's bases in the West Indies. Captain William Kidd was hired to lead the expedition. In 1696, after only a year in office, Mayor Evert Bancker was replaced with Dirck Wesselse Ten Broeck who was then replaced two years later with Hendrick Hansen. Hansen also served only one year and was replaced in 1699 by Pieter Van Brugh. Van Brugh and the succeeding three mayors (Jan Jansen Bleecker, Johannes Bleecker, Jr., Albert Janse Ryckman) each served only one year. Johannes Schuyler was appointed mayor in 1703 and was succeeded by David Schuyler in 1706. David Schuyler served only one year before he too was replaced. Evert Bancker, Albany's third mayor, was returned to office by the governor of New York in 1707 but then replaced in 1709 by Albany's second mayor, Johannes Abeel. Robert Livingston, Jr was appointed mayor in 1710 and became the first mayor since Pieter Schuyler to serve more than three years. A census taken in 1710 showed the population had more than doubled since Albany became a city in 1686. The city had a population of 1,136; 113 of these were slaves. Queen Anne gave the Anglican community in Albany the right to build a church. After many years of conflict in which the city council was dominated by those of the Dutch Reformed faith who attempted to stop construction the church, Saint Peter's was eventually built in 1717. It was the first Anglican church in New York west of the Hudson River. It is located at the corner of State Street and Lodge Street. Robert Livingston was replaced as mayor by Myndert Schuyler in 1719, but Schuyler was replaced with former mayor Pieter Van Brugh the next year. The first recorded instance of a person from Ireland living in Albany occurred in 1720; 100 years later the Irish would become one of the most important immigrant groups in Albany history. In 1722 Albany was home to negotiations between the Iroquois and the provinces of New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia resulting in the Treaty of Albany which limited the Iroquois to west of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Myndert Schuyler was returned to the office of mayor in 1723. In 1725 Schuyler was again replaced, this time with Johannes Cuyler, who was replaced a year later with Rutger Bleecker. In 1729 Bleecker was replaced with Johannes De Peyster, the only mayor to serve three non-consecutive terms. Johannes Hansen served for one year during 1731 after which De Peyster was returned to office by the governor. Also in 1731 Albany received from England its first primitive fire engine \\"to spout water\\" upon fires from a safer distance than using buckets carried up ladders. In 1733 De Peyster again was replaced, this time by Edward Holland. Holland, despite his last name, is the first mayor of Albany to be of any religion other than that of Dutch Reformed. He was of Anglican faith. John Schuyler, Jr. was appointed mayor in 1740. He was of Dutch Reformed faith and served for one year before being replaced by De Peyster. De Peyster served his third and final time from 1741‚Äì1742. Cornelis Cuyler was appointed mayor in 1742. 1744‚àíAmerican Revolution France and Britain declared war in 1744 and almost immediately forces were assembled in Albany for an invasion north to French Canada. French Canadian and natives attacked settlements north of Albany in 1745 and forced refugees to flee to Albany. In response, Colonel William Johnson assembled representatives from the Iroquois Confederacy in Albany in 1746 and successfully convinced them to declare war against the French. Also in 1746 Dirck Ten Broeck was appointed mayor by the governor. In 1748 peace came between France and Britain (and therefore between Canada and New York) through the signing of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle and Jacob Ten Eyck was appointed mayor. In 1750 Robert Sanders took the oath of office as mayor of Albany. In 1751 an auction was held to sell the rights to operate two ferries, one from Greenbush (today Rensselaer) to Albany, and another from Albany to Greenbush. Also in 1751, a conference was held in Albany consisting of representatives from the Iroquois Nation, New York Governor George Clinton, the Indian commissioners from South Carolina, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and the Catawba tribe. Since Massachusetts claimed a boundary extending \\"from sea to sea\\", which would include the city and much of the surrounding Albany County, disputes occurred between the sheriffs from Albany and the sheriffs from Springfield, Massachusetts. In 1751, after some Massachusetts officers were arrested and brought to Albany, the sheriff of Albany County was arrested and taken to Springfield. Join, or Die cartoon drawn by Benjamin Franklin to support the Albany Congress in 1754, supporting united action in defence against France. Fear of imminent war with France led the British Lords of Trade in 1753 to send letters to the colonies of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia, suggesting they meet in Albany to discuss their common defense. The next year all except Virginia and New Jersey attend, but Rhode Island and Connecticut attend in their stead. Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania presented what is now known as the Albany Plan of Union. The meeting, which took place at the corner of Broadway and Hudson Avenue, became known as the Albany Congress. Although it was never adopted by Parliament, it was an important precursor to the United States Constitution. One month later, fears of a war with France came true and new stockades are erected at Albany. Johannes Hansen is appointed mayor. Map of Albany in 1758. During the French and Indian War, Albany was the target of several French plans to cut the British colonies in half. Albany was also the point in which British and colonial troops were assembled, and where several invasions of French Canada, and specifically Montreal, were planned. By 1756, 10,000 soldiers were drilling in Albany in preparation of attacks on Canada or for defense of the route to Albany. Sybrant Van Schaick was appointed mayor in 1756 and a smallpox epidemic occurred. Refugees and soldiers continued to pour into the city as fighting along the routes to and from Canada escalated. Due to the large population of British soldiers, British tastes are introduced to Albany, and the first theatrical performance in the city occurred in the winter of 1757 by the British officers stationed there. General James Abercrombie's troops were stationed across the river from Albany in Greenbush, next to Fort Crailo. Dr. Shackburg of the British army composes \\"Yankee Doodle Dandy\\" as a mock of the various colonial militias that came to Albany. In 1758 General Lord George Augustus Howe was killed at the Battle of Ticonderoga and was subsequently buried in Albany, today under the front vestibule of Saint Peter's Church on State Street. He is the only British Lord buried in the United States. The Schuyler Mansion was built in 1761 by Colonel John Bradstreet for General Philip Schuyler, famous visitors in later years include George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and Aaron Burr. Schuyler Mansion in 1818, site of marriage between Alexander Hamiltion and Philip Schuyler's daughter Volkert Douw was appointed mayor in 1761. In 1763 a second fire engine was purchased. Prior to 1766 Albany had no permanent docks, so in that year the Common Council had three stone docks built. Each were long and between and wide. In 1770 Abraham Cuyler was appointed mayor, being the last mayor to be appointed under a British Royal Commission. Also in that year, a fourth dock was built along the river and the sloop Olive Branch became the first Albany ship to set sail for the West Indies. Additionally, the city sold its remaining land in Schaghticoke. The Gazette became the first newspaper in Albany, first published in 1771 by Alexander and James Robertson. American Revolution By 1774 events in other colonies regarding disputes with the British Parliament over taxation brought Albany into the wider issue of a colonial union for the first time since the Albany Congress. John Barclay became chairman of the newly formed Committee of Superintendence and Correspondence. The committee selected Colonel Philip Schuyler, Abraham Yates Jr, Colonel Abraham Ten Broeck, Colonel Peter Livingston, and Walter Livingston as delegates from Albany (city and county) to the provincial congress in New York that would select the colony's delegates for the Philadelphia meeting of the Continental Congress. Of them, only Schuyler was selected to represent the colony at Philadelphia. In 1775 the Continental Congress sent a committee to Albany to make a treaty with the Iroquois ensuring either their cooperation or their neutrality. It ended with no decision, but ultimately was a failure. The last Dutch-born minister of the Dutch Reformed Protestant Church in Albany, Eilardus Westerlo, began preaching in English in 1782. Despite the war, the mayor and several others celebrated the King's birthday in 1776, but were disrupted by a mob. Later that month the sign from the King's Arms Tavern at the corner of Green and Beaver is carried to State Street and burned. Philip Livingston, born in Albany, signed the Declaration of Independence in July 1776 and on July 9 the New York Provincial Congress met at White Plains, officially changing the name from \\"Province of New York\\" to the \\"State of New York\\". On July 19, the Declaration of Independence was read out loud in front of City Hall to a mass gathering. Due to the war, this was the first year city elections were not held. City elections were not held in 1777 either. The British copied French plans from the French and Indian War and sent General Burgoyne to Quebec in order to march on Albany and meet up with forces coming east from Niagara Falls and north from New York City, thereby cutting the New England states off from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and the Southern states. The attacks from the west and south never actually got close to Albany, and Burgoyne's main thrust from the north was defeated at the Battle of Saratoga by General Gates. On October 17, 1777 Burgoyne surrendered his army to Gates, ending the immediate threat to Albany for the remainder of the war. Burgoyne was then sent to Albany where he lived at the Schuyler Mansion as a prisoner under house arrest. To help protect Albany from further encroachment by British forces based in Manhattan, West Point was built along the Hudson between New York and Albany in 1778. In 1778 the New York Legislature meeting in Poughkeepsie passed the \\"Act to remove all doubts concerning the corporation of the city of Albany\\", allowing the citizens to restructure the government. The legislature took over the job of appointing the mayor and subsequently appointed John Barclay. At that point, city elections resumed. Barclay was Episcopalian and the first non- Dutch Reformed mayor since Edward Holland in 1733. The next year General Abraham Ten Broeck was appointed to take over as mayor; he was of Dutch Reformed religion. On January 27, 1780 the State Legislature met at Albany for the first time, meeting in City Hall on the corner of Broadway and Hudson Avenue. The Legislature convenes again in Albany the next year. In December of that year Alexander Hamilton married General Philip Schuyler's daughter Elizabeth at the Schuyler Mansion, which was Elizabeth's father's house and at the time called \\"The Pastures\\". Hamilton and his wife soon moved into a cottage on her father's land, where he studied law in the library of his father-in-law's house. Aaron Burr also studied law in that library, often getting into a tug-of-war over books with Hamilton. In 1782 Burr also got married in Albany, at the Dutch Reformed Church the Schuylers attended. With Albany in relative calm after the Battle of Saratoga, not seriously threatened by native or British attacks, Albany could become more concentrated on commercial business, and in 1782 the first bank chartered in the city was created, the Bank of Albany. The American Revolutionary War came to an end in 1783 and Johannes Beekman was appointed mayor by the Governor. George Washington visited in this year and was presented with the \\"freedom of the city\\".

Characteristics The Italian colonial administration of Libya raised squadrons of locally recruited Spahi cavalry immediately following the occupation of Libya, during the Italo- Turkish War of (1911‚Äì1912). These differed from their French namesakes in that their prime role was that of mounted police, tasked with patrolling rural and desert areas, plus providing escorts and scouts. The name is the French form of the Ottoman word sipahi, a word originally derived from Middle Persian term Spah meaning \\"army\\", or \\"horsemen\\". Although they had Italian officers these spahis were more loosely organised than the regular Libyan cavalry regiments (Savari). Newly enlisted spahis brought their own horses with them, in return for a government grant. They usually wore a picturesque dress modelled on that of the desert tribesmen from whom they were recruited.Plates I & IV, \\"Under Italian Libya's Burning Sun\\", The National Geographic Magazine August 1925 History The Italian Spahis formed part of the Regio Corpo Truppe Coloniali of Libya (Royal Corps of Libyan Colonial Troops), which included desert and camel troops, infantry battalions, artillery and cavalry. The Truppe Coloniali saw extensive service during the Italian conquest of Tripolitania and mainly contributed to the full control of Cyrenaica & Fezzan, which was not completed until 1932. Subsequently, they patrolled the border areas of Italian Libya. In 1936 Spahis and other Libyan units took part in the Italian invasion of Ethiopia and received a \\"Gold Medal of Honor\\" for their distinguished performance in battle Medal of Military Honor =The Spahis of Amedeo Guillet= The Italian officer Amedeo Guillet commanded a \\"gruppo\\" of spahi irregular cavalry in Libya during 1934.

The Libyan colonial infantry and artillery suffered heavy losses during the Battle of the Marmarica (December 1940) and were formally disbanded in January 1943 following the Italian withdrawal into Tunisia. The role of the Libyan Spahis and other horse mounted troops was limited mainly to patrol and scouting work by the demands of modern mechanized warfare. Spahi detachments were in control of Ghat and Ghadames until the first weeks of 1943. Notes Bibliography * Antonicelli, Franco. Trent'anni di storia italiana 1915-1945\\\\. Mondadori.

History of discoveries  The first captured living monoplacophoran was Veleropilina zografi in 1896, but at that time it was described as if it were an archaeogastropod, a true limpet, mainly because of its patelliform (limpet-like) shell. This species was finally revealed to be monoplacophoran 87 years later, in 1983. In April 1952, a living specimen was collected from deep depths in the Middle America Trench off Costa Rica's Pacific coast.Enrico Schwabe, A summary of reports of abyssal and hadal Monoplacophora and Polyplacophora (Mollusca), Zootaxa 1866: 2005-222 (2008).

In 1989, fossils in Italy from the middle Pleistocene were described which appear to be identical with the living species Micropilina minuta.  Anatomy  Drawing of the shell of Pilina unguis. Head region is on the left. Ventral view of the (fossil) shell of Tryblidium reticulatum Lindstr√∂m, 1880. There are visible muscular attachment scars. Head region is on the upper part of the drawing. The shell length is up to 43 mm. Dorsal view of the shell of Tryblidium reticulatum. Little is known about monoplacophorans. They have a single, flat, rounded bilateral shell that is often thin and fragile; it ranges in size from 3 to 30 millimetres (in recent species). The apex of the shell is at the anterior end. The fossil shells exhibit a series of muscular attachment scars on the inner side, suggesting metamerism; indeed, with living Monoplacophora to study, it can be seen that their body segments exhibit a serial repetition of kidneys, gills and reproductive structure. This used to be interpreted as a true segmentation, which suggested a \\"missing link\\" between mollusks and annelids. More recent studies have shown that the repetition of these organs is secondary. Monoplacophorans move on a rounded foot. Their reduced head lacks eyes or tentacles. The mantle cavity forms a horseshoe-shaped groove running around the muscular foot, in a similar fashion to that of the chitons, and contains five or six gills on either side. The mouth opens on the underside between the ends of the groove, while the anus opens into the hindmost part. Like chitons, monoplacophorans possess a sensory subradular organ, as well as a rasping radula. A fold of ciliated tissue surrounds the mouth to the front and sides, while a smaller fold, bearing a number of tentacles, lies just behind it. The stomach contains a style, projecting from a diverticulum, or \\"style sac\\". The mouth has a chevron-shaped lip in front of it, and bears tentacles behind it, which have various shapes and layouts in different species. The heart is divided into two equal halves, each with its own auricle, ventricle and aorta. The left and right aorta fuse shortly after leaving the heart, and supply blood to the open circulatory system. There are six pairs of nephridial excretory organs, which empty into the mantle cavity. The nervous system has small ganglia around the oesophagus from which two pairs of main nerve cords run through the body; one pair supplying the foot, and the other the visceral organs. As in the chitons, these main nerve cords are connected by a series of lateral nerves, giving the layout of the nervous system an appearance somewhat like a ladder. There are two pairs of gonads, which release gametes into the water through one of the pairs of nephridia. The sexes are separate, and fertilisation is external.  Ecology  = Habitat = Monoplacophora are a geographically widespread component of the benthos. Most are known from deep water (1800 - 6500 meters), although several species are found in shallower waters ranging up to 200 meters. Leiden & Copenhagen. = Feeding habits = It is presumed that they graze on microscopic organisms in mud or bottom detritus.

From 2014-2017, Simotas served as Chair of the Assembly's Task Force on Women's Issues. =Policy positions= Upon passage of Assemblymember Simotas's Rape- is-Rape bill, survivor and advocate Lydia Cuomo was on hand in Albany to celebrate the legislation's protections for rape survivors across New York. June 11, 2013  Sexual violence  In 2012, Simotas introduced the \\"Rape is Rape\\" bill to expand the definition of rape in New York State law to include forced anal and oral sexual contact. The bill has passed in the Assembly every year since 2013. Simotas sponsored legislation in 2016 to combat the rape kit backlog by mandating timely processing and testing of rape kits. In 2017, she introduced legislation to establish a Sexual Assault Survivors' Bill of Rights and prevent premature destruction of evidence. The bill was signed into law in 2018. In 2019, the legislature passed Simotas' bill to extend New York's five-year statute of limitations for second and third degree rape to 20 years and 10 years respectively. Simotas authored a package of bills aimed at strengthening protections against sexual harassment in the workplace and pushed the legislature to hold the first public hearings on the subject in 27 years. In June 2019, the legislature passed Simotas' bill to eliminate the severe or pervasive standard for harassment claims, extend the time period for employees to file complaints, hold employers accountable for harassment committed by supervisors, and establish protections for workers who sign non-disclosure agreements. Simotas has sponsored a series of bills to combat sexual abuse in medical settings. The bills would require health care providers to undergo background checks as a condition of licensure, expand the information about patients' rights and reporting options available online, and require doctors who are disciplined for misconduct to notify their patients.  Health care  In 2015, legislation introduced by Simotas made New York the first state in the country to designate pregnancy as a qualifying event to enroll in health insurance through the state health exchange. In 2016, Simotas introduced the Fair Access to Fertility Treatment Act to require insurers to cover in vitro fertilization, as well as fertility preservation services for cancer patients. Provisions of Simotas' proposal were enacted as part of the 2019-2020 state budget. Simotas introduced legislation to establish a Newborn Health and Safe Sleep Pilot Program to combat infant mortality by distributing \\"baby boxes\\", essential care items and educational materials to new parents in high risk areas. The bill was signed into law in October 2017.  LGBTQ rights  Simotas voted in favor of marriage equality in New York, which she termed \\"my proudest moment as a legislator and, frankly, as a person.\\" Simotas had been a lead sponsor (\\"co-sponsor\\") of Assembly Bill A08354, which passed the Assembly by an 80‚Äì63 vote, later passed the Senate, and was signed into law by Governor Andrew Cuomo. Since she first took office, Simotas supported the Gender Expression Non-Discrimination Act (GENDA), for which she was a \\"multi-sponsor\\".  Criminal justice In 2019, Simotas introduced legislation to close a loophole in New York's Raise the Age law to expand eligibility for record sealing. Simotas voted against rollbacks to bail reform in the FY 2020-2021 state budget. Energy and environment Simotas has been chairperson of Smart Power NY, a coalition to develop new energy sources for the area, since April 2012. Its first goal was to support the utility NRG Energy with their plan to replace its \\"decades-old, dirty\\" power plant in Astoria with a newer generator. NRG wants to replace 31 generators with new ones that will increase the megawatts of power while reducing emissions. Emissions would be reduced because the new plants will use natural gas, while the current generators run primarily on oil.  Other issues  Simotas has pushed for the allocation of additional polling sites and the expansion of early voting. Simotas joined several other public officials in protesting against the anti-immigrant Greek organization, Golden Dawn, which held a recruitment meeting in Queens. Simotas said that the anti-immigrant message was not welcome in her community; she expressed anger because she is an immigrant herself.Golden Dawn is a neo-Nazi party in Greece, and is involved in Holocaust denialism. A sample of work on Golden Dawn reports:  * Simotas kicks off QSAC's annual 5K race for Autism. September 2013 Simotas has supported the expansion of Mount Sinai Queens hospital, which is undergoing a massive $125 million building project, noting the expanding population of western Queens and the necessity of increased healthcare opportunities to meet the needs of a growing community. In October 2013, Simotas hosted a seminar for Astoria seniors about Medicare, health insurance, and local resources. Simotas reads to students during a \\"Proud to Read Aloud\\" event at P.S. 70 in Astoria, Queens. May 2013 In 2013, Simotas supported the retention and expansion of Gifted and Talented programs in her district. Simotas has been active in keeping local public schools open and functioning in her district, including Long Island City High School, which has been threatened with closing or \\"co-location\\" (consolidation) since the early 2010s. Simotas speaks out in support of her Community Full Disclosure Act during floor debate in the Assembly chamber. Simotas has pushed for cleaner streets in Astoria, calling upon Mayor Bill de Blasio to take action and reduce street waste and litter. Personal life Simotas is married to John Katsanos, and they have one daughter, born in 2012.

It was designated as a Michigan State Historic State on May 18, 1971 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 4, 2007. History The Chicago Road (now U.S. 12) was built in the late 1820s and early 1830s, and quickly became a prime transportation route. In 1834, Henry W. Sisson built a log tavern at this site along the Chicago Road. In 1839, he sold the tavern and associated property to John Davenport, the owner of a local saw and grist mill. Davenport owned the property until 1864, and at some time during that period constructed the present hotel building, Although the exact date of construction is unknown, it was likely in about 1861. (note: large pdf file) In 1864, Davenport sold the hotel to Henry Lancaster. Lancaster renamed the hotel the \\"Lancaster House,\\" and operated it as a hotel and a social center for the local population until 1884, when he moved. He continued to own the property until 1888, when the mortgage was foreclosed. At that time, businessmen John and Edward Smith purchased the hotel, and in 1889 sold it to Edward L. Clapp. Clapp served as the local postmaster, and operated a post office in the hotel from 1890 to 1900. In 1907, Clapp sold the hotel to Charles F. Pitcher, who operated it until his death in 1925. Frank H. Ridley then purchased it, and hired George and Jessie Bauer to manage the establishment. The late 1920s were a boom period for the Irish Hills area: the Chicago Road was paved in 1926, and the area was touted as a tourist destination. The Bauers had the hotel renovated, enlarging the dining room and updating the decor. Frank Ridley owned the hotel until 1938, then sold it to the Bauers, who renamed in \\"Bauer Manor.\\" The Bauers retired in 1963, and sold the hotel to Kenneth and Mary Van Doren in 1965. The establishment became primarily a restaurant, still operating under the \\"Bauer Manor\\" name. AI and Diane Andrews purchased the hotel in 1979, and the restaurant continued operation until 2003. In the later 2000s, the property was renovated into office space and apartments, and the lower floor housed a realty company. Description The Bauer Manor is a broad, two-story wooden Greek Revival structure with a wide hip-roof main mass, a gabled wing extending to the rear from one end, and another rear single-story addition constructed in 1965. The front facade is seven bays wide, with a two-story square-column portico extending across the entire front. Two entrances are in the front. The primary entrance is located near the center, and has a Revival molded trim enframement, sidelights, and a transom. A plainer, secondary entrance is located at one end of the building. Both the front and side facades have double-hung six-over-six windows. The original interior layout had the main entrance opening into an entry hall containing a staircase. Off the hall was a dining room, two bedrooms, a bar area, and a kitchen behind. The dining room has since been expanded twice: once in the 1920s with the removal of the two bedrooms, and later in the 1960s with the construction of a rear addition. On the second floor, a central hallway leads to the guest rooms. To the rear is a large ballroom. The ballroom has since been subdivided.

After the Revolutionary War, Albany County saw a great increase in real estate transactions. After Horatio Gates' win over John Burgoyne at Saratoga in 1777, the upper Hudson Valley was generally at peace as the war raged on elsewhere. Prosperity was soon seen all over Upstate New York. Migrants from Vermont and Connecticut began flowing in, noting the advantages of living on the Hudson and trading at Albany, while being only a few days' sail from New York City.Anderson (1897), p. 68 Albany reported a population of 3,498 in the first national census in 1790, an increase of almost 700% since its chartering. In 1797, the state capital of New York was moved permanently to Albany. From statehood to this date, the Legislature had frequently moved the state capital between Albany, Kingston, Poughkeepsie, and the city of New York. Albany is the second oldest state capital in the United States.Rittner (2002), back cover steamer Albany departs for New York City; at the height of steam travel in 1884, more than 1.5 million passengers took the trip.McEneny (2006), p. 92alt=A white steam ship is seen near the shore of the Hudson River in front of the downtown area of Albany; the New York State Capitol can be seen in the background. Albany has been a center of transportation for much of its history. In the late 18th century and early 19th century, Albany saw development of the turnpike and by 1815, Albany was the turnpike center of the state. The development of Simeon De Witt's gridded block system in 1794, which gave Albany its original bird and mammal street names, was intersected by these important arterials coming out of Albany, cutting through the city at unexpected angles.McEneny (2006), p. 75Waite (1993), p. 201 The advent of the turnpike, in conjunction with canal and railroad systems, made Albany the hub of transportation for pioneers going to Buffalo and the Michigan Territory in the early and mid-19th century.Albany. (2010). Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved June 27, 2010, from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. In 1807, Robert Fulton initiated a steamboat line from New York to Albany, the first successful enterprise of its kind.McEneny (2006), p. 92 By 1810, with 10,763 people, Albany was the 10th largest urban place in the nation. The town and village known as \\"the Colonie\\" to the north of Albany was annexed in 1815. In 1825 the Erie Canal was completed, forming a continuous water route from the Great Lakes to New York City. Unlike the current Barge Canal, which ends at nearby Waterford, the original Erie Canal ended at Albany; Lock 1 was located north of Colonie Street. The Canal emptied into a man-made lagoon called the Albany Basin, which was Albany's main port from 1825 until the Port of Albany-Rensselaer opened in 1932. In 1829, while working as a professor at the Albany Academy, Joseph Henry, widely regarded as \\"the foremost American scientist of the 19th century\\", built the first electric motor. Three years later, he discovered electromagnetic self-induction (the SI unit for which is now the henry). He went on to be the first Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.Joseph Henry. (2010). Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved September 18, 2010, from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. In the 1830 and 1840 censuses, Albany moved up to 9th largest urban place in the nation, then back to 10th in 1850. This was the last time the city was one of the top ten largest urban places in the nation. Albany also has significant history with rail transport, as the location of two major regional railroad headquarters. The Delaware and Hudson Railway was headquartered in Albany at what is now the SUNY System Administration Building.Waite (1993), p. 245 In 1853, Erastus Corning, a noted industrialist and Albany's mayor from 1834 to 1837, consolidated ten railroads stretching from Albany to Buffalo into the New York Central Railroad (NYCRR), headquartered in Albany until Cornelius Vanderbilt moved it to New York City in 1867. One of the ten companies that formed the NYCRR was the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad, which was the first railroad in the state and the first successful steam railroad running regularly scheduled service in the country. 1784-1800 1790 map of Albany by Simeon De Witt Albany's 1794 plan for future street grid, by Simeon De Witt After the American Revolution, Albany began to grow both physically and commercially, but also culturally. The first post office in Albany was established in 1784 on the east side of Broadway, north of Maiden Lane. In 1785 the Common Council ordered to change the names of any streets that seemed to \\"savor of the English rule\\" and Fort Frederick was demolished, which allowed for further expansion of the city to the west. Also in 1785, the sloop Experiment left Albany for China, being only the second American ship to go to China, and the first expressly built for that purpose. A regular schedule of comedic acts were performed for several months in 1786, the first time comedians performed in Albany. John Lansing Jr. became mayor in that year as well. In 1788 and 1789 stage lines are established linking Albany to Lansingburgh, New York and Springfield, Massachusetts, prior to this the only stagecoach service was to New York. This is the very beginning of Albany's rise as a transportation hub, stage lines being an early version of intercity bus lines. In 1791 stage coach mail route is established to Bennington, Vermont and a stage line is started to Oneida County in 1792. In the following few years stage lines are established with the surrounding communities and beyond, such as Ballston in 1793 and to Buffalo and Niagara Falls in 1811. Within ten years turnpikes would start to radiate out from Albany to surrounding communities and farther. The first national census was taken in 1790 and the city was shown to have 3,498 people. Albany County had 75,180 people, making it larger than the next two largest counties combined, New York and Dutchess counties. Also in 1790, the street names were officially changed, east-west streets named for mammals and north-south streets for birds; most of the bird named streets continue to today with their names from this time, while the mammal streets, except for Elk, are changed over the course of time. Abraham Yates Jr. was appointed mayor in this year as well. Congress authorized the construction of a post road from Albany to Canajoharie through Schenectady. The Albany Library was incorporated in 1791 as well as the Bank of Albany. In 1797 the Albany Museum was incorporated. Emigration from New England to the western part of the state increased as roads were improved west of Albany. By 1795, 500 sleighs a day were passing through Albany in February on their way from New England states to the west. On the death of Mayor Yates, Abraham Ten Broeck was appointed mayor a second time. In 1797, the state capital of New York was moved permanently to Albany. From statehood to this date the legislature spent roughly equal time constantly moving between Albany, Kingston, Poughkeepsie, and the city of New York. Also in 1797 the Ten Broeck Mansion was completed by Stephen Van Rensselaer for his brother-in-law Mayor Ten Broeck. Later that year he was replaced by Philip Van Rensselaer. A State Capitol, jointly used as City Hall, was finished at the corner of State and Lodge streets. Transportation hub to the west (1800-1830) The era of turnpikes in Albany started with the incorporation of the Great Western Turnpike Company in 1799. The Great Western Turnpike (today Western Avenue and US Route 20) connected Albany with the Finger Lakes and eventually Lake Erie at the site of Buffalo. Various other corporations soon started to connect Albany to various places: Lebanon Springs in 1799, Schenectady in 1801, Bethlehem in 1804, Albany and Delaware in 1805. In 1803 the second bank chartered in Albany, the New York State Bank, opened. In 1807, Robert Fulton initiated a steamboat line from New York to Albany; this was the first commercially viable steamboat in the world. In 1804 Aaron Burr, who had a law office in Albany at 24 South Pearl Street, came into conflict with Alexander Hamilton. At 50 State Street, the home of John Tayler (later Lt. Governor and acting-Governor of the state), Hamilton made disparaging remarks about Burr and these were published in a local newspaper. A new building was constructed at the Public Square in 1808 at the head of State Street to be used jointly as the State Capitol and City Hall, just as the previous capitol/city hall on Broadway and Hudson Avenue. In 1810 Middle Public Square has its name changed to Washington Square, this and the cemetery next to it which was established a few years before are the genesis of the presend-day Washington Park. By 1810 Albany, with 10,763 people, was the 10th largest city in the nation. The city continues to prosper and grow, adding new buildings, institutions, and people. In 1813 The Albany Academy is incorporated, the Albany Argus newspaper is established, two more banks apply for charters, and the grand opening of the Green Street theatre (first professional theater in Albany). The next year sees the opening of the Albany Academy for Girls. The city in 1815 annexes the village of Colonie, today the it is the neighborhood of Arbor Hill. In 1816 a petition is started to get the Legislature to construct a canal from Albany to Lake Erie. After 17 years Mayor Van Rensselaer is removed from office for political reasons, and Colonel Elisha Jenkins becomes mayor of the city in 1816. In 1817 slavery comes to a gradual end in Albany as the Legislature decides that all slaves in the state born before July 4, 1797 will be emancipated on July 4, 1827 and all slaves born after July 4, 1797 will be emancipated at age 28 for males, 25 for females. A month later the Legislature authorizes the construction of an Erie canal. Also in 1817 Martin Van Buren establishes his law firm, it is located at 111 State Street, then moves to 353 Broadway, and then in 1822 to 109 State Street. The New York State Library is established in 1818 inside the Capitol. Philip Van Rensselaer returns to office in 1819 after Mayor Jenkins resigns. In 1819 the city is built up only one mile west of the Hudson, beyond that is the Pine Bush, today the Pine Bush Preserve does not begin until five miles (8 km) out from the Hudson. Theodric Romeyn Beck performs a comprehensive agricultural and geological survey of Albany County in 1820, it is the first in the state. Also in 1820 a chamber of commerce is established at Albany. The Common Council takes over the right to appoint the mayor and in 1821 unanimously elects Charles Edward Dudley. In Albany William Charles Redfield proposes that hurricanes are circular rotational vortices. DeWitt Clinton, first train in New York, ran from Albany to Schenectady In 1823 the Federal Dam at Troy is finished with a lock allowing for river navigation above Troy to Lansingburgh and Waterford. Throughout 1824 from January 1 to March 7 the Common Council meets trying to vote out the mayor in favor of Ambrose Spencer, but several times deadlocks 11-11, finally on March 8 on the second ballot of that day Ambrose Spencer is elected on a vote of 11 for, 10 against, and one blank. He is only the third Episcopalian mayor and non-Dutch Reformed, in 1825 he will be reelected unanimously. The Albany Institute, the predecessor to the Albany Institute of History and Art is incorporated in 1824. In 1825, a long and wide pier was constructed from, and perpendicular to, Albany's shoreline. Along with two bridges, the pier enclosed roughly of the Hudson River as the Albany Basin. The construction of the pier and bridges cost $119,980. The Erie Canal opens officially and the Seneca Chief leaves Buffalo on October 26, arriving at Albany November 2. James Stevenson is elected by the Common Council in 1826, this is the first time in which an Episcopalian succeeds and Episcopalian as mayor of Albany. The Mohawk and Hudson Railroad (M&H;), chartered in 1826, builds the Albany and Schenectady Railroad between those two cities, starting service on August 9, 1831, this is the first railway in the state. Map of Albany and Schenectady counties in 1829 The last public execution in Albany occurs on August 24, 1826. Jesse Strang is hanged for the murder of John Whipple at the Cherry Hill Mansion, beyond the city line then but today a museum within the city's South End. He is hung on what was Hudson Street (Avenue), at a location now within the Empire State Plaza. Charles Dudley returns to office on the resignation of Mayor Stevenson, this returns a Dutch Reformed mayor after two Episcopalians, and Dudley's fourth time as mayor, but resigns in 1829 in order to become a United States Senator. John Townsend replaces him and becomes the first Presbyterian mayor of Albany, Albany becoming less dominated by Dutch descendants. Also in 1829 Joseph Henry at The Albany Academy demonstrates the idea behind electromagnets, induction, generators, and the electric telegraph but fails to patent any idea or invention, only publishing scientific papers, allowing others such as Samuel Morse to patent the same inventions years later. 1830-1860 Francis Bloodgood, of Dutch Reformed faith, becomes mayor in 1831 and pays all the debts of those in debtors' prison on the occasion of his swearing in. A City Hall is erected on Eagle Street, between Maiden Lane and Pine Street, the location of the current City Hall. It is made of marble and capped by a gilded dome. John Townsend returns as mayor in 1832. Summer of that year sees a cholera epidemic in Albany. Out of a population of about 26,000 there are 387 become infected and 136 die just in July, with the last death of cholera in this epidemic recorded in September. Also in 1832 in order for Hudson Avenue to be extended west with the growing city the Rutten Kill is filled in between Eagle and Hawk streets (today part of the Empire State Plaza), having already been covered east of Eagle by Hudson Avenue. In 1833 Francis Bloodgood becomes mayor for the second time. Prior to 1833 the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad ended at the junction of Western and Madison avenues, starting in 1833 the tracks were extended to State Street within of Eagle Street but the cars were pulled by horses for fear that locomotives could start buildings on fire or spook horses on the streets. At this time less than a handful of streets are opened as far west as Swan Street, some have been expanded out to Hawk, and most streets don't go past Eagle, except on paper, even Eagle Street is not open from Hudson to Madison avenues. The house that is farthest south in the city limits at this point is at the corner of Grand and Hamilton streets. Erastus Corning, Mayor of Albany. In 1834 Erastus Corning is elected mayor by the Common Council. Cholera breaks out again this year, from August 11 to September 16, 19 people die.

Also in 1837 Albany Medical College is founded and 29 Elk Street is bought by the state as the first official governor's residence. Jared Rathbone is elected mayor in 1839, first Baptist mayor, last one to be chosen by the Common Council and also the first one to be elected by popular vote in 1840. In the first popular election for mayor Rathbone (Whig Party) defeats Corning by only 322 votes. 1840 census shows the breakdown of the population of Albany as 15,729 white males, 17,021 white females, 378 black males, and 499 black females.

The tradition can be traced back to the first president, George Washington, and continues on today with President Donald Trump. History Samuel Brooks created the first presidential medal for President George Washington‚Äîthe medal produce had a crude profile of Washington on one side and is known as the \\"Manly medal\\". When elected for his second term in office, \\"success tokens\\" were distributed as mementos following Washington's inauguration, but the medals were not produced for the actual festivities. Thomas Jefferson received the first unofficial presidential inaugural medal produced by John Reich in 1802. The silver medal was sold for $4.25 and the tin medal for $1.25. For years, independent medal makers would produce presidential medals to commemorate a specific president's inauguration. In addition, unofficial presidential buttons, ribbons, and badges were produced. All of these became increasingly popular once elaborate inaugural festivities were thrown in Washington, D.C because the various items became favored souvenirs for the attendees. Since there was no standard medal, historians have uncovered medals in various sizes and qualities, as well as composed of different metals.MacNeil, Neil. The President's medal, 1789-1977. New York : Published in association with the National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution, by C. N. Potter, 1977. Obverse of a 1905 Roosevelt presidential inaugural medal.When the government decided it could no longer afford the inaugural celebrations at the turn of the twentieth century, D.C. residents took it upon themselves to raise all the funding for inaugural festivities. One way to raise funds was through the sale of official presidential inaugural medals. Instead of various presidential medals being produced for tourist consumption, an official inaugural medal would be produced by the official Inauguration Committee and sold to the public. In 1901, William McKinley received the first official presidential inaugural medal‚Äîit had his portrait stamped on one side and the Capitol building on the other. Surrounding the Capitol building are the words, \\"William McKinley President of the United States * Theodore Roosevelt Vice-President\\". Instead of being produced by the United States Mint, the medals were produced by the Joseph K. Davison Company of Philadelphia. Scholars believe that 3 gold, 55 silver, and approximately 4,000 bronze medals were produced. The three gold medals were created for the President, Vice President, and President of the Official Inauguration Committee for Medals and Badges. Silver medals were to be distributed among committee members and bronze medals were available for public sale. This set a tradition that is still observed today. Reverse of a 1905 Roosevelt presidential inaugural medal.When Theodore Roosevelt came into office in 1905, he decided that the previous medal produced for McKinley would be insufficient for him. Roosevelt, an avid art supporter, wanted his medal to go above and beyond a simple portrait. This led to two different medals being produced for his inauguration‚Äîa simpler medal approved by the Committee on Medals and Badges and a medal commissioned by Roosevelt himself. When choosing someone to design his personal inaugural medal, Roosevelt turned to renowned sculptor, Augustus Saint-Gaudens. Saint-Gaudens was at the height of his career and was in negotiations with the U.S. Treasury to make new designs for American coins. It was during his visit to the White House that President Roosevelt also asked him to design a superior inauguration medal for his election. Saint-Gaudens agreed to the President's proposal and immediately began to sketch possibilities. The medal produced from Saint-Gaudens certainly held a superior art aesthetic in comparison to the original medal produced by the Inaugural Committee. One side of the medal displays a distinguished portrait of Roosevelt and the other side holds a high-relief eagle. This is the same eagle that is later used for the $10 coins produced by the U.S. Treasury. Roosevelt's artistic design continues to influence presidential inaugural medals today. Following Roosevelt's presidency, the Chairmen for the Committee on Medals and Badges purposefully chose artist and other pro-art members in order to produce superior results. The precedence Roosevelt set continued to be followed and efforts were made to contract an artist, whether it be a sculptor or engraver, to design future medals. However, time constraints and the limitations set forth by the contracted firm to produce the medals always affects the final results. Consequently, various degrees of artistic medals have been produced, from the less ornate Woodrow Wilson medals with his portrait on one side and his name and Vice President's Riley Marshall's name on the other side, to the more elaborate John F. Kennedy medal that has his portrait on one side and a high relief Presidential Seal on the other.Levine, H. Joseph. Collectors Guide to Presidential Medals and Memorabilia. Danbury, Conn. : Johnson & Jensen, 1981. When producing a new inaugural medal, the sculptor has the President-elect sit for the creation of a clay sketch. The sketch is then turned into a mask to which additional facial features can be added. The mask is then transformed into a plaster model, then an epoxy cast. The cast is used to create the die cuts that will be used for striking the medals. After the medals have been created, they are immersed in chemicals that darken the piece to create a two-toned effect. Lastly, the medals are lacquered to preserve the piece. Collecting Inauguration Medals 1901 Bronze Presidential Medal for McKinleyIt was not until Richard Dusterberg published The Official Inaugural Medals of the Presidents of the United States in 1971 that collecting Presidential Medals began to become popular. The original catalog included pictures of all the medals up to 1969, as well as a price guide. As a result, the increase in collecting led to an increase in prices. Collecting presidential medals has grown in popularity due to the appeal of the subject matter, availability of the pieces, and the fact that it is a defined collection. If a collector chooses to collect the bronze medals, this can be completed fairly easily for a decent price. The value of the presidential inaugural medals has fluctuated over the years and is highly influenced by auctions and the current U.S. economy. For example, in 1980 there was the Great Gold and Silver Panic when silver was worth $50 per ounce and gold worth $800 per ounce. This led to thousands of medals being melted down for their silver and gold weight values. The medals produced for Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and Jimmy Carter fell victim to this panic, which has since then created a shortage available for collectors and therefore a higher price tag for those presidents. Currently, the Smithsonian Institution and the Special Collections Research Center at The George Washington University hold the most complete collections of presidential inauguration medals. The Smithsonian collection is composed of medals donated by different individuals over the years. In December 1977, the National Portrait Gallery premiered the Smithsonian's medal collection with the exhibition, \\"The President's Medal\\". The Special Collections Research Center's collection was donated by Darrell C. Crain in May 1976. Crain's father had designed the presidential medals for President Woodrow Wilson (1917), President Warren G. Harding (1921), and President Calvin Coolidge (1925). In addition, Crain served on the Official Inaugural Medal Committee for five presidents.Darrell C.

McNabb is perhaps best known as a longtime member of the band Better Than Ezra, although he has performed session and touring work with many acts during his career. Prior to joining Better Than Ezra in January 1996, McNabb toured with acts such as Vigilantes of Love, Beggars, and seminal Oregon-based punk rock band The Wipers. Since mid-2007, he has been the full- time touring drummer with Grammy-award winning Country/Bluegrass act Sugarland. Travis McNabb has equipment endorsement relationships with Ludwig drums, Pro-Mark drumsticks, Remo drum heads, and Zildjian cymbals. Early career Travis McNabb was born a third-generation musician in New Orleans, Louisiana. His grandfather Edgar McNabb was a Bluegrass guitarist and dobro player, and his father Richard played guitar in area Rock bands during the 1960s. McNabb initially dabbled in guitar and piano, but took up the drums at age 15. By age 18, McNabb was already on the road, touring with Oregon-based punk band The Wipers, and manning the drum set for what became their final tour. After finishing this stint, McNabb began several years of session and touring work with acts such as Vigilantes of Love, Billy Pilgrim, Shawn Mullins, and Indigo Girls before joining Eli Braden, Robert Levon Been and Jeremy Kunz to form the Beggars. Better Than Ezra In January 1996, McNabb auditioned for New Orleans-based Alternative-Rock band Better Than Ezra, and was hired to replace departing founding drummer Cary Bonnecaze. For the next 13 years, McNabb was a member of the band, playing countless live shows, as well recording four albums, a re-recorded rarities collection, non-album tracks for compilations and a greatest hits collection, and a live album/DVD release. Sugarland Following the better part of two decades on the road and in the studio, Better Than Ezra took a brief hiatus in early 2007. During this period, guitarist/songwriter Kevin Griffin found himself writing songs for other artists, and bassist Tom Drummond began producing other acts at the band's New Orleans recording facility, Fudge Studios. This break provided McNabb with the opportunity to return to his roots as a session and touring musician for hire while still maintaining his association with the band. Upon hearing of his availability, former Billy Pilgrim bandmate Kristian Bush contacted McNabb about playing some studio sessions for his new act, Country/Bluegrass duo Sugarland. After these recordings were completed, McNabb was offered a spot touring with the band, which he accepted. Beginning in August 2007, McNabb hit the road with Bush, his partner Jennifer Nettles, and their backing band, playing shows in support of Sugarland's album Enjoy the Ride. During this period, he continued to play sporadic shows with Better Than Ezra during special appearances and one-off bookings they accepted during their break. in January 2009, Better Than Ezra made the announcement that McNabb would be leaving the band as a full-time member in order to concentrate on the increasing demands placed on his time due to Sugarland's brisk touring schedule. At the same time, McNabb's replacement was announced to be former Pleasure Club drummer Michael Jerome. Both sides stressed the amicable nature of the parting, which was reinforced by the fact that McNabb remains on the board of Better Than Ezra's charitable organization The Ezra Foundation (a fund which focuses on the rebuilding of areas of New Orleans struck by Hurricane Katrina). In addition, McNabb returned to the band briefly to play a set with Better Than Ezra during the victory party for the NFL's New Orleans Saints upon the team's Super Bowl win in early 2010. McNabb also appears as the drummer on several tracks of Better Than Ezra's 2009 release \\"Paper Empire.\\" McNabb's official final performance with Better Than Ezra was at Family Gras in Metairie, Louisiana on Feb. 15th, 2009. Current McNabb continues his association with Sugarland, playing drums at all of the band's live appearances at concert venues, as well as television specials and awards shows. In addition, he was the primary studio drummer on Sugarland's 2010 release \\"The Incredible Machine,\\" as well as several tracks on their Christmas-music collection \\"Gold and Green.\\" During brief breaks in Sugarland's tour schedule, McNabb has also recently picked up road work with other current artists, including Brendan Benson (of The Raconteurs) and Country act Little Big Town, as well as session work with artists such as Howie Day, Dar Williams, and Mandi Perkins. In addition, he has performed with both Kristian Bush and Jennifer Nettles of Sugarland during television and other live solo appearances. From July 2013 to June 2014, McNabb toured as the drummer with Country music duo Big & Rich. McNabb's first affiliation with Big & Rich came in 2010, when he was invited to organize the backing band for a Haiti earthquake relief benefit put together by one of that group's founders, Big Kenny Alphin. Starting in mid-2014, McNabb toured with singer-songwriter Gavin DeGraw. As of 2015, McNabb has been the drummer with the backing band of alt-country artist Frankie Ballard. Personal life Travis McNabb currently resides in Nashville, Tennessee with his wife Cristy, and their dogs Maggie and Emmy Lou. He is a classic motorcycle and vehicle enthusiast, and enjoys collecting and playing vintage drum and percussion gear. McNabb also recently opened a drum tracking studio, Wood Hill Recording, where he offers his services as a studio percussionist and audio engineer.

The alt=A flat boat with large, wooden boards piled on it floats in a narrow channel surrounded by more piles of wooden boards. A few men pose on the boat. While the key to Albany's economic prosperity in the 19th century was transportation, industry and business also played a role. Largely thanks to the city's Dutch and German roots, beer was one of its biggest commodities. Beverwyck Brewery, originally known as Quinn and Nolan (Nolan being mayor of Albany 1878‚Äì1883), was the last remaining brewer from that time when it closed in 1972. The city's location at the east end of the Erie Canal gave it unparalleled access to both raw products and a captive customer base in the west.McEneny (2006), pp. 87‚Äì88 Albany was known for its publishing houses, and to some extent, still is. Albany was second only to Boston in the number of books produced for most of the 19th century.McEneny (2006), p. 88 Iron foundries in both the north and south ends of the city brought thousands of immigrants to the city. To this day, one can see many intricate wrought-iron details on older buildings. The iron industry waned by the 1890s, falling victim to the costs associated with a newly unionized workforce and the opening of mines in the Mesabi Range in Minnesota.McEneny (2006), pp. 88 & 92 Albany's other major exports during the 18th and 19th centuries were furs, wheat, meat and lumber;McEneny (2006), p. 65 by 1865, there were almost 4,000 saw mills in the Albany area and the Albany Lumber District was the largest lumber market in the nation. The city was also home to a number of banks. The Bank of Albany (1792‚Äì1861) was the second chartered bank in New York. The city was the original home of the Albank (founded in 1820 as the Albany Savings Bank), KeyBank (founded in 1825 as the Commercial Bank of Albany), and Norstar Bank (founded as the State Bank of Albany in 1803). American Express was founded in Albany in 1850 as an express mail business.Reynolds (1906), p. 603 In 1871, the northwestern portion of Albany‚Äîwest from Magazine Street‚Äîwas annexed to the neighboring town of GuilderlandHowell and Tenny (1886, Vol. I), p. 77 after the town of Watervliet refused annexation of said territory. In return for this loss, portions of Bethlehem and Watervliet were added to Albany. Part of the land annexed to Guilderland was ceded back to Albany in 1910, setting up the current western border. Overview A lithograph of Albany as seen in 1879, with the Albany Basin and Maiden Lane Bridge in foreground. Albany City Hall in 1897, completed in 1881. In 1860 George Thacher (Democrat) defeats John Taylor (Republican) by 735 votes. Eli Perry becomes mayor again in 1862 with 2,489 votes over George Luther the Republican candidate. George Washington Hough invents the recording barometer while director of the Dudley Observatory. In 1864 the Albany Railway Company begins intra-city service with horse cars between the corner of Broadway and State Street to the corner of Central Avenue and Northern Boulevard (today Henry Johnson Boulevard) and Eli Perry is reelected mayor by a 1,193 vote majority over John Rathbone (Republican). In 1866 former mayor George Thacher is elected over Robert Pruyn (Republican) by a 733-vote margin, the Livingston Avenue Railroad Bridge is finished in this year as well. In 1867 the Bowery is changed to its current name of Central Avenue, Lydius Street is changed to Madison Avenue, and Madison Place gets its current name as well having previously been Madison Avenue. In 1868 Charles Bleecker defeats John Parker (Republican) by 2,836 votes. Also in 1868 Albany is created an Episcopal diocese from the New York diocese, William Doane is elected the first bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Albany. In 1869 Christian Brothers Academy is organized. George Thacher becomes mayor again with a 1,238 vote margin over Edmund Judson (Republican), he becomes the first mayor to have veto power over the Common Council. Prior to 1870 the city's western boundary had remained the limit from the Hudson River as stated in the Dongan Charter, in this year the limit is reduced to five miles (8 km), where Magazine Street is today, but the city annexes the hamlet to the north called North Albany from the town of Watervliet (today the town of Colonie) and areas to the south from the town of Bethlehem. The Maiden Lane Bridge over the Hudson in Albany is finished and the first train crosses it on December 28, 1871. Westward expansion of the city is evident in the opening of Washington Park in 1871 (lake, bridge, and lakehouse finished in 1875) and of a fifth police precinct on Central Avenue, occupying building at 270 Central Avenue in 1876 (just west of North Lake Avenue). In Albany's South End Second, Third, and Fourth avenues receive their names, formerly being in order- Whitehall Road, Van Vechten Street, and Nucella Street. George Thacher resignes in 1874 and Edmund Judson (Republican) is elected by a margin of 1,492 votes over Thomas McCarty (Democrat), Judson becomes the second Republican mayor of Albany and the first to be elected by the people. In 1875, the Irish-born in Albany make up 14,184 out of the total population of over 86,000. Map of Albany in 1895 New York State Capitol, begun in 1872 and completed in 1899. At a cost of $25 million it was the most expensive government building of its time. In 1876 Anthony Banks (Democrat) defeats Mayor Judson by 1,465 votes. In that year the first Albany High School is completed, it being on Eagle Street between Columbia and Steuben Streets, today the site of the Albany County Courthouse. In 1878 Michael Nicholas Nolan (Democrat) wins election as mayor over William Young (Republican) by a 3,558 vote margin. Mayor Nolan is the first Irish and first Catholic mayor of Albany. Also in 1878 Adam Blake, a former slave of the Van Rensselaer family opens the Kenmore Hotel at the corner of North Pearl and Columbia streets, the building still stands and is used for office space. In 1879 City Hall burns down and the Albany College of Pharmacy is organized. In 1881 electric lighting comes to Albany's streets and the current City Hall is completed. The election in 1882 is decided in favor of Mayor Nolan over John Swinburne but the next year the courts decide that Swinburne won and Mayor Nolan resigns. John Swinburne becomes mayor of Albany on June 25. Also In 1882 Academy Park was reconstructed with $4,500. In 1883 the West Shore Railroad connects Albany to New York and to Syracuse, by January 1, 1884 it is to Buffalo. Former Mayor Anthony Banks defeats the current mayor Michael Nolan by a margin of 250 votes in 1884. In this year the cornerstone for Cathedral of All Saints was laid, technically the building is still not complete today. In 1886 John Thacher (Democrat) defeats Edward Durant (Republican) by 1,529 votes. In 1888 Edward Maher (Democrat) defeats Former Mayor Swinburne by 2,753 votes. In 1889 construction on the Washington Avenue Armory, at the corner of Lark Street and Washington Avenue, is begun. James Manning (Democrat) wins the mayoral election in 1890 over Republican candidate Howard Fuller by 7,236 votes. Also in this year the Hawk Street Viaduct is completed, allowing for traffic to go from Elk Street over Sheridan Hollow to Clinton Avenue. Father Burke of St. Joseph's Church (Catholic) at a meeting at City Hall encouraging the Mayor to sign the bill authorizing the bridge says, \\"When the bridge shall have been built, should any one be so rash as to demand its removal, he would incur the indignation of the people of Albany.\\" The bridge is demolished in 1970. November 17, 1892 the Albany Times-Union is first published (and later drops the hyphen). Mayor Manning wins reelection in 1892 by a margin of 5,253 votes over James Warner (Republican). In 1893 the Moses statue in Washington Park is erected, a gift of Henry L. King. Oren Wilson (Republican) becomes mayor in 1894, defeating James Rooney by 3,509 votes. In 1896 former-mayor John Thacher defeats the Republican candidate William Walker by 4,278 votes. Also in 1896 the Northern Boulevard bridge is built over the New York Central Railroad's Tivoli Hollow line, it is located at the same location as the modern Northern Boulevard bridge between the Livingston Middle School and Albany Memorial Hospital. In 1898 Thomas Van Alstyne (Democrat) becomes mayor after defeating Seldon Martin by 2,158 votes. Also in 1898 the second bridge in Albany to span Sheridan Hollow is built, this one to carry Knox Street (later renamed Northern Boulevard and today called Henry Johnson Boulevard) from Central Avenue to Spruce Street. The current State Capitol begun in 1867, is finished in 1899 when Governor Theodore Roosevelt declares the building completed. It was inspired by the Paris City Hall. It was the most expensive government building of the time. Notable architectural features include its \\"Million Dollar Staircase.\\" Also in 1899 the first automobile in Albany arrives, owned by Archibald Dederick, it is steam-powered. James Blessing (Republican) becomes mayor in 1900 after defeating Mayor Van Alstyne by 2,369 votes. In this year the Chamber of Commerce is organized.

Under this translation paradigm, the computer software that assists the human translator attempts to predict the text the user is going to input by taking into account all the information it has available. Whenever such prediction is wrong and the user provides feedback to the system, a new prediction is performed considering the new information available. Such process is repeated until the translation provided matches the user's expectations. Interactive machine translation is specially interesting when translating texts in domains where it is not admissible to output a translation containing errors, hence requiring a human user to amend the translations provided by the system. In such cases, interactive machine translation has been proved to provide benefit to potential users. Nevertheless, there are few commercial software that implements interactive machine translation and work done in the field is mostly restrained to academic research.  History  Historically, interactive machine translation is born as an evolution of the computer-aided translation paradigm, where the human translator and the machine translation system were intended to work as a tandem. This first work was extended within the TransType research project, funded by the Canadian government. In this project, the human interaction was aimed towards producing the target text for the first time by embedding data- driven machine translation techniques within the interactive translation environment with the goal of achieving the best of both actors: the efficiency of the automatic system and the reliability of human translators. Later, a larger-scale research project, TransType2, funded by the European Commission extended such work by analyzing the incorporation of a complete machine translation system into the process, with the goal of producing a complete translation hypothesis, which the human user is allowed to amend or accept. If the user decides to amend the hypothesis, the system then attempts to make the best use of such feedback in order to produce a new translation hypothesis that takes into account the modifications introduced by the user. More recently, CASMACAT, also funded by the European Commission, aimed at developing novel types of assistance to human translators and integrated them into a new workbench, consisting of an editor, a server, and analysis and visualisation tools. The workbench was designed in a modular fashion and can be combined with existing computer aided translation tools. Furthermore, the CASMACAT workbench can learn from the interaction with the human translator by updating and adapting its models instantly based on the translation choices of the user. Recent work on involving an extensive evaluation with human users revealed the fact that interactive machine translation may even be used by users that do not speak the source language in order to achieve near professional translation quality. Moreover, it also elucidated the fact that an interactive scenario is more beneficial than a classic post-edition scenario. The previously described approaches rely on a tightly coupled underlying corpus-based machine translation system (usually, a Statistical machine translation system) that is used as a glass box, therefore inheriting the shortcomings of the translation systems and limiting the usage of interactive machine translation for some scenarios. For this reason, an approach that uses any kind of bilingual resource (not limited to machine translation) as a black-box to provide interactive machine translation was developed. This approach is not able to extract as much information from the bilingual resources used, due to the black-box nature of the interaction, but can use any resource available to the user. Forecat is a black-box interactive machine translation implementation that is available both as a web application (that includes a webpage and a web services interface) and as a plugin for OmegaT (Forecat-OmegaT).  Process  The interactive machine translation process starts with the system suggesting a translation hypothesis to the user. Then, the user may accept the complete sentence as correct, or may modify it if he considers there is some error. Typically, when modifying a given word, it is assumed that the prefix until that word is correct, leading to a left-to-right interaction scheme. Once the user has changed the word considered incorrect, the system then proposes a new suffix, i.e. the remainder of the sentence. Such process continues until the translation provided satisfies the user. Although explained at the word level, the previous process may also be implemented at the character level, and hence the system provides a suffix whenever the human translator types in a single character. In addition, there is ongoing effort towards changing the typical left-to-right interaction scheme in order to make human-machine interaction easier. A similar approach is used in the Caitra translation tool.  Evaluation  Evaluation is a difficult issue in interactive machine translation. Ideally, evaluation should take place in experiments involving human users. However, given the high monetary cost this would imply, this is seldom the case. Moreover, even when considering human translators in order to perform a true evaluation of interactive machine translation techniques, it is not clear what should be measured in such experiments, since there are many different variables that should be taken into account and cannot be controlled, as is for instance the time the user takes in order to get used to the process. In the CASMACAT project, some field trials have been carried out to study some of these variables. For quick evaluations in laboratory conditions, interactive machine translation is measured by using the key stroke ratio or the word stroke ratio. Such criteria attempt to measure how many key-strokes or words did the user need to introduce before producing the final translated document.  Differences with classical computer-aided translation  Although interactive machine translation is a sub-field of computer-aided translation, the main attractive of the former with respect to the latter is the interactivity. In classical computer-aided translation, the translation system may suggest one translation hypothesis in the best case, and then the user is required to post-edit such hypothesis. In contrast, in interactive machine translation the system produces a new translation hypothesis each time the user interacts with the system, i.e. after each word (or letter) has been introduced.

As an accomplished draughtsman his work is noted for its intricate detail, which can be best seen in his landscapes views and street scenes, many of which were reproduced as designs for railway carriage prints and station billboard posters. thumb Kenneth Steel was born in Sheffield, England to G. T. Steel, an artist and silver engraver. His elder brother, George Hammond Steel (1900‚Äì1960) was a successful landscape painter. Both brothers studied at Sheffield College of Art under Anthony Betts. During the 1920s Kenneth Steel studied briefly under the landscape artist, Stanley Royle, throughout their careers both artists remained close friends. Kenneth Steel supported and encouraged fellow Sheffield etcher, Leonard Beaumont. During World War II, both his mother, Annie and wife, Olive died during 'the Sheffield Blitz', victims of German bombing raids on the city during December 1940. His house took a direct hit resulting in the loss of much his work, designs and etching plates. Throughout the 1940s he wrote several important articles on the art of etching for the London art journal, 'The Artist'. From his studio in Crookes, Sheffield, Steel produced much of his commercial work for several regional railway companies. His work is held by a number of public collections in Britain and Ireland; including the Waterford Municipal Art Collection where his watercolour \\"St Audeon's Church\\" can be seen in the Waterford Institute of Technology. In recent years, many of his works have been appeared at auction and his work has undergone a long over-due re-evaluation. Museums Sheffield hold a significant number of his etchings.

Part of this is due to design in the world which is often right-hand biased. Handwriting is one of the biggest sources of actual disadvantage for left-handed people, other than for those forced to work with certain machinery. About 90 percent of the world's population is right-handed, so many common articles are designed for efficient use by right- handed people, and may be inconvenient, painful, or even dangerous for left- handed people to use. These may include school desks, kitchen implements, and tools ranging from simple scissors to hazardous machinery such as power saws. Beyond being inherently disadvantaged by a right-handed bias in the design of tools, left-handed people have been subjected to deliberate discrimination and discouragement. In certain societies, they may be considered unlucky or even malicious by the right-handed majority. Many languages still contain references to left-handedness to convey awkwardness, dishonesty, stupidity, or other undesirable qualities. In many societies, left-handed people were historically (and in some cases still are) forced as children to use their right hands for tasks which they would naturally perform with the left, such as eating or writing. Favorable perceptions Lloque Yupanqui, the third Sapa Inca, whose name means \\"the glorified lefthander\\" Among Incas left- handers were called (and now are called among the indigenous peoples of the Andes) () which has positive value. Peoples of the Andes consider left-handers to possess special spiritual abilities, including magic and healing. The Third Sapa Inca‚ÄîLloque Yupanqui‚Äîwas left-handed. His name, when translated from Quechua, means \\"the glorified lefthander.\\" In tantra Buddhism, the left hand represents wisdom. In early Roman times, the left side retained a positive connotation, as the Augures proceeded from the eastern side. The negative meaning was subsequently borrowed into Latin from Greek, and ever since in all Roman languages. In Russian, \\"levsha\\" (lefty, lefthander) became a common noun for skilled craftsman, after the title character from \\"The Tale of Cross-eyed Lefty from Tula and the Steel Flea\\" written in 1881 by Nikolai Leskov. Unfavorable perceptions The unfavorable associations and connotations of the use of the left hand among cultures are varied. In some areas, in order to preserve cleanliness where sanitation was an issue, the right hand, as the dominant hand of most individuals, was used for eating, handling food, and social interactions. The left hand would then be used for personal hygiene, specifically after urination and defecation. Personal hygiene rules in Islam required this, as derived from hadith sources. These rules were imposed on all, no matter their dominant hand. Through these practices, the left hand became known as the \\"unclean\\" hand. Currently, amongst Muslims and in some societies including Nepal and India it is still customary to use the left hand for cleaning oneself with water after defecating. The right hand is commonly known in contradistinction from the left, as the hand used for eating. In many religions, including Christianity, the right hand of God is the favored hand. For example, Jesus sits at God's right side. God's left hand, however, is the hand of judgement. The Archangel Gabriel is sometimes called \\"God's left hand\\" and sits at God's left side. Those who fall from favor with God are sent to left, as described in Matthew 25: 32‚Äì33, in which sheep represent the righteous and goats represent the fallen: \\"And he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats. And he shall set the sheep on his right, but the goats on his left.\\" In 19th-century Europe, homosexuals were referred to as \\"left-handed\\". In Protestant-majority parts of the United Kingdom, Catholics were called \\"left-footers\\", and vice versa in Catholic-majority parts of Ireland and Irish America.; ; ; Black magic is sometimes referred to as the \\"left-hand path\\", which is strongly associated with Satanism. Various innocuous activities and experiences become rude or even signs of bad luck when the left hand becomes involved. In some parts of Scotland, it is considered bad luck to meet a left-handed person at the start of a journey. In Ghana, pointing, gesturing, giving or receiving items with the left hand is considered taboo or rude. A person giving directions will put their left hand behind them and even physically strain to point with their right hand if necessary. =Forced use of the right hand= Due to cultural and social pressures, many left-handed children were forced to write and perform other activities with their right hands. This conversion can cause multiple problems in the developing left-handed child, including learning disorders, dyslexia, stuttering and other speech disorders. Shifts from left- to right-handed are more likely to be successful than right to left, though neither have a high success rate to begin with. Successful shifters are more likely to become ambihanded than unsuccessful ones. Conversions can be successful with consistent daily practice in a variety of manual activities, but though activity in the non-dominant left-hemisphere of the brain will increase during tasks, so too will activity in the dominant right-hemisphere. Consistent left-handers have no higher activity in these task centers than converted left-handers, so it may be inferred that \\"attempts to switch handedness by educational training far from weakening the functional expression of lefthandedness in higher-order motor areas of the (dominant) right hemisphere in fact enhance it.\\" Many Asian countries force their children to become right-handed due to cultural perceptions of bad luck associated with the left hand. In India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Indonesia, it has traditionally been perceived as \\"rude\\" behaviour to use the left hand for eating. In a 2007 study in Taiwan, about 59.3% of children studied had been forced to convert from left-handedness to right-handedness. The study took into account economic status of the children's families and found that children whose parents had less education were more likely to be forced to convert. Even among children whose parents had higher levels of education, the conversion rate was 45.7%. Among naturally left-handed Japanese senior high school students, only 0.7% and 1.7% of individuals used their left hand for writing and eating, respectively, though young Japanese are more likely to convert to using chopsticks right-handed than forks or spoons (29.3% to 4.6%). The proportion of females subjected to forced conversion is significantly higher compared to males (95.1% to 81.0%). Malawians cite their views that \\"the left hand is less skilled and less powerful than the right one\\" as main reasons for forcing left-handers to convert. Among students, teachers and parents, 75% said the left hand should not be used to perform habitual activities, and 87.6% of these believed left-handers should be forced to switch dominant hands. Parents and close relatives are most responsible for impressing these beliefs upon their children. In the Soviet Union, all left- handed students were forced to write with their right hand in the soviet school system.–ê. –ü. –ß—É–ø—Ä–∏–∫–æ–≤, –í. –î. –ú–∏—à–∏–µ–≤. // –õ–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –Ω–∞—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –°–°–°–† –≤ –∫–æ–Ω—Ü–µ 70-—Ö –∏ –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–µ 80-—Ö –≥–æ–¥–æ–≤. –ö –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –ª–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–π –Ω–µ–π—Ä–æ–ø—Å–∏—Ö–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏–∏ –∏ –Ω–µ–π—Ä–æ–ø—Å–∏—Ö–∏–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–∏. –•—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–æ–º–∞—Ç–∏—è. –î–æ–Ω–µ—Ü–∫, 2010, 192 —Å.–ê. –ü. –ß—É–ø—Ä–∏–∫–æ–≤, –ï. –ê. –í–æ–ª–∫–æ–≤. // –ú–∏—Ä –ª–µ–≤–æ—Ä—É–∫–∏—Ö. –ö–∏–µ–≤. 2008. As a child British King George VI (1895-1952) was naturally left-handed. He was forced to write with his right hand, as was common practice at the time. He was not expected to become king, so that was not a factor. =Rise in acceptance of left-handedness= On March 8, 1971, The Florence Times‚ÄîTri-Cities Daily reported that left-handed people \\"are becoming increasingly accepted and enabled to find their right (or left) place in the world.\\" The Florence Times‚ÄîTri-Cities Daily also wrote \\"we still have a long way to go before the last vestiges of discrimination against left- handedness are uprooted, however.\\" The frequency of left-handed writing in the United States, which was only 2.1 percent in 1932, had risen to over 11 percent by 1972. According to an article by The Washington Post from August 13, 1979, a psychologist from University of Chicago named Jerre Levy said: \\"In 1939, 2 percent of the population wrote with the left hand. By 1946, it was up to 7 1/2 percent. In 1968, 9 percent. By 1972, 12 percent. It's leveling off, and I expect the real number of left-handers will turn out to be about 14 percent.\\" According to the article by The Washington Post from August 13, 1979, \\"a University of Michigan study points out that left-handers may not be taking over the world but...7 percent of the men and 6 percent of the women over 40 who were interviewed were lefties, but the percentages jumped to well above 10 percent in the 18-to-39 age group.\\" According to the article by The Washington Post from August 13, 1979, Dr. Bernard McKenna of the National Education Association said: \\"There was recognition by medical authorities that left-handedness was normal and that tying the hand up in a child often caused stuttering.\\" In Japan, Tokyo psychiatrist Soichi Hakozaki coped with such deep-seated discrimination against left-handed people that he wrote The World of Left-Handers. Hakozaki reported finding situations in which women were afraid their husbands would divorce them for being left-handed. According to the article by The Washington Post from August 13, 1979, an official at the Japanese Embassy said: \\"Before the war, there was discrimination against left- handers,\\" said the official at the Japanese Embassy. \\"Children were not trained to use their left hand while eating or writing. I used to throw a baseball left-handed, but my grandparents wanted me to throw right-handed. I can throw either way. Today, in some local areas, discrimination may still remain, but on the whole, it seems to be over. There are many left-handers in Japan.\\" In an article by The Washington Post from December 11, 1988, Richard M. Restak wrote that left-handedness became more accepted and people decided to leave southpaws alone and decided to quit working against left-handedness. In an article by The Gadsden Times from October 3, 1993, the newspaper mentioned a 5-year-old named Daniel, writing: \\"the advantage that little Daniel does have of going to school in the '90s is that he will be allowed to be left-hander. That wasn't always the case in years past.\\" In a 1998 survey, 24 percent of younger-generation left-handed people reported some attempts to switch their handedness. Equipment Left-handed (left) and right-handed scissors Kitchen knives: (1) symmetrical, (2) right-handed, (3) left-handed. Cross sections seen from the handle. Because most people are right-handed, most everyday items are mass-produced for ease of use with the right hand. Tools, game equipment, musical instruments and other items must be specially ordered for left-handed use, if they are even produced and are usually more expensive than their right-handed counterparts. At least one specialty store sells only left-handed items.Anything Left Handed =Household items= Right- handed tools can be difficult, uncomfortable, or dangerous for left-handed people to use. Scissors For example, (right-handed) scissors are arranged so that, in the right hand, fingers and thumb push the blades together laterally, creating the shearing action essential to scissors' utility. In the left hand, however, fingers and thumb tend to force right- handed blades apart, so that, rather than being sheared, the work-material is merely hacked, as by a knife, or slips between the blades uncut. Left-handers using right-handed scissors will often try to compensate by forcing the handles apart laterally, causing discomfort or injury to the first knuckle of the thumb. In addition, a right-handed person using right-handed scissors can easily see the cutting line, but for a left-handed user the upper blade obscures the view. Many scissors are offered as \\"ambidextrous\\" or \\"suitable for right- or left-handed use.\\" Typically, these are merely right-handed scissors with modified handles to permit use in the left hand with less discomfort, but because the blades are still arranged for right-handed use, they still won't perform quite as well in the left hand. Computer input devices Input devices for computers can present obstacles to left-handed operation if intended for right-handed use. Some computer set-ups have the mouse placed on the right side of the keyboard and unable to be repositioned to the left. The mouse itself is also sometimes shaped to fit the right hand better. The functions of mouse buttons, even on mice shaped to fit both hands, default to right-hand use. On two-button mice, the left button ‚Äîunder the index finger of a right-handed person‚Äî is the primary button, while the right button performs secondary functions. The on-screen pointers themselves are also configured for right-handed people. Most desktop operating systems allow a user to reverse the functionality of mouse buttons to accommodate left- handed use, but left-handed cursors sometimes need to be specially downloaded. Trackballs and trackpads are often shaped for right-handed use. Even with the ability to change the functionality of buttons, these devices may be difficult for left-handed use. For a left handed person there are computer mice designed for left handed use, but they are a much smaller segment of the marketplace. Video game controllers often have the action buttons on the right with the directional controls on the left. In first-person shooters, many games default to the right pointer-finger being used to fire, simulating a right-handed person pulling the trigger of the weapon. Certain systems' layouts, such as Nintendo's Wii U and 3DS, have games in which right-handed stylus use is assumed and can cause difficulty for left-handed players. A right-handed trackball is difficult to use with the left hand. Knives While European-style kitchen knives are usually symmetrical, Japanese kitchen knives have the cutting edge ground asymmetrically, having the cutting edge closer to the user's body with ratios ranging from 70‚Äì30 for the average chef's knife, to 90‚Äì10 for professional sushi chef knives; left-handed models are rare, and usually must be specially ordered or custom made. On the other hand, the majority of \\"flat ground\\" general-purpose knives typically have the cutting edge on the right, as with a left-handed knife, for aesthetic reasons rather than practical. Cameras One of the few cameras ever produced for left- handers was the half-frame Yashica Samurai. Cameras predominantly have the hand grip, shutter release, film wind lever and commonly used selection buttons, switches and dials controlled by the right hand. Lens controls (where present) tend to be accessible by either hand. When an unskilled left-handed person uses a right-handed camera the hand control can be less steady and hence produce camera shake leading to poorer pictures at low shutter speeds. =Musical instruments= Left-handed adaptations have even bridged the world of music. Left-handed string instruments are produced, including guitars and violins. Inverted trumpets are made, too. Although the trumpet's valves are normally designed to be operated with the right hand, the prevailing belief is that left-handed trumpeters are not at a significant disadvantage. The French horn, for example, is played with the left hand, yet most horn players are right-handed. Left handed drummers also set up drum kits the exact opposite to conventional right-handed setup (i.e. hi-hat on the right, bass pedal under the left foot, ride cymbal to the drummer's left, etc.). =Sports= A left- handed individual may be known as a southpaw, particularly in a sports context. It is widely accepted that the term originated in the United States, in the game of baseball. Ballparks are often designed so that batters are facing east, so that the afternoon or evening sun does not shine in their eyes. This means that left-handed pitchers are throwing with their south-side arm. The Oxford English Dictionary lists a non-baseball citation for \\"south paw\\", meaning a punch with the left hand, as early as 1848, just three years after the first organized baseball game, with the note \\"(orig. U.S., in Baseball).\\" A left-handed advantage in sports can be significant and even decisive, but this advantage usually results from a left-handed competitor's unshared familiarity with opposite-handed opponents. Baseball is an exception since batters, pitchers, and fielders in certain scenarios are physically advantaged or disadvantaged by their handedness. Some baseball players like Christian Yelich of the Milwaukee Brewers bat left-handed and throw right- handed. In baseball, due to the direction in which curveballs and sliders break, it is generally accepted that the pitcher has an advantage when his handedness is the same as the batter's, and the batter has an advantage when they are opposite. For this reason, many baseball teams include a left-handed specialist pitcher, who is brought into the game specifically to pitch to dangerous left-handed batters in crucial situations. A left-handed first baseman uses a more fluid motion to tag out a baserunner returning to first base during a pickoff attempt by the pitcher and has less difficulty avoiding baserunners while presenting their mitt as a target for other fielders to throw to. It is very uncommon to see a left-handed player playing any infield position other than pitcher or first basemen due to the clockwise flow of the game when throwing the ball around the bases. A fielder's handedness is either a physical advantage or hindrance for similar reasons throughout the infield positions, and left-handedness is not always the more desirable dexterousness. Left-handed bowlers are usually at an advantage during ten-pin bowling competition when hooking the ball into the pins from the left side of the lane. As there are fewer left-handed players, the lane's left side is not used as much, and thus the applied oil pattern does not change as quickly as it does for right-handed bowlers. In boxing, someone who boxes left-handed is frequently referred to as southpaw. The term is also used to refer to a stance in which the boxer places the right foot in front of the left, so it is possible for a right-handed boxer to box with a southpaw stance. Most boxers, southpaw or otherwise, tend to train with sparring partners who adopt an orthodox stance which gives southpaws an advantage, but some left-handed boxers such as Gerry Cooney and Oscar De La Hoya also used an orthodox stance, giving them other advantages. Manny Pacquiao is an example of a southpaw (although he writes with his right hand). In the popular boxing film series Rocky, the main character Rocky Balboa is a southpaw. Southpaw is also a term in professional wrestling, often giving them the advantage. Fencing weapons feature left- and right-handed grips, and a left-handed fencer's stance is opposite that of a right-handed opponent. Although commonly asserted that left-handed fencers have an advantage over right-handed opponents because the line of defence favors their sword arm, this assertion describes both fencers in a mixed-handed duel, so neither competitor has a unique physical advantage. Thus the left-hander's advantage in fencing stems mostly from a right-hander's unfamiliarity with a left-handed stance. The game of golf is most commonly played right-handed, and left-handed players typically must provide their own special golf clubs. The game can be played with both hands, provided the player has both left- and right-handed clubs, giving an advantage over one- handed players. Professional golfer Phil Mickelson plays left-handed though he is naturally right-handed. In tennis, southpaws hold the racket in their left hand. Because of this, their grip of the handle is supposedly adjusted in a slightly different style from right-handed players. Some world champion left- handed tennis players include Jimmy Connors, Guillermo Vilas, John McEnroe, Martina Navratilova, Marcelo R√≠os, Goran Ivani≈°eviƒá and Rafael Nadal. When playing volleyball, left-handed players are at an advantage when placed on the right wing to spike. This is because the ball does not travel over their head in order for them to hit the ball, and is therefore easier for a lefty to hit the ball. However, the reverse is true for the left wing. Right handed players are at an advantage on the left wing because the ball does not pass over their head while they are jumping to hit, therefore making it easier to contact the ball. Playing cards often have their pips printed only in the upper left corner assuming holding them with right hand. Such design may be uncomfortable for left-handed people who may prefer all four corners of the card to be used. =Weapons= US Navy SEALs left-handed shooter The vast majority of firearms are designed for right-handed shooters, with the operating handle, magazine release, or safety mechanisms set up for manipulation by the right hand, and fired cartridge cases ejected to the right. Also, scopes and sights may be mounted in such a way as to require the shooter to place the rifle against the right shoulder. A left-handed shooter must either purchase a left- handed or ambidextrous firearm (which are manufactured in smaller numbers and are generally more expensive and/or harder to obtain), shoot a right-handed gun left-handed (which presents certain difficulties, such as the controls being improperly located for the left hand or hot shell cases being ejected towards the shooter's body, especially the eyes or down the collar or right sleeve), or learn to shoot right-handed (which may be less comfortable or \\"natural\\"). A related issue is ocular dominance, due to which left-handed people may wish to shoot right-handed, and vice versa. Ocular dominance plays more of a role in shooting accuracy than does left versus right handiness. Therefore, ocular dominance will cause a preference on how a shooter chooses to hold a gun. Some modern firearms are ambidextrous (e.g. the FN P90 and Heckler & Koch P7), or can be converted between right- and left-handed operation (e.g. the Heckler & Koch G36 and Steyr AUG). Bullpup rifles are particularly problematic for left-handers unless they can be reconfigured, since empty shells would be ejected straight into the shooter's face and cheek potentially causing injury, or otherwise designed from the ground up for ambidextrous use, often by way of complex ejection systems as seen on the FN F2000 and the Kel-Tec RFB. The British L85 Assault Rifle must be fired right- handed, placing left-handed soldiers at a disadvantage. In contrast, the Steyr AUG is a modular design and the ejection port and extractor can be switched/replaced to suit the handedness of the soldier operating it. The M-16 and its variants have a fixed ejection port, but being a conventional design (i.e. not bullpup) the ejection port is forward of the operator and hence able to be fired either-handed. Circa 1985, with the introduction of the M16A2 version, a case deflector was incorporated adjacent to the ejector port to direct discarded shells in a more forward direction, making the rifle even more left hand operator friendly. The deflector is not always effective, however, as the ejected shell still stands a chance of hitting the left-handed shooter's cheek, especially in windy conditions. Lever action and pump action firearms present fewer difficulties for left-handers than bolt action weapons do. Many weapons with adjustable sights allow for left-handed use, but for a right eye dominant shooter it is necessary to adjust. In fact, most weapons adjust well enough that a weapon will not eject shells into a left-hander's eye. =Machinery= Power tools, machinery and other potentially dangerous equipment is typically manufactured with the right-handed user in mind. Common problems faced by left-handed operators include the inability to keep materials steady, and difficulty reaching the on/off switch, especially in emergency situations. Table saws, whose blades protrude from the top of a table and pose the risk of losing fingers or hands, have their cutting area on the right side. This makes it difficult for a left-handed operator to guide the material being cut, as it must be pushed to the right side to align with the fence to avoid kickback. On bandsaws, the blade teeth are on the left side of the blade, necessitating the material being cut to be pushed from the left side of the machine. However, at this angle, the casing of the machine containing the rest of the blade is on the operator's left side, making it extremely difficult to guide the wood with their left hand. Handheld circular saws are made almost exclusively for right-handers, with the motor and grip on the right side. If held in the left hand, it is impossible for the operator to see what they are cutting. Tool manufacturer Porter-Cable produces a left- handed circular saw that can be purchased relatively inexpensively. Language Historically, the left side, and subsequently left-handedness, was considered negative. The word \\"left\\" itself derives from the Anglo-Saxon word lyft, \\"weak\\". In Ancient Greek both words meaning \\"left\\" were euphemisms: the word ·ºÄœÅŒπœÉœÑŒµœÅœåœÇ, arister√≥s (the standard word in Modern Greek as well) is derived from ·ºÇœÅŒπœÉœÑŒøœÇ, √°ristos, \\"best\\", and the word Œµ·Ω∫œéŒΩœÖŒºŒøœÇ, eu≈çnymos, \\"of good name\\", is another euphemism used in lieu of \\"ill-named\\". The Latin adjective sinister/sinistra/sinistrum originally meant \\"left\\" but took on meanings of \\"evil\\" or \\"unlucky\\" by the Classical Latin era, and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin, and in the English word \\"sinister\\". Alternatively, sinister comes from the Latin word sinus meaning \\"pocket\\": a traditional Roman toga had only one pocket, located on the left side. The right hand has historically been associated with skill: the Latin word for right-handed is dexter, as in \\"dexterity\\", meaning manual skill. Even the word \\"ambidexterity\\" reflects the bias. Its intended meaning is \\"skillful on both sides\\". However, since it keeps the Latin root dexter, which means \\"right\\", it ends up conveying the idea of being \\"right-handed on both sides\\". This bias is also apparent in the lesser-known antonym \\"ambisinistrous\\", which means \\"left-handed [i.e., clumsy] on both sides\\". In more technical contexts, \\"sinistral\\" may be used in place of \\"left-handed\\" and \\"sinistrality\\" in place of \\"left-handedness\\". In both Ancient Greek and Roman religion, auspices (usually the flight paths of birds, as observed by a bird-diviner, or augur) were thought to be unfavorable if appearing on the diviner's left-hand side and favorable if on the right: an ancient custom mentioned in Homer's Iliad and of apparently Middle Eastern origin (as attested in the Amarna correspondence, in which a king of Alashiya, i.e. Cyprus, requests an eagle- diviner from the Pharaoh of Egypt). Meanings gradually developed from use of these terms in the ancient languages. In many modern European languages, including English, the word for the direction \\"right\\" also means \\"correct\\" or \\"proper\\", and also stands for authority and justice. In Sanskrit, the word \\"‡§µ‡§æ‡§Æ\\" (waama) stands for both \\"left\\" and \\"wicked\\". In most Slavic languages the root prav (right) is used in words carrying meanings of correctness or justice. In colloquial Russian the word –ª–µ–≤—ã–π (levyƒ≠) \\"left\\" means unofficial, counterfeit, strange. In Polish, the word prawo means \\"right\\" as well as \\"law\\", prawy means: lawful; the word lewy means \\"left\\" (opposite of right), and colloquially \\"illegal\\" (opposite of legal). The Czech slang term lev√°rna (roughly \\"left business\\") denotes a suspicious, shady scheme or trickery. In French, (cognate to English direct) means both \\"right\\" and \\"straight\\", as well as \\"law\\" and the legal sense of \\"right\\", while gauche means \\"left\\" and is also a synonym of maladroit, literally \\"not right\\", meaning \\"clumsy\\". Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and German have similar constructs. The Spanish term diestro and the Italian term destro mean both \\"right-handed\\" and \\"skillful\\". The contemporary Italian word sinistra has both meanings of sinister and left (the masculine adjective for sinister being sinistro), and maldestro means \\"clumsy\\". The Spanish siniestra has both, too, although the \\"left\\" meaning is less common and is usually expressed by izquierda, a Basque word that made its way into Portuguese as well. In some Spanish-speaking countries, to do something por izquierda means to engage in corrupt conduct or employ illegitimate means, whereas por derecha or a derechas means to do it the right (legitimate) way. Also, in Spanish, to tell someone \\"Eres tan zurdo\\" means that they are being clumsy, though the literal meaning is \\"You're so lefty.\\" In Portuguese, the most common word for left-handed person, canhoto, was once used to identify the devil, and canhestro, a related word, means \\"clumsy\\". In Vietnamese, the word for \\"right\\", ph·∫£i also means \\"correct\\" or \\"must\\". The word for \\"left\\" is tr√°i, which also mean \\"wrong\\", \\"opposite\\". For example, \\"m·∫∑c √°o tr√°i\\" means \\"wearing a shirt inside out\\", or \\"l√†m tr√°i √Ω\\" means going against someone's will. In Romanian drept/dreaptƒÉ (coming from Latin directus) means both \\"right\\" and \\"straight\\". The word for \\"left\\" is st√¢ng/st√¢ngƒÉ coming from Latin (= stanticus) meaning \\"tired\\". In German, recht means \\"right\\" in both the adjectival sense (correct) and the nominal (legal entitlement). The word for \\"left\\" is links, and is closely related to both link (underhand, questionable), and linkisch (clumsy).Die Deutsche Sprache, \\"link\\" (Berlin: Duden 2013). The Dutch words for \\"left\\" (links, linker) and \\"right\\" (recht, rechts, rechter) have much the same meanings and connotations as in English. The adjective link means \\"cunning, shifty\\" or \\"risky\\". A linkerd is a \\"crafty devil\\". To look at someone over the left shoulder (iemand over de linkerschouder aanzien) is to regard him or her as insignificant.W. Martin and G. A. J. Tops, eds., Van Dale groot woordenboek Nederlands-Engels, 2d ed. (Utrecht, Antwerp: Van Dale, 1991). In Irish, deas means \\"right side\\" and \\"nice\\". Ciot√≥g is the left hand and is related to ciotach meaning \\"awkward\\"; ciot√≥gach (kyut-OH-goch) is the term for left-handed. In Welsh, the word chwith means \\"left\\", but can also mean \\"strange\\", \\"awkward\\", or \\"wrong\\". The Scots term for left-handedness is corrie fistit. The term can be used to convey clumsiness. In Finnish, the word oikea means both \\"right\\" (okay, correct) and \\"right\\" (the opposite of left). In Swedish, att g√∂ra n√•got med v√§nsterhanden (literally \\"to do something with your left hand\\") means \\"to do something badly\\". In Swedish, v√§nster means \\"left\\". The term v√§nsterprassel means \\"infidelity\\", \\"adultery\\" and \\"cheating\\". From this term the verb v√§nstra is derived. In Hungarian, the word for right is jobb, which also means \\"better\\". The word for left is bal, which also means \\"bad\\". In Estonian, the word pahem stands for both \\"left\\" and \\"worse\\" and the word parem stands for both \\"right\\" and \\"better\\". In Turkish, the word for right is saƒü, which means \\"alive\\". The word for left is sol, which means \\"discolor\\", \\"die\\", \\"ill\\". In Chinese culture, the adjective \\"left\\" (Chinese character: , Mandarin: zu«í) sometimes means \\"improper\\" or \\"out of accord\\". For instance, the phrase \\"left path\\" (, zu«íd√†o) stands for unorthodox or immoral means. In Korean, the word for right is oreun (Ïò§Î•∏), to be compared to the word meaning morally proper, orheun (Ïò≥ÏùÄ) which shares the same pronunciation. In Hebrew, as well as in other ancient Semitic and Mesopotamian languages, the term \\"left\\" was a symbol of power or custody. There were also examples of left-handed assassins in the Old Testament (Ehud killing the Moabite king). The left hand symbolized the power to shame society, and was used as a metaphor for misfortune, natural evil, or punishment from the gods. This metaphor survived ancient culture and was integrated into mainstream Christianity by early Catholic theologians, such as Ambrose of Milan, to modern Protestant theologians, such as Karl Barth, to attribute natural evil to God in explaining God's omnipotence over the universe. =Expressions and colloquialisms= The left side is often associated with awkwardness and clumsiness. The Spanish expression \\"tener dos pies izquierdos\\", in English, the expression \\"to have two left feet\\", refers to clumsiness in the domains of football or dancing. A \\"left-handed compliment\\" is considered one that is unflattering or dismissive in meaning. The Polish expression \\"mieƒá dwie lewe rƒôce\\", Dutch \\"twee linkerhanden hebben\\", German \\"zwei linke H√§nde haben\\", the Bulgarian expression \\"dve levi ratse\\", French \\"avoir deux mains gauches\\", Hungarian k√©tbalkezes and Czech \\"M√≠t obƒõ ruce lev√©\\" all mean \\"to have two left hands\\"‚Äîthat one is clumsy or is a very poor handyman; the English equivalent is \\"to be all thumbs\\". Moreover, the German idiom \\"mit dem linken Fu√ü aufgestanden sein\\", the Spanish expression \\"levantarse con el pie izquierdo\\", the French expression \\"s'√™tre lev√© du pied gauche\\", the Polish expression \\"wstaƒá lewƒÖ nogƒÖ\\" and the Hungarian expression \\"bal l√°bbal kelt fel\\" (literally, to get up with the left foot) mean to have a bad day and do everything wrong or unsuccessfully, related to the English expression \\"to get up on the wrong side of the bed\\". The Welsh phrase \\"tu chwith allan\\" and the Polish expression \\"na lewƒÖ stronƒô\\" (left side out) refers to an object being inside-out. In Russian and Polish, the use of the term nalyevo (na lewo in Polish) means \\"on the left\\", but can also connote taking bribes or \\"sneaky\\" behavior. Balszerencse (lit. \\"left luck\\") is Hungarian for \\"bad luck\\". There are many colloquial terms used to refer to a left-handed person, e.g. \\"southpaw\\" (USA). Some are just slang or jargon words, while other references may be offensive or demeaning, either in context or in origin. In some parts of the English-speaking world, \\"cack-handed\\" is slang for left-handed, and is also used to mean clumsy. The origin of this term is disputed, but some suggest it is derived from the Latin cacare, in reference to the habit of performing ablutions with the left hand, leaving the right hand \\"clean\\". However, other sources suggest that it is derived from the Old Norse word keikr, meaning \\"bent backwards\\". Australians frequently use \\"cacky-handed\\". A less common Australian slang word for a left-handed individual is the term Molly-Dooker, whose origins cannot be determined with certainty. =Handwriting= Left-handed people who speak Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Hebrew or any other language that conventionally uses a right-to-left script do not have the same difficulties with writing. The right-to-left nature of these writing systems prevents left-handers from running their hand on the ink as happens with left-to-right languages. Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, it is considered easier to write the Latin alphabet with the right hand than with the left. Furthermore, it is considered more difficult to write legible Chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the person in question. Left- to-right alphabets can be written smudge-free and in proper \\"forward slant\\" with the left hand if the paper is turned turn clockwise (90 degrees to the right), and the left hand is drawn toward the body on forward strokes, and left to right on upward strokes (as expressed in directionality of the text). It is also possible to do calligraphy in this posture with the left hand, but using right-handed pen nibs. Otherwise, left-handed pen nibs are required in order to get the thick-to-thin stroke shapes correct for most type faces, and the left-handed calligrapher is very likely to smudge the text. Left-handed pen nibs are not generally easy to find, and strokes may have to be done backwards from traditional right-handed calligraphic work rules to avoid nib jamming and splatter. Left-handed people have an advantage in learning 19th- century copperplate hands, which control line-width by pressure on the point. Civic life =Schooling= Because almost all students in public schools are right-handed, most commonly used implements are designed for right- handers, from pencil sharpeners to scissors to desks. The consequences to left-handed students can vary from decreased academic performance or physical ailments to nothing at all. In many classrooms and lecture halls, desks are designed so that the writing surface is attached to the chair instead of separate from it. In this design, the desk is attached on the right side, offering an armrest for right-handed people to use while writing. In some of these desks, the writing surface does not extend fully to the left, necessitating a left-handed user to turn their body in order to write properly, sometimes causing back, neck and shoulder problems. This contorted posture may also cause the student to be accused of cheating. In some cases, however, large lecture halls will use left-handed desks on the left-most column of each section so that left-handed people can comfortably write without bumping against a neighbor. This right-handed bias is reflected in standardized tests as well. Multiple-choice tests tend to put the question on the left side of the page and the answers on the right side. If the answers must be filled in in a separate booklet, it can be awkward and uncomfortable for a left-handed student to line up the booklet with the answers. The time it takes to find a comfortable, convenient position cuts into test-taking time, resulting in rushed answers and unchecked work. In Vietnam, schools officially require students to write with their right hands, and some teachers of Grade 1 (when writing is taught) would implement that rule by deducting points from tests written by the left hand. The Civic Education textbook for grade 6 mentions a student thanking her old teacher for helping her write with her right hand, and stopping her from using her left hand to write. =Employment= In research done on the relations of handedness and employment, researchers may start their experiments believing left-handers earn lower wages than their right-handed counterparts, due to effects like difficulty using right-handed tools and increased risk of illness. However, their findings are more complex. In studies in the United States and United Kingdom, it was found that left-handed men earn more than right-handed men; about 5% more in the UK. Conversely, left-handed women earn about 7.5% less than right-handed women.

Albany opened one of the first commercial airports in the world, and the first municipal airport in the United States, in 1908. Originally located on a polo field on Loudon Road, it moved to Westerlo Island in 1909 and remained there until 1928. The Albany Municipal Airport‚Äîjointly owned by the city and county‚Äîwas moved to its current location in Colonie in 1928. In 1960, the mayor sold the city's stake in the airport to the county, citing budget issues. It was known from then on as Albany County Airport until a massive upgrade and modernization project between 1996 and 1998, when it was rechristened Albany International Airport. By 1916, portions of Albany's northern and southern borders had reached their modern courses; Westerlo Island, to the south, became the second-to-last annexation in 1926. Overview In 1901 as part of the Arbor Day celebration Dana Park is opened, where Delaware Avenue and Lark Street meet at Madison Avenue. Also in 1901 a strike occurred by the employees of the United Traction Company (UTC), which ran the inter-city and intra-city mass transit buses and trolleys. The strike begins on May 7, and on May 14 the governor sends the 10th Battalion and Third Signal Corps to keep order on the UTC's routes, the next day the 23rd Regiment of Brooklyn is sent as reinforcement and the city is placed under martial law. On May 16 a mob attacks one of the UTC cars on Broadway just north of Columbia Street. The 23rd Regiment opens fire and two are killed, the strike ends on May 19. Later in 1901 the local baseball team wins the State Pennant, they will win again in 1902. In 1902 Charles Gaus (Republican) becomes mayor of Albany after defeating General Amsaa Parker (Democrat) by 2,354 votes in the 1901 election. He is reelected over Colonel William Rice (Democrat) by 4,563 votes in the 1903 election, and in the 1905 election over Dr. William Wansboro by 8,536 votes. The Albany County Municipal Airport was the first municipal airport and Albany International Airport remains the oldest in the United States. In 1908 the airstrip was located on a former polo field on Loudonville Road, three miles (5 km) north of the city in the town of Colonie. In 1909 the airport was moved to Westerlo Island, which is in the city of Albany, but at that time was in the town of Bethlehem. The airport was named after Teddy Roosevelt's son, Quentin, a fighter pilot during World War I. A $10,000 prize was established for sustained flight between Albany and New York City; Glen Curtiss achieved this feat on May 29, 1910. Other early pioneers of aviation that stopped at this early field were Charles Lindbergh, Amelia Earhart, and James Doolittle. Mayor John Boyd Thacher II once said \\"a city without the foresight to build an airport for the new traffic may soon be left behind in the race for competition\\". He therefore decided to build in 1928 a new modern airport on the Shaker site near Albany-Shaker Road in Colonie, not far from the original polo fields used as the first site of the municipal airport. The Shakers not only sold the land used but also loaned the use of tractors and tools. Erastus Corning 2nd, Albany's longest-serving mayor and the longest- serving mayor of any American city, was elected in 1941 and began his tenure in 1942.

Didcott was known for his firm support of human rights during 23 years on the bench in and after the apartheid era.  Biography  Didcott was born on 14 August 1931 in Durban. After matriculating at Hilton College, near Pietermaritzburg in 1948 he went to the University of Cape Town (UCT) where he obtained a BA in 1951 and an LLB in 1953. At university he involved himself in student politics and gained a reputation as a powerful public speaker. He was twice elected president of the UCT Students' representative council and later became President of the National Union of South African Students. Didcott was a founder member of the Liberal Party of South Africa, which brought him to the attention of the security police. In 1953 he was awarded an Abe Bailey Travel Bursary to the United Kingdom. He was also a member of the team representing the International Student Conference, which visited universities in Southeast Asia for six months in 1955 and 1956. After graduating, Didcott was admitted to the Bar in Cape Town on 26 February 1954, but then joined the Cape Argus for a year as Supreme Court reporter. That experience alerted him to the difficulties and challenges faced by journalists and the media, and he was always an avid reader of newspapers, although often critical of their shortcomings. In July 1956 Didcott moved to Durban to set up chambers. Shortly thereafter (during the 1960 State of Emergency he was tipped off that the security police planned to detain him for his political activities, and he fled the country to Southern Rhodesia, where he spent some months as a prosecutor until it was safe to return. He returned to the Durban Bar where he built up a successful legal practice. He took silk (appointed a Senior Counsel) on 19 July 1967 and was Chairman of the Bar from 1973 to 1975. He served as an acting judge of the Natal Provincial Division in 1971 and again in 1975. In June 1975, at the comparatively young age of 44, he was invited to take an appointment as a judge. For someone with strong liberal principles it involved careful thought. He had to balance the problem of administering apartheid legislation with the possibility of making a difference on the Bench and somehow helping to alleviate the impact of unjust laws. Convinced of the useful contribution he could make, he accepted. However, his decision and that of like-minded judges -was publicly challenged some years later when Natal University law professor Raymond Wacks urged that all 'moral judges' should resign. Judge Didcott had no time for this view. In 1994 he became a member of the Special Electoral Court for South Africa's first fully democratic general election in 1994 and later that year he was appointed to the Constitutional Court.  Awards and honours  In April 1991, in recognition of his contribution to the University and of his attempts to promote justice in an unjust society, the University of Natal awarded the degree of Doctor of Laws, Honoris Causa to him. His contribution to law and society was also recognised by the University of Durban-Westville, which made him its Chancellor in 1989. He also received honorary degrees from the University of Cape Town and the University of the Witwatersrand. Didcott was also appointed as an honorary professor in the Department of Procedural and Clinical Law at the University of Natal in 1989. Judge Didcott served on the Constitutional Court from its inception in 1994 until his death in 1998. He died on 20 October 1998, after a battle with cancer.  Human rights  Didcott was the one judge on the South African bench who never sentenced anybody to death. When asked how he could maintain that record, he said he always found a reason, questioned further on if he was not able to find a reason, he responded, 'Then I'd resign.' Prof. Jack Greenberg of Columbia Law School, an authority on civil rights law, said  The rights of an accused to legal representation  In S v Khanyile and Another 1988 (3) SA 795 (N), Didcott (sitting with Friedman) considered the rights of an accused to legal representation and emphasised the role of the Bench in assessing the totality of circumstances to decide if gross unfairness would result if an accused is not represented. The judgment went as far as to say that if the judge concluded that a trial without representation would be grossly unfair, he should refer the case at once to those administering the legal aid scheme or similar organisation and should refuse to proceed with the trial until representation was procured. In S v Mthwana 1989 (4) SA 361 (N) a full bench (consisting of Howard JP, Booysen and JH Combrink JJ) of the division criticised and effectively overruled the decision in Khanyile, which had already been criticised in other divisions. The Appellate Division sided with Mthwana. Didcott, sitting in the Constitutional Court in S v Vermaas; S v Du Plessis 1995 (3) SA 292 (CC), had the last word in holding that the controversy 'has been settled decisively by our new Constitution, the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Act 200 of 1993, s 25(3)(e)' that essentially codified the principles advanced in Khanyile.  Justice and morality  Under the apartheid system the law had become a corrupt system. The legal system in South Africa had been in the great tradition, with its roots in Roman-Dutch law and the common law of England. But when the National Party (South Africa) won power in 1948, it quickly began to distort the system to formalise racial discrimination and entrench itself in power. A judgement by Didcott shows he was a man of compassion, with a true sense of justice.re Dube, Natal Provincial Div., Didcott, J. and Milne, J. concurring (1 May 1979)  Publications    Notes   References  = Monographs =   = Journal articles =  = News articles = * = Websites =  Category:1931 births Category:1998 deaths Category:Judges of the Constitutional Court of South Africa Category:South African judges Category:People from Durban Category:South African people of British descent Category:20th-century South African lawyers Category:South African Senior Counsel ","title":"John Didcott"},{"id":"30533854","text":"The history of Albany, New York from 1942 to 1983 begins with the beginning of the tenure of Erastus Corning 2nd as mayor and ends with Corning's death in 1983.

During the 1950s and 1960s, a time when federal aid for urban renewal was plentiful, Albany did not see much progress in either commerce or infrastructure. It lost more than 20 percent of its population during the Corning years, and most of the downtown businesses moved to the suburbs.Grondahl (2007), p. 492 While cities across the country experienced similar issues, the problems were magnified in Albany: interference from the Democratic political machine hindered progress considerably. Governor Nelson Rockefeller (1959‚Äì1973) (R), who had a preference for grandiose, monumental architecture and large, government-sponsored building projects, was the driving force behind the construction of the Empire State Plaza, SUNY Albany's uptown campus, and much of the W. Averell Harriman State Office Building Campus.Grondahl (2007), p. 501 Albany County Republican Chairman Joseph C. Frangella once quipped, \\"Governor Rockefeller was the best mayor Albany ever had.\\"Grondahl (2007), p. 502 Corning, though opposed to the project, was responsible for negotiating the payment plan for the Empire State Plaza. Rockefeller did not want to be limited by the Legislature's power of the purse, so Corning devised a plan to have the county pay for the construction and have the state sign a lease- ownership agreement. The state would pay off the bonds until 2004. It was Rockefeller's only viable option, and he agreed. Due to the clout Corning gained from the situation, he was able to get the State Museum, a convention center, and a restaurant, back in the plans‚Äîideas that Rockefeller had originally vetoed. The county gained $35 million in fees and the city received $13 million for lost tax revenue.Grondahl (2007), pp. 467‚Äì469 Another major project of the 1960s and 1970s was Interstate 787 and the South Mall Arterial. Construction began in the early 1960s. One of the project's main consequences was separating the city from the Hudson River. Corning is sometimes called shortsighted with respect to use of the waterfront, as he could have used his influence to change the location of I-787, which now cuts the city off from \\"its whole raison d'√™tre\\".Grondahl (2007), p. 498 Much of the original plan never came to fruition, however: Rockefeller had wanted the South Mall Arterial to pass through the Empire State Plaza. The project would have required an underground trumpet interchange below Washington Park, connecting to the (eventually cancelled) Mid-Crosstown Arterial. To this day, evidence of the original plan is still visible. In 1967 the hamlet of Karlsfeld became the last annexation to be added to the city limits, having come from Bethlehem.

In addition to teaching areas (classrooms, lecture halls and auditoriums), the FCSH/NOVA also has various spaces for socialization, a printing centre and a large courtyard. To solve logistical issues created by recent growth, new facilities are scheduled for the FCSH/NOVA in the plans of the Campolide Campus, where other Faculties of the Universidade NOVA de Lisboa (NOVA) are already installed, such as the Faculdade de Economia (FE), the Faculdade de Direito (FD) and the Instituto Superior de Estat√≠stica e Gest√£o de Informa√ß√£o (ISEGI). The Rectory of NOVA and the University residence Alfredo de Sousa are also located in the Campolide Campus.

The development of this mission is secured by the faculty members associated each Department - tenured and visiting - supported by a secretariat. The coordination of each department is taken up by a Coordinator appointed by the Dean from the tenured faculty members.Articles 24 and 25 of the Statutes of FCSH  Research Centres  ID building houses the FCSH research centres FCSH houses a total of 16 Research Centres, whose primary mission is the development of scientific research in different cultural areas of the social sciences and humanities, the education of researchers and the rendering of services to the community. The Faculty is the only higher education institution in the Social Sciences and Humanities field with its own facilities dedicated to research centres and to PhD‚Äôs (ID building), strengthening the desired association between research and PhD programmes. Out of the 16 research centers, 13 were evaluated by international panels of FCT/MCTES - four with an \\"Excellent\\" grade and eight with a \\"Very Good\\" grade - launching the FCSH to a position of great importance in the national University panorama. Taken together, these centres captured 1.4 million Speech by Professor Jo√£o S√†√°gua, Dean of FCSH at the 32nd anniversary of the Faculty, April 28, 2010 in funding in 2009.  Study Cycles  Today, the FCSH is the second largest unit of NOVA, both in student numbers, and in financial budget. It has more than 300 faculty members, almost all of them holding a PhD degree or with recognized prestige in their scientific area. It also has about 100 staff members. During the academic year 2015/16, the Faculty admitted a total of 4725 students, 2587 undergraduate, 1488 masters and 650 students for doctoral programs. The FCSH teaching programme for the academic year 2016/2017 includes 14 undergraduate degrees, 46 masters programs and 28 PhD‚Äôs, the latter two being exclusively developed during a night schedule. The study cycle cover the traditionalSocial Sciences and Humanities fields, but also several thematic and interdisciplinary courses. In addition to a Summer School, the FCSH/NOVA also offers specialization degrees, free courses and, since 1997, a programme on Portuguese Language and Culture. This program is structured according to the six proficiency levels of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages. It can be intensive (30 hours - 5 times per week), a semester (64 hours two times per week) or taught individually. Annually, more than 400 students participate in the Mobility Programmes, of which the Erasmus Programme is the best known example. This is one of the examples of the FCSH/NOVA‚Äôs internationalization strategy. The BMSC is also a deposit for private donations given by inheritors of former teachers of FCSH: The Leonor Buescu Library (BLB) - 3000 volumes of broad scope, with greater relevance to the area of Linguistics and English Literature; the Luis Krus Library (BLK) - 2200 volumes on Portuguese and European Medieval History, Anthropology and Sociology; the Ant√≥nio G. Mattoso Library (BM) - 8500 books of broader scope, with particular importance to the field of History, and the M√°rio Sottomayor Cardia Library (BMSC) ‚Äì 70000 volumes, still not fully treated, that deal with issues of a general nature, with a particular emphasis on Philosophy and Political Science.

When Corning died in 1983, Thomas Whalen assumed the mayorship and was reelected twice. Albany saw a significant influx of federal dollars earmarked for restoring historic structures. What Corning had saved from destruction, Whalen refurbished.McEneny (2006), p. 191 The Mayor's Office of Special Events was created in an effort to increase the number of festivals and artistic events in the city, including a year-long Dongan Charter tricentennial celebration in 1986.McEneny (2006), p. 192 Whalen is credited for an \\"unparalleled cycle of commercial investment and development\\" in Albany due to his \\"aggressive business development programs\\". Prior to the recession of the 1990s, Albany was home to two Fortune 500 companies: KeyBank and Fleet Bank; both have since moved or merged with other banks.McEneny (2006), p. 193 Albany saw its political climate change after the death of Corning and the retirement of Congressman Sam Stratton. Long-term office holders became a thing of the past in the 1980s. Local media began following the drama surrounding county politics (specifically that of the newly created county executive position); the loss of Corning (and eventually the machine) led to a lack of interest in city politics.McEneny (2006), pp. 193‚Äì194 The 1990s brought about the surprise election of Gerald Jennings, who has been mayor since 1994. His tenure has essentially ended the political machine that had been in place since the 1920s.McEneny (2006), p. 198 During the 1990s, the State Legislature approved the $234 million \\"Albany Plan\\", \\"a building and renovation project [that] was the most ambitious building project to effect the area since the Rockefeller era.\\" The Albany Plan saw the initiation of renovation and new building projects around the downtown area, and the move of many state workers from the Harriman State Office Campus to downtown.McEneny (2006), p. 201 The late first decade of the 21st century saw a real possibility for a long-discussed and controversial Albany Convention Center; as of August 2010, the Albany Convention Center Authority had already purchased 75% of the land needed to build the downtown project.

On March 9, 2011, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) arrested Kevin William Harpham, 36, of Addy, Washington, a white supremacist who acted alone (a \\"lone wolf\\"). On December 20, 2011, he was sentenced to 32 years in prison for the attempted bombing. Bomb plot and discovery The bomb had a \\"welded blast plate\\" and it also contained shrapnel, specifically 128 quarter-ounce fishing weights, laced with brodifacoum, an anticoagulant rat poison, which prevents bleeding wounds from coagulating; it also contained human feces which causes infections.Thomas Clouse, Investigation of Kevin Harpham‚Äôs 2011 planned MLK March bombing in Spokane turned terrorism into an FBI case study, The Spokesman-Review (January 15, 2017).Nicholas K. Geranios, Sealed documents released in Harpham case, Associated Press (November 23, 2011). The pipe bomb was viable and designed to be directional, which means that it was crafted to spray shrapnel into the street where the parade marchers would pass through; had it exploded, the bomb could have caused multiple casualties. According to the FBI, the bombing may have been racially motivated, and its timing was likely not a coincidence. The New York Times said that the bomb had been reported to police at roughly 9:25 a.m. that morning. The bomb was found in a backpack that also contained two T-shirts. One of the shirts mentioned a rally against cancer in Stevens County, Washington, while the other mentioned a 2009 play put on by students at Chewelah, Washington high school (also in Stevens County). The backpack with visible wires was noticed by three parade workers on a bench in downtown Spokane, about a half-hour before the parade was set to begin. Police sent bomb-sniffing dogs, a robot, and specially trained officers to the location where the bomb was found. After the bomb was defused by the local Spokane County sheriff's bomb squad, the backpack was sent to the FBI Laboratory in Quantico, Virginia for further analysis. The parade was quickly rerouted. Arrest, conviction, and sentence of perpetrator The FBI offered a $20,000 reward for any information leading to the capture of those responsible. On March 9, 2011, the FBI arrested white supremacist and separatist Kevin William Harpham, 36, of Addy, Washington, in connection with the bombing attempt. Harpham was a \\"lone wolf\\" who acted alone. Harpham was a fire support specialist in the U.S. Army from 1996 to 1999, and later he was a member of the racist National Alliance movement and a contributor to its website/magazine Vanguard News Network, where he posted more than a thousand articles which espoused racism and antisemitism. Harpham was identified as the perpetrator based on evidence which was primarily collected during a forensic examination of the bomb and backpack, which contained body hair and several individuals' DNA, including DNA which was matched to the DNA sample that Harpham had given to the Armed Forces Repository of Specimen Samples for the Identification of Remains when he was in the U.S. Army. Investigators were then able to match the purchase of bomb components to Harpham's purchases in the Colville, Washington area. On May 3, 2011, Harpham's lawyers requested a four-month delay in his federal trial for attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, contending that Harpham faced life in prison if he were convicted of the charge and they also stated that they would need more time to prepare for the trial. Harpham pleaded not guilty, and he remained in jail without bail since the time of his arrest. On May 20, 2011, U.S. District Judge Justin Quackenbush agreed to delay Harpham's trial until August 22, 2011. On September 14, 2011, Harpham pleaded guilty to setting the device, admitted to attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and hate crimes.Kip Hill, Harpham loses latest appeal, Spokesman-Review (Augst 3, 2015). On December 20, 2011, hours before he was due to be sentenced, Harpham tried to withdraw his guilty plea, claiming that the device in his backpack didn't meet the legal definition of a bomb. After rejecting the request and expressing disbelief at Harpham's claim that the device was not intended to hit parade-goers, Quackenbush sentenced him to 32 years in prison, followed by supervised release for life. He will also be required to complete counselling. His appeals were rejected. Harpham is imprisoned at United States Penitentiary, Lompoc in Lompoc, California; he is scheduled for release in 2039.

He was one of the \\"Four Mohawk Kings\\" who went to London in 1710 to meet with Queen Anne and her court to mark a treaty with her. The chiefs requested the Queen's help in controlling French influence in New York and asked for English missionaries to help their people offset French Catholic influence. The Mohawk diplomacy helped the Iroquois preserve their power through the colonial years. Early life and education Tejonihokarawa was born into the Wolf Clan of his mother; the Mohawk and all Iroquoian nations had a matrilineal kinship system, in which descent and social status were passed through the maternal line.Barbara J. Sivertsen, Turtles, Wolves, and Bears: A Mohawk Family History (1996), genealogy, reprint Heritage Books, 2007 The English translation of his name is \\"open the door\\", suggesting he may have had the responsibility for opening the longhouse door to receive visitors. He was given the name Hendrick Peters in July 1690 when he was baptized by Godfridius Dellius as a Christian and member of the Dutch Reformed Church. According to the anthropologist Dean Snow, Peters later became a Protestant preacher. He lived in the lower Mohawk village known as Tionondoroge, along the Mohawk River. The English built Fort Hunter here, where Schoharie Creek entered the Mohawk River. Career By 1710 Tejonihokarawa may have been selected as one of three Wolf Clan sachems, with the title Sharenhowaneh. The sachems were chosen by the women elders of the clan.Snow, Dean R. \\"Searching for Hendrick: Correction of a Historic Conflation\\" , New York History, Summer 2007, accessed 8 October 2011 His actions helped build the alliance with the English and preserve the Iroquois Confederacy as a key power to be reckoned with in North America in the early 18th century. He met with English leaders at Albany to preserve Mohawk territory to the west throughout the Mohawk River Valley. Other nations of the Iroquois had territories to the west and north of there, closer to the Great Lakes. He and two other Mohawk chiefs, in addition to a Mahican chief, sailed to London in 1710 to meet with Queen Anne and her court, to mark a treaty. While in London, Tejonihokarawa requested Anglican missionaries to help offset French Catholic influence in Iroquois territory. After the French severely damaged Mohawk villages in 1666, they had forced the people to accept Catholic Jesuits as missionaries. The Jesuits soon set up a base near what later developed as Auriesville, New York, a few miles west of Schoharie Creek. They had been working to recruit Mohawk converts in present- day New York. Numerous converted Mohawk had migrated to the St. Lawrence River area, settling at the mission village of Kahnewake south of Montreal. Queen Anne sent Anglican missionaries to the New York Colony in 1711, who established a mission and chapel at Fort Hunter. The nearby Mohawk village became largely Christianized within years. In turn, Queen Anne had asked Tejonihokarawa for help in resettling Palatine German refugees in New York. They had been working at English camps in the Hudson Valley to pay off their passage to the colony and wanted their own lands. Through Governor Hunter, Tejonihokarawa offered Mohawk land in his territory to the refugees, some of whom took land near Schoharie Creek. Tejonihokarawa was deposed by Wolf Clan matrons in the winter of 1712-1713, apparently because of differences with the missionaries. By 1720 he had been restored to power, as he was noted as sachem in colonial records. In 1723, a group of 100 Germans were given grants of Mohawk land west of present-day Little Falls, in what is now known as the Burnetsfield Patent in the Mohawk Valley, on both sides of the river. They started other settlements as well. This area was upriver and west of existing Dutch and English settlements, as well as the upper Mohawk village of Canajoharie. Tejonihokarawa also traveled to northern New England, trying to build alliances with the Abenaki there, but he was prevented from meeting with them. They had frequently allied with the French in this period. Until Barbara Sivertsen's work published in 1996, biographical details concerning Tejonihokarawa, or King Hendrick, have frequently been confused with the similarly named Hendrick Theyanoguin, who was three decades younger.
