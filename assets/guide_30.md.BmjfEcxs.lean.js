It stars Ahmed Ali and Hania Amir as leads. The script was written by Mansoor Saeed and directed by Mohsin Mirza. The show was dubbed in Pashto under the title ÿ®€åÿß⁄æÿ∫€Å ŸÖ€åŸÜ€Å and aired on Hum Pashto 1. Plot  The story begins with two brothers Ashar, the elder, and Yasir, the younger. They are married to two sisters with Yasir being married to the elder, Ramsha, and Ashar being married to the younger, Samra. Samra is pregnant and the couple already has a daughter named Alishba. Ramsha and Yasir share a son, Waleed. Living with them is the head of the household known as 'Dadi' by everyone. Raffiq is the family's servant who takes care of everything and is treated like a member of the family. He is especially close to Alishba who won't eat from anyone else's hand. At the time of Samra's baby shower, Raffiq brings along his pregnant wife and son on the instructions of Dadi. When Dadi begins the traditions on Raffiq's wife, Samra comes in and throws a fit that it's her baby shower. She is disgusted that a mere servant took her place. Due to her fit, Ashar has an argument with her telling her that if she acts so high and mighty over the servants, someday she will crash to the ground. The next day, it is raining heavily and Samra faces contractions. She refuses to go to the hospital with anyone aside from Ashar. In his haste to get to her, Ashar crashes into Raffiq's pregnant wife and son, killing them. He leaves in panic and arrives at the hospital to find his unborn child has also died. The family is hit with tragedy. A few days later, unable to bear the guilt, Ashar tells Yasir of the crime he committed. Raffiq overhears and in an act of revenge, kidnaps Alishba and takes her to some unknown village. Due to the shock, Samra is paralyzed from the waist-down. FIFTEEN YEARS LATER . . . Raffiq has raised Alishba as his own daughter along with a woman (Hamda Kaki) he calls his \\"sister\\". Alishba is now known as Alina. Raffiq is severely ill and the doctors suggest for him to go to Karachi to which he eventually agrees. On the other side, the family is preparing for Waleed's return from the US and his engagement to Sana. The two are shown as workaholics. Sana is especially rude to all of Waleed's family members which eventually leads to Waleed distancing himself from her. To earn some money for her father's (Raffiq) operation, Alishba begins working at her old house without knowing that she is their long-lost daughter. Eventually, the truth comes out and Raffiq begs for forgiveness after which he passes away from throat cancer. Alishba is re- introduced into the family and Samra, who was previously depressed, learns to live again. Alishba takes a while to adjust to her new life. Sana's mother isn't happy with the marriage causing them to move it up from one year to twenty days. During this time, Waleed's childhood friend, Sheheryar, comes along. He's shown as the opposite of Waleed, being lively and funny. Alishba and him get along and eventually Sheheryar falls in love with her. Dadi figures it out and arranges for the two to get married on the same day as Sana and Waleed. Waleed is facing a difficult time with Sana who is rude and stubborn. In the twenty-day gap between his marriage, he realizes that he is also in love with Alishba, much to the joy of Samra who has held on to Ramsha's promise that their children would marry one day. Waleed confesses his love for Alishba in front of Sana, her mother, Alishba and her father. Sana is upset and leaves at that moment regardless of it being only a night before their marriage. Alishba is distraught that Waleed would do this to her when she is supposed to marry Sheheryar. She refuses to marry Waleed but Sheheryar, who is under the misunderstanding that the entire household wants Waleed and Alishba to marry, leaves that night. In the morning, Samra convinces Alishba to marry Waleed and they do so. Ramsha is very angry throughout since she still does not believe that Alishba is actually Samra's daughter. Initially, Alishba is not happy with Waleed since he broke her marriage causing people to doubt her honor. Ramsha adds fuel to the fire in attempt to break the two up. However, Samra continuously tells Alishba that Waleed loves her endlessly and that it would be foolish of her to not see that. Alishba finally decides to forget Sheheryar and move on with Waleed. The two fall in love, with Alishba confessing it in front of their family. At this point, Sana returns with the aid of Ramsha. She's gone insane for Waleed and will do anything to gain him, including framing Hamda Kaki for thievery. She attempts suicide when Waleed doesn't talk to her and in order to prevent her from doing so again, he agrees to talk to her at night only. When Alishba asks, he says he's talking to a 'Canadian client'. When Ashar and Yasir wonder who this client is, Alishba grows suspicious. Alishba discovers she's pregnant and the whole family is overjoyed. Waleed tells Sana to forget him since he now has his own family. Sana is about the leave when Ramsha stops her and tells her to wait for a few more days. She clearly has a trick up her sleeves. A man is constantly calling Waleed, asking for his wife named \\"Hina\\". Waleed denies knowing her and the man, Rehmat, claims that Alishba is actually Hina and that she only married Waleed for his wealth. The entire family grows suspicious of Alishba's true identity and a DNA test is demanded to which Alishba refuses. This causes Waleed to doubt his wife. Alishba calls Hamda Kaki to back her story that she truly is Alishba. During this time, she also goes to meet Rehmat to demand why he would play such a sick joke on her when she doesn't even know who he is. Waleed sees the two together and confronts Alishba, accusing her of being Hina and lying to him. Hamda Kaki comes along and confirms that Alishba is in fact, only Alishba and that this Hina story is a fraud. Alishba, seeing how the family has doubted her (everyone except Samra believes that she is Hina), leaves with Hamda Kaki. She wants a divorce from Waleed but when the time comes, she cannot go through with it. On the other end, Waleed has been pressurized to believe that Alishba has lied to him all this time. In attempt to get over her, he accepts to marry Sana, much to her happiness and his mother's satisfaction. During the wedding preparations, Waleed and Sana go to the mall where Sana sees Rehmat along with a woman and son. She contacts the woman and finds out that she is Rehmat's wife. On the day of Sana's nikkah with Waleed, Sana calls the woman and has her speak the truth in front of everyone. Ashar and Yasir also drag Rehmat inside who admits that he was paid by Ramsha to pretend that Alishba was Hina. The marriage breaks off for a second time and Waleed is angry at himself for not believing Alishba. When the entire family encourages him to go get her back, including Sana, Ramsha threatens that she'll kill herself if he does. Waleed walks away and she shoots herself, damaging her brain and paralyzing herself. At that time, Alishba goes into labor and Hamda Kaki is informed that they need more money for the operation. She calls Waleed who rushes to help his wife. Alishba gives birth to a son. Waleed begs for her forgiveness and she agrees. The family is reunited. A few days later, they plan on naming the baby. Alishba says Ramsha has a right to do so and Ramsha chooses the name 'Waqas'.

After recording one minor win as a two- year-old she reached her peak in the spring and summer of the following year, taking major prizes in the Irish 1000 Guineas and the Coronation Stakes. At the end of the year she was rated the best three-year-old filly trained in Britain. After the end of her racing career she became a successful broodmare whose foals had great success in Japan. Background Katies was a \\"big, rangy\\" bay or brown mare with a narrow white blaze bred in Ireland by Mareco Ltd. As a yearling she was sold at auction for 11,000 guineas and sent into training with Mick Ryan. Katies' sire Nonoalco won the 2000 Guineas and the Prix Jacques Le Marois in 1974 and stood as a breeding stallion in Europe (siring Noalcoholic) before being exported to Japan. Her dam Mortefontaine was a winner of one minor race in France, a full-sister to the Nunthorpe Stakes winner Polyfoto and closely related to the dual Cambridgeshire Handicap winner Baronet. Apart from Katies she produced Millfontaine who won the Extel Handicap and the Winter Hill Stakes in 1983. Racing career =1983: two- year-old season= Despite finishing unplaced over six furlongs on her racecourse debut, Katies then started at odds of 10/11 for a maiden race over seven and a half furlongs at Lingfield Park in October. She won by a length from the Geoff Wragg-trained Dusty Letter with the first two coming home well clear of the other eighteen runners. Later that month, on her only subsequent start of the year she finished unplaced in a race at Newbury. =1984: three- year-old season= Katies finished unplaced on her first appearance as a three-year-old and then defeated the Henry Cecil-trained Ophrys by half a length in a minor race over seve furlongs at Leicester Racecourse in April. Later that month she finished third behind Kanz and Triagonal when moved up in class and distance for the Princess Elizabeth Stakes over eight and a half furlongs at Epsom Racecourse. She had looked likely to win the race before hanging badly to the right in the closings tages and was reported to have sustained a minor leg injury during the contest. Shortly after her defeat at Epsom she was bought for a reported ¬£500,000 by Terry Ramsden. In May Katies was sent to Ireland and started at odds of 20/1 in a twenty-three runner field for the Irish 1000 Guineas over one mile at the Curragh in which she was ridden by Philip Robinson. After turning into the straight just behind the leaders she went to the front a quarter of a mile from the finish and accelerated two lengths clear of her rivals. She came under pressure in the closing stages but held on to win narrowly from Alianna, So Fine and Lady of the House, with Desirable in fifth, the favourite Masarika (Poule d'Essai des Pouliches) in sixth and the future Irish Oaks winner Princess Pati in seventh place. Robinson later commented that Katies might have won more easily had he not sent her to the front so early. In June Katies was matched against the English 1000 Guineas winner Pebbles in the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot. Robinson was given the choice between the two Guineas winners and opted to partner Katies. The betting suggested that he had made the wrong choice as Pebbles started favourite ahead of Leipzig (runner-up in the Nell Gwyn Stakes) and So Fine with Katies going off the 11/2 fourth choice. The other runners included L'Orangerie (Prix Imprudence), Lady of the House and Desirable. Robinson settled his mount behind the leaders as Leipzig set a strong pace, and then moved up into second place behind Pebbles with two furlongs left to run. The two Guineas winners quickly drew away from the field with Katies proving the stronger, taking the lead inside the finsl furlong and winning by a length. There was a gap of five and a half lengths back to So Fine who took third place ahead of Desirable. Katies started odds-on favourite for the Child Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse in July but was beaten into second place by the 1000 Guineas runner-up Meis-El-Reem, to whom she was conceding six pounds in weight. On her final appearance of the season, Katies was matched against older horses and male opposition in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot Racecourse in September. Chief Singer started favourite with Katies the joint- second choice alongside the four-year-old gelding Teleprompter. She produced a strong finish but failed by a neck to overhaul Teleprompter having been slightly hampered by the winner in the closing stages. Philip Robinson lodged an objection but the result was allowed to stand by the racecourse stewards. At the Goffs sale in November Katies was put up for sale but was withdrawn by her vendor after the bidding had reached 2,800,000 guineas. Assessment In their annual Racehorses of 1983 the independent Timeform organization gave her a rating of 85, making her more than thirty pounds inferior to the best fillies of her generation while commenting that she would \\"stay 1m\\". In the official International Classification for 1984 Katies was give a rating of 84, making her the second best three-year-old filly in Europe behind Northern Trick and the best filly of her generation trained in Britain. Timeform rated her on 126, five pounds behind Northern Trick and two pounds ahead of Pebbles. Breeding record Katies was retired from racing to become a broodmare. Although she was based in the United States for the rest of her life, her stock were most successful in Japan. She was sold twice at auction, fetching $1,000,000 in 1989 and $625,000 in 1998. She produced at least fourteen foals and eleven winners between 1987 and 2004: *Katies First, a bay filly, foaled in 1987, sired by Kris.

As a racially hybrid community, the prazeros signified not only a merge of cultures, but an emergence of a new socio-political order. The Zambezi valley The Zambezi valley became a topic of interest to the Portuguese as early as 1505,Shillington, K. (2012). History of Africa: Third Edition. London, UK: Palgrave MacMillan and later became the main trading initiative taken by the Prazeros and their armies. By the mid-16th century, the Portuguese crown had established minuscule administration centres, which in turn prompted a small but sustainable migration pattern from Portugal to the valley.Shillington, K. (2012). History of Africa: Third Edition. London, UK: Palgrave MacMillan By the next century, the Portuguese government grew weary in the status of the Zambezi Valley. With no formation of a well-trained administration bureaucracy, and a military that was small in numbers and underdeveloped in both military tactics and combat training, the region had no hope of effectively integrating into the colonial empire of the Portuguese. Establishment of the Prazero community The first influx of Portuguese migration to the Zambezi Valley (beginning in the sixteenth century) consisted of prestigious Portuguese individuals and families, many of whom were awarded with estates as recognition for social standing, along with royal agents to the crown who had performed elite tasks on its behalf. Such individuals included priests, merchants, and former military officers, who enjoyed a monopoly of power, wealth and prestige; all of whom were profoundly committed to the king and nation, and regarded themselves as representatives sent to expand the majesty of Portugal.Isaacman, A. & Isaacman, B.

Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/217484?sid=primo&origin;=crossref&seq;=1#page_scan_tab_contents At this time, the number of people immigrating to the Zambezi Valley was minimal,Shillington, K. (2012). History of Africa: Third Edition. London, UK: Palgrave MacMillan due to the harsh weather conditions such as intense heat, prolonged rainfall and fatal diseases that characterized this region. In many ways, the Portuguese had to fight to survive. Due to the absence of a substantial population of eligible European women, Portuguese men were led to engage in intermarriages and ultimately reproduce with the indigenous population, causing an upheaval in social and racial composition. =Increase in migration throughout the 18th Century= Throughout the 18th century, the Portuguese population in the Zambezi Valley continued to form unions with the local peoples, which also involved an adoption of culture, ultimately creating a hybrid race. By mid-18th century, people of colour dominated the Prazero community; referred to as Muzungu, the offspring of Portuguese and African unions dominated the Prazeros, signifying a completion in racial absorption.Isaacman, A. & Isaacman, B.

Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/217484?sid=primo&origin;=crossref&seq;=1#page_scan_tab_contents As one of the first dominant hybrid cultures to exist in this region, the Prazeros were successful in wielding tangible power in relations with the Europeans and the local indigenous population, acting as the ‚Äúmiddle men‚Äù in numerous interactions. Power of the Prazeros As a community powerful in both numbers and in military/economic support, the main source of power for the Prazeros were their large Chikunda armies Shillington, K. (2012). History of Africa: Third Edition. London, UK: Palgrave MacMillan which consisted primarily of captured slaves. These armies were utilized for the purposes of collecting taxes, hunting, raiding and trading with other local communities. =Chikunda Armies= The power of these armies through their abundant supply of guns and advanced weaponry eliminated any possibility of another large state opposing them. As a result, the Prazeros dominated the ivory trade in the lower Zambezi Valley throughout the 18th century,Shillington, K. (2012). History of Africa: Third Edition. London, UK: Palgrave MacMillan shooting elephants without regard of local hunting laws, and continued raiding villages for captives to add to their armies. Through the support of these armies, the Prazeros controlled the people and the land of this region. Local farmers were taxed and expected to provide sufficient amounts of food to support the Prazero communities and their armies. Between 1630 and 1670, the Prazeros invoked a deep sense of violence and oppression throughout the land, driving the local people to flee from their homes in hopes of refuge with local powerful men.Shillington, K. (2012). History of Africa: Third Edition. London, UK: Palgrave MacMillan The Prazeros as trans-frontiersmen Through this deep connection to indigenous African culture that was being transmitted through genealogical ties, the Prazeros were in many ways Africanized,Isaacman, A. & Isaacman, B.

From once recognizing themselves as agents for the crown, by the 18th century, the Prazeros were no longer accepting of their subordinate position in society. This non-conforming attitude led them to refuse to pay taxes or provide military assistance to the Portuguese nobility, while also rejecting the Portuguese appeal to renounce autonomy. Despite this appeal being enforced by their standing military power, the Prazeros fought against them, proving their solidarity with their African home and people. As trans-frontiersmen, the Prazeros abided by four concepts: they were permanent residents on land extended beyond the European settler community‚Äôs limits; most marital unions they engaged in were with people from the indigenous population, rather than European; by adopting the culture and identity of the locals, all European ties within them were lost; their loyalty, despite originating with Portugal, shifted to the local people.Isaacman, A. & Isaacman, B.

From the club‚Äôs inception to the start of World War I, the club hosted prominent speakers, discussed academic subjects, and held theatrical performances. Presently operating out of the Harvard Club of Boston, The Saturday Morning Club is an exclusive organization for members to share written works on academic topics.  Early years  The Saturday Morning Club, organized by Julia Ward Howe (1819‚Äì1910) in 1871, was one of the first women‚Äôs clubs to be founded for young girls. Howe, the author of the ‚ÄúBattle Hymn of the Republic,‚Äù was a writer of poems, essays, and children‚Äôs books. She was also an abolitionist, social reformer, and a founding member of the New England Women‚Äôs Club (1868), one of the first women‚Äôs clubs in the nation. The idea for the Saturday Morning Club was inspired by Howe‚Äôs daughter, Maud, who questioned her mother about the conspicuous lack of clubs for young girls. From its beginning, Howe sought a reasonable alternative to the sewing clubs and debutante balls that molded the lives of middle- and upper-class young girls. The Club instead offered a broad range of intelligent, useful, and imaginative activities to enrich their lives and occupy their free time. As the Youth‚Äôs Companion stated in 1910: ‚ÄúThe Saturday Morning Club was born of Mrs. Howe‚Äôs desire that her daughters and their friends should have wider education than the schools offered in 1870. Mrs. Howe chose the fortunate seventy young women, and made them a plan which has proved wonderfully workable through the advancing years‚Äù. The first meeting of the club was held in Mrs. Howe‚Äôs home on Thursday, November 2, 1871, at 4 o‚Äôclock with only eight young girls present. They voted to form a club which held meetings on Saturday mornings, each alternate Saturday being devoted to a discussion of the previous Saturday‚Äôs lecture. Katherine C. Pierce, who wrote a history of the club in 1900 remembered the Club's naming: ‚ÄúWhat would they name the club? The first suggestion was ‚ÄòThe Junior Brain Club‚Äô. Mrs. Howe did not favor it. The next suggestion was ‚ÄòThe Boston Association for Intellectual Improvement‚Äô. This Mrs. Howe turned this down as too pretentious. But, she said, since it was to meet on Saturday mornings, why not call it the ‚ÄòSaturday Morning Club‚Äô? This was adopted, and the Saturday morning club was born‚Äù. The first club members, which consisted of Maud, her friends, and her schoolmates, held informal meetings at Howe‚Äôs home on Mt. Auburn Street, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where they learned to draft a constitution, adopt bylaws, and elect club officers. Nicknamed the ‚ÄúSat Morn Girls‚Äù by Howe, they also created groups to discuss mathematics, science, history, and the arts. By 1874, theatrical projects were added to their weekly meetings and club members were presenting monologues, staging classical plays, and performing musical skits for members and their distinguished guests. Scholarly and intellectual pursuits eventually became the central aspect of club activity. Howe led group discussions to introduce them to critical ways of thinking. As the girls matured and club membership expanded to include older women, they adopted the practice of writing and presenting their own original essays on topics of interest. = Constitution = From the moment of its founding, the club instituted a strict set of rules and regulations in order to maintain the high standard of the group and their work. The 1874 Constitution, available in the Schlesinger Library Collection at the Radcliffe Institute, contains the following set of rules: # The name of this Association shall be the SATURDAY MORNING CLUB. # The objects of this Association are to promote Culture and Social Intercourse. # The Officers of this Association shall consist of President, two Vice-Presidents, Secretary, Assistant Secretary, Treasurer, Assistant Treasurer, and Council. # The Officers shall be chosen annually, and shall come into office on the first Saturday of January. # This Association shall hold twenty-five weekly meetings each year, on Saturday mornings, which shall be alternately Lectures and Discussions, unless otherwise directed by the Officers. # There shall be chosen annually, a Lecture Committee of three, and Discussion Committee of three. # The Annual Meeting shall be held on the third Saturday in November, and the Officers and Committees for the ensuing year shall then be chosen; a two-thirds majority of the members present being necessary for a choice. # The Officers and Council shall form a Board of Direction and Executive Committee, who shall transact all business of the Club. # If any Officer except the President resign during the year, the vacancy shall be filled by the Executive Committee. In case of the President‚Äôs resignation, they shall order a special election. # The Nominating Committee to act at the Annual Meeting, shall be chosen as the last meeting in the spring. # The President shall take the Chair at meetings of the Club, and shall have power to call meetings of the Officers. # The Secretary shall send annual notices, with annual and weekly reports of the meetings held by the Club, keep a list of the actual and proposed members, and have charge of the property of the Club. # The Treasurer shall write an annual report, keep record of attendance, file all bills, have charge of all the moneys received and paid by the Club, and keep the accounts in such order, as to give a statement of the condition of the funds, whenever the President shall so require. # To become a member it is necessary to be proposed by a member, and accepted by the Board of Direction. # The Constitution may be amended at any annual or special meetings, by a two-thirds vote of the members present, notice of the intention to amend having been given previously. # A quorum shall consist of thirty-five members. # By-laws may be amended by a majority of two-thirds, a quorum being present. This was then followed by a list of 36 By-Laws. According to the Youth‚Äôs Companion, in 1910, ‚ÄúThe Club meets each Saturday morning. A survival of its founder‚Äôs vigorous method is its invariable roll-call, and it's fine of five cents for absence and ten cents for tardiness‚Äù. Katherine C. Pierce, a former Club member, described in her written history of the club: ‚ÄúDecember 27th, 1879, a vote was passed that ‚Äòif any member appointed to lead the discussion cannot be present, she shall either send a paper or provide a substitute‚Äô. At the two hundred and twenty- fifth meeting it was voted ‚Äòthat all new members shall take part in one discussion, either actively or by writing a paper, within a year of their admission, or forfeit their membership‚Äô. At the three hundred and forty-second meeting March 7, 1885, members were urged to bring suggestions and criticisms to promote the welfare of the club. Miss Noyes then made a motion, and a vote was passed: That six members should be chosen to prepare papers on a given subject one month before that subject was to come up for discussion. These six members are to constitute a committee, one of the six to be appointed chairman. They are to meet during the month one of more times to prepare the discussion. The papers to be read as formerly, and a general discussion opened.\\" Pierce went into great detail regarding how the Constitution of the club was constantly changing to adapt to the welfare of the club, and how closely they adhered to the voted rules. Katherine C. Pierce continued on in her writing, ‚ÄúGrowth is essential to prosperity; and we have certainly grown and prospered along the two main lines marked out by our constitution, literary and social. Should the question be asked of any of our Presidents, ‚Äúwhat do you consider the most valuable characteristic of the Saturday Morning Club?‚Äù I feel sure each one would answer, Its loyalty, or espirit de corps. I wish we had a good Anglo-Saxon word for this essentially Anglo-Saxon virtue. It is a virtue traditional in our club; and to my thinking, it is the best legacy we can leave to future years‚Äù. The guidance of the Constitution was crucial to the Club‚Äôs success and longevity, according to Pierce and other members. = Performances = Over time, as the Saturday Morning Club‚Äôs membership grew steadily, more diverse activities developed. At the January 31, 1874 meeting, Mrs. Howe proposed that the Club offer entertainment, both literary and musical. The first of these, held at Mrs. Howe‚Äôs residence, consisted of vocal and instrumental music, an essay, and a play in two acts, all of which was followed by a ‚Äúcollation‚Äù prepared by the cookery group. By 1874, club members were presenting monologues, staging classical plays, and performing musical skits for members and their guests. Members dressed in costume as both men and women and performed successfully in front of numerous large audiences. By the 1890s, the Club had more than a hundred members who dedicated much of their time and energy to staging amateur productions of plays such as Antigone, Pride & Prejudice, and The Arabian Nights for audiences of up to 850 people. Of their staging of A Winter‚Äôs Tale in 1895, The Boston Transcript stated that the Club‚Äôs members performed with ‚Äúa genuine Shakespearean spirit, and with distinction worthy of the difficult task attempted‚Äù The Youth‚Äôs Companion notes of their performances: ‚ÄúOccasionally the club undertakes some piece of acting. The ‚ÄòAntigone‚Äô of Sophocles, ‚ÄòThe Winter‚Äôs Tale,‚Äô ‚ÄòIn a Balcony‚Äô have had remarkable presentations to audiences of women. Once a year the club has a frolic‚Äîusually in costume, and enlivened by some witty ‚Äòskit‚Äô by some clever girl‚Äù. = Lectures = As the Centennial Remembrance of the Saturday Morning Club states, the Saturday Morning Club was born out of the larger women‚Äôs club movement, which ‚Äúoffered to women a new instrument of activity outside the home, for self-improvement and self- education at a time when higher education had not yet opened its doors to women.‚Äù Julia Ward Howe, ‚ÄúThe Queen of the Clubs,‚Äù wrote of the movement‚Äôs purpose: ‚ÄúIn advising with all women‚Äôs clubs, I always urged them to include in their programs pressing questions of the day.‚Äù Lectures were a primary and vital component of the Club, rooted in Howe's original educational purpose. The Youth‚Äôs Companion commented on the lectures: ‚ÄúEvery other Saturday the club hears a lecture, and the list of lecturers would be the history of scholarship, philanthropy, and literature for forty years. On the alternate Saturdays the morning is given to a discussion conducted by four club members and participated in by many others. The selection of subjects for the debates was Mrs. Howe‚Äôs perennial interest...Tendencies in literature, music, art, education, society are all studied. Today the club may have a fervid discussion as to the industrial employment of women, and a fortnight hence they may be equally animated in their advocacy of the classics in education or of Shakespeare for the modern stage‚Äù. The Centennial Remembrance Report notes that between the first meeting on the club in 1870 and the second, Mrs. Howe was able to line up five lecturers for the coming weeks, due to her acquaintance with the Boston luminaries of her day. Among the first lecturers was Ralph Waldo Emerson. Following his lecture, it was reported in the Boston Post of 1872 that Emerson found the \\"Sat Morn Girls\\" to be \\"the keenest in perception, and the most appreciative of good things, of any audience he ever spoke before, and...he begged the privilege of reading his new papers to them before they were read elsewhere‚Äù. In addition, Amos Bronson Alcott, Dean of the Concord School of Philosophy lectured on Plato. Lectures of all topics were covered with incredibly notable speakers in attendance. Some of the most prominent thinkers to lecture to the Saturday Morning Club include: Samuel Clemens (Mark Twain; 1882) on \\"Mental Telegraphy,\\" the lawyer and future Supreme Court Justice Louis B. Brandeis on ‚ÄúCivil Rights of Women‚Äù (1883), the African American educator Maria Baldwin on the writings of Harriet Beecher Stowe (1904), and abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison (1905) on the necessity of free speech. A full list of these lectures and their dates is written and recorded in the Saturday Morning Club records at the Schlesinger Library in Cambridge, MA.  World War I involvement  With the onset of the First World War in 1914, the members of the Saturday Morning Club faced a dilemma: did they follow the precedent of the American government and remain neutral in the conflict, or did their intellectual engagement demand further engagement? Inspired by the words of Howe‚Äîwho died several years earlier, in 1910‚Äîthe members decided to devote some club activities to the support of the Allied Powers. Though they did not cease during this time, Club activities subsided as members threw their efforts into war service. Some members volunteered in traditional military support efforts, as they raised money, knit, sewed, and ran drives for the Red Cross, The American Fund for French Wounded, and other organizations. Some also took to workrooms to manufacture bandages and other medical supplies. Still other members volunteered in more individualized and specific projects, such as running the Army & Navy Canteen on the Boston Common, staging amateur theatricals to support the Polish Relief Fund, and writing over 200 letters a week to soldiers abroad. One member achieved the rank of Yeoman (F.) in active service with the U.S. Naval Reserve Force‚Äôs Radio School, and two others facilitated the adoption of orphans from France. Another member was even awarded the Croix de Guerre from the French government for her work nursing and feeding wounded soldiers on the front lines, sometimes under shell fire.  Post-World War I period  The war effort took a serious toll on Club membership, which dwindled from its high of 61 members prior to the war. Many women, now more involved in activities outside the Club, had little time to participate, while other older members looked to hand over the reins to new leadership. As the Club celebrated its 50th anniversary on December 9, 1921 at the Hotel Brunswick in Boston, it faced a critical point of transition in its history. Once an organization primarily for well- bred young women, the Club was increasingly in competition with other similar organizations, which cut into their membership. The Club‚Äôs interests were tailoring more towards an older demographic, which altered the dynamic of the Club. In short, the Saturday Morning Club had shifted from a ‚Äúyoung girl‚Äôs organization,‚Äù as the president wrote in 1931, to a ‚Äúgroup of older women...valiantly upholding early traditions.‚Äù In response to these changes, the Club concentrated less on consuming other people‚Äôs expert opinions, and more on discussing and refining their own‚Äîa focus which still defines the Club‚Äôs activities today.  Contemporary Club (1931‚Äìpresent)  The Saturday Morning Club continues to meet at the Harvard Club of Boston. The Club‚Äôs season runs from October to April of each year, during which time there are about a dozen club meetings. = Purpose = The modern-day Saturday Morning Club is a private organization where adult professional women can socialize and discuss intellectual ideas. Each year, a committee of club members chooses a new conceptual topic to guide discussion during that year‚Äôs meetings. Past topics have included technology, ciphers, and memory. After meeting with the Club‚Äôs president, each member crafts a short research paper, story, memoir, or essay on some aspect of the year‚Äôs discussion topic. The topic selection committee attempts to choose topics that are broad enough to invite diversity of thought and discussion, but narrow enough to promote a uniform theme for the year. During each club meeting, two members present their essays, papers, stories, or memoirs to the group. Presentations are between twelve and fifteen minutes long. The floor is then opened for questions, feedback, and discussion. = Membership = The Club remains exclusive. An applicant must be sponsored by two current club members and must participate in club activities as a provisional member for two years. After these two years, Club members vote on whether to extend full membership to the provisional member.

Biography Lambourn was born in Rotherhithe in London and in 1916 joined the Royal Naval Air Service with whom he trained as an observer, while attached to a squadron based in Scotland during World War I. After the war he worked in Bruges where he planned the design of a factory for the English Electric Light Bulb Company. While in Bruges he developed his interest in art and painting. This led Lambourn to study art at Goldsmiths and at the Royal Academy Schools between 1921 and 1926, and then briefly in Paris. In 1926 he married and moved to Sussex. Eventually he and his wife and their two children settled in Brooke near Norwich. There, Lambourn began painting portraits, most notably one of Augustus John which he completed in 1932. In 1936, Lambourn first visited Mousehole near Penzance. Soon afterwards he bought a former school which he made into his studio when he settled in Cornwall in 1938. Lambourn was a keen sportsman and was one of the first judo black belts in Britain and was chosen for the British Olympic kayak team in 1936. In 1938, Lambourn held his first solo exhibition at the Matthiessen Gallery. Among the works exhibited at that exhibition was Portrait of a Communist, which is possibly Lambourn's best known work and is now in the collection of the Tate. At the start of World War Two, Lambourn joined the Red Cross and went to France, working in an ambulance unit as part of the British Expeditionary Force, in early 1940. Lambourn was subsequently assigned to a Field Dressing Station for the holding force covering the retreat from Calais. He was severely wounded and evacuated on one of the last boats to take part in the Dunkirk evacuation and was subsequently mentioned in dispatches. In July 1940, Lambourn joined the British Volunteer Ambulance Corps and commanded a section. When his service with the Ambulance Corps ended, he painted a number of works at the Hawksley aircraft factory in Gloucester. These works included Test Pilots, a large composition which depicted numerous individuals. He also decorated the canteen at the factory and this led to a commission to join the newly formed Army Decorating Service to decorate canteens and rest centres for the Eighth Army. Often using prisoners of war as well as British troops as his labour force, Lambourn decorated canteens and other facilities as the Allies advanced through North Africa, Italy and then into Austria. While in Italy in 1944, he briefly crossed paths with Spike Milligan, then a soldier recovering from shell shock. During the advance, Lambourn made several paintings of the refugees he encountered and a small number of these works were purchased by the War Artists' Advisory Committee. After the war, Lambourn returned to Mousehole, where he ran the Merlin Theatre, from the school building he had bought before the war, until 1951. A solo show of his work, supported by the Arts Council, was held at the City Art Gallery in Plymouth in 1950. Following a bad experience with a Cork Street gallery, Lambourn mostly showed at small regional galleries with his last show being at the Newlyn Art Gallery in 1976. A memorial exhibition for Lambourn was held at the Gordon Hepworth Gallery in Exeter in 1991.

It was at Theodora‚Äôs request that Damascius wrote the Life of Isidore, and to her that he dedicated it. This work, also known as the Philosophical History, was composed between 517-526, and provides an account of the lives and times of the pagan Neoplatonic communities in Alexandria and Athens at the very end of antiquity, structured around the biography of Isidore.

The 70 refers to Ventadorn, and the 43 is the song number among Ventadorn's works. is a song written in the Occitan language by Bernart de Ventadorn, a 12th-century troubadour. It is among both the oldest and best known of the troubadour songs. Both the lyrics and the melody of the song survive, in variants from three different manuscripts. It is one of the first poems \\"to dramatise the effect of someone actually speaking in the present\\", in part by its formulation as a first-person narrative. Its lyrics are arranged in seven stanzas of eight lines, ending in a four-line coda. The first two verses speak of a lark (the \\"lauzeta\\" of the title) flying with joy into the sun, forgetting itself, and falling, with the speaker wishing he could be so joyful, but unable because of his unrequited love for a woman. In subsequent verses, the subject compares himself to Narcissus and Tristan, and promises to go into exile if the woman he loves does not return his love. This song is one of three Occitan verses interpolated into the 13th century French-language romance Guillaume de Dole, and one of two similar interpolations in Gerbert de Montreuil's Le roman de la violette. Some scholars have suggested that this song inspired a tercet in Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, Paradiso XX:73‚Äì75, which also describes the flight of a lark; however, others have suggested that Dante might have come by this image indirectly through Bondie Dietaiuti, or that this sight would have been common enough that no connection between the two poems can be ascribed. Ezra Pound included a translation of parts of this song in Canto 6 of The Cantos, and returned to the same image in Canto 117. The song continues to be performed, and recordings are available on many albums.Bernart de Ventadorn, Quan (Can) vei la lauzeta mover, motet on allmusic.com, 40 versions listed, retrieved 2017-03-22.

Rosenthal founded the company Philipp Rosenthal & Co. AG in 1897 for the production of ceramic wares.  Biography  Philipp Rosenthal, born March 6, 1855, in Werl, Germany, was the son of the porcelain merchant Abraham Rosenthal and Emilie Rosenthal (born Meyer). Rosenthal company logo Rosenthal was educated in his father's company and went to the USA at the age of 18, where he became the porcelain buyer of the Detroit-based porcelain import company Jacob Meyer Brothers. On his business trips looking for painted porcelain, he realized painted porcelain was a scarce commodity. So he decided in 1879 to return to Germany and open a porcelain painting shop. He started with two painters in Erkersreuth Castle using white porcelain from the porcelain factory Lorenz Hutschenreuther in neighboring Selb . The unexpected breakthrough, however, succeeded commercially with the ashtray \\"little resting place for burning cigars\\". After a short time, Rosenthal employed 60 employees, moved the company to Selb, and opened its own porcelain factory there in 1889. Rosenthal expanded the company through new start-ups and acquisitions and converted it into Philipp Rosenthal & Co. AG in 1897. In 1916, Rosenthal introduced the eight- and twelve-sided dodecagon porcelain dinnerware set \\"Maria,\\" which Rosenthal named after his second wife, Maria Franck, who was the daughter of the royal lawyer Josef Frank. She had divorced Frank in 1916 in order to be able to marry Rosenthal, who was much older. Rosenthal had two sons from his marriage to Maria, Philip Rosenthal and step- son Udo Franck-Rosenthal. In the National Socialism (Nazism) era the Catholic Rosenthal was ousted from the company because of his Jewish ancestry. In order not to damage the reputation of the export-strong company abroad, the dictators after 1933 did not dare to go directly against him. Nevertheless, Rosenthal had to resign the presidency in 1934. Soon, fostered by family quirks, an opportunity presented itself to Rosenthal more inconspicuously. On the one hand, the daughters of the first marriage, Klara and Anna, feared that they would be too short in the event of emancipation. Rosenthal, on the other hand, gave his step-son extraordinary powers, and intended to employ him as the guardian of his interests. The sons of Rosenthal's daughter Anna then applied to the court to divorce her grandfather. The members of the Board of Management joined the motion when Rosenthal asked them to take over his position on the board. In 1936, Rosenthal was incapacitated and placed under guardianship. However, in order to be able to annul long-term, binding resolutions of the dethroned Director General, Rosenthal's opponents from the head of the Munich Psychiatric and Nervous Clinic prepared a negative opinion. On February 15, 1937, Rosenthal became incapable of dealing with the situation as a result of severe changes in the age of the brain, which had been altered by changes in the arteries of the brain. Rosenthal died March 30, 1937, in Bonn. In 1950, his son Philip Rosenthal joined Rosenthal AG after his exile in England. The company achieved international importance through its porcelain designed by modern artists such as Henry Moore, Friedensreich Hundertwasser, Salvador Dal√≠, Ernst Fuchs and Helmut Andreas Paul Grieshaber.

Adadia is inhabited by the Ibibio1 2people. History & Culture The first soil on which Adadia (Itu Obio Amin) lived was Uruan Ekpe in Efut in Southern Cameroon. Obong Ekene Iyit√∂ led them and sailing up the Cross River, settled in the upland forest where Obio Oko (Creek Town) lives till this day. The five villages who later joined them were: 1) Adiabo - first village 2) Obut√∂√± 3) Atakpa 4) Nsidu√± 5) Ekpe Oku Atai ( otherwise known as Mbarakom) When Obong Ekene Iyit√∂ died, a silk cotton tree was planted to mark his grave. His son, Iyit√∂ Ekene Iyit√∂, was named after his grandfather led the next phase of migration and founded Esuk Mbat, which is Esuk Ekpok Ekpa, which is Okoyong Inua Akpa. He named it \\"Itu Iyit√∂ Ekene.\\" Obong Iyit√∂ Ekene's team met Efot Abua living at one part of the land leading to Idim Ete Ni√±. When Obong Iyit√∂ Ekene died, his son, Amin Iyit√∂ Ekene, renamed the place \\"Itu Obio Amin\\" meaning \\"Obio Ndito Iyit√∂ Ekene\\" (Village of the descendants of Iyit√∂ Ekene). How the name Adadia came about. When Obong Amin Iyit√∂ Ekene died, ten young warriors went head hunting for the burial rites as was the custom then. They sailed and landed at Okobo. The Okobo people captured them and allocated them as slaves to their Chiefs. On some mornings when out from their masters' homes, they would discuss and plan their escape. One eventful evening, the captives decided to escape, they brought out some bottles of intoxicating drink, which they called \\"onwong otop ek√∂t\\" and presented to theirs masters who happily accepted, and drank them. Being highly intoxicated they fell asleep. At night, they killed their masters and escaped. The Okobo people mourned and exclaimed \\"Idia Idia owo nyin.\\" Giving rise to the name Adadia. Quarrel between Okon Otu Ukpong, an Okoyong son and Mbesembe Otu, led to war, caused Adadia to leave Okoyong for their present abode. Among those who first left Okoyong for what is now known as Adadia were: 1\\\\. Udo Obon 2\\\\. Anda√± 3\\\\. Ema 4\\\\. Uma Eyie 5\\\\. Udo Obon 6\\\\. Mbo Nta 7\\\\. Ekanem Akpakan All these left with their families and on arriving the new found land, they settled at different locations.

Ekpuk Obong Ubom Obio Ema from Ikot Udo landed and established a beach known as Esuk Ikot Ikpata. 3\\\\. Ekpuk Obong Oto Akpabio Eda from Ikot Oto landed at Esuk Atai. Present day Adadia has come to have gazetted villages within it, which are: 1) Esuk Akpan Ambo (Odoro Enen, Ikot Udo) 2) Afaha Ikot 3) Ibeno 4) Issiet Adadia (Issiet Inua Akpa) Headship of Adadia The Headship of Adadia otherwise known as \\"Obong Adadia\\" follows a rotational system within the three (3) main outstanding family units namely: Nung Emuk, Ikot Udo & Ikot Ottor in its governance.

It operated in the occupied Ukraine and Southern Russia regions behind Army Group South's front lines. Its duties included security of communications and supply lines, economic exploitation and combatting irregular fighters (partisans) in Wehrmacht's rear areas.

It is one of the main cultural events, religious and tourist attraction of M√°laga. During Holy Week, 42 brotherhoods (cofrad√≠a) make 45 processions through the streets of M√°laga showing realistic wooden sculptures narrating scenes of the events of the Passion of Christ, or images of the Virgin Mary showing sorrow. Holy Week in M√°laga was declared in 1965 Fiesta of International Tourist Interest of Spain. Procession Nazarenes of the section of the Virgin of the Brotherhood of the Holy Transfer =Nazareno= A characteristic common with the rest of the Holy Week in Spain is usage of the nazareno or penitential robe for some of the participants in the processions. This garment consists in a tunic, capirote (a hood with conical tip) used to conceal the face of the wearer, and sometimes a cloak. The fabrics normally used in these garments are velvet, damask, satin or twill. The Nazarenos of some brotherhoods also can wear gloves, scapulars, stoles and the tunic fastened with cincture or belts of espartos. The exact colors and forms of these robes depend on the particular brotherhood, in Malaga normally the colors of the Nazarenos of the section of the Christ and the Virgin are different. Usually the nazarenos carry candles and they go in front of the thrones at the leading segments. embroidered with the shield of the brotherhood from Vineyards =Emblem= The majority of the brotherhoods carry a significant number of insignia in the procession that are carried by nazarenos: *Cross guide (the so-called Cruz de Gu√≠a - Guiding Cross) is carried at the beginning of each procession and is responsible for guiding it. * Banner (the so-called Gui√≥n) is an emblem of the cofrad√≠a in the form of a folded flag, that carries in the center of the flag embroidered in thread of gold and silk the shield or arms of the brotherhood. * Senatus is the name with which it is known to an emblem that serves to recall the time of the Roman Empire, the period wherein the events of the Passion of Jesus Christ are set. It bears the letters SPQR, which is an acronym for the Latin expression Senatus Populus Que Romanus (Senate and people of Rome). * Book of Rules (in Spanish Libro de Reglas) is a book that contains the norms and rules of the Brotherhood. A standard embroidered with a painting of the Virgin of Grace * Standard (the so-called Estandarte) is an insignia, sometimes embroidered in gold thread and luxuriously decorated, with a painting of the Christ or Virgin of each brotherhood. =Mantilla= Some processions are accompanied by women who wear mantillas. It is formed by a black dress, a sign of mourning and pains, is accompanied by a mantilla, lace or silk veil or shawl worn over the head and back. The peineta, similar in appearance to a large comb, is used to hold up the mantilla. =Acolyte= Before the throne are placed a group of six or eight acolytes dressed in vestments, many of them wearing dalmatics; the ceroferarios who carries the ciriales or processional candlestick; and the thurifers who carries the thurible where incense is burned and it is dispersed. Throne of the Virgin of Great Power, where the canopy is visible with the bambalinas, the candeler√≠a at the front and the arbotantes on the corners. =Throne= The thrones, in others places called pasos, are enormous platforms where are located the sculptures that depict different scenes from the gospels related to the Passion of Christ or the Sorrows of Virgin Mary. Each brotherhood usually exhibit two thrones, the first one would be a sculpted scene of the Passion, or image of Christ; and the second an image of the Virgin Mary, known as a dolorosa. The structure of the thrones, known as cajillo, is richly carved in wood, silver, bronze or nickel silver and some gilt with gold leaf. In each of the corners of the cajillo is placed the arbotantes (candelabra) or lantern to illuminate the image or sculptural group that is located in the upper part of the cajillo. A throne butler rings a bell after the bearers' rest The thrones of Christ are adorned at the top with carpet of flowers such as carnations or iris, or a mountain of corks, while most of the Virgin's thrones are covered by an ornate canopy secured to the cajillo by 12 or 16 palio bars. From the front, back and sides of the canopy hang the bambalinas, velvet or mesh draperies embroidered in gold, plate and silk. In front of the image of the Virgin is placed the candeler√≠a, a set of candlesticks which are placed in a stepped layout. Thrones are carried on the shoulders of men and women, called men of thrones or bearers, through long bars or beams called varales, which usually measure between 8 and 14 meters long. Each throne has 6 or 8 varales depending on the size of the throne. Depending on weight, some can weigh up to 5 tonnes, a throne requires between 120 and 270 portadores (bearers) to moved. Each person can carry between 20 and 40 kilograms of weight, during the time of the procession, from 6 to 14 hours. At the front of the throne‚Äôs varales there is a big bell. This is rung with a hammer by the Throne Butler (the chief of the Throne Men) to guide and stop to rest the bearers. Christ of the Souls of the Blind (c. 1649) attributed to Pedro de Zayas, Royal Merged Brotherhood =Sculpture= The sculptures are located at the top of the throne and are the central axis of each brotherhood, most of the sculptures are carved wood (or recently, polychrome), often life-size or somewhat smaller. Some of these carvings are great works of art with centuries of antiquity, although unfortunately during the burning of churches and convents in the 1931 riots, a great number of these sculptures were destroyed, between them the great majority of works of Pedro de Mena. After the Civil War, authors such as Mariano Benlliure, Francisco Palma Burgos, Castillo Lastrucci or Jos√© Navas Parejo began to make new sculptures to replace the destroyed works. These sculptures are in their respective churches and chapels during the rest of the year where they receive worship. Cape of the Virgin of the Solitude, Congregations of Mena The images of Jesus are situated on the first throne, which represents a biblical passage of the Gospels: triumphal entry into Jerusalem, Jesus carrying the cross, Jesus crucified, descent from the Cross, etc. Depending on the scene depicted the carving of Jesus may appear alone or accompanied by other statues related to the biblical passage. Some images of Christ wear tunics, smooth or richly embroidered over much of its surface. In the second throne is located the Virgin of Sorrow, mostly alone but sometimes accompanied by sculpture St. John the Evangelist. The statue of the Virgin usually is of a mannequin, with only the hands and the head carved. The body and arms are covered with luxurious dresses embroidered with gold and silver thread as well as colored silks. Around the head is placed a veil and usually carry a crown or halo. In the back is placed long capes embroidered in gold and silver thread and taking forms that are generally inspired by vegetable motifs, in Malaga these capes can reach up to 8 meters in length. Drums belonging to a band =Music= ;Bands Most of the thrones are accompanied by marching bands. Each procession usually has 3 bands, the first band, a drum and bugle band is located behind the lead cross. The second band walks behind the first float, this band is usually of bugles and drums, military band or concert band with woodwind instrument, brass instrument and percussion. Finally, the throne of the virgin is only accompanied by a concert band. Many of these bands are created by the brotherhoods themselves, a few being made up of personnel of the Armed Forces. These bands play processional marches during processions, most of these marches have been created to accompany the movement of the thrones. It is a tradition that the Marcha Real is played at the departure and entrance of the images in the home churches or chapels of the confraternities and once it is played, everyone pays respect to the anthem (military, police and fire personnel out of formation salute when it is performed). ;Saeta As throughout the Spanish world, and especially in Andalucia, during the processions saetas are sung to the sculptures. The saeta is a religious song, generally improvised and without accompaniment, which is usually sung from a balcony or on the street. It is a melody of free and full of lyricism. It recalls the style of cante jondo typical of the musical tradition of flamenco. The Route =Brotherhood house= This is the place from which the great majority of the corporations begin their processional route, because the dimensions of the thrones do not allow them to begin the procession at their associated churches. It is also where they keep the heritage throughout the year, occupying many positions in their museum during the rest of the year. =Official Route= Marqu√©s de Larios Street, one of the streets that form the official route In Holy Week, the official route is made up of those streets that share each and every one of the brotherhoods. Official route During Holy Week, the brotherhoods of M√°laga leave their temple or brotherhood' house, to go to the official route that begins in the Alameda Principal and follows the Larios roundabout, Marqu√©s de Larios street, Constitution Square and Granada street. This route has a distance of about 850 meters. After this route, the brotherhoods continue their own journey returning to their brotherhood or temples of origin, or enter the Cathedral to establish their penitence station. The Association of Holy Brotherhoods of Malaga places on the official route around 16,000 chairs and several grandstands, among which stands out the Constitution Square. =The Rostrum of the Poor= At the end of Carreter√≠a Street from M√°laga, at the confluence with the Santa Isabel Hall, there is a staircase which at Holy Week becomes a natural tribune to witness the processions of Malaga. Some brotherhoods are expected there with great enthusiasm and popular fervor. It is called this because it is free and in contrast to the Official Rostrum, located in Constitution Square where the authorities are sat. Of the 45 processions participating in Holy Week, 28 pass through this place. =Cathedral= Some brotherhoods make a penitential station inside the Cathedral of Malaga. There are 15 cofrad√≠as that enter the Cathedral. The remaining corporations do not station in the Cathedral due essentially to the large size of their thrones, which prevents them from entering the Cathedral thru the main gates. Previous Days =Procession= Prior to Holy Week, especially the Friday of Sorrows and the Saturday of Passion, some brotherhoods make processions. These brotherhoods are usually historical confraternities of neighborhoods very far from the center, as the Brotherhood of the Sorrows from Puerto de la Torre or Brotherhood of the Sorrows from Churriana, or young brotherhoods that still do not belong to the Brotherhood' Association, so even they can not go through the official route. Legion, Holy Thursday morning =Transfers= The transfers are small processions in which usually only one throne of reduced dimensions which carry the two sculptures of the brotherhood. They aim to move the statues of their temple to the Brotherhood' House. They usually take place the week before Holy Week, although some brotherhoods carry out during Holy Week.

It is owned and operated by Western Oregon Radio Club, Inc., and broadcasts an oldies format. The station takes its call letters and inspiration from the former KISN in Vancouver, Washington, a then-Top 40 outlet which broadcast from 1959 to the late 1970s. History In 2010, Dave \\"Records\\" Stone began an internet stream that served as a revival of KISN, at which he had worked. This stream was shut down in 2014. After its cloure, Scott Young‚Äîwho had been a technician involved in its creation‚Äîcontacted Ken Seymour of the Western Oregon Radio Club (WORC) to explore opportunities for joining forces to resurrect KISN radio. The WORC had recently received a construction permit issued by the FCC to build a new low-power FM station in Portland on 95.1 FM. The WORC, led by President Ron Polluconi and club member Ken Seymour, were planning to move the club's existing radio station, KQSO-LP, from Newberg to Portland's Mount Scott; KQSO was shuttered because of the launch of an FM translator in Portland. On August 26, 2014, the WORC installed the transmit antenna for the new station on a tower located in a communications compound on Mt. Scott. On October 21, 2014, Ken Seymour successfully negotiated use of the KISN call sign from the licensee of the current KISN radio station, located near Bozeman, Montana. Subsequently, a press release was issued on November 28, 2014 where Ron Polluconi announced that \\"finally after 38 years the KISN call sign and radio signal will return to Portland via the FM airwaves\\". On May 1, 2015, at 9:51 a.m., KISN-LP commenced broadcasting on the 56th anniversary of the launch of the original KISN in 1959.

She has published three books, two of which have won international awards. She focuses on issues relating to queer Nigerians, such as in Blessed Body: Secret Lives of LGBT Nigerians (2016).  Biography  Azuah was born in Ogwashi-Ukwu in Delta State of Nigeria to a Tiv father from Ukan in Ushongo local government area of Benue State and to an Igbo mother from Asaba in Delta State. Being born during the Nigerian Civil War to parents on both sides of the conflict, she was raised mostly as Igbo and was estranged from her paternal family because a Tiv Nigerian soldier was not supposed to cross the enemy line to get involved with a Biafran (Igbo) woman. She attended the University of Nigeria, Nsukka where, as an undergraduate, she edited the English department literary journal called The Muse and received the awards of the best Creative Writing student for two consecutive years: 1992 and 1993.https://www.african-writing.com/seven/unomaazuah.htm She has a Bachelor of Art in English, University of Nigeria, Nsukka (1994), a Masters in English from Cleveland State University, Ohio (2001) and a Masters in Fine Art from Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond (2003).  Gay rights advocacy/activism  Azuah is the first Nigerian to give LGBTQI issues consistent visibility in the Nigerian literary scholarship. She left Nigeria in 1999, after receiving numerous threats to her life on account of her work, and now splits her time between the US and Nigeria to continue assisting and working with the Nigerian LGBTQI community. Of her work, Azuah has said \\"I‚Äôve always explored the theme of sexuality in my writing, especially in my poems and non-fiction pieces. Edible Bones is actually inspired by a true story. The life of the major character loosely reflects the life of a Nigerian immigrant I met. He happened to be highly homophobic, but when he goes to jail and becomes a point of attention for bullies, a homosexual guy happens to be his savior.\\" Of the anti-gay law in Nigeria, she has also said the following: \\"I feel that the Nigerian leadership is using the matter as a tool to distract Nigerians from genuinely pressing concerns like the lack of economic opportunity and infrastructure. The strong wave of fundamentalist Christianity sweeping over Nigeria fuels the distraction of this topic which should not be up for national debate because what consenting adults do in the privacy of their bedroom should concern no one. Her exploration of gay themes in her work, and \\"defense of queer sex\\", for a Nigerian-based writer has been described as \\"a courageous act indeed.\\" Now a citizen of the USA, she continues to stay \\"deeply involved in her homeland by sharing stories of the persecution of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community there.\\"  Professional life  Azuah currently teaches writing at the Illinois Institute of Art ‚Äì Chicago.

As a specialized Labor Court, all matters adjudicated by it are exclusive to the court and its decisions were hitherto, subject only to appeal when certain conditions were met. Currently, appeals can be made to the Court of Appeal by leave. The Trade Dispute Decree No.7 of 1976 set up the National Industrial Court; initially consisting of a president and four other members and a quorum of the president and two members. The initial jurisdiction of the court set forth in the Decree No.7 was dealing with trade union disputes and interpretation of collective bargaining agreements. From 1976 until 2006, the operations of the court was limited and its judgement barely respected. It operated on matters that emerged from arbitration or conciliatory labor disputes while it shared jurisdiction on most matters with the state and Federal High Court. The first president was Paul Atilade. Currently,Hon.Justice Benedict Kanyip is the President of the NICN. There is a total of 33 judges currently in the various divisions of the court. In 2006, the legislature passed the National Industrial Court Act, 2006 (NICA), strengthening the rules of the court and its ability to enforce judgement. The act also repealed parts of Decree No.7 and reduced some of the jurisdiction of the High Courts that was shared with NIC. The 1999 Constitution (Third Alteration) Amendment Act 2010 further enhanced the jurisdiction of the court and established it as a superior court of record. The procedures, jurisdiction, practice and power of the courts were properly defined by the 2010 act. In 2017, the court made new rules which it now uses procedurally. Alternate Dispute Resolution The 2006 Act encouraged arbitration of labour matters and in 2015, the court established the Alternate Dispute Resolution center. The centre's mandate include reduction in cost and delays in judicial delivery through efficient, fast and equitable settlement of disputes.

It was set up in January 1992 with the aim to spread awareness about heritage of the Maltese islands among locals and foreigners through museums, publications, exhibs and events. The foundation was begun by a group of individuals with different backgrounds but with a common goal of promoting Maltese patrimony.http://www.livenewsmalta.com/index.php/2018/03/12/hsbc- malta-foundation-continues-partnership-with-patrimonju-malti/ Among its displayed items are collections of objets d‚Äôart, some loaned from Maltese private collections which are temporary viewed to the general public. FPM manages a historic house museum located at Palazzo Falson in Mdina and an art gallery dedicated to British artist Victor Pasmore. The Foundation publishes its own cultural magazine, occasional catalogues of its exhibitions, and academic literature to subjects related.  History  FPM was founded in 1992, with Maurice de Giorgio serving as its first Chairman until his death in 2015. During this time, the Foundation established itself as a prominent entity within the Maltese cultural heritage sector, organising various exhibitions related to Maltese cultural heritage and opening the Palazzo Falson Historic House Museum.  Museums  FPM‚Äôs first museum project began in 1997 with the setting of the Theatre Museum. Initially the Foundation organised four exhibitions on Maltese heritage with the names of Antique Maltese Clocks, The Sedan Chair in Malta, Girolamo Gianni in Malta and The Silver in Malta. These exhibitions were the precursor to a larger and more permanent museum project, namely the restoration and transformation of the Palazzo Falson Historic House Museum. This project was carried out through an agreement with The Captain O F Gollcher OBE Art an Archaeological Foundation, whereby FPM was to manage the museum and transform it into a state of the art historic house museum. = Palazzo Falson Historic House Museum = Palazzo Falson is the second oldest structure still standing in Mdina, parts of which date back to the 13th century. In 1927 the Palazzo was bought by Olof Frederick Gollcher OBE (1889‚Äì1962), a collector of objets d‚Äôart including paintings, silver, furniture, jewellery, oriental rugs and arms and armour, among others. Gollcher wanted his house to be preserved with its contents as a museum open to the general public, and in his will left instructions for the setting up of a foundation bearing his name that was to carry out this wish. Following a five-year intensive restoration exercise, Palazzo Falson Historic House Museum opened its doors to the public in May 2007. Palazzo Falson currently hosts both a permanent collection and temporary exhibitions, exhibiting artefacts and objects of relevance to Maltese cultural heritage from public and private collections. = Victor Pasmore Gallery = In September 2015, FPM took over the management of the Victor Pasmore Gallery with the aim of bringing to light the importance of Victor Pasmore and the Maltese modern art movement.Galea; Balzan (2007) p. 1-4. Born in Chelsham, Surrey, Victor Pasmore (1908‚Äì1998) settled and worked in Malta in the second half of the twentieth century. The collection at the VP Gallery covers a wide range of Pasmore‚Äôs creations and preferred media, including drawings, reliefs and spray paintings, constructions, prints and composite works. Though not all produced in Malta, the works on display are largely representative of Pasmore‚Äôs artistic practice following the move to his village farmhouse in Gudja in 1966, and also exhibit a greater sensitivity and interest in light, colour and myth. The gallery is situated on the site of a former gunpowder magazine, originally dating back to the period of the Order of St John, and was later rebuilt during the British period. The magazine was restored by the Central Bank of Malta and The Victor Pasmore Foundation, and was officially opened to the public on 3 November 2014.

It was founded in 1718 and continued until 1864. The firm was Europe's second-oldest porcelain factory after Meissen porcelain, and for 25 years the two remained the only European producers. Initially it was a private enterprise, founded by Claude du Paquier,in official documents \\"Claudius Innocentius du Paquier\\" an official of the Viennese Imperial court, but in 1744 it was rescued from financial difficulties when bought by the Empress Maria Theresa, and thereafter remained an asset of the emperors.Battie, 94 1790s Sorgenthal period cup and saucer, probably mainly intended to be displayed in a cabinet rather than used. The wares from the earlier, private period before 1744 are the most sought-after today, if only because production was lower and so the pieces are much more rare. These are often called Du Paquier porcelain from the Du Paquier factory.Frick, 1; as by Wardropper, and the auction houses cited below The other high point, \\"perhaps the factory's most glamorous period\\",Battie, 153 was from 1784 to 1805 when a variety of innovative wares in broadly Neoclassical styles were produced, then with S√®vres porcelain the main influence. Wares were used as diplomatic gifts by the emperors, and exports to Turkey were significant.  History  Sorgenthal period, early 1800s, Neoclassical cup and saucer The factory was on Porzellangasse (\\"Porcelain Lane\\") in Alsergrund, now Vienna's 9th district. The history of the manufactory is often divided by German writers into five periods. The first period, used by all sources, was under its founder and first director du Paquier, who was given a monopoly for 25 years. This is therefore known as the \\"Du Paquier period\\", and many sources talk of \\"Du Paquier porcelain\\" and the \\"Du Paquier factory\\",Wardropper; \\"Du Paquier Porcelain Manufactory\\", Getty Museum usually with a capital \\"D\\", although his actual name has a small \\"d\\". While Meissen and most later German factories were owned by the local ruler, and usually heavily funded, du Pacquier received only permission to manufacture, and many orders for wares, from the emperor, and the factory seems always to have been under-capitalized in his time. This situation lasted from 1718‚Äì1744, when the monopoly expired and the financial difficulties apparently came to a head; the empress intervened by buying the factory,Battie, 94; Frick, 1 which was then renamed as the \\"Imperial State Manufactory Vienna\\". The second period is the \\"Plastic period\\" (1744‚Äì1784), the third is the \\"Sorgenthal period\\",Battie, 153 or \\"Painterly period\\" (Malerische Periode) of 1784‚Äì1805, then the \\"Biedermeier period\\" (1805‚Äì1833) and finally the \\"Late Biedermeier period\\" (1833‚Äì1864).Wien By the last quarter of the 18th century, as many as 120,000 pieces annually were exported to the Ottoman Empire; these were typically brightly coloured, but less finely painted than those for European markets.Battie, 96 Many were sets of the small cups used for Turkish coffee. The factory received a boost from the Congress of Vienna in 1815, in the course of which it was visited by a number of monarchs and other leading figures, although King George IV of the United Kingdom never went to Vienna and so missed the service he would have been presented with.Levetus, A.S., Imperial Vienna, 239 According to another account, the king preferred to be sent a quantity of Tokay wine.Falke, 50 Although exports to the Ottoman Empire continued, by the 1860s the factory was suffering from increased competition from Bohemian factories in particular, and was eventually closed by the Austrian parliament in 1864, with the moulds and other equipment being given to the Museum of Applied Arts, Vienna.Wien; Battie, 96, but see p. 153 \\"finally closed in 1866\\" The wares are sometimes called \\"old Vienna\\" (or Alt Wien in German).Wien; Falke, 53 The name was revived in 1923 with the foundation of the Vienna Porcelain Manufactory Augarten.Wien Characteristics Wares were hard-paste porcelain, and always of very high quality. Like most factories in the German-speaking world, it was founded with expertise provided by key workers enticed from Meissen porcelain, who brought the secrets of the Meissen materials and techniques with them, and the wares remained broadly similar to those made there, although the body was not exactly the same, and gradually improved. Initially mostly table wares were produced, often with a slightly blueish tinge to the plain body. European flowers (as opposed to East Asian ones copied from imports) were used in decoration from around 1730, before Meissen, and subsequently very widely used across European factories. As at Meissen, chinoiserie decoration was also often used, as were hunting and battle scenes.Battie, 94‚Äì95; Frick, 3‚Äì5 Vienna porcelain trembleuse cup from the du Paquier period, 1730 The Du Paquier period began the tradition of strong and varied colours, which was to remain a strength of Vienna porcelain. There was heavy use of openwork in some pieces. A very common style, called Laub- und Bandelwerk in German, has intricate painted borders or backgrounds of trellis, bandwork, palmettes and other very formalized plant motifs. Knobs and handles are often formed as animals, and sometimes people.Frick, 5 Like other factories in major capitals, including Meissen, Capodimonte and Buen Retiro in Madrid, Vienna produced a few porcelain rooms for palaces, the only surviving example of which is now installed in the Museum of Applied Arts, Vienna. However, the porcelain here does not cover all the wall space that is not window or mirror, as in other examples, but is a border around the wall-spaces, with matching plaques on the furniture.Lecture on the room at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 2009 Porcelain was used for diplomatic gifts; the Hermitage Museum retains most of a service made in 1735 for Czarina Anna Ivanovna of Russia, which included more than 40 tureens.Wardropper; Frick, 6. It seems almost certain this was a gift to Anna from the Holy Roman Emperor, but this cannot be precisely documented. Other pieces are dispersed (the early Soviet government sold several pieces), and a tureen from the service made $365,000 at Christies in New York in 2014.Lot 27, \\"The Exceptional Sale\\", New York, 11 December 2014 (see Lot Essay); Frick, 6 ‚Äì another tureen in the Frick Collection] Chief modellers included Johann Joseph Niedermeyer, working from 1747 to 1784, and Anton Grassi from 1778 to 1807,Battie, 95‚Äì96 who was sent to study classical remains in Rome for several months in 1792.Battie, 153 Neither quite achieved the charm of the light-hearted genre figures of other factories. Like Meissen and other German factories, some Vienna pieces were decorated by outside painters, or Hausmalers.Lehman, 184; Sotheby's lot 13, Sale 18 November 2011, New York A new director, Konrad von Sorgenthal, took over during a financial crisis in 1784 and changed the style of wares, following the fashion for Neoclassicism and taking some influence from S√®vres. Bright colours, extensive use of gold, and very detailed painting characterize the style, and set the typical Vienna style for decades to come. Another Neoclassical fashion in porcelain which Vienna embraced was the biscuit porcelain figure.Battie, 96 Many pieces of tableware, especially cups with saucers, were now essentially made for display in porcelain cabinets, rather than use.Battie, 153 Painters at work, c. 1830 Sorgenthal employed painters known in other media: Anton Kothgasser (1769‚Äì1851) was also a painter of glass, and Moritz Michael Daffinger (1790‚Äì1849), the son of a painter for the factory, worked for them until 1809, before concentrating on painting portrait miniatures.Battie, 153 The quality of wares was in decline by the late 1820s, when unsuccessful attempts began to revive the factory by producing cheaper wares from lower- quality materials, decorators paid on piecework, and some use of printed transfer. All were counter-productive, and production continued to reduce, although some high-quality pieces were produced until the end.Falke, 49‚Äì53; Battie, 153 Some moulds and undecorated fired \\"blanks\\" were bought by other factories, including Herend, and added to the considerable volume of imitations, \\"replicas\\" and downright forgeries that have copied Vienna porcelain. Other genuine Vienna pieces had their decoration scraped off to be repainted in a more elaborate style.Falke, 53; Battie, 96, 153, 187‚Äì188 Marks No marks were used before the Imperial takeover in 1744, after which a \\"beehive-shaped shield\\" was used, either in blue or impressed. In 1783 the impressed date mark was introduced, beginning with \\"83\\", then running from \\"801\\" for 1801.Battie, 96 Painters, and the turners responsible for the body, can often be identified by the numbers they were given, which were added to the underside of pieces to ensure they were paid for the right pieces.Lehman, 184‚Äì188; Battie, 153 Exhibitions Imperial Privilege: Vienna Porcelain of Du Paquier, 1718‚Äì44 was held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2009‚Äì2010.\\"Exhibition of Rare Du Paquier Porcelain at Metropolitan Museum\\", Met To celebrate the 300th anniversary of the founding of the factory, the Museum of Applied Arts, Vienna had the exhibition 300 Years of the Vienna Porcelain Manufactory, to September 2018, covering all periods of production in Vienna.\\"300 Years of the Vienna Porcelain Manufactory\\", MAK The Uffizi in Florence, ran another from November 2018 to March 2019, covering only the Du Paquier period and drawing from the collections of the Florence Porcelain Museum and the Liechtenstein collection.Le Vie della Porcellana tra Vienna e Firenze, press release The Frick Collection in New York also celebrated the anniversary with a dedicated installation in 2017‚Äì2018.Frick, 1 One of the most complete collections of Vienna porcelain is the over 1,000 pieces in the Marton Museum in Croatia, showing the development from the Du Paquier period until 1864, especially in the Maria Theresa period from 1744 to 1780, which is often less appreciated by museums and collectors, and the Sorgenthal period between 1784 and 1805.

A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A partial solar eclipse occurs in the polar regions of the Earth when the center of the Moon's shadow misses the Earth. It was the last of two all partial eclipses that took place that year. It was part of solar saros 150. The next eclipse was on April 16, 1874 in the same hemisphere, it covered the smaller part of the area of the previous eclipse including the northernmost of Antarctica along with Prime Meridian, the ice shelf with the island would be inside the umbral portion which was a total eclipse. Description The eclipse took place in almost the whole of Antarctica (much of it in areas that had a 24-hour daylight at the time) except for areas within the separation of the Indian and Pacific Ocean and the northernmost of its peninsula with its islands which was nighttime, it also occurred largely in the Atlantic and Indian Ocean along with Prince Edward and Kerguelen Islands. The rim of the eclipse included modern-day South Africa and the south of Madagascar, the eclipse was close to Maputo (then Louren√ßo Marques), Mozambique. The eclipse went as far as hundreds of miles (or kilometers) south of East London, South Africa and around the same parallel with Cape Town. The eclipse started at sunrise in the Indian Ocean and ended at sunset in Antarctica. A very small part occurred on the location of the previous eclipse, many areas occurred on the opposite side. As the moon moved towards the left on Earth in Africa, at the peninsular portion, in Northern and Peninsular Antarctica, it was seen as it was moved towards the bottom right, then right then top as the axis spun at around the 70th parallel south. The center of the Moon's shadow was missed by about 1,300 km above the area (69 S) south of the Antarctic Circle. The eclipse began at sunrise southeast of Madagascar and ended at sunset in the southern part of the Pacific Ocean. The greatest eclipse was in the Atlantic off the shore of Antarctica at 63.2 S & 9.5 W at 3:22 UTC and occurred after sunrise. It showed up to 25% obscuration of the sun at the middle of the Antarctic Peninsula at the 110th meridian and around 30% in the area of the South Pole, at the northern shore by the 20th meridian, it was close to 50% obscured.

He was awarded the Yakir Yerushalaim prize in 1974. He is best known for blowing the shofar at the conclusion of the Yom Kippur service at the Western Wall, defying the law of the British Mandate, which prohibited doing so. Biography Moshe Zvi Segal was born on 23 February 1904 (6 Shevat 5664) in Poltava, Ukraine. His father was Abraham Mordechai Segal from Mohilov, situated above the Dnieper River in White Russia. His mother was Henna Leah Menkin, whose family moved from Mohilov to Vortinschina-Zeberzhia as farmers to escape the Tzar's decree to kidnap Jewish children from their homes, forcefully prevent them from religious observance, and recruit them in the army. The seeds of Segal's love for Jerusalem and the Holy Land were sown at an early age, when he learned about the forefathers of the Jewish People, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the Torah. In 1914, as a result of the First World War, the Mir Yeshiva relocated to Poltava. Segal studied there from the age of 10 until the age of 15. In 1919, when the yeshiva returned to Poland, Segal declined the Rosh Yeshiva's invitation to join them because of his prior obligation to assist his parents with the family's meager finances. During his years in the yeshiva he was also an avid reader of books at Poltava's Hebrew Library. His reading significantly broadened his knowledge of Jewish philosophy in the middle ages and later generations. At the age of 17, Segal was accepted as a member of the HeHalutz Jewish underground organization in Poltava. In 1924, at the age of 20, Segal immigrated with his parents and siblings to the land of Israel (then under the British Mandate for Palestine). In 1929, in response to King George VI's decrees limiting Jewish rights and religious observance in Palestine and Jerusalem, Segal organized a large demonstration to the Kotel on 9 Av, the day of Jewish national mourning. During the 1929 Arab riots and the pogroms in Hebron and Safed he defended Tel Aviv as a member of the Hagana. He later co-founded the Etzel military movement. Segal was also one of the founders of Brit HaBirionim. In 1930, Segal prayed the Yom Kippur service at the Western Wall. He borrowed a shofar from Rabbi Isaac Orenstein, then Chief Rabbi of the Western Wall, and hid it until the end of the Ne'ila service, when it is the custom to sound the shofar. When the service reached its climax, Segal boldly blew the shofar for all to hear, against the law of the British Mandate, and was promptly arrested for doing so. Upon hearing of the incident, Chief Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook announced that he would not break his fast until the young Segal was allowed to eat. Rabbi Kook telephoned the British High Commissioner of Palestine requesting Segal's release, and at about midnight that same evening, he was freed. In the years that followed, until the founding of the State of Israel in 1948, Segal arranged that a shofar be smuggled into the Western Wall area and he trained young men to sound it at the appropriate moment every year at the end of the Yom Kippur service. Organizations Throughout his life, Segal was a member of a number of organizations, some of which he founded himself. *1916: Tikvat Yisrael youth organization, Poltava *1920: Tzeirei Tzion, Poltava *1920: HeHalutz Ha'Adom, Poltava *1926: Hagana *1926: Hatzohar *1927: Tenuat HaRechvim *1927: Gedud Meginei HaSafah *1930: Agudat HaShomer Bagalil *1931-1932: Brit HaBirionim *1931: Etzel *1937: Brit Hahashmonaim *1943: Lechi *1943: Aguda Le'Ma'an HaShabbat *1943: Machane Yisrael *1946: Le'Asireinu *1948: Tzeirei Chabad *1968: Herut *1972: El Har Hashem *1978: Chashmonaim Movement *1979: Tehiya *1982: Shevut Ha'Aretz *1985: Shavei Tziyon References 1904 births 1985 deaths Israeli rabbis Ukrainian rabbis ","title":"Moshe Zvi Segal (rabbi)"},{"id":"53569680","text":"Dutch newsreel from 1979 about the winter period including at the end scenes from both a women's short track race in Genemuiden won by Anneke Zeinstra, and a horse-drawn sleigh race Kortebaanschaatsen (short track skating) refers to an old form of Dutch ice skating tournament that goes back to the 18th century.Kortebaanschaatsen in Atlas vand er Stolk It is not to be confused with the modern speed skating sport known as short track speed skating.

The general definition for this category is that these rulings are those which, being based on the Quran, sunnah, ijma' and 'aql, with due consideration of the physical and spiritual nature of man and its proneness to various deviations and defects, and with a view to various things which are to its benefit and advantage, are not subject to any form of change whatsoever; although they are subject to modulation, depending on the varying states and conditions of a mukallaf (a responsible Muslim). These varying conditions of a mukallaf may be such as travelling, presence in one's home‚Äëtown, compulsion, exigency, or any other ordinary or extraordinary condition.\\"\\".\\" Secondary rules, rules that are specific to the presentations some cases, the situation will become.

He served as abbot of the Rein Abbey from 2010 to 2015.  Biography  = Early life and education = Georg Maria Feurstein was born on 14 October 1958 in Hohenems, Vorarlberg, Austria, to Guntram and Antonio Feurstein. After graduation, he entered Heiligenkreuz Abbey as a novice on 15 November 1977. He studied theology at the Benedict XVI Philosophical- Theological University, which is located at the abbey, from 1977 to 1983. Taking the religious name Christian, he made his solemn profession on 1 November 1981, and was ordained a deacon on 26 December 1981 by Archbishop Franz Jachym. On 23 May 1983, he was ordained in Heiligenkreuz by Cardinal Paul Augustin Mayer, OSB. = Priesthood = In 1983, Feurstein began his priestly ministry as pastor of a parish in Wiener Neustadt, a position he held in 1987, and until 1988 he was an assistant teacher at Heiligenkreuz Abbey. In 1988, he was sent with three other monks to the newly reestablished Stiepel Priory in Bochum, Germany. He was subprior there from 1988 to 1991, pilgrimage director from 1988 to 2001, novice master from 1999 to 2002, and prior from 2001 to 2004. In 2004, he returned to Heiligenkreuz Abbey, where he served as prior and novice master until 2009. During his time in that position, 26 novices entered the abbey, the most in 200 years. In 2009, he once again left Heiligenkreuz, this time to live at Rein Abbey in Styria, Austria. On 8 June 2010, he was unanimously elected abbot, and was confirmed by the congregation on 21 June. His benediction took place on 21 August 2010, performed by Bishop Egon Kapellari. As abbot, he was concerned with the stability of the monastic community and the pastoral care of the parishes the abbey is entrusted with, as well as monastery renovations and improving the abbey's financial situation. The abbey basilica was restored and renovated during his tenure. In 2013, Feurstein was accepted into the Order of the Holy Sepulchre with the rank of Knight Commander with Star, and was invested by Grand Master Cardinal Edwin Frederick O'Brien on 21 September 2013 at the Mondsee Abbey basilica. He resigned from the office of abbot on 9 March 2015 due to his severe heart disease, and returned to Heiligenkreuz Abbey, where he spent the last two years of his life. He died on 12 March 2017 in a hospital in Vienna after a heart transplant. Bishop Wilhelm Krautwaschl said about his death: \\"Abbot Christian was a special phenomenon in all his meetings with his kind and sympathetic charisma.

Career Born in the Melbourne suburb of Middle Park, Knox attended Scotch College before leaving, aged 15, to work as a bank clerk in the State Savings Bank of Victoria.Woodhouse, Fay (2007) 'Knox, Alistair Samuel (1912‚Äì1986)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, accessed online 21 April 2017. From June 1942, he devoted spare time to the Volunteer Defence Corps, transferring to the Naval Auxiliary Patrol in 1943. In 1944 he joined the Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve serving on HMAS Martindale, in the waters off Papua New Guinea until the end of World War II. Following his discharge he returned to the bank, and in 1946 began to study building construction at Melbourne Technical College; during his studies, he started building two houses near Eaglemont. Post-war shortages of building materials led Knox to consider using mudbrick, and in 1947 he built a mudbrick house in Montmorency. He later actively campaigned for banks to lend capital for earth-built housing projects, and as a result he helped popularise and legitimise mudbrick buildings in mainstream society. Largely self-taught, Knox believed that houses should be built using available resources and by working in harmony with the environment. He pioneered an 'Australian' architectural look characterised by a lower, flatter roof line, often with a clerestory to introduce light to the centre of the house and large windows to the living areas to bring the 'outside in'. Second-hand bricks, large eaves, verandahs, natural materials and finishes, adobe walls, timber linings and large beams, brick and slate floors became a feature. These ideals were formed by the strictures of the immediate post-WWII period, as well as his circle of friends in the artistic community, and an independent view of the world. Knox's main influences were Justus Jorgensen at Montsalvat, Francis Greenaway, Walter Burley Griffin and Frank Lloyd Wright. In landscape design Knox was particularly impressed by the work of Ellis Stones and Gordon Ford, whose espousal of 'bush gardens' he helped to promote. As a building practitioner Alistair Knox played a key role in encouraging and facilitating the self-builder movement. By demystifying the building process he helped empower people to build for themselves.Johnson, Murray Alistair Knox in his own words. Accessed: 21 April 2017. Knox was a founding member and fellow (1983) of the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects. After more than 30 years of designing and building Alistair Knox was awarded an honorary degree as a Doctor of Architecture by the University of Melbourne in 1984.  Projects  Nanga Gnulle is one of two houses that Alistair Knox designed in the area of Bendigo. It was designed in the early 1970s, and was built with reclaimed materials, including pieces of the demolished Bendigo Natives Association (ANA) Hall, 19th century railway parts, and bricks made by convicts from Bruny Island. The house is a rare example of Knox's mudbrick modernist style, and in 2017 was granted heritage protection.https://architectureau.com/articles/alistair-knox-designed-mud- brick-house-saved-from-demolition/ Legacy The Alistair Knox Park in Eltham is named after him and many of Knox‚Äôs buildings are heritage listedSearch results: \\"Alistair Knox\\", Victorian Heritage Database.

It is being celebrated since 2011 in more and more countries each year on four continents. World Mime Day is not officially recognized by UNESCO.  Initiators  * Marko Stojanoviƒá, a mime artist from Serbia and president of the World Mime Organisation. * Ofer Blum, a mime artist from Israel and vice-president of the World Mime Organisation. * Jean Bernard Laclotte, a mime artist from France. All three of them are former students of Marcel Marceau.  History  World Mime Day is one of those ideas that occur on different sides of the planet in almost the same time and it should belong to all humanity. The three initiators are probably not the only people that thought of establishing the World Mime Day under this or any other name/title. In 1998 Israeli mime artist Ofer Blum came to Serbia, at that time still called Yugoslavia for a short tour organised by Marko Stojanovic, his friend and classmate from Marcel Marceau International Mime School in Paris. It is than that Blum and Stojanovic first spoke about establishing a World Mime Organisation, not yet under that name and a World Mime Day or as they called it at that time \\"International Day of Mime\\". Marcel Marceau was still alive, so was his school but unfortunately Blum and Stojanovic were not aware of the seriousness of their ideas and they were also preoccupied with their careers. It was only in 2004 that World Mime Organisation was officially registered as a Non- Governmental and Non-Profit organisation in Serbia, where the paperwork was the easiest and the World Mime Day idea was back \\"on the table\\" (where it stayed till 2011). In 2007, Marceau died and again Blum and Stojanovic came back to the idea of establishing the World Mime Day to celebrate the day when Marceau was born - March 22. In April 2011 Jean Bernard Laclotte has sent an e-mail to Stojanovic with the same idea and a developed concept of the \\"Journ√©e Mondiale du Mime\\" except that he wanted to mark the day when Marceau died 22 September. Thanks to Laclotte‚Äôs initiative \\"Journ√©e Mondiale du Mime\\" was celebrated in several countries around the world on September 22, 2011. World Mime Day is celebrated on March 22 in most of the countries but there are still few countries, especially in South America celebrating it on 22 September. World Mime Organisation recognises \\"Journ√©e Mondiale du Mime 2011\\" as the first World Mime Day celebrated.

The proteases within this family have been identified in species of Staphylococcus, Bacillus, and Streptomyces, among others. The two former are more closely related, while the Streptomyces-type is treated as a separate family, glutamyl endopeptidase II.  Identified proteases  Staphylococcus * S. aureus glutamyl endopeptidase GluV8 : The first discovered enzyme of this family, and the most well characterized, was isolated from the Staphylococcus aureus strain V8, and hence better known as \\"V8 protease\\". Other common references to this protease are staphylococcal serine protease, and SspA from its corresponding gene. * S. epidermidis glutamyl endopeptidase GluSE : Also called S. epidermidis serine protease (Esp). * S. warneri glutamyl endopeptidase GluSW : Also referred to as PROM. Bacillus * B. licheniformis glutamyl endopeptidase GluBL * B. subtilis glutamyl endopeptidase GluBS Enterococcus * E. faecalis glutamyl endopeptidase SprE  Function  Glutamyl endopeptidase is in at least some species part of a zymogen activation cascade, with its activity being dependent on proteolytic activation of a pre- form of the protease. GluV8 of S. aureus, for example, is dependent of activation by the metalloprotease aureolysin, and is itself needed for activation of staphopain B. GluSE, GluSW and SprE have been observed to be activated by a metalloprotease in a similar fashion. Proteases of this group hydrolyzes peptide bonds after the negatively charged glutamic acid or aspartic acid, with a higher preference to the former. The pH optimum has been found to lie slightly above neutral pH (7-8) for GluV8 and GluBL. It has been shown that in spite of their similarities, the proteases from different species may differ in their efficiency in cleaving biological targets. The GluV8 is suggested in several mechanisms of S. aureus immune evasion, and GluV8 and GluSE have shown impact on the regulation of biofilms.

A total of 4 sequels of the play were produced from 1985 to 1998, and according to one of the main actors, Predrag Ejdus, the play was performed more than 1800 times, and was performed in almost every city in former Yugoslavia that had a decent theatre. Thanks to its great popularity with the audience, the play launched the carriers of then young and later famous, main actors Josif Tatiƒá and Predrag Ejdus. The play is mostly set as a dialog between a stereotypical Serb, Slobodan Mihajlovic (played by Tatiƒá) and a stereotypical Croat, Bernard Drah (played by Ejdus), both of whom drink heavily. The script derives its capacity to make the audience laugh from the everlasting differences between Serbs and Croats, and the destiny of two people historically, culturally and geographically bound to one another. At first the play may have been seen as controversial due to its departure from then omnipresent dogma of Brotherhood and unity of the two people. The later events of dissolution of Yugoslavia have shown the script to be the predictor of an inevitable divorce. Radoslav Pavloviƒá received an award for Best script at 11th Satire days () in Zagreb, 1986.

A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A partial solar eclipse occurs in the polar regions of the Earth when the center of the Moon's shadow misses the Earth. It was the last of four eclipses that took place that year, the last two that were partial. It was the last four of solar saros 111, the next eclipses of the cycle were on December 13, 1898, December 24, 1916 and January 5, 1935. Description The eclipse took place in the northernmost areas in Antarctica west of the Prime Meridian and includes the northcentral peninsular portion with much of its ice shelf, all of it occurred only in the Western Hemisphere. The eclipse started at sunrise and ended at sunset. At the peninsular portion, it occurred in the late evening hours of December 1. The greatest eclipse was in the Atlantic off the shore of Antarctica just over 75 miles (125 km) south of the Antarctic Circle at 67.8 S & 49.2 W at 3:11 UTC (12:11 AM local time. As the moon moved towards the right on the Moon, in that part of Antarctica north of the South Pole at the 40th meridian west, it was seen as it was moved towards the right as the axis spun at around the 68th parallel south. The eclipse went as far as hundreds of miles (or kilometers) south of East London, South Africa and around the same parallel with Cape Town. The eclipse started at sunrise in the Indian Ocean and ended at sunset in Antarctica. A very small part occurred on the location of the previous eclipse, many areas occurred on the opposite side. At one part of the peninsula, it showed at 1% obscuration, the remainder showed up to over 3.5% obscuration of the sun. The center of the Moon's shadow was missed by about 2,600 km above the area south of the Antarctic Circle.

Belgrade: Mladost, 1975 He was posthumously awarded the Order of the People's Hero. Early life Vukmiroviƒá was born on 1 August 1912 in the Bulgarian town of Bratsigovo. His father , originally from the Montenegrin town of Rijeka Crnojeviƒáa, took part in the Ilinden Uprising in 1903. After the uprising was suppressed, Nikola was imprisoned in the Ottoman Empire later moving to Bulgaria where he married Stojanka with whom he had three sons: Boro, Andro and Rade. In 1914, the family moved to Peƒá where Boro completed elementary school and six grades of gymnasium. At that time, the Peƒá gymnasium had only six grades and further education had to be completed in Prizren for which his parents didn't have the funds. After completing the sixth grade, he found a job as a labour worker. He worked in Peƒá and other places in Kosovo. Pre-Second World War As a young worker, he joined the labour movement. He became a member of the League of Communist Youth of Yugoslavia (SKOJ) in 1932 and a member of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (KPJ) in 1933. Near the end of 1934, he became a bureau member of the Communist Party District Committee for Peƒá.Vojna enciklopedija (eighth edition). Belgrade: 1974 Due to his revolutionary activities, he was sought and arrested numerous times by the police. In 1935, he was arrested and tortured in a police prison in Peƒá. He was then brought before the state court in Belgrade but due to a lack of evidence he was freed. At the first regional KPJ conference for Kosovo and Metohija at the beginning of July 1937, he was chosen as the organizational secretary for the Regional Committee. At the beginning of August 1940, he was chosen as a member of the KPJ Regional Committees for Montenegro, Sand≈æak and Kosovo and Metohija. In October 1940, Vukmiroviƒá was in Zagreb for the Fifth Worldwide KPJ Conference at which he was a candidate for member of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (CK KPJ). He was organizer of numerous strikes, demonstrations and other working-class protests in Peƒá and other places in Kosovo and Metohija such as the large anti-fascist demonstrations on 11 May 1940 and the March demonstrations in Peƒá in 1941. Second World War Vukmiroviƒá and Ramiz Sadiku in 1943 After the invasion and occupation of Yugoslavia in 1941, he worked on connecting party organizations and organizing armed battles in Kosovo and Metohija. First he was member of the Military Committee formed before the Regional Committee but after the arrest of Miladin Popoviƒá, he took over as secretary of KPJ Regional Committee for Kosovo and Metohija. By directive of the CK KPJ, he coordinated ties with Albanian communists and helped them link the Communist Party of Albania with the People's Liberation Struggle. In October 1941, he was named as the political commisar for the Metohija Partisan Unit and in October 1942 he was chosen as a member of the temporary Main Unit of the Kosovo and Metohija Partisan units. He then founded the newspaper Glas naroda (Voice of the People) which he led until his death as a tribune of the KPJ Regional Committee and the People's Liberation Struggle in Kosovo and Metohija. In April 1943, Vukmiroviƒá was in ƒêakovica/Gjakova along with Ramiz Sadiku. At that time, CK KPJ member Tempo Vukmanoviƒá left for Prizren. Boro and Ramiz had agreed to meet him there. On 7 April 1943 en route to Prizren in the village of Landovica, Boro and Ramiz were captured after being wounded in battles with Italian fascists and Albanian fascists known as the Balli Komb√´tar. Knowing that they are high- ranking members of the Yugoslav Partisans, the Balli Komb√´tar members tried to get information on other Partisans from them by torturing them. As Vukmiroviƒá and Sadiku didn't want to inform, it was decided that they were to be executed. On being demanded that they are to be executed individually, they put their arms around one another and shouted slogans supporting the Partisan cause and were executed together (on 10 April 1943). Legacy On 6 March 1945 by decree of the presidency of the Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia, Vukmiroviƒá and Sadiku were posthumously awarded the Order of the People's Hero and were among the first to be recipients. In the years after the Second World War, Boro and Ramiz became a symbol of Brotherhood and Unity of the Serbian/Montenegrin and Albanian people and of the anti-fascist struggle in Kosovo and Metohija. Numerous streets and schools bore their name along with the sports centre in Pri≈°tina. In 1963 on the twenty-year anniversary of their execution, a monument was made in the form of an obelisk with a mosaic and a memorial fountain and it was erected in Landovica in the spot they were executed. Poet Adem Gajtani dedicated the poem Boro dhe Ramiz to them.

It is commonly known and used in Iranian plateau. However, it is sometimes used instead of barley in the form of malt (early stage sprout) for making beer. It is used in numerous Persian pastries, dishes, and desserts. Also, it has been used traditionally in the new year's Haft-Seen table decoration in the form of Sabzeh (wheat grass) and a delicious dessert called Samanu as the symbols of blessing from Ahura-Mazda. This custom has been observed by most of the people on Iranian Plateau and some of the populations in beyond (e.g. some parts of India, Yemen, Lebanon, Russia, and China) for thousands of years maybe as old as emerging of Zoroaster. One of the confections called Sohan is made up of mainly wheat sprout flour. It is a traditional Persian saffron brittle toffee and made in the holy city of Qom. A fine powder of the dried sprout is widely used in Iran and a few other countries as a skin care product (e.g. facial masks) which is not yet approved by the scholar resources.

A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. An annular solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is smaller than the Sun's, blocking most of the Sun's light and causing the Sun to look like an annulus (ring). An annular eclipse appears as a partial eclipse over a region of the Earth thousands of kilometres wide. It was one of two eclipses that took place that year, the only one that took place in the Southern Hemisphere. It was part of solar saros 120. Description The eclipse took place in the southeast portion of the Pacific and the southern part of the South Atlantic oceans. Almost all of Antarctica saw the eclipse except in areas within the 110th meridian east in which it was dark as well as South America's Patagonia (part of Argentina and Chile) and the Falklands (Malvinas) and other islands and a tiny portion of the Cape Colony (now South and North Cape), South Africa within the Atlantic in Africa. The rim of the eclipse included the area north of Puerto Montt and near the lowest point in South America. As the moon moved towards the left on Earth in the Antarctic Peninsula, at the other side of Northern Antarctica that includes the 100th meridian, it was seen as it was moved towards the bottom right, then right then top as the axis spun at around the 69th parallel south. The eclipse began at sunrise east of New Zealand, the Cook Islands and Wallis and Futuna and ended at sunset in the area of Cape Town. The greatest eclipse was in the Antarctic Peninsula at 81.2 S, 114.5 W at 16:31 UTC (9:31 AM local time).

It was erected in about 1790 by an attorney who worked in the town. It was the residence for the next two centuries of many notable people. It is now owned by the Dacorum Borough Council and is Grade II* listed. Ginger family The Bury in 1795 Advertisement for the sale of the Bury in 1797 William Ginger (1742‚Äì1793), an attorney, erected the current building in about 1790. He demolished a manor house on the site, which had previously been owned by his father William Ginger (1699‚Äì1783),Hertfordshire Burials, 1883. who was also an attorney. He appears to have been unmarried because, when he died in 1793 at the age of only 51, the house was inherited by his younger brother Richard Ginger. In 1796 the magazine called the Monthly Mirror published an article about the property, which contained an etching of the house. They described the estate which they called \\"Mr Ginger‚Äôs Villa\\" in the following terms: Shortly after this, Richard Ginger, who had formerly lived in Queenhithe in London, was declared bankrupt and was forced to sell all of his property. A sale notice for all of his inherited Hemel Hempstead holdings was published in the newspapers in 1797 and is shown. The description of The Bury is as follows: William Hilton, a merchant who traded in England and Ireland, bought the property and lived there for about ten years.Morning Post, Tuesday, 27 October 1801, p. 4. He then appears to have moved to Westminster and rented the estate. The Grover family were the tenants for many years. Grover family Harry Grover (1761‚Äì1935) was a resident in The Bury from about 1808 until his death in 1835. He was born in 1761 in Hammersmith. His father was Montague Grover (1723‚Äì1795) and his mother was Letitia Moody. He became a solicitor, and in 1787 he married Sibylla Ehret, who was the granddaughter of the famous botanical artist Georg Dionysius Ehret. The couple lived in Watford for some years, and then in about 1792 they moved to Hemel Hempstead, where they rented several houses before they tenanted The Bury in about 1808 and later bought it. As well as being a solicitor, he became a banker and established the firm Grover and Pollard. The couple had ten children. One of them, Henry Montague Grover, became a notable writer.National Dictionary of Biography.

The couple lived for some time in Scarborough and were members of the Staintondale Hunt. Geoffrey died in 1948 at The Bury. Soon after this, the house was bought by the Dacorum Borough Council and was used as a registry office. Museum and art gallery proposals In 2016, Dacorum Council vacated the building and relocated its registry office to Hemel town centre. Dacorum Heritage Trust, a local history advocacy group, has proposed that the building should be converted into a museum and art gallery, to display a collection of archaeological and historical artefacts from the surrounding area. The project is currently awaiting necessary funding and planning permission to proceed.

Swimming Canada oversees the management of all swim programs throughout the nation and provides the foundation for beginner-level athletes to train towards the elite level, with the chance to attend world championships and the Olympic Games. The national headquarters is located in Ottawa, Ontario, with staff dispersed throughout Canada.  History  The Canadian Amateur Swimming Association was established in 1909, after the preliminary appearance of a Canadian swimmer at the London 1908 Summer Olympics. Robert Zimmerman of Montreal was the first Canadian Swimmer to appear at any Olympic Games, competing in the 100m freestyle, 100m backstroke, and springboard Diving. At the 1912 Summer Olympics, George Hodgson won Canada's first two Olympic swimming medals and set a world record in the 1500 meter freestyle. Elaine Tanner became the first Canadian to win three swimming medals at the Mexico 1968 Summer Olympics. In the Montreal 1976 Summer Olympics, Canadian swimmers accounted for eight of the total 11 medals won by Team Canada. The Canadian Olympic team has brought swimmers to each Olympics games, except for the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, due to a government boycott. Over the past 100 years, Canadian swimmers have earned over 40 medals at the Olympic games, as well as many other successes through World Championship competitions. In the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics, the Canadian women's swim team earned six out of the 22 medals that Team Canada won during the Games. Four of the six medals were earned by 16 year-old Penny Oleksiak, the only Canadian to win four medals in a single Olympic Games. =Meets = Swimming Canada works with local club teams, university teams and national select teams, as well as community members to make annual events possible. * Canadian Swimming Championships: Senior national championship swim meet. Swimmers may range from Olympic athletes to rising Olympic potential who have all qualified for the national time standards (50M) established for that year. * Age Group Championships: A competition divided by gender, for swimmers 18 years and younger. Created for athletes striving to reach the elite-level. This is typically a season-ending, long course (50M) competition that occurs annually at the end of July/beginning of August. Similar to the national competition, swimmers need to qualify for time standards established for their age and that apply to that year of competition. * Trials: The annual competition which results in the selection of the Senior National and Junior National Canadian teams. During the Olympic year this competition will determine the selection for the Canadian Olympic team. This also requires time standards to be met in order to compete and is typically swam long course as well. During an Olympic year the top two people who qualify for FINA A time standards will make the Olympic Team and those events which qualify for a relay (100, 200 Free) will take the top four swimmers to the Games. * Canadian Olympic & Para-Swimming Trails: This competition takes place every four years to determine the selection for the Canadian Olympic and Paralympic swim team. * Speedo Eastern Open: In addition to national championship competitions, Swimming Canada pairs with local organizing committees to run a regional open meet. This meet is for Eastern Canadian clubs and swimmers where specific time standards are established for that area. These meets offer a competitive environment to prepare for trials, exposure to more elite competitions and provides an opportunity to prepare for larger competitions later in the year. * Speedo Western Open: Swimming Canada pairs with local organizing committees to run two regional open meets.

She was best known for overcoming the high rate of infant mortality for Aboriginal children.  Early life  Strehlow was born in Geroldsgruen, the daughter of wood factory owner C.T. Keysser, living there until he died in 1879. She then lived partly with her mother and step- father and with her mother‚Äôs sister Augusta and her grandparents in Theilenhofen and later Gunzenhausen. Her grandfather was the Lutheran pastor at Theilenhofen, Johann Erhard Fischer, who was a co-founder with Wilhelm L√∂he of the Society for Inner Mission in Neuendettelsau in 1850. Her grandmother, Sophia Elisa Marianna (Omeis) Fischer, was also the daughter of a Lutheran pastor. She studied at L√∂he‚Äôs Industry School in Neuendettelsau in 1890 and fell in love with Carl Strehlow in 1892 when he was on his way to Killalpaninna Mission (also known as Bethesda) in South Australia. It is said that they fell in love just 36 hours after meeting. Despite opposition from her family the relationship blossomed, conducted by letter. She came to Australia and on 25 September 1895 she and Carl were married at Point Pass in South Australia. They arrived in Hermannsburg on 5 November after a challenging journey on the mail buggy from Oodnadatta, twice running out of water.  Life in the Northern Territory  Frieda Strehlow and her sewing class at Hermannsberg Mission in 1907. Strehlow had six children at Hermannsburg between 1897 and 1908, during which time the mission buildings were renovated or replaced by new structures. Being a cattle station in a remote area, life was difficult, especially during the droughts, with many privations as regards food and supplies. There were no doctors, so each child‚Äôs birth took place without trained medical help, twice with Carl acting as midwife. Frieda suffered greatly from toothache. Strehlow devoted herself to the younger generation of girls, teaching them basic health practices, how to sew, how to cook and above all how to bring up healthy children in the changed circumstances they were living in. For several years she was the only white woman at Hermannsburg. She learned Aranda fluently and translated several hymns. Due to her psychological isolation, she maintained an enormous correspondence with female friends in Australia and Germany, as well as with her brother Christian Keysser in New Guinea. This is now in the Strehlow Research Centre in Alice Springs. Frieda also kept comprehensive diaries of her time in Central Australia, which offer a unique record of life on the frontier. These were used by her grandson, John Strehlow, to write The Tale of Frieda Keysser: Frieda Keysser and Carl Strehlow, An Historical Biography, Volume I: 1875‚Äì1910. Later life  Apart from a year‚Äôs holiday in 1903 and a visit to Germany in 1910 to place the Strehlow children in German schools, Frieda and Carl spent their entire time together in Australia at Hermannsburg. When Carl‚Äôs health made it necessary to go south in October 1922, they travelled with their youngest son Theo by horse and buggy to Horseshoe Bend where Carl died, leaving her without any means of support. She became matron at Immanuel College in Adelaide until 1931 to support Theo through his education, returning to Germany later that year. During the 1920s she stayed in touch with the Aranda at Hermannsburg, corresponding by letter. Fleeing with millions of others from Silesia before the Red Army advance at the end of World War II, she died in Neuendettelsau in 1957, where she was buried.

He founded Developers Diversified Realty Corporation (now SITE Centers), which at the time of his death was the 4th-largest developer of shopping centers in the United States. In 1979, he purchased the Cleveland Force Major Indoor Soccer League team, and attempted to purchase the Cleveland Browns in 1998. He retired from active business in 1997, and became one of the most generous donors in the United States in his final years. Early life and education Bertram Leonard Wolstein was born to a Jewish family on February 23, 1927, in East Cleveland, Ohio, to Joseph and Sarah ( Lipson) Wolstein. He had an older sister, Malvene. Both his parents were immigrants from the Russian Empire. His father had been born in Minsk, and emigrated to the United States in 1903. Fluent in Yiddish, he was an actor in Yiddish theater for 15 years before taking a job as a fabric cutter for Printz Bierderman Co. and later Keller Kohn Co. His mother was also born in Minsk, and emigrated to the United States in 1904. She worked in clerical jobs for the General Accounting Office and for the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections. The Wolsteins lived in a very small home with another family in East Cleveland. When Bert was 12 years old, they moved into a duplex in adjacent Cleveland Heights, Ohio. The family was poor, and the onset of the Great Depression worsened their financial condition. Wolstein went to work at a young age, and held down a series of jobs while attending local public school: Selling copies of the Cleveland Press newspaper, stocking shelves and working as a cashier at his aunt's store, working as a soda jerk at various local drugstores, selling hot dogs and soft drinks at League Park (a baseball stadium in Cleveland), cleaning home furnaces, shoveling snow from driveways, and selling Christmas trees. He was enterprising, and once made money by selling cold soft drinks from his toy wagon to construction workers building new homes across the street from where he lived. The hard work did not leave him embittered. Even as a boy and young teenager, Wolstein saw hardship as a means of gaining valuable work experienced. The Depression left a profound impact on him. \\"Iris and I never forgot where we came from,\\" Wolstein said in 2003. \\"We were Depression babies, and no matter how much we have or the rare experiences we have encountered along the way, our roots will always be in Cleveland's old Jewish working class neighborhood, Tuscora Road.\\" Wolstein was educated at Parkwood and Boulevard elementary schools and Roosevelt Junior High School. He graduated from Cleveland Heights High School in 1945, and enlisted in the U.S. Navy. He was trained as a pharmacist's mate, and was discharged in 1946 as part of the downsizing of U.S. armed forces. Still debating what to do with his life, Wolstein enrolled in the accounting program at Cleveland College, an adult education institution jointly operated by Western Reserve University and Case School of Applied Science, paying for his education by working part-time coordinating subcontractors for a local building firm. The firm was owned by Harold I. Shur, his future father-in-law. In 1949, Wolstein enrolled at the Cleveland‚ÄìMarshall Law School, an independent JD-granting institution which had formed in 1946. He attended classes at night while working full-time for Kalamazoo Appliances, Harold Shur's home heating and air conditioning business. Wolstein graduated cum laude and seventh in his class from Cleveland-Marshall in 1953, and passed the bar exam that same year. Career =Early real estate development= Wolstein began his business career working in real estate development rather than the law. His wife's family owned L&J; Development, a Cleveland-area home builder. Wolstein went to work for the company, and assisted with the development of several suburban housing projects. Wolstein helped build his first shopping center, the Great Northern Mall in North Olmsted, Ohio, during his tenure with the firm. In 1959, Wolstein returned to the practice of law while continuing to work in real estate. He formed several construction firms with Wilbur J. Horwitz, his personal insurance agent and owner of a local insurance company. Wolstein oversaw the firm's legal business while his partner ran the construction side of things. The firm struggled at first, and incurred heavy debts in order to raise the capital to build the houses it sold. In 1964, one of Wolstein's firms, Scott Construction, received a $725,000 loan ($ in dollars) to build a 350-home development in Twinsburg, Ohio. Wolstein named the development Heritage Hill. The project was so financially successful that Wolstein closed his law practice and began concentrating solely on real estate. =Developers Diversified= In 1965, Wolstein partnered with Hannan Construction Co. and incorporated a new company, Developers Diversified, with the goal of constructing retail shopping centers. Wolstein reached an agreement with Kmart to provide the anchor tenant for his shopping malls. The first Kmart-centered mall opened in 1967. Wolstein set a goal of constructing five malls, but his business proved so successful that within 15 years he'd built 150 shopping centers nationwide. By 1980, Developers Diversified had constructed one in six Kmart stores, and was Kmart's second-largest development partner. Developers Diversified ended its relationship with Kmart in 1980, but continued to build shopping malls around large anchor tenants such as Home Depot, Kohl's, and Wal-Mart. In 1981, Wolstein formed Diversified Equities, an investment company, with his son, Scott Wolstein, and businessman Jim Schoff. In December 1992, Developers Diversified filed to become a publicly held real estate investment trust (REIT). The move was prompted by a nationwide credit contraction that had severely limited Developers Diversified's ability to engage in new projects. The company, now known as Developers Diversified Realty Corp. (DDRC), went public in February, listing its shares on the New York Stock Exchange. The firm sold 9.2 million shares, raising $202 million ($ in dollars). It was the second-largest public offering of common stock ever offered by a newly formed REIT. Bert Wolstein became chairman of the board of directors of the new company, while Scott Wolstein became its chief executive officer. Diversified Equities merged with Developers Diversified in 1993.; ; Wolstein retired from DDRC in February 1997. Having spent most of his life as a freewheeling maverick who operated on hunches and personal relationships, he had become frustrated having to subordinate his decisions to those of a board of directors and stockholders (many of whom had no experience in real estate development). Wolstein retained about 2 million of the firm's 25 million shares, worth about $70 million ($ in dollars), and was given the title of Chairman Emeritus. At the time of his departure, DDRC was the 15th largest shopping center owner in the nation. =Heritage Development= After leaving DDRC, Wolstein formed a new real estate development firm, Heritage Development Co. Having developed golf courses in Aurora, Ohio, and North Canton, Ohio‚Äîboth designed by golf legend Jack Nicklaus‚ÄîWolstein intended to build more golf courses, often in a public-private partnership with local city or county governments. Wolstein had also retained ownership of of land on the east bank of the Cleveland Flats, and intended to use Heritage Development to begin designing, constructing, and operating a wide range of restaurants, bars, dance clubs, and music venues there. Wolstein also expressed interest in building an industrial park in Twinsburg on property he owned there, as well as getting back into the residential housing market. Heritage Development purchased the Renaissance Building, an office building located on Playhouse Square in downtown Cleveland which Wolstein had personally bought in 1988. The company also developed the Bertram Inn and Conference Center and The Marketplace at the Four Corners Shopping Center in Aurora; the Moen Inc. office building in North Olmsted; the Macedonia Commons mall in Macedonia, Ohio; and the Creekview Commons mall in Brecksville, Ohio. In 2003, as the city of Cleveland was debating whether to build a new convention center to replace the existing Cleveland Convention Center, a number of sites were under consideration. Wolstein suggested using the disused, Norfolk Southern rail yard near the Jacobs Field baseball stadium. Wolstein proposed that Heritage Development purchase the Norfolk Southern site and construct a convention center, a 20-story hotel, a retail center with shops and restaurants, and an RTA station. In return, the city would agree to lease the convention center from him for $19.5 million ($ in dollars) a year for 25 years. Cleveland Tomorrow, an alliance of business interests in Cleveland which was pushing for another site, said Wolstein's proposal would cost $64 million ($ in dollars) more than any alternative site. Wolstein angrily faulted their analysis, and called the site selection process highly flawed. No decision on a convention center site was made in 2003. It would be another four years before the city agreed to sell the existing convention center to Cuyahoga County, which built a new convention center on the same site. Sports team ownership =Cleveland Force= On October 3, 1979, Wolstein purchased a majority interest in the Cleveland Force Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL) team from owners Eric Henderson and Frank Celeste for $25,000 ($ in dollars). The team, and the league, were just a year old. Within a year, he had more than doubled fan attendance at games to 5,000 from 2,000. The team struggled to win fans, obtain business community backing, and win games. But by 1983, it was in the playoffs, during which it drew 19,106 fans to its final playoff game. The team won almost two-thirds of its games over the next five seasons, and twice battled for the Eastern Division title. In 1988, the Force became the first Cleveland-area sports team to play for a national championship in 24 years. The team lost the championship series, zero games to four. The Force was the only team in the MISL to turn a profit that year. The team also set a league- high average attendance record of 14,121 fans that season. Wolstein folded the team in 1988, after the league ran into severe financial difficulties and four other MISL teams folded due to bankruptcy. In 2004, when Major League Soccer made a two-team expansion, Wolstein signed a letter of intent to buy one of the franchises and base it in Cleveland. He also pledged to contribute $20 million ($ in dollars) toward the cost of a $110 million ($ in dollars) stadium for the team. His bid ended when he died a month before the league awarded the franchise. =Attempted Cleveland Browns ownership= In 1995, Art Modell, owner of the Cleveland Browns professional football team, suddenly moved the team to the city of Baltimore, Maryland. To settle legal claims made in the wake of the relocation, the Modell and the National Football League (NFL) agreed to allow the Browns name, trademarks, and other indicia to remain in Cleveland if the city agreed to build a new football stadium. The city agreed to do so. With FirstEnergy Stadium due to open in the fall of 1999, a bidding war to see who would own the new team erupted in 1997. Wolstein assembled a group which included backing from retired Browns offensive lineman Dick Schafrath (now an Ohio state senator, former Ohio State University offensive lineman John Hicks, and other retired NFL players. The group quietly informed the NFL of their intent in the summer of 1997, and went public with their bid on January 16, 1998. Football experts believed that the franchise rights would sell for $300 million ($ in dollars) or more. Under NFL rules, Wolstein (the lead partner in the group) was required to personally provide at least 30 percent of the purchase price, and his investors group could contain only 10 or fewer members. According to press reports, Wolstein proposed to pay just 30 percent of the auction price in cash. The NFL would own the remaining 70 percent of the team. In a boost to his efforts, Wolstein recruited retired Browns fullback Jim Brown and area automobile dealer Alan Spitzer as partners in the investment group. Wolstein was bidding against three others: Al Lerner, billionaire owner of MBNA, the nation's second-largest issuer of credit cards; Charles Dolan, founder of HBO and the Cablevision cable television service, and his attorney brother, Larry Dolan; and New York City banker and real estate developer Howard Milstein. As the bidding price rose above $400 million ($ in dollars), Wolstein's bid was seen as increasingly unattractive. On September 8, 1998, the NFL sold the Cleveland Browns franchise rights to the Al Lerner group for $450 million ($ in dollars). Philanthropy Wolstein was a frequent supporter of a number charities and nonprofit organizations throughout the greater Cleveland area for most of his life. One of Wolstein's first major gifts came in 1997, when he and his wife, Iris, donated $750,000 ($ in dollars) to United Cerebral Palsy of Greater Cleveland. The organization used the money to finish a new rehabilitation and workshop center, which it named the Bart and Iris Wolstein Building. The Wolsteins made a $1.5 million ($ in dollars) donation in 2000 to renovate the three-story bell tower at Ohio State University. The renovated facility, renamed the Iris S. and Bert L. Wolstein Football Center, contained new locker rooms, a media center, and recruitment center. Bert and Iris Wolstein donated $100,000 ($ in dollars) to the Cleveland‚ÄìMarshall College of Law in 2001, which helped to fund scholarships for needy law students and to assist the law school in paying architectural fees for a much-needed renovation. In 2002, the Wolsteins donated $1 million ($ in dollars) to renovate Sycamore Hall at the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve University. The structure was renamed Iris S. and Bert L. Wolstein Hall in their honor. The donation allowed the management school to divert resources to the establishment of a new undergraduate program which emphasized entrepreneurship over mathematical models of business management. The Wolsteins also donated $1.5 million ($ in dollars) to endow a professorship at Weatherhead. The combined gift was the largest gifts received by either the school or the parent university in recent years. In January 2003, the Wolsteins donated $25 million ($ in dollars) to both University Hospitals of Cleveland and Case Western Reserve University to enable the construction of a joint medical research building. The , six-story building contained laboratory and office space for 900 biomedical researchers and a 28,000-cage mouse research facility. The structure was named the Iris S. and Bert L. Wolstein Research Building in their honor. In January 2004, The Chronicle of Philanthropy listed Bert and Iris Wolstein as one of the 60 most generous donors in the nation for 2003. Personal life Since childhood, Wolstein had been nicknamed \\"Bart\\" by his family and friends. But as early as 1948, he used the name \\"Bert\\" in public as well. In 1946, Bert Wolstein was playing touch football in Cain Park in Cleveland Heights when the ball landed at the feet of Iris Shur. The couple fell immediately in love, and married on September 11, 1948. The couple had two children: Cheryl (born June 19, 1950) and Scott (born June 24, 1952). =Death= Bert Wolstein's mausoleum at Mayfield Cemetery. Wolstein suffered from a recurrence of cancer throughout his life. A cancerous tumor was removed from his back when he was in his late 20s. In 2000, he underwent operations to remove a cancerous prostate, a cancerous cyst on his neck, and a cancerous thyroid. The cancer recurred a short time later, and had metastasized. He died of a heart attack on May 17, 2004, at Hillcrest Hospital in Mayfield Heights, Ohio. At the time of his death, DDRC owned 400 shopping centers in 44 states, and was the fourth- largest shopping center developer in the nation. He was buried at Mayfield Cemetery in Cleveland Heights. Legacy On October 27, 2004, Iris Wolstein donated $6.25 million ($ in dollars) to the Cleveland-Marshall College of Law in Bert Wolstein's name. The gift included $5 million ($ in dollars) for building renovations, the purchase of new technology, and scholarships for needy students. The remainder of the pledge matched, up to $1.25 million ($ in dollars), money raised for a new law school endowment. The endowment was named for the Wolsteins. It was one of the largest donations in Cleveland State University's history. In January 2005, Cleveland State University renamed its Convocation Center the Bert L. and Iris S. Wolstein Convocation Center in recognition of the 2004 donation to the law school.

Free soilers, they arrived in western Douglas County, Kansas, in July 1854, one month after the territory was opened to settlement. They built a large log house to serve primarily as their living quarters. It had six rooms and was west of the free-state stronghold of Lawrence, Kansas. For protection the family built loop holes for guns into the sides of the house.W. H. T. Wakefield, \\"Early History of Kanwaka Township,\\" unpublished address delivered in western Douglas County, July 4, 1876, pp. 1, 9 (from the Manuscript Div. of the Kansas Historical Society, Topeka, Kans.). Wakefield became the justice of the Squatters' Court, when it was organized August 26, 1854. Because of his position, he was thereafter known as Judge Wakefield. He tried cases involving both northern and southern settlers and until spring 1856 both groups got along without much trouble. That spring southern partisans in the area began a picket of men assigned to watch the house. In August 1856 much trouble erupted between the free-state men and the southern men in eastern Kansas. Free-state men at times garrisoned Judge Wakefield's house. At 2 A.M. on August 16 southern parisans, including Henry T. Titus, attacked the fortress home, but they were unable to take it. Later that day free-state men attacked and destroy the fortress home of Titus, called Fort Titus.John Lawrie, letter to Arthur Lawrie, April 16, 1857, in \\"Letters on the War in Kansas in 1856,\\" Kansas Historical Quarterly, November 1941, Vol. 10, No. 4, p. 376, online in the Kansas Collection website, at http://www.kancoll.org/khq/1941/41_4_gibbens.htm The southern partisans sought retaliation for their string of defeats in August, when not only Fort Titus, but New Georgia's fort, Franklin's Fort and Fort Saunders were all taken by free-state partisans. On the night of September 1, 1856, the southerners burned six houses and one other building, including Judge Wakefield's house. The family lost all their possessions.John H.

EuroLeague historical formats A EuroLeague game in Madrid, in 2009. Starting with the EuroLeague 2009‚Äì10 season, the EuroLeague's first phase was the Qualifying Rounds, which involved eight clubs bracketed into a knockout tournament consisting of two-legged matches. The four survivors of the First Qualifying Round were paired against one another for the Second Qualifying Round, with the two winners playing for the last spot in the EuroLeague Regular Season. All losing clubs in the Qualifying Rounds parachuted down into Euroleague Basketball's second-tier level competition, the EuroCup. The next phase of the old format was the Regular Season, in which 24 teams participated; from the 2009‚Äì10 season to the 2015‚Äì16 season, the participants included 23 or 24 clubs automatically entered into the Regular Season, depending on if there was a Qualifying Round winner. Each team played two games (home-and-away) against every other team in its group. At the end of the Regular Season, the field was cut from 24 teams to 16 teams. Before the 2008‚Äì09 season, the teams were divided into three groups of eight teams each, with the top five teams in each group, plus the top sixth- place finisher advancing. After that, the Regular Season involved four groups with six teams each, with the first four teams in each group advancing. From the 2013‚Äì14 to 2015‚Äì16 seasons, the eight eliminated teams in this stage were dropped down to the 2nd-tier level EuroCup. The setting of the 2014 EuroLeague Final Four, in Milan. Under this format, the second phase, known as the Top 16, then began, featuring the 16 survivors of the Regular Season, drawn into eight-team groups. As in the Regular Season, each Top 16 group was contested in a double round-robin format. The third phase under that format, the Quarterfinal round, was played from the 2004‚Äì05 season to the 2015‚Äì16 season. Before that, only the group winners advanced to the EuroLeague Final Four (see below). From the 2004‚Äì05 season to the 2015‚Äì16 season, the first- and second- place teams from each group advanced. In the quarterfinal round, the first- place team from each group was matched against a second-place team from another group, in a playoff series. Through the 2007‚Äì08 season, the playoff series were held in a best-of-three format, and expanded to a best-of-five format for the 2008‚Äì09 season. Home court advantage in the series went each one of the first-place teams from the previous stage. Under these formats, the EuroLeague Final Four, held at a predetermined site, featured the winners of the four quarterfinal series in one-off knockout matches. The semifinal losers played for third place; and the winners played for the EuroLeague championship. The 2010 EuroLeague Final Four was held on 7 and 9 May, at Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy in Paris, France. The 2011 EuroLeague Final Four was held at Palau Sant Jordi, in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. For the 2012‚Äì13 Euroleague season, the Top 16 was changed from four groups of four teams, to two groups of eight teams. The four best teams in each group then qualified to the league's quarterfinals playoffs round. =Qualifications= Over the years, the EuroLeague usually, but not always, has included national domestic league champions from the leading European club basketball countries. Depending on the country, places in the EuroLeague may have been awarded the years on the basis of: * Performance in their previous season's national domestic league. * Performance over their previous two or three national domestic league seasons. * Contracts with the Euroleague Basketball company. * In addition, the winner of the previous season's 2nd-tier level EuroCup would always received a place. For example, two 2007‚Äì08 season national domestic league champions from ULEB member countries did not compete in the 2008‚Äì09 Euroleague ‚Äî Zadar (Croatia) and Hapoel Holon (Israel). Zadar instead played in the European second-level EuroCup in the 2008‚Äì09 season. Hapoel Holon, however, did not compete in any of the three European-wide continental club competitions ‚Äî not even in the then third-tier level EuroChallenge (which was run by FIBA Europe, instead of Euroleague Basketball) ‚Äî because of financial difficulties. Starting with the 2009‚Äì10 season, and through the 2015‚Äì16 season, the entrance criteria to the EuroLeague changed: * A number of clubs were chosen via a formula based on competitive performance, television revenues, and home attendance, to receive \\"A Licenses\\", giving them automatic entry into the EuroLeague regular season phase. Originally, 13 clubs received A Licenses, with Asseco Prokom Gdynia of Poland becoming the 14th, before the 2011‚Äì12 season. A Licenses were awarded for three years, meaning that the next adjustment of A Licenses would not take place until the 2012‚Äì13 season. However, Euroleague Basketball suspended the A License of Virtus Roma, after the club finished in the bottom half of its national domestic league, in the 2010‚Äì11 season. * Eight clubs received one-year \\"B Licenses\\" into the EuroLeague regular season. Seven of them were directly based on the ranking of the national domestic league in which the clubs competed. The eighth was a three-year \\"wild card\\" license, based on similar factors to the A Licenses; the first such license was awarded to ASVEL of France. * Under this EuroLeague format, the winner of the previous season's EuroCup, received a one-year \\"C License\\" into the EuroLeague regular season. If the same club also qualified for a direct B License into the regular season, via its results in its national domestic league, the C License was then awarded to the club not already qualified for the EuroLeague regular season, that was highest on the EuroLeague entry list. * Eight other clubs received one-year \\"B Licenses\\" into the EuroLeague qualifying rounds, with two advancing into the regular season. =EuroLeague teams that had an \\"A Licence\\"= { - style=\\"vertical-align: top;\\"  * CSKA Moscow * Real Madrid * FC Barcelona * Olympiacos   * Maccabi Tel Aviv * Panathinaikos * Fenerbah√ße * Anadolu Efes   * Baskonia * ≈Ωalgiris * Olimpia Milano } EuroLeague teams that had and lost an \\"A Licence\\" * Virtus Roma * Asseco Prokom * Montepaschi Siena * Unicaja References  External links  * EuroLeague's official website * List of EuroLeague Winners with Rosters * EuroLeague History ‚Äì Stats * InterBasket.net EuroLeague Basketball Forum * EuroLeague's Youtube Channel EuroLeague History of basketball ","title":"EuroLeague historical league formats"},{"id":"53571085","text":"The Story of Molly X is a 1949 American film noir crime film directed by Crane Wilbur and starring June Havoc, John Russell and Dorothy Hart.

In 1992, she became the first women to be elected to serve as a bishop by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA).  Early life and education  April Ulring Larson (born April Ulring) was born in Decorah, Iowa on April 22, 1950. She was the second of five children. After high school, Larson studied music at Luther College in her hometown of Decorah for two years from 1968-1970 before transferring to the University of Iowa in 1970. In 1972, she graduated from the University of Iowa with a degree in vocal music. After graduation, Larson taught music for two years at a Roman Catholic school in Cresco, Iowa. Music had and continues to have a large impact on Larson‚Äôs life. In regard to music, Larson once said: However, feeling drawn to ministry, Larson began seminary at Wartburg Theological Seminary in Dubuque, Iowa in 1974 and graduated in 1977, being one of the first 10 women to do so at Warburg Theological Seminary. Larson has also been presented with Honorary Doctor of Divinity degrees from Wartburg Theological Seminary and Luther College.http://www.vasynod.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/The-Rev-Dr-April- Ulring-Larson-Bishop-Emeritus.pdf  Early career  Larson was ordained into the Ministry of Word and Sacrament in February, 1978.http://www.goodshepherddecorah.org/pastor-april-ulring-larson-to-become- interim-pastor/ After her ordination, Larson spent the next 12 years serving as a parish pastor in Iowa. Over the 12 years, Larson worked at three separate churches. She also served on the Northeastern Iowa Transition Team, became the District trainer of the Search Bible Study congregational lecturers, and was a member of the Iowa District Theological Task Force that authorized Evangelism Guidelines for Congregations. In 1989, Larson became Assistant to the Bishop in the Southeastern Minnesota Synod.  Election as Bishop  Larson was initially reluctant to run for bishop, since no woman had yet become one in North America. While serving as Assistant to the Bishop, Larson would deny requests from various synods to put her name on their ballot. She accepted the La Crosse Synod nomination because she did not know many people in the synod, and was not initially interested in winning, nor did she expect to win. However, Larson was elected Bishop of the Lacrosse Area Synod of the ELCA on June 22, 1992, at the age of 42 and was re-elected twice, in 1996 and 2002. After serving three terms, the maximum term-limit allowed by the ELCA, Larson stepped down after 16 years as the La Crosse Bishop on October 1, 2008.  Work as Bishop  As bishop, Larson oversaw the La Crosse Area Synod, which included 43,600 members from 81 congregations in 10 counties in western Wisconsin and southeastern Minnesota. Larson participated in service as a member of the Lutheran World Relief Board and the Luther College Board of Regents. She was a member of the Executive Committee and Chair of the Agenda Committee of the Conference of Bishops of the ELCA, served from 1988 to 1993 as a member of the ELCA Task Force on the Study of Ministry, and spent two years as President of the Wisconsin Council of Churches. Additionally, Larson has contributed through artistic pursuits. She has written chapters in Augsburg/Fortress books and was a writer for Word & World. In 1996, she was the choral director for the La Crosse Area Synod All Saints Choral Fest. In the church wide election for Presiding Bishop, Larson was the runner-up and in 2001, she was a finalist for Presiding Bishop. She was the preacher at the installation of Bishop H. George Anderson in 1995 and served as a commencement preacher at five ELCA seminaries. Furthermore, she received the Wittenberg Award from the Luther Institute in Washington, D.C. and the Distinguished Service Award from California Lutheran University.  Lutheran World Federation in Hong Kong  In 1997, April Ulring Larson was a delegate to the 50th Anniversary of the Lutheran World Federation (LWF). While there, she presided at the Eucharist that symbolized the mark of the 50th anniversary of the LWF. This was the first LWF where almost half of the delegates who were in attendance were women. At the conference, they reaffirmed the LWF‚Äôs commitment to ordaining women but also acknowledged that some of the member churches differed in their commitment to this goal.https://www.lutheranworld.org/sites/default/files/archives-section/LWF- Assemblies-since-1947.pdf Ten years after the LWF assembly in 1997 in Hong Kong, Larson was also a delegate and as a presenter at the 60th Anniversary Assembly in Lund, Sweden.http://chippewa.com/news/state-and-regional/april- ulring-larson--present/article_5098ed42-99c8-5dfb-8ab1-9000bc1c6596.html  Influence on Women in Ministry  The ELCA, which is the largest Lutheran denomination in the United States, first began to ordain women in 1970. When Larson was elected Bishop, she became the second female Lutheran bishop in the world, and the first in North America. Additionally, Larson was the first to be elected by a synod. The election of Larson as bishop began a wave of women in ministry throughout the ELCA with three women, including Larson, becoming candidates to serve as the presiding bishop of the ELCA in 1995. By 2001, the next election, that number had increased to seven. Also in 2001, Margarita Martinez, a woman of color, became a bishop for the Caribbean Synod. The number of clergywomen in the ELCA had increased to 2,573 by 2002, the same year that the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada (ELCIC) elected its first female Bishop with the election of Cynthia Halmarson. By 2008, 7 of the 65 bishops in the ELCA were women and 10 were by 2017.http://download.elca.org/ELCA%20Resource%20Repository/Bishops_and_Synods_Map_at_a_Glance.pdf?_ga=1.101355138.2045223404.1484454239 In 2013 the ELCA elected its first female presiding bishop with the election of Elizabeth Eaton.http://www.christianpost.com/news/elca-assembly-elects- first-female-leader-of-denomination-102365/ By 2016 35 percent of the 9,250 active and ordained clergy in the ELCA were women, which grew from only 20 percent in 2000. Currently, 50 percent of seminary students are women.  Personal life  After graduating from the University of Iowa, Ulring married Judd Larson, and the two attended Wartburg Theological Seminary together, and would later serve as co-pastors together in Iowa for three parishes. They had twin daughters in 1978, both of whom became physicians, and each have three children. In 1984, Larson gave birth to a son, Ben. Ben graduated from Luther College in 2006 and went on to Wartburg Theological Seminary, but died in 2010 while on a mission trip in Haiti during the 2010 Haiti earthquake.

She was known for a violent disposition. She is credited with saving most of the band of the 6th Massachusetts Regiment from certain lynching in April 1861, at the outbreak of the American Civil War. Background Manley, and her husband James, were Whigs, and later American Party, loyalists who operated a brothel on Eastern Avenue in the Fell's Point of Baltimore and were among \\"the most desperate characters\\" in the red light district. James Manley was a party \\"rough\\", responsible for harassing and attacking Democrats, and intimidating voters on election day; he was associated with the party's street enforcers, the Plug Uglies. His political connections helped him secure patronage jobs, including a long stint of service as a city night watchman. This was despite his having been arrested at least once for beating Ann. Ann herself had been arrested on at least one occasion for severely beating one of her prostitutes and was known to have a penchant for brawling. According to a period report in The Baltimore Sun, Ann Manley was also arrested in 1852 after attacking a police officer who was \\"beaten very severely, having been struck repeatedly\\". On May 8, 1850, James and Ann, while on a stroll, passed the house of the local Democratic boss, George Konig. Konig's wife, Caroline, was standing on the porch and James told Ann to beat the \\"damn bitch\\". Konig appeared and intervened. James returned later and shot Konig in the chest; the wounds were serious but non-fatal. As soon as Konig had recovered, a Plug Uglies gang under James's command unsuccessfully made another attempt to murder him. In 1853 Manley was convicted of attempted murder over the 1850 shooting and sentenced to six years in prison. Fortunately for him, in 1857 fellow Know Nothing Thomas Holliday Hicks was inaugurated Governor of Maryland and promptly pardoned him. Despite Konig and Manley's occasional attempts to murder each other, they appeared to view their rivalry as professional and Konig even wrote a letter in support of Manley's pardon. Rescue of the 6th Mass. band The 6th Massachusetts Regiment fights its way through Baltimore. On April 19, 1861, the 6th Massachusetts Volunteer Regiment arrived via train in Baltimore en route to Washington, D.C., where it had been called to fortify the city against what was believed to be impending attack by the Confederate States. The main body of the 6th Massachusetts proceeded out from the President Street Station on foot to make a connecting train at Canton Depot, temporarily leaving its 24-piece band posted at the first station. As the regiment entered downtown Baltimore it was beset by Baltimoreans, outraged at the presence of Massachusetts troops in Maryland, and had to fight its way through the city, during the course of which at least three soldiers were stoned to death, one soldier was dragged to the sidewalk and beaten to death, and many more were injured from gunfire directed at them from rooftops. Part of the mob, upon learning that the regimental band remained at the President Street Station, ended its attacks and returned to the station. This faction was led by Konig and it began stoning the railway car in which the bandsmen were waiting, injuring several. At this point the unit separated in two and fled the station, each element pursued by Konig's men. The first group was rescued by the Baltimore Police while the second became lost in the maze of streets and alleys of Fell's Point. A \\"rough looking man\\" intercepted the fleeing bandsmen and yelled either \\"Follow me\\" or \\"This way, this way, boys.\\" The soldiers followed the man up a narrow side alley to the Manley brothel where Manley hurried each inside before bolting the front door. Manley personally carried one bandsman, who was bleeding from a head wound, to the relative safety of the second floor of the building. There, she dressed the soldiers' wounds and fed them \\"at her own cost\\". For reasons unclear, Manley had a large collection of men's clothing and the soldiers used it to disguise themselves so that they could later safely travel through Baltimore. Upon returning to the train station they found the bodies of two bandsmen who had been separated from the main group and lynched. Manley forwarded the soldiers' uniforms and instruments, which they had left at her brothel, to the train station and the surviving members of the band took the next train to Philadelphia. Personal life With James Manley, Ann Manley had at least one son, also named James. Legacy In Elizabeth Cady Stanton's book History of Woman Suffrage, Manley is compared to Mary Magdalene, \\"with a pity as divine as that of the woman who anointed the feet of our Lord and wiped them with the hair of her head\\".

The association was founded in March 1894 at a meeting in the Brisbane Town Hall with approximately 110 members. Mrs John Donaldson was the founding president and Charlotte Eleanor Trundle was the secretary. The initial aim of the association were to secure the right to vote for every adult women. At the second general meeting of the association on 27 April 1894, Emma Miller was elected president and the wording of a petition to be presented to the Queensland Parliament was agreed. Unlike the original aim of the association, the petition called for \\"granting to white women the franchise, embodying the principle of one adult one vote and one only\\", rejecting the system of plural voting then used for men. By rejecting plural voting, the association was strongly aligning itself with the labour movement in Queensland which supported the principle of \\"one man, one vote\\". After the Federation of Australia, the Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902 gave white women the right to vote in federal elections and the right to stand for election to the Australian Parliament. It was not until 1905 that the Queensland Parliament passed the Elections Act Amendment Act to allow women to vote (but not stand) in Queensland state elections. On 4 May 1905, the Women's Equal Franchise Association held a social event at the Brisbane Trades Hall to celebrate obtaining the franchise for women in Queensland and disbanded the organisation. Postscript  The 1907 state election, held on 18 May 1907, was the first Queensland state election at which women were entitled to vote. In 1915, women were allowed to stand for election to the Queensland Parliament.

Background  The Tabqa Dam in 2014 The SDF, moving to take Raqqa, positioned themselves around the city as part of the second phase of the operation. However, as part of this, they encountered IS forces dug in around the Tabqa Dam, west of Raqqa city.

Probing attacks took place in January 2017, when U.S. special forces crossed the Euphrates in amphibious raids, including the raid against ISIL by combined SDF and U.S. special forces on the Tabqa Dam and the nearby city of al-Thawrah (al-Tabqah). Following the raids, ISIL counterattacked the SDF positions, but the counterattacks were largely repelled.  The offensive  = Assault on Tabqa Dam and Tabqa Airbase = SDF fighters near Tabqa Dam On 22 March, the SDF began an assault to capture the Tabqa Dam, al-Thawrah (al-Tabqah; Tabqa) city, and the Tabqa Airbase. 500 SDF fighters and U.S. special forces from CJTF‚ÄìOIR were airlifted by helicopters of the United States military across the Euphrates river and Lake Assad, and were dropped on the Shurfa Peninsula to the west of Tabqa city. The attack was supported by artillery support from United States Marines, as well as air support. SDF and US forces also landed on the Jazirat al-'Ayd Island (or Peninsula) to the west of Tabqa Dam, capturing it as well. An anti-ISIL coalition spokesman announced that the advance had cut off the highway linking the Aleppo, Deir ez-Zor, and Raqqa Governorates. He added that around 75-80% of the attacking force consisted of Arab fighters, with the rest being Kurds. The SDF stated that the advance was also meant to block any advance on Raqqa by the Syrian Arab Army from the west. The operation was described by Pentagon spokesman Eric Pahon as a large high-priority offensive to secure the area both around Tabqa and the associated Tabqa Dam. The airlift of forces behind enemy lines enabled SDF and US forces to cut the road to Raqqa from the west. Four towns were also seized as part of the amphibious landing.

The assault on the dam was spearheaded by SDF fighters who were backed by United States Special Operation Forces. It was also reported that the SDF had captured eight villages to the southwest of Tabqa city. Amaq meanwhile claimed SDF had withdrawn from the dam. Jabhat Thuwar al-Raqqa claimed online that the SDF had captured the Tabqa Airbase; however, Al-Masdar News stated that the SDF's open room had stated that the claim was completely fabricated. A boat carrying SDF fighters across Lake Assad On 26 March, the SDF captured two villages to the east of Tabqa. It was also reported that ISIL was shelling the surroundings of Tabqa Dam with heavy weaponry. On the same day, ISIL claimed that Tabqa Dam was on the verge of collapse and that all the floodgates were closed. The dam was reported to have become inoperable, which ISIL claimed was due to Coalition bombing and artillery strikes, though the SOHR stated that the actual reasons were unknown, adding that ISIL still held its main building and turbines. SDF however denied that it had been hit, while RISBS (Raqqa is Silently Being Slaughtered) stated that ISIL was informing fleeing civilians that the dam was safe. Additionally, the US-led Coalition stated that the Tabqa Dam was structurally sound, and that the dam had not been targeted by any airstrikes. They also stated that the SDF controlled an emergency spillway at the northern part of the dam, which could be used in the event of an emergency. On the same day, SDF spokesman Talal Silo announced that SDF had stormed the Tabqa military airport, and had taken sixty to seventy percent of it. They later announced that they had completely captured the Al-Tabqa Airbase, following a 24-hour battle. ISIL fighters stationed at Tabqa Airbase were reported to have withdrawn northward, to Tabqa city. Additionally, SDF forces captured two villages near the airbase during the advance. ISIL was reported to have reversed an earlier evacuation order in Raqqa, stating that the dam was safe and ordered civilians to remain in the city.\\"IS conflict: Raqqa warning over 'risk to Tabqa dam'\\" - BBC 26 March 2017 A day later however SDF announced they were temporarily pausing their offensive for the dam. Later in the day, a spokeswoman of the SDF announced that engineers who had been permitted to check the dam and its operations did not find it was damaged or malfunctioning. On 28 March, ISIL deployed an additional 900 fighters to the Tabqa District, in an attempt to stop the SDF advances. = Besieging Tabqa city = Toyota Hilux and other technicals of the YPG and YPJ near Tabqa On 29 March, the SDF cut the road between al-Thawrah (al-Tabqah) city and Raqqa. The SDF stated that ISIL had shelled the Tabqa Dam during the day, causing repair work to be temporarily paused. On 31 March, SDF forces attacked the town of Al-Safsafah, to the east of Tabqa, nearly besieging the city. The SDF and some activists stated on 2 April that it had repelled a major ISIL counterattack to the northeast of Tabqa city, near the Tabqa Dam, and near the Tabqa airbase. They also continued to advance in villages to the east of Tabqa city. On the same day, it was reported that SDF had completely besieged al-Thawrah (al- Tabqah) city, with Kurdish activists stating that two SDF units linked up to the east of the city. SOHR, however, stated that they were still trying to besiege the city. SDF fighters continued battling for Safsafah and Ibad, on the next day, to fully encircle Tabqa. On 3 April, it was reported that ISIL was possibly in the process of moving its capital from Raqqa city to Mayadin, in the Deir ez-Zor Governorate. This followed months of gradual relocation of resources and senior ISIL leaders from Raqqa to Mayadin. SDF entered and besieged Safsafah on 5 April, thus also besieging Tabqa city while claiming that it had also taken control of a major part of Safsafah. The village was captured by the next day, resulting in SDF completely encircling Tabqa city. The SDF captured Ibad village, to the east of Safsafah, on 9 April, further expanding their control in eastern countryside of Tabqa, while more than 25 ISIL fighters were killed in the clashes. ISIL also launched unsuccessful counterattacks on Safsafah, while also attacking Al-Tabqa Airbase. The SDF captured another village near Tabqa on the next day. On 11 April, the US-led Coalition reported that the SDF had captured 60% of Tabqa Dam, and that they were \\"very close\\" to liberating the dam. On 13 April, the United States military stated that CJTF-OIR had bombed a SDF fighting position near Tabqa as it was misidentified as belonging to ISIL. It added that the airstrikes resulted in deaths of 18 SDF fighters. = Battle for Tabqa city = A SDF fighter stands in a destroyed area of Tabqa On 15 April, the SDF advanced within \\"hundreds of metres\\" from Tabqa, and fighting reached two suburbs of the city. Later on the same day, the SDF entered al-Thawrah (al-Tabqah) from the east and the west, capturing the entire Alexandria suburb in southern Tabqa, bringing 15% of the city under SDF control. On 17 April, the SDF advanced further, bringing 20% of Tabqa city under their control. Also on 17 April 2017, it was announced that 200 fighters from the Manbij Military Council would participate in this part of the battle, with a total of 350. On 18 April, the SDF captured the ISIL radio station in the city. In the following days, SDF decided to accelerate their operations in Tabqa and by 22 April managed to secure a quarter of the city. IRPGF fighters crossing the Lake Assad by boat SDF advanced in Tabqa city again on 30 April. It stated that it had captured six more districts and ISIL only controlled the northern part of the town near Tabqa dam. SOHR stated that SDF controlled at least 40% of the city, including more than half of the Old City area. Later on the same day, it was reported that the SDF had captured at least 60% of the city. On the next day SDF stated that it had completely captured the Old City area, leaving ISIL in control of only the newer areas of the town alongside the dam. SOHR stated that they controlled about 80% of the city. On 2 May, SDF stated that it had captured about 90 percent of the town amid reports of negotiations between Kurdish fighters and ISIL to allow the latter to withdraw from the remaining areas under its control. By 3 May, SDF had almost captured the whole city except in a small northern area and district near the dam. ISIL also carried out counterattacks in and near Tabqa. It was later reported that a deal had been reached to allow remaining ISIL fighters to withdraw from the city as well as the dam. SDF and its commanders however denied any deal had been reached, adding that clashes were still ongoing against ISIL in a village near Tabqa and the three northern districts of the town including some militants who were hiding among civilians. = End of the battle = SDF fighters raise their flag in Tabqa By 10 May, there were still two ISIL holdouts in the Tabqa area. On one side, 14 Chechen and French African ISIL fighters, members of the elite Ingimassayeen units, still held the control room, the floodgates, and a number of tunnels inside Tabqa Dam. Even though they were left without light or fresh air, as the SDF had shut down all electricity to the dam, and without means to communicate with their allies because the coalition jammed their radio frequencies, these ISIL fighters had resisted attempts to clear them out for weeks. The second, bigger holdout was in northern Tabqa city, where around 50 ISIL militants still defended a number of highly fortified apartments. In course of 10 May, however, this last resistance was finally broken, when the remaining ISIL defenders surrendered or fled. According to the United States Central Command, the Islamists had acceded to SDF's demand of dismantling the IEDs surrounding the dam. The anti- ISIL coalition stated that it tracked those militants who fled and targeted those who could be killed without harming civilians. At 16:00 on that day, SDF commander Rojda Felat stated that the Tabqa Dam had been completely brought under control of the SDF. SDF conducted clearance operation after the capture and hunted for any remaining ISIL holdouts in addition to carrying out de- mining operations.

The pilots are mainly former militia pilots who are no longer active in the militia combat aircraft squadrons because of their age. The Pilatus Porter was an ideal transport aircraft at the time of the first helicopters, with its considerably higher load capacity. In 1967 a first tranche of 12 Pilatus PC-6 Porters was procured. This version of the PC-6 H2M was still equipped with a piston engine. With the procurement from 1978 a second tranche of 6 new turbo-porters were bought and the piston engine-porter converted to PC-6 with turbo engine. At this times Dornier DO-27 were also used for Lufttransport Staffel 7. In earlier years, the \\"Light Transport Squadron 7\\" operated the Porter not only for droping off the parachute reconnaissance troops, for fighting against forest fires, the aircraft could be converted with a water tank. But this was abandoned when the Alouette III and the Bambibucket made it possible to discard larger quantities more precisely. Even training sessions as spray aircraft with chemical substances for the AC exercise of troops could be carried out. However, this is no longer practiced today. Ever since, the Lufttransport Staffel 7 has also carried out its flight operations from temporary airfields. Its home base has been the Milit√§rflugplatz Emmen since the year 2000, before was the military airfield St. Stephan the home base, but this is no more a military airbase. The Lufttransport Staffel 7 drop off parachute reconnaissance units from heights of up to 8000 meters above sea level. It carries out take-offs and landings from makeshift places on the ground for the tactical deployment STOL. In addition, passenger and material transports and connecting flights are carried out for the most varied locations. The service of Lufttransport Staffel 7 is not limited to the repetition course of the Parachute Reconnaissance Company 17. Throughout the whole year, the pilots ensure the service of the parachute reconnaissance school 83 in Locarno with individual service days. Also the creation of aerial photographs (not to be confused with the airphotography for the cartography) belongs in the varied task area. Nowadays the Lufttransport Staffel 7 still has 15 Pilatus PC-6, 14 of them are in olive-green camouflage color.

At that point, it was equipped with Northrop F-5 and used the military airfield of Turtmann as a designated war base. Fliegerstaffel 1 carried a stylized Vogel Rokh as its coat of arms, a red background and a white figure 1 completed their emblem.  History  = Early years = A first precursor was set up in 1913 as a pioneer company 1. At that time, the Kriegstechnische Abteilung (KTA) rented some machines from private ownership for experimental and evaluation purposes, e.g. A Bl√©riot XI owned by Oskar Bider. On the outbreak of the First World War, the aircraft groups, now designated as Military Aircraft Division 1, did not have a single aircraft of their own. Imports from abroad were no longer possible because of the war. The first commander of the aircraft groups, Hptm (Captain) Theodor Real, had to requisition aircraft from private ownership. The first real combat aircraft was a German aircraft who made an emergency landing 1916 in Bettlach, an interned Fokker D.II. In 1917, five Nieuport 23 aircraft, built in France, were bought and remained operational until 1921. From 1920 a total of 27 used Fokker D.VII were bought, which together with the H√§feli DH-5, developed and built in Switzerland, formed the stock for the first two aircraft squadrons. = Development from 1924 = In 1924, the Fliegerkompanie 1 was set up and started with the H√§feli DH-5 and Fokker D-VII to operate from airfields at Lucerne, Payerne, Seedorf and La Chaux-de-Fonds. In 1933, the Fokker CV was added, and the C-3603 in 1942. The renaming into Fliegerstaffel 1 took place 1945 and but soon the name changed into the French designation Escadrille 1 in 1946, after moving to Payerne. Until 1951 the aircraft used was the Morane D-3800 was in use. From 1951 to 1959 the Escadrille 1 used its first jet aircraft, the De Havilland D.H. 100 Vampire, at the Payerne Air Base. In 1955, the return to D√ºbendorf and the change of name back to Fliegerstaffel 1 took place. Near the main entrance of the D√ºbendorf Air Base is located a monument with the emblem of Fliegerstaffel 1, Vogel Rokh. In 1959, the Hawker Hunter was re-trained on the wartime airbase. Fliegerstaffel 1 was chosen to show the Hawker Hunter in formation flight to the public until 1964. The team consisted of Hptm Brunold, Oblt Pellanda, Lt Spychiger and Adj Br√ºlhart. The aerobatics team of the Fliegerstaffel 1 was renamed Patrouille Suisse in 1964 on the occasion of the Expo 64. In 1981, the Fliegerstaffel 1 got equipped with the Tiger F-5 and moved to the military airfield of Turtmann, where the aircraft was operated from the aircraft cavern, while the Patrouille Suisse still used the Hawker Hunter. 2003 was the last service course in Turtmann.

In 1955 it flew the De Havilland D.H. 112 Venom and was based at the Military Airfield of Ulrichen until 1982. In 1983, still on the military airfield of Ulrichen, Fliegerstaffel 2 took over the Hawker Hunter. The Fliegerstaffel 2 operated the Hunter up to its end. During this time, the Fliegerstaffel 2 relocated its flight operations to the (Hardened aircraft shelter) U-20 on the Payerne Air Base. In 1992 the military airfield Turtmann, where aircraft operations took place out of anAircraft cavern, became a short time new home base of the Fliegerstaffel 2. The Fliegerstaffel 2 was disbanded 1994 with the withdrawal of the Hawker Hunter in the Swiss Air Force. During the last service in 1993 a Hawker Hunter with the registration J-4138 was marked with white color on the left side and on the right side with red color as reference to the Canton of Valais. Since the color was not water resistant, the aircraft was not allowed to fly at that time.

From 1939 the Fliegerstaffel 6 was in operation Dewoitine D.27. From 1939 to 1946, the Fliegerkompanie 6 used the Messerschmitt Bf 109 from the Air Base Zweisimmen. Leutnant Hans Thurnheer from the Fliegerstaffel 6 was the first Swiss combat pilots who shoot down an enemy: On May 10, 1940, he was involved in a firefight with a Heinkel He 111, who resisted following the order to land, and opened fire. After Lieutenant Thurnheer had shot the He 111, the latter left the Swiss airspace. Fliegerstaffel 6 was involved in air battles over the Jura in June 1940 and scored 2.5 confirmed killings (1.5 He 111 and one Bf 110). In 1945, the squadron was renamed to Fliegerstaffel 6. After the Second World War, the Fliegerstaffel 6 received D-3800 and D-3801 Morane. These flew only for a short time at Fliegerstaffel 6. From 1951 on the Fliegerstaffel 6 flew with De Havilland D.H. 100 Vampire as one of the first front squadrons. The Vampires stayed at the Fliegerstaffel 6 until 1959. From 1960 to 1978, the Vampire was replaced by the successor, the De Havilland D.H. 112 Venom. In 1978 the Fliegerstaffel 6 was re-trained on the Hawker Hunter at Sion Airport. In 1983 was the re-training on the F-5 Tiger and Payerne Air Base became the new home base of Fliegerstaffel 6. The Fliegerstaffel 6 is a militiasquadron, all pilots fulfill their military service obligation in the squadron and are otherwise active in different professions, which do not necessarily have to have a connection with the aviation. The pilots of the Fliegerstaffel 6 come from the French-speaking cantons of Switzerland. The Fliegerstaffel 6 has no aircraft specifically assigned to it and use the aircraft of the Tiger fleet like the other squadrons on availability. However, it is a F-5E Squadron / militia squadron of the Swiss Air Force, who has, with the F-5E J-3033, its own squadron aircraft with a permanent squadron painting (similar to the J-3073, J-3038, J-5011, J-5017 and J-5018 of the Fliegerstaffel 8, 11, 17 18 and 19). The Fliegerstaffel 6 is also called \\"Ducks\\" and celebrated its 90th anniversary in 2015, and created for this birthday a special squadron badge.

It is planned to introduce a successor model for the F-5 and F /A-18 for the Swiss Air Force by 2025. It is not yet clear which squadrons will continue to exist with the new aircraft.

The badge itself was an isosceles triangle with a black border that stood on top.  History  In 1925, the unit was founded as 'Fliegerkompanie 7' . The aircraft types Fokker CV and Potez were first used in 1937. 1940 were they replaced by the new Messerschmitt Bf 109, which remained in use until 1947, whereby in 1945 the pilots of the Fliegerkompanie were regrouped into their own unit, Fliegerstaffel 7. From 1951 to 1973 the Fliegerstaffel 7 used jet aircraft De Havilland D.H. 100 Vampire along with De Havilland D.H. 112 Venom, which were in use from 1963 to 1974. From 1975 to 1983, Fliegerstaffel 7 was equipped with Hawker Hunters at Meiringen. From 1984 to 1991, the squadron had its homebase at Interlaken Airport.

The aircraft was mostly blue, with yellow wing roots and air inlets and a part at the stern leading to the engine exhaust, which gave the hunters' aerodynamic shape a good effect. Also the auxiliary tanks under the wings received a blue top. Their ground forces unit was Fliegerkompanie 9, whose emblem it carried on the right front fuselage. In the years 1992 and 1993, the squadron operated in the Italian speaking part of Switzerland at their war- time homebase in Ambri-Piotta. In 1994, Fliegerstaffel 7 was back at its old home on the military airfield of Meiringen and by the end of the year, the Hawker Hunter was taken out of service and the Fligerstaffel 7 disbanded.

From 1940 to 1949 the Messerschmitt Bf 109 E was used. In 1945, Fliegerstaffel 8 was created out of the pilots within Fliegerkompanie 8. The squadron was equipped with De Havilland DH-100 Vampire from 1950 to 1959. In the fall of 1956, Fl St 8 completed a training course at Meiringen, flying their first missions out of Aircraft caverns. During the retraining phase on the Hawker Hunter in Emmen and the following services, Oblt Paul Habegger shot an 8-mm film named \\"Bambini Vandalo\\". The film documents the work of the pilots of a Hunter squadron in the sixties. From 1959 to 1975 the flight operation with Hawker Hunter took place from Meiringen Air Base, from 1976 until 1980 from Alpnach Air Base. Since 1980, the squadron has his home base at the Meiringen Air Base. During the planned dismantling of the Hunter fleet, two Tiger squadrons should be re-trained for ground combat in a second role. In addition to the professional pilots Fliegerstaffel 1, the militia Fliegerstaffel 8 was selected for this task but cancelled shortly later. In 1993, the first F-5E Tiger with the tailnumber J-3088 (now wearing the colors of the Patrouille Suisse) received the Fliegerstaffel 8 badge. Like all Swiss squadrons, however, the Fliegerstaffel 8 does not have any aircraft specifically assigned to it. However, as a militia squadron of the Swiss Air Force, it has, with the F-5E J-3073, an aircraft with a permanent squadron painting. Air policing and identification of foreign aircraft became a major task of the Fliegerstaffel 8. The future of the Fliegerstaffel 8 is, like for the other two F-5 squadrons, the Fliegerstaffel 19 and Fliegerstaffel 6 uncertain. This is because the F-5 is expected to be phased out in 2018. It is planned to introduce a successor model for the F-5 and F /A-18 for the Swiss Air Force by 2025. It is not yet clear which squadrons will continue. With the procurement of modern, complex combat aircraft, it is foreseeable that they can't be used effectively by non-professional militia pilots.

The Fliegerstaffel 11was the first time as an observer on the NATO Tiger Meet 1981 at Bitburg. The pilots traveled with the Beechcraft Twin Bonanza A-711, this aircraft with the yellow bottom was adorned with tiger stripes, on the engines and a red shark mouth. As of 1991, Fliegerstaffel 11 was no longer just an observer at the Tiger Meet but as a full member with the F-5E. However, there was no special paint, only a new, color-changed squadron emblem on the front. In 1994 and 1996, the pilots from Fliegerstaffel 11were again only as observers with the Learjet 35 T-781 at the tigermeet. From 2002 on as active member with the F / A-18. The Fliegerstaffel 11 won the award Silver Tiger Trophy in 1982 and 2008. From 24 to 27 March 1983 and from 17 to 21 October 1986, the Fliegerstaffel 11 was the host of the Mini Tiger Meets at Meiringen. From 11 to 14 March 2005 the Fliegerstaffel 11 was the organizer of the Snow Survival Exercise in Sion. Because of these Tigermeets usually one or more aircraft of ‚Äútigersquadrons‚Äù received a special \\"tiger\\" painting. In 2003 it was decided to do it as well with a F/A-18C for the Fliegerstaffel 11. The choice was the F / A-18C with the registration J-5011, the 11 for theFliegerstaffel 11. However, the machine received no major change for the first time, only the additional tank and the AIM-9 Sidewinder dummys on the wingtiprails got a tigerstyle paint. In 2004, the aircraft received a permanent color scheme. This machine is used for TigerMeeting events. In normal flight operation the J-5011 is given priority to the squadron commander of Fliegerstaffel 11, but is also flown by other pilots. If the current F/A-18 Hornet Solo Display pilot is from the Fliegerstaffel 11, he will fly the J-5011, if possible. Fliegerstaffel 11 was the first squadron of the Swiss Air Force which received an aircraft with a permanent special painting, and a few years passed until the Fliegerstaffel 17, Fliegerstaffel 18 and Fliegerstaffel 19 also got their own squadron aircraft. = Accidents = On 23 October, a two-seat F/A-18D crashed into the mountain Lopper near the Pilatus. The pilot Stefan \\"Stiwi\\" J√§ger of the Fliegerstaffel 11 and the Aviation medical examiner Volker Lang of the Aeromedical Center (AMC) as passenger were killed.Es war ein Pilotenfehler!

In: Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung, October 24, 2013. As a result of the Aviation accidents and incidents investigation of the Military justice, a \\"misconception of the situation\\" has been determined by the pilot as the reason for the controlled flight into terrain. In the investigation report, the investigator of the military jury recommended, on the one hand, that passenger flights should be carried out on combat aircraft only in good weather, and on the other hand the examination of the training of the reversing maneuver, especially in bad weather situations and in low level flight. .

The home base of the unit is Milit√§rflugplatz Emmen. As coat of arms, the Zielflugstaffel carries a badge with a yellow and black target pattern, a bullseye and the writing ‚Äú Zfl St 12‚Äù. History Sqadron Badge of the Zielflugstaffel 12. A C-3605 target tug has retracted the trailing target with the winch after its target flights. In 1925, the Fliegerkompanie 12 was founded. From 1939 to 1950 the unit used aircraft of the type Morane D-3801. In 1945, the squadron was renamed to Fliegerstaffel 12. The original coat of arms of Fliegerstaffel 12 was a white Halberd with the number 12 on the blade and black wings on the handle against a red background. With the De Havilland D.H. 100 Vampire the unit received their first jet aircraft in 1952 and operated it as a combat squadron until 1970. Then the Fliegerstaffel 12 became designated a target squadron and was renamed Zielflugstaffel 12. The Zielflugstaffel 12 continued to use the Vampire until 1990 as a target aircraft. Some Vampires received a black and orange paint scheme. A black and yellow scheme was hardly ever used. Additionally, Zielflugstaffel 12 operated the C-3605 aircraft as target tug, which remained in use until 1987. From 1990 to 1994 the Hawker Hunter replaced the Vampires as a target aircraft, carrying laser reflectors. The C-3606 was replaced as a tug in 1987 by the PC-9. In 1994 the F-5E Tiger took over the task of the Hawker Hunter at the Zielflugstaffel 12. The crews of the Zielflugstaffel 12 are former militia pilots of the Fliegerstaffel 6 , Fliegerstaffel 8 and Fliegerstaffel 19, which have reached the age limits on the combat aircraft squadrons. The main task is to present flying targets as air threats to various units of the army. The main customer is the Ground to Air Defense, GBA. The PC-9 in its tug role is equipped with a winch for a towing target under the wing. The Fliegerstaffel 24 uses the same PC-9 with the ‚Äò‚ÄòVista'5Ericsson pod for electronic warfare. The Fliegerstaffel 24 was integrated into the Zielflugstaffel 12 in 1994, but it differs so much in operational terms that it may be regarded as an independent squadron. Zielflugstaffel 12 uses also the 11 red /white F-5E‚Äôs that are used by the Patrouille Suisse with a winch on the centerlinepylon for air-to-air gunnery training. The future of the Zielflugstaffel 12 is uncertain on the one hand because of the F-5E scheduled to be phased out by 2025. Due to the planned introduction of modern air defense systems under the designation BODLUV2020, it was decided earlier to discontinue the target flying operation with the PC-9 by the end of 2016, since such exercises with modern systems would no longer have been necessary. However, since the STINGER and the medium-sized air raid cannon system Oerlikon 35 mm will be replaced later than expected and the replacement of the Rapier is put on hold, the passing out of the PC-9 is being retarded. In 2016 the rumour was that 4 PC-9 should stay in use until 2025. Of these two machines (C-907 and C-908) were intended as target tugs and the other two (C-911 and C-912) as radar jammers.

In 1942 they were trained to fly the C-3603 at their new home, Buochs Air Base. From 1945 to 1947 its flight operations with C-3603 were carried out from Raron. In the post-war period, the interception company 17 was transferred into No. 3 squadron of the UeG (√úberwachungsgeschwader) and used various aircraft types, among them the Morane D‚Äê3800 from 1947 to 1955 and the C-3604 from 1947 to 1956. In 1952, today's Fliegerstaffel 17 was founded as a unit of pilots only.

In 1963, the \\"Falcon\\" was introduced as a new squadron emblem. From 1969 to 1975, flight operations were conducted with Mirage IIIS from Turtmann Air Base, followed by a period at Payerne Air Base from 1976 to 1997.

Their home base at the dissolution was the military airfield at Mollis. The squadron carried as its coat of arms a black Bison on a yellow background. The writing ‚ÄúFl St 20‚Äù below the Bison appeared during the squadron's history.  History  The unit's roots date back to 1938, when Fliegerkompanie 20 was founded. On September 2, 1939, the military airfield Mollis became the home base of the unit. It had nine reconnaissance aircraft C-35s. In 1940 the Fl Kp 20 was upgraded to D-3800 Morane aircraft. In 1946, the Fliegerkompanie units were split up into pilots and ground crew groups, which resulted in the foundation of Fliegerstaffel 20. In 1948, the squadron got the P-51 Mustang, followed by the jet combat aircraft DH-100 Vampire in 1956. Only a year later, in 1957, the retraining to the aircraft type DH-112 Venom was completed . On August 27, 1962, the Fliegerstaffel 20 had a serious disaster. Three DH-112 Venom of the Fliegerstaffel 20 collided in the clouds near the Furka Pass, at the southern and nord Ridge of the Blauberg, when they tried to fly into the Rhone Valley in the course of maneuvers of the No 3 Swiss Mountain Corps. In 1979, the Fliegerstaffel 20 changed to the Hawker Hunter. The flight operations on their war airfield at Mollis were usually carried out from Hardened aircraft shelters. As it was a militia squadron, the pilots would fly also from most other Swiss air fields during training courses, while Mollis was active only a few weeks each year.

History  P-51 Mustang J-2113 of Fliegerstaffel 21 The unit was founded in 1936 under the designation Fliegerkompanie 21 and used Dewoitine D-27 aircraft. From 1939 until 1945 the Fliegerkompanie 21 used Messerschmitt Bf 109 E, their home base initially being the military airfield at D√ºbendorf. However, the FlKp21 was stationed during the war on the Airfield Buochs (1942) and the Military Airfield Payerne. In 1945, a unit consisting of the pilots only was formed and named Fliegerstaffel 21. From 1945 to 1948 it used the Morane D‚Äê3800. This was followed by the P-51 Mustang from 1948 to 1958. The transition to the first jet, the De Havilland D.H. 100 Vampire, took place as early as 1956. The Vampire remained their aircraft until 1957 and was then replaced by De Havilland D.H. 112 Mk 4 Venom. De Havilland D.H. 112 Mk 4 Venom was used at the unit until 1960. One year earlier, in 1959, the military airfield at Buochs became the new home base and in the same year, Fliegerstaffel 21 commenced the introduction of the Hawker Hunter. In 1968, Turtmann became the new home of Fliegerstaffel 21. However, this changed again in 1982, and nearby Raron Airfield became the new home base. This remained the location of Fliegerstaffel 21 until it was dissolved in 1993. Above Fliegerstaffel 21 is a gap in the sequence of the squadrons. The Swiss Air Force had 22 squadrons, but there were no Fliegerstaffel 22 and Fliegerstaffel 23. The 22nd squadron was called Fliegerstaffel 24.

By 1974 the double control had been removed in two Vampire trainers (J-1205, J-1203) and the aircraft had been upgraded with an operator seat for EKF purposes. [http: //www.skynews.ch/archiv/01-52_SkyNews09_08.pdf First flight with the new Vampire Trainer Simulator in D√ºbendorf], Skynews, September 2008 In 1977 it was decided to use the Hunter trainers also for the electronic warfare (EKF) and to form the crews in Fliegerstaffel 24. Also in the Hunter trainers an operator was needed to operate the EKF equipment. Hunter trainers were used from 1977 to 1994 for the Fliegerstaffel 24, the aircraft were also used by other (Hawker Hunter) squadrons for conventional pilot training. This is also the case with the F-5F and PC-9 aircraft of the Fliegerstaffel 24. The home base for the Fliegerstaffel 24 was Sion Airport from 1979 to 1980, and then the Milit√§rflugplatz Emmen and Payerne Air Base. Since 1994 is the military airfield Emmen the only homebase of the Fliegerstaffel 24. In 1994 the Fliegerstaffel 24 was integrated into the Zielflugstaffel 12. In the year 1987, the Fliegerstaffel 24 together with the Zielflugstaffel 12 received a total of 12 Pilatus PC-9, today 8 PC-9 are still in use. From 1987 to 2006 the Fliegerstaffel 24 also used one of the two Swiss Air Force's Learjet 35 for EKF tasks. In 1994, the Hunter trainers passed out of the Swiss Air Force, and the Fliegerstaffel 24 instead used some (J-3201, J-3210, J-3211 and J-3212) of the 12 F-5F Tigers.

The Fliegerstaffel 24 shares the PC-9 with the Zielflugstaffel 12, which is use it as a target tug. The future of the Zielflugstaffel 12 and Fliegerstaffel 24is uncertain. This is because, on the one hand, the F-5F are scheduled to be phased out in 2018, and it was planned to remove the PC-9 at the end of 2016. However, four PC-9 are to continue to fly until 2025.

Similarly, orphaned wells may have different legal definitions across different jurisdictions, but can be thought of as wells whose legal owner it is not possible to determine. State legislatures in the United States have specific definitions based on local needs and priorities. For example, the section on abandoned wells in Texas' Natural Resource Code defines an \\"inactive well\\" as \\"an unplugged well that has had no reported production, disposal, injection, or other permitted activity for a period of greater than 12 months.\\" Pennsylvania's definition of abandoned well includes not producing for 12 months, \\"considered dry and not equipped for production within 60 days after drilling, redrilling or deepening, and from which the equipment needed to extract resources or produce energy has been removed.\\" Ohio legislation defines \\"idle and orphaned wells\\" based on whether or not a well bond has been forfeited or the money to plug it is unavailable. It defines a \\"temporary inactive well status\\" as not having produced for two (non-horizontal wells) or eight (horizontal wells) statutorily defined reporting periods or one that has produced \\"less than 100,000 cubic feet of natural gas or 15 barrels of crude oil.\\"  Environmental impacts of orphaned and abandoned wells  Orphaned and abandoned wells can cause environmental damage by leaking pollutants into the atmosphere or water supplies. Important determinants of how much orphaned and abandoned wells impact the environment include the techniques used and precautions taken when first drilling the well, whether it is a gas well, oil well, or combined oil and gas well, and if and how the well was sealed. If wells are not properly sealed when orphaned or abandoned, there can allow oil and gas to contaminate groundwater. It is also possible for orphaned and abandoned wells to be significant emitters of methane into the atmosphere. Furthermore, brine present in wells dug into shale formations can contain some radioactive and toxic substances that contaminate groundwater if the well leaks. Plugging wells can reduce the risk of explosions and protect groundwater, but does not always prevent methane emissions. The costs to mitigate the impact of orphaned and abandoned wells varies, but may include removing all equipment from the site, restoring the land and topsoil, and planting local species, in addition to plugging the well itself. For example, plugging a well and restoring the surrounding land costs an average of $100,000 for wells in the Marcellus Shale. One problem with studying the impacts of orphaned and abandoned wells is that data about them can be scarce and incomplete. In the United States, it is possible for wells to have been orphaned or abandoned for over a century, and information about them, if it exists at all, can be difficult to find.  Responses  One way to encourage well owners not to abandon or orphan wells and to make sure wells are safely abandoned is to use well bonds. These are bonds paid by well operators to a surety company and are held by an obligee (state or federal entity) until the well has been satisfactorily plugged and the land surface restored. A significant challenge of making well bonds an effective policy tool is to set their price to a point that does not make market entry prohibitively expensive, but also does not incentivize well operators to forfeit the bond instead of undertaking the abandonment requirements specified in local law. Another way to encourage well owners not to abandon or orphan wells is to retrofit oil and gas wells to produce geothermal energy. One benefit of this approach is that it is less expensive to retrofit an abandoned well to produce geothermal energy than it is to drill a new oil or gas well. It also saves the cost of exploring sites for geothermal fields. Avoiding new exploration and drilling avoids the environmental impacts of these activities. However, geothermal fluids can contain environmentally hazardous chemicals such as hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, methane, arsenic, mercury, and lead. A third option is to mandate that well operators establish reclamation trusts which would be used to pay reclamation costs if the operator does not perform the necessary plugging and land restoration within a given time period after abandoning the well. This policy option has been used to mitigate the environmental impact of mines in the United States as part of a combined command-and-control and market incentive policy response to environmental protection. One risk attached to this policy option is that if wells become economically unproductive before the period planned for in the trust agreement, the abandoned well could become a liability held by the relevant government authority.

It had professional military pilots and militia part-time pilots. Its main task was to provide air medical services for the Swiss military. At the time of its dissolution the MHR was based at D√ºbendorf Air Base.  History  Alouette II Alouette III In the federalism system of Switzerland, rescue services are not within the scope of the Confederation, but are the responsibility of the cantons, municipalities and cities. This prevented the creation of an air-rescue organization on a national base. It was not possible for the smaller cantons to build up their own air rescue services. This led to the creation of the civilian organization REGA. The REGA is financed by membership fees only. The Swiss military also recognized the benefits of air rescue shortly after the introduction of helicopters into its service in 1952. The creation and organization of the rescue service by means of military helicopters dates back to the year 1960. This was probably due to the ejection seat rescue of Wachtmeister Tresoldi in July 1960 over the Blinnental in the canton of Valais. As a result, material depots for helicopter rescue operations were created on 13 airfields and a proving ground (Andermatt) and an instructions sheet for rescue pilots was created. However, fuel reserves for the use of helicopters in emergencies were already provided in 1959 at eight airfields and the proving ground in Andermatt, which may be described as the forerunner of today's rescue organization. In individual cases, these were used as a means of rescue. One of the first such missions was a failed rescue mission on 13 January 1954 using a Hiller UH-12, on the occasion of an avalanche accident at St. Ant√∂nien, the failure due to the lack of experience of the pilot. Since 1960, the Swiss Air Force had a permanent rescue organization with specially equipped helicopters during working hours. On the basis of the now confirmed advantages of air rescue, the Milit√§r-Helikopter-Rettungsdienst was founded by the Swiss Air Force on 1 December 1965.Milit√§r-Helikopter-Rettungsdienst, 1966 (Dossier) The Milit√§r-Helikopter-Rettungsdienst was continuously ready for emergency rescue operations from dawn until dusk, starting in July 1966.Milit√§rhelicopter-Rettungsdienst, Pikettdienstleistungen durch DMP- Personal (PDF, Bundesarchiv, English: Military helicopter rescue service, emergency services by DMP staff (PDF , Bundesarchiv ) This service was responsible for air rescue within the Swiss military, but also for other organizations that were part of the then EMD and today's DDPS (German: VBS), such as the Youth and Sport (German : Jugend + Sport, J + S). The Milit√§r- Helikopter-Rettungsdienst was alerted by telephone. The MHR did not exist as a fixed unit. The pilots and helicopters always belonged to various air transport squadrons such as the Lufttransport Staffel 5. Alouette III helicopters were used, which were equipped with rope or rescue winches (the rope winches were mountable on all Alouette IIIs of the Swiss Air Force). The MHT was dissolved towards the end of the 1990s and the task was taken over by REGA. However, the service for rescues which had not been directly connected with the military (e.g. for Scouts organizations) had already been handed over to the REGA before. Military air rescue operations continue with the Air Rescue Service of the Army (LRA) with its helicopters in support of the REGA. In the late 1990s, the LRA emerged from the former MHR. With the transfer of MHR to the LRA, the service has been greatly reduced and serves only to maintain competence. * From 1960, 1961 and 1962 there are no statistical data on the use of military helicopters for rescue operations. In the years 1961 and 1962 the MHR, under the pressure of austerity measures was already very restricted. * 1963: Only rescue operations of military personnel were carried out. The following were transported: 6 injured, 3 sick, 1 avalanche spill. Flight services: 24 h 30 min / 104 flights. * 1964: 12 rescues were flown with helicopters.

Research on performance measurement in management accounting has identified surrogation as \\"the tendency for managers to lose sight of the strategic construct(s) the [performance] measures are intended to represent, and subsequently act as though the measures are the constructs of interest\\" (emphasis in original). An everyday example of surrogation is a manager tasked with increasing customer satisfaction who begins to believe that the customer satisfaction survey score actually is customer satisfaction. First usage Inspired by work by Yuji Ijiri, the term surrogation was coined by Willie Choi, Gary Hecht, and Bill Tayler in their paper, \\"Lost in Translation: The Effects of Incentive Compensation on Strategy Surrogation\\". They show managers tend to use measures as surrogates for strategy, acting as if measures were in fact the strategy when making optimization decisions. This appears to occur even if a measure-maximizing choice ultimately works against the strategy. They also show surrogation is exacerbated by incentive compensation. But, the phenomenon is distinct from wealth-maximizing behavior, since it persists both when incentives are removed and when they are changed to create an opportunity cost for maximizing the surrogate. The additional tendency to surrogate in the presence of incentives is reduced when managers are compensated based on multiple measures of a strategy rather than on a single measure. Choi, Hecht, and Tayler proposed attribute substitution as a mechanism for surrogation. Attribute substitution in decision-making involves a complex target attribute being replaced by a more easily accessible heuristic attribute. For this to occur, the target attribute must be relatively inaccessible, the heuristic attribute must be readily accessible, and the mental substitution must not be consciously rejected by the person. In the case of surrogation, the two attributes are related in that some party intends the heuristic attribute to serve as proxy for the target attribute. Further studies In a follow-up study, Choi, Hecht, and Tayler demonstrate involving managers in the selection of a strategy reduces their tendency to surrogate. Merely involving managers in the strategy deliberation process does not appear to have the same surrogation-reducing effect as involving them in the actual selection of the strategy. Jeremiah Bentley shows the effects of incentive compensation on surrogation are partially explained by a mechanism in which measure-based incentive compensation (in this case using a single measure) and wealth- maximizing behavior lead agents to distort their operational decisions (see Campbell's law). That operational distortion, in turn, leads them to change their beliefs about the compensated measure's causal relationship with the outcome‚Äîin other words, to surrogate‚Äîpossibly as a means of reducing cognitive dissonance arising from inconsistency between beliefs and actions. He demonstrates that allowing people to provide narrative explanations for their decisions reduces the amount of operational distortion observed under an incentive compensation scheme, and also reduces surrogation. He also finds that the effect is larger for people who have a high preference for consistency, which supports the argument that surrogation is due to an attempt to reduce cognitive dissonance. Robert Bloomfield had proposed a link between cognitive dissonance and surrogation in an earlier paper. In a subsequent study, Paul Black, Tom Meservy, Bill Tayler, and Jeff Williams show that surrogation can occur simply when a measure is provided to managers, even if they do not receive incentive compensation based on the measure. That is, if managers know that something is being measured, they will begin to surrogate on that measure, even if they are told that the measure is no more nor less important that other measures when determining their compensation. This implies that firms must be careful in determining what measures are communicated to managers, as managers may surrogate on a measure just because they hear that it is being measured. Other studies have evaluated the intentionality of surrogation among executive management. Jeff Reinking, Vicky Arnol, and Steve G. Sutton demonstrate through an exploratory cross-sectional field study with 27 executive to mid-level managers that executive management intentionally designs dashboards to achieve strategy surrogation. The evidence supports that the impact of this intentional surrogation appears to arise through operational managers' beliefs that dashboard measures align with organizational strategy and lead to improved managerial and organizational performance. However, Reinking, Arnol, and Sutton point out that this relationship between the perceived alignment of performance measures and managerial and organizational performance is mediated by the quality of the dashboard and information. These field tests were followed by another study evaluating the use of KPI (key performance indicator) dashboards by management. The results showed that two primary constructs, strategy alignment and interactive management control, are important factors impacting the extent of dashboard use, perceived managerial performance, and perceived organizational performance. Operational managers perceive that dashboards focused on specifically tailored KPIs lead to both improved managerial and organizational performance. As a result, the study suggests that intentional strategy surrogation may have beneficial effects at the lower operational levels in an organization. Surrogation is conceptually related to Plato's Allegory of the Cave in that people are failing to distinguish the shadow (i.e. the measure) from the form (i.e. the construct). Surrogation is also related to Baudrillard's concept of simulacra, in his order-of-simulacra theory. The connection to this concept is discussed in Macintosh, Shearer, Thornton and Welker (2000). Popular press In a fall 2019 article, Tayler and doctoral student Michael Harris discussed how surrogation at Wells Fargo led management to inadvertently replace their \\"build long-term relationships\\" strategy with their \\"cross-selling\\" metric, resulting in a massive account fraud scandal. They also discuss methods for overcoming surrogation, providing examples from Intermountain Healthcare. Bill Tayler has discussed everyday examples of surrogation and incentive compensation on BYU News Radio. In his book entitled When More is Not Better: Overcoming America's Obsession with Economic Efficiency, Roger L. Martin explains the pervasiveness of surrogation through examples in business, public policy, and other areas of every-day life. He demonstrates the prevalent nature of surrogation in our thinking through examples like the modern stock market, where \\"today‚Äôs stock price is considered the true and complete manifestation of the value of a company\\". Martin suggests that \\"business executives need to turn their backs on the dominant vector of reductionism, recognize that slack is not the enemy, guard against surrogation by using multiple measures, and appreciate that monopolization is not a sustainable goal\\". Martin warns that while surrogating in the business domain is a natural tendency, it is a danger that facilitates \\"gaming\\" and \\"makes executives unreflective about how their business really works\\". To guard against surrogation, Martin suggests using multiple measurements and, in particular, contradictory proxies. Contradictory proxies help managers to \\"think integratively\\" and mitigate the risk of gaming on proxy measurements.

Later, she also received a master's degree in public health from Columbia University. Dr. Smith joined Harlem Hospital in 1968 and served as the president of its medical board between 1984 and 1987. She also served as director of its sickle cell center and taught at Columbia. Dr. Smith led several National Institute of Health-funded studies throughout the 1970s, 80s, and 90s on sickle cell anemia and related diseases. In the 1970s, she ran a NIH study that followed the growth and development of primarily black patients with sickle cell anemia from infancy through adulthood. The study became an important metric for gauging the severity of the disease over time. In 1993, Dr. Smith was co- chairman of a panel that called for more intensive screening for infants of Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, and South American descent. This panel also recommended vaccinations and antibiotic treatments for infants with the disease, and these guidelines were accepted by the American Academy of Pediatrics, and were widely adopted.

Prelude The operation commenced on 23 August as a road security operation by the 1st Brigade on Highways 1 and 16 between Dƒ© An Base Camp and Ph∆∞·ªõc Vƒ©nh Base Camp. the 1st Brigade established two artillery bases to support the operation, the 1st Battalion, 2nd Infantry Regiment (1/2nd Infantry) was at Firebase 1 at the hamlet of Bo La () 30 kilometres north of Dƒ© An and the 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment (1/26th Infantry) was at Firebase 2 2 kilometres to the south. Operation Operation Amarillo, 25 August 1966 On 23 and 24 August the two infantry battalions patrolled the surrounding areas without locating any Viet Cong presence. On the morning of 25 August following an overnight patrol, a 15-man unit from Company C 1/2nd Infantry began to move east to return to Firebase 1 when it was attacked by the Viet Cong Phu Loi Battalion and the local C62 Company. Unknown to the Americans their patrol had stumbled into a major Viet Cong base camp. The patrol took cover in a trenchline and radioed for support and the rest of Company C and 2nd Platoon, Troop C, 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry Regiment were sent from Firebase 2 to assist them. The Viet Cong meanwhile had broken through the patrol's line and the commander called in artillery fire on their own position which broke up the attack, 9 members of the patrol took shelter in a bunker while the other members scattered. At 08:30 Col. Sidney Berry ordered the two other companies from 1/2nd Infantry and the 1/26th Infantry to reinforce and later BG William E. DePuy ordered the 1st Battalion, 16th Infantry Regiment (1/16th Infantry) and the 2nd Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment (2/28th Infantry) to deploy to the area from Lai Kh√™. At 09:00 as the initial relief column approached the assumed location of the patrol, the Viet Cong attacked a platoon guarding a small clearing to the rear of the column. The M113s turned and moved back to the clearing to support the platoon, but were soon pinned down by intense fire from Vietcong hidden in the dense trees and brush surrounding the clearing. Col. Berry then ordered Company A 1/2nd Infantry to move in from the southeast, Company B 1/2nd Infantry and Troop C 1/4th Cavalry to move in from the east, while Company C 1/26th Infantry came up from the south. 2/28th Infantry was landed by helicopter to the north, 1/16th Infantry was landed to the west and Companies A and B 1/26th Infantry and Troop A 1/4th Cavalry approached from the south. The approach of all units was delayed by dense jungle, wet ground and caution against further Viet Cong ambushes. At 13:00 the Company B 1/2nd Infantry and Troop C 1/4th Cavalry column finally approached the clearing, but Company B which moved to clear the southeast was met by machine gun and mortar fire and four attacks on the Viet Cong positions were repulsed. Troop C's armor meanwhile was able to break through lighter Viet Cong fire and get into the clearing. The wounded were moved to Landing Zone (LZ) Blue which was established 400 metres to the east of the clearing. In order to establish centralized ground command over the intermingled units Col Berry ordered Major Richard Clark of 1/2nd Infantry to take command and establish a defensible perimeter. Major Clark's and Col. Berry's command helicopters landed at LZ Blue and they were discussing plans in the clearing when Major Clark was shot in the head by a Viet Cong sniper, killing him, Col. Berry then took direct command of the clearing, while his operations officer Maj. John Galvin assumed overall control of the battle. By 15:15 the other units began to close in on the battlefield. Company B 1/26th Infantry and Troop A 1/4th Cavalry broke through the Viet Cong defensive line before being moved west to assist Company B 1/2nd Infantry. Meanwhile, the 1/16th Infantry attacked from the west of the clearing, finding abandoned Viet Cong camps before joining up with the US forces to the south of the clearing. 1/16th Infantry then turned north to attack the main body of the Viet Cong but their right flank was hit by Viet Cong machine gun and recoilless rifle fire from entrenched positions before the Viet Cong withdrew. Col. Berry handed command of the clearing to LCol. Paul Gorman and resumed command of the battle. At dusk the US forces established 3 night defensive positions, one in the clearing, another of 1/16th Infantry 400 metres north and another further north. On the morning of 26 August Napalm strikes were ordered between the clearing and 1/16th Infantry, however one napalm canister fell short killing 2 Americans and wounding 14 others. The American forces then patrolled the surrounding areas but the Viet Cong had left the battlefield. The bodies of 6 members of the Company C 1/2nd Infantry night patrol were located, while the remaining 9 members had survived the battle and made their way to LZ Blue. Aftermath Operation Amarillo officially concluded on 31 August. Total US casualties were 41 killed of which 34 were killed on 25 August, while VC losses were 99 killed, later intelligence indicated that VC losses were actually 171 killed. Col. Berry regarded the operation as a victory but stated that \\"We thrashed our way almost blindly into the enemy's base camp and fought him on his home ground under conditions favorable to him.\\" The battle at the clearing on 25 August has subsequently been referred to as the Battle of Bong Trang, after a village to the southwest.

It was formerly called Workers' Children Secondary School () and, before that, Mongkok Workers' Children School (). History =Establishment= In 1946 the missionary bishop Ronald Hall proposed to various trade unions that they should band together to form a society for the education of workers' children. The \\"Education Advancement Society for the Children of Workers in Hongkong and Kowloon\\" was thus formed. The society opened seven schools in 1947, at Mong Kok, Wan Chai, Apliu Street (Sham Shui Po), Hing Man Street (Shau Kei Wan), Sai Wan Ho, Jaffe Road, and Portland Street. The Mongkok school was housed in government premises and had 556 students in April 1947. More schools opened in 1948. These schools were often not in permanent premises but in rented flats. The government was still working to rehabilitate schools ruined during the Japanese occupation of World War II. A few years after opening, the original Mongkok school was closed by the government, which felt that the workers' children schools were operating in unsuitable premises. The government planned to build new government schools in both Hong Kong Island and Kowloon and withdraw the subsidy given to the education advancement society. However, the Mong Kok school continued operating. A new school campus was built at Nairn Road (now called Princess Margaret Road) in Ho Man Tin. It was formally opened with a commemorative ceremony on 29 April 1951. The school was founded as a kindergarten, and the primary section was added soon after. The lower secondary section was founded in 1961. =1960s disturbances= Mongkok Workers' Children School was regarded as a leftist institution. It was the site of discord during the 1967 riots, inspired by the contemporaneous fervour of the Cultural Revolution in China. In May 1967, at the outset of the disturbances, it was reported in the South China Morning Post that men dressed as Red Guards, claiming to have come from Canton, were seen shouting communist slogans outside the school. In October 1967 one of the teachers, Li Mou-lan, was tried and subsequently convicted of possessing inflammatory posters and recommended for deportation back to China, his birthplace. The same month a student of the school was accused of possessing a bomb. Following a bomb explosion at the Chung Wah Middle School, which was subsequently shut down by the government, the Mongkok Workers' Children School was among four other \\"communist-run\\" schools raided by police on 28 November 1967. It was believed that the schools were being used for bomb-making. When the police arrived, students began shouting slogans and throwing objects and furniture at the officers. The headmistress, Lam Suk- ching, was accused by the police of directing others to attack the officers. The police heard \\"minor explosions\\" and saw smoke during the raid, and used tear gas shells to quell the disturbance. During the raid 16 people, including the headmistress, were arrested and later charged with obstructing the police and making inflammatory speeches. =Modern developments= Interior view The upper secondary section was founded in 1975. In the 1980s the Mongkok Workers' Children School moved toward becoming a more mainstream institution. It participated in the Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination (HKCEE) for the first time in 1980. It was among several leftist schools that lobbied for government subsidy from the mid-1980s. The Hong Kong Government launched the Direct Subsidy Scheme (DSS) in 1991 to provide grants to private schools. The Mongkok Workers' Children School, previously classified as a Private Independent School (PIS), was one of nine schools that joined the DSS at the outset. The school was the 1996 champion of the Hong Kong Mathematics Olympiad. Description The school is a co-ed institution founded in 1946. It is a Direct Subsidy Scheme school sponsored by the Hong Kong Workers' Educational Organisation Ltd. There are about 700 students, taught by 48 teachers. The school campus on Princess Margaret Road comprises about of floor space. It comprises classrooms, two computer labs, an auditorium, a library, four laboratories, and two outdoor basketball courts. It is air conditioned.

Phillott published on Persian grammar, Egyptian Arabic and on falconry. He also contributed a few notes on ornithology. Phillott was elected member of the Asiatic Society of Bengal in November 1889 and a fellow in 1910; and he published in its journal and served as secretary to the Philological Committee. He translated several works into English, popular among which was From Sepoy to Subedar, a work supposedly written by an Indian soldier and included reminiscences of the 1857 mutiny. He published The BƒÅz-nƒÅma-yi NƒÅ·π£irƒ´, a Persian treatise on falconry which is a major work on the traditional falconry of Iran as well as a translation of the Ain-i-Akbari. He also played a major role in the publication of a Persian translation of The Adventures of Haji Baba of Ispahan written by James Justinian Morier. The translation, which was originally done by Mirza Habib Esfahani, was wrongly attributed to Sheykh Ahmad Ruhi Kermani whose image appeared as the frontispiece of the book. Research has shown that Esfahani's translation, though highly praised for its fluency and innovations, included editorial additions and modifications to suggest that Persia was backward, ruled by despots unlike the advanced culture of Constantinople.

Dunbar, from an 1897 publication. Lois Dunbar was a Union nurse during the American Civil War. \\"My war record is one of hard labor and severe trials,\\" wrote Dunbar in a letter to Mary G. Holland. Dunbar's extensive service began in St. Louis, Missouri on November 10, 1861. In St. Louis, Dunbar worked for Dr. Hodges, a head surgeon at the city's hospital. Working with Dr. Hodges, Dunbar cared for three hundred patients at a time as they were coming in from battle at Fort Donelson. In April 1862, Governor Morton requested Dunbar's service in Evansville, Illinois, as there were no nurses on duty. At this new location, Dunbar served with Dr. DeBruler, another head surgeon. At this new appointment, Dunbar was placed in full charge, acting as a commanding officer and a nurse in addition to have five other hospitals to monitor, according to her aforementioned letter. In September 1862, Dunbar received a commission from Dorothea Dix to serve as a hospital inspector, but the head surgeon Dr. DeBruler objected as he needed Dunbar's service as a nurse. Dunbar agreed, thinking her time better spent as a nurse than an inspector. During her service, Dunbar experienced many tragic and dangerous situations. While she was serving on a hospital transport ship, for example, the ship came under fire. Dunbar worked to transform a church into a hospital to accommodate the growing number of casualties. Serving at Young's Point during the Battle of Vicksburg, Dunbar's feet became badly blistered and she was thoroughly exhausted, ultimately fainting in her room. She still managed to get back to service after resting. Dunbar knew how to perform minor surgery well; she was taught by Dr. Jameson who acted as a surgeon during the Crimean War. Because of this knowledge, she assisted in many amputations. She might have even used this knowledge to treat a patient who would become her husband George A. Dunbar, a corporal the 3rd Iowa Infantry, a man who Dunbar saved after five doctors had lost hope of his survival. Dunbar writes in her letter that she would often carry treats in her pocket for the patients she treated, though she also saw many dark moments during her work. For instance, one man died in Dunbar's arms, clutching her dress. Dunbar left the service in 1864. A pension file was found for Dunbar in the Adjutant General's office in Evansville, Illinois.

The Harbor Defenses of Narragansett Bay was a United States Army Coast Artillery Corps harbor defense command. It coordinated the coast defenses of Narragansett Bay and Rhode Island from 1895 to 1950, beginning with the Endicott program. These included both coast artillery forts and underwater minefields. The command originated circa 1895 as an Artillery District, was renamed Coast Defenses of Narragansett Bay in 1913, and again renamed Harbor Defenses of Narragansett Bay in 1925.Stanton, pp. 455-481Coast Artillery Organization: A Brief Overview at the Coast Defense Study Group websiteRinaldi, pp. 165-166Berhow, pp. 430-434 Geography The southern part of Narragansett Bay is defined by the mainland to the east and west and by two large islands, Aquidneck Island to the east and Conanicut Island (which is also the town of Jamestown) to the west. Thus, the southern part of the bay is divided into three arms. The western arm is called the West Passage, between Conanicut Island and the mainland. The middle arm is called the East Passage, between Conanicut and Aquidneck Islands. Because the city of Newport and its sheltered harbor are on and defined by Aquidneck Island, the East Passage was the main area of fortification until the Endicott Period of the late 19th century. The eastern arm of the bay, between Aquidneck Island and the mainland, is called the Sakonnet River, although it is not geographically a river. The north end of it is too narrow and shallow for most vessels to pass, and thus it was not heavily fortified until World War II. The southwestern portion of Conanicut Island resembles a beaver, with the southern part called Beavertail and the northern part called Beaver Head. History =Early Rhode Island forts= Colonial period Prior to the Revolution there was only one significant fort in Rhode Island: Fort Anne (later Fort George, eventually Fort Wolcott) on Goat Island in Newport harbor. The site was first fortified with an earthen battery in 1700, replaced by Fort Anne (named for the reigning Queen of England) in 1702. It was gradually enlarged until in 1727 it was described as a 50-gun stone fort, which in 1730 was renamed Fort George, after George II.Roberts, pp. 706-707Duchesneau, John T., History of Fort Wolcott website In 1764 and 1769 two attacks on British ships by persons dissatisfied with British rule took place at and near the fort. In 1764 persons who believed was carrying stolen goods from local merchants seized the unmanned Fort George and fired on the ship, which escaped. In 1769 had seized two ships from Connecticut in the course of customs enforcement. The merchant captain whose ships had been seized led a mob which captured and burned the ship on Goat Island, near Fort George. Another fortified site of the Colonial period was Brenton's Battery, on Brenton's Point in Newport, later the site of Fort Adams. This battery had four guns in 1641, and two guns in 1683. It was rebuilt in the 1750s. Revolutionary War Fort George in 1777, from a map by Charles Blaskowitz. In 1775 the American Revolution broke out. Fort George was seized by patriot forces and renamed Fort Liberty. In 1776 the fort was rearmed with 25 guns, a mix of 24- and 18-pounders, with a 50-man garrison under Captain Samuel Sweet. The patriots built at least two other batteries in Newport, one on Easton's Point at Battery Park, site of the later Fort Greene, and another at Castle Hill.Early Newport forts at American Forts Network The Easton's Point battery once forced the besieging HMS Scarborough to move away from the town.Roberts, p. 702 Another 12-gun battery was built on Conanicut Island across the bay from Newport, initially named the Dumpling Rock Battery or Fort Brown, after its commander, Abdiel Brown. This fort was also called Fort Conanicut after 1779.Roberts, p. 706 The patriots also fortified the bay's West Passage with the Beaver Tail Fort and the Conanicut Battery. On 6, 10, and 14 April 1776, four guns at Brenton's Point manned by the Artillery Company of Newport drove off British ships attempting to attack Newport. Despite this, the British captured Newport on 8 December by assaulting the Beaver Tail Fort and Conanicut Battery in Jamestown, then sailing around the west and northeast parts of Conanicut Island to approach Newport from the north.Duchesneau and Troost-Cramer, pp. 16-19 They renamed the main fort as Fort George, and occupied the city for three years, building a barracks at Brenton's Point. The appearance of a French fleet off Newport in mid-1778 caused the British to scuttle some of their own ships in an attempt to block the harbor. Patriot forces attempted to recover Newport in August 1778, fighting the Battle of Rhode Island about seven miles north of the town, but were unsuccessful. However, the British abandoned Newport in October 1779, concentrating their forces in New York City. At this point Fort George was reoccupied by the patriots and became Fort Washington. Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, Comte de Rochambeau. An expedition of 5,500 French troops under Count Rochambeau arrived in Newport by sea on 10 July 1780. They built Fort Chastellux (later known as Fort Harrison and Fort Denham) on high ground behind Goat Island (near King Avenue, later renamed Chastellux Avenue), not far from the current site of the Ida Lewis Yacht Club, and rebuilt and re-used the British barracks on Brenton's Point.Roberts, p. 701 A French map of this period reportedly shows a total of 39 forts and batteries in Newport and Middletown. A year later the French left Rhode Island to join Washington's forces north of New York City, eventually participating in the Yorktown campaign that effectively won the Revolution. Their overland route from Newport to Yorktown is marked today as the Washington‚ÄìRochambeau National Historic Trail. 1783-War of 1812 Plan of First System Fort Adams. Newport received several new forts under the first system of US fortifications in the 1790s. By this time Newport was considered the most important coastal site in New England, with two companies of the Regular Army's Artillerists and Engineers stationed there.Wade, p. 57 Its naturally well-protected harbor, if seized by an enemy, could serve as a base for land and sea attacks on Boston or New York. Major Louis Tousard, a French military engineer with the Corps of Artillerists and Engineers, designed all four of the new forts in the Newport area. The most significant was the first Fort Adams on Brenton's Point, on the site of the current Fort Adams, which mounted 17 guns.Duchesneau and Troost- Cramer, pp. 18-24 The other large fort was Fort Hamilton on Rose Island, northwest of the harbor and intended for 60 guns. However, construction on this fort was abandoned while still largely incomplete.Fort Hamilton (RI) at American Forts NetworkFort Hamilton (RI) at FortWiki.com Two smaller forts were a rebuilt Fort Dumpling on Conanicut Island with 8 guns, and the new Fort Greene on Easton's Point (also called North Point), mounting 12 guns on the site of the Revolutionary War battery.Fort Greene (Newport) at American Forts Network Fort Adams was completed in 1799, Fort Dumpling was completed in 1798, and Fort Greene was mostly complete when work was halted in 1800. In 1798 Fort Wolcott was renamed for the last time, after the recently deceased Oliver Wolcott, Governor of Connecticut and a general in the revolution. The fort was also refurbished with 38 guns.Fort Wolcott at American Forts Network Around 1806 a war scare with Great Britain prompted another round of fort construction that was later called the second system of US fortifications. In Rhode Island the improvements were modest, being limited to repairs at Fort Wolcott and Fort Adams. In the Secretary of War's report for 1811 Fort Dumpling was noted as incomplete, and Fort Greene was \\"in a state of ruin\\".Wade, pp. 242-243 Rhode Island was not attacked in the War of 1812. State troops were mobilized to garrison Fort Adams and Fort Greene. 1816-1890 Aerial view of Fort Adams. Although heavily fortified locations were not attacked in the War of 1812, the British managed to bypass or suppress the weak defenses at the mouth of Chesapeake Bay and burn Washington, DC. As a result, Congress approved a large-scale program of improved masonry forts, later called the third system of US fortifications, to replace the relatively small forts of the first and second systems. Newport was selected for one of the largest forts ever built in the United States, the new Fort Adams. Two other forts of the third system, Fort Monroe in Virginia and Fort Jefferson in Florida, were its only rivals in size in North America.Duchesneau and Troost-Cramer, pp. 25-35 Fort Adams' initial design was by French military engineer Simon Bernard, and the first 13 years of its construction were personally overseen by Joseph G. Totten of the Army Corps of Engineers, the foremost American fort designer. The fort was begun in 1825 and was first garrisoned in 1841, with construction continuing through 1858.Parkman, pp. 16-18 A drawing in the National Archives shows that a similarly large fort in Jamestown on Conanicut Island, at the eventual location of Fort Wetherill, was considered but not approved. The new Fort Adams was unusual among American forts in having a tenaille and crownwork, plus a detached redoubt, protecting the fort on the landward side. These were designed to break up and channel an assault force, effectively forcing an attacker to resort to a long siege.Weaver, pp. 120‚Äì133 In 1854 the fort was armed with 200 guns, and had positions for over 400. About 50 of these were 24-pounder flank howitzers, short-barreled guns for defense against an assault, mounted in casemates in the tenaille and redoubt.Duchesneau and Troost-Cramer, p. 154 Fort Wolcott went into caretaker status in 1836 and was never re-garrisoned; it was probably abandoned in the 1900s. During the Civil War Fort Adams was an important mobilization center, and served as the home garrison of the 15th US Infantry Regiment. For a few months in 1861 it was also the US Naval Academy, which was transferred from Annapolis, Maryland to Newport due to the Confederate sympathies of Maryland. However, the Academy soon moved to the Atlantic House hotel. New defenses were also built on Dutch Island to guard the West Passage. An eight-gun battery was built and armed by the 14th Rhode Island Heavy Artillery (Colored) in 1863-64. A battery for eleven 10-inch Rodman guns was also built at the south end of the island; it extended in a north-south line and had wide arcs of fire on either side. However, it was vulnerable to flooding and was never armed.Schroder 1998, pp. 14-18 The Civil War had shown that masonry forts were vulnerable to modern rifled cannon, particularly in the siege of Fort Pulaski near Savannah, Georgia in 1862. Also, the 15-inch (381 mm) smoothbore Rodman gun was introduced during the war. In the 1870s through 1890s Fort Adams was rearmed with eleven 15-inch Rodmans, thirteen 10-inch (254 mm) Rodmans in the original casemates, and four 100-pounder (6.4-inch (163 mm)) Parrott rifles in a set of casemates that pointed south towards potential attackers. New earth-protected positions were built for five of the 15-inch guns, two atop the southwest corner of the fort and three new positions south of the fort; the remainder were on the barbette tier atop the fort. Parrott rifles had shown an alarming tendency to burst when fired, so procurement was stopped shortly after the Civil War and they were deployed only in limited quantities.Duchesneau and Troost-Cramer, pp. 154-156 In 1867-69 a battery for six 15-inch Rodman guns was built on Dutch Island and armed with five of the weapons. In 1870 a massive fort mounting forty 15-inch Rodman guns was proposed for Dutch Island, but funding for this was cut off in 1875, and within a few years nearly all coast defense funding was cut off nationwide.Schroder 1998, pp. 20-21 In 1869 the Naval Torpedo Station was founded on Goat Island; this became the US Navy's primary research, development, and manufacturing center for torpedoes. In the 1880s the Naval Station Newport and the Naval War College were established on Coasters Harbor Island; the naval base and the adjacent anchorage grew in size and importance through World War II, making their protection increasingly important. =Endicott period= Typical US disappearing gun battery for two guns. 12-inch mortars at Fort Greble, Dutch Island. 10-inch gun M1888 on disappearing carriage M1896, Fort Greble, Dutch Island. 6-inch gun M1900 on pedestal mount M1900, probably at Fort Getty. The Board of Fortifications was convened in 1885 under Secretary of War William Crowninshield Endicott to develop recommendations for a full replacement of existing coast defenses. Most of its recommendations were adopted, and construction began in 1897 on new forts to defend Narragansett Bay.Map of HD Narragansett Bay at FortWiki.com Two underwater minefields in the East and West Passages also guarded the bay. The defenses of the East Passage were the new Fort Wetherill and new batteries at Fort Adams, south of the main fort. The West Passage was adequately defended for the first time with three new forts. These were Fort Getty on Beaver Head in Jamestown, Fort Greble on Dutch Island, and Fort Kearny in Saunderstown on the mainland, opposite Dutch Island. Fort Wetherill was the largest of the new forts in armament, and included the mine planting and storage facilities for the area. Heavy weapons for the East Passage included four 12-inch (305 mm) guns at Fort Wetherill (two on barbette carriages, two on disappearing carriages), with three 10-inch (254 mm) disappearing guns there, along with sixteen 12-inch (305 mm) mortars and two 10-inch (254 mm) disappearing guns at Fort Adams. The West Passage had three 10-inch disappearing guns and eight 12-inch mortars at Fort Greble, with three 12-inch disappearing guns at Fort Getty. Medium caliber weapons in the initial design were five 6-inch (152 mm) guns at Fort Wetherill (two disappearing, two on pedestal mounts), three 6-inch disappearing guns at Fort Greble, and two 6-inch pedestal guns at Fort Getty, along with six 6-inch disappearing guns at Fort Kearny. Each fort had at least one battery of 3-inch (76 mm) guns to defend the minefields against minesweepers.Berhow, pp. 206-207Parkman, p. 119 Generally, the heavy batteries were built first, followed by the 3-inch and then the 6-inch batteries. However, the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War broke out in early 1898. Most of the Endicott batteries were still years from completion, and it was feared the Spanish fleet would bombard the US east coast. A number of batteries of medium-caliber rapid-fire guns were hastily built.Congressional serial set, 1900, Report of the Commission on the Conduct of the War with Spain, Vol. 7, pp. 3778‚Äì3780, Washington: Government Printing Office Fort Adams received a one-gun battery with an 8-inch M1888 gun (203 mm) on a modified Rodman carriage, and a battery of two 4.72-inch (120 mm) Armstrong guns. Fort Getty received a single 6-inch (152 mm) Armstrong gun. Another Endicott-program fort was built in Rhode Island, part of the Coast Defenses of Long Island Sound. This was Fort Mansfield, on Napatree Point in Westerly. The fort was intended to guard the strait between Westerly and Fishers Island. It was one of the smallest Endicott forts, with two 8-inch disappearing guns and four 5-inch guns. However, an exercise in 1907 showed that the nearby beach could be invaded in a sector the guns could not cover, thus the fort was vulnerable to capture.Military Exercise Exposed Fort Mansfield's Flaw, Westerly Sun, 20 April 2014 The fort was placed in caretaker status in 1909 and disarmed to provide guns for World War I in 1917. It was abandoned and sold in 1928.Fort Mansfield at FortWiki.com The initial Endicott batteries were completed in 1907. Some of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War batteries were short-lived; Fort Getty lost its 6-inch Armstrong gun by 1900, along with Fort Adams' single 8-inch gun. However, in 1907 there was a re-alignment of 6-inch Armstrong guns. Fort Adams received a battery of three 6-inch Armstrong guns as a result. In 1913 these were transferred to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. =World War I= The American entry into World War I brought many changes to the Coast Artillery and the Coast Defenses of Narragansett Bay (CD Narragansett Bay). Numerous temporary buildings were constructed at the forts to accommodate the wartime mobilization. As the only component of the Army with heavy artillery experience and significant manpower, the Coast Artillery was chosen to operate almost all US-manned heavy and railway artillery in that war. Stateside garrisons were drawn down to provide experienced gun crews on the Western Front; the first two regiments designated to operate French-made railway artillery in France (and their brigade headquarters) mobilized at Fort Adams along with other units.Duchesneau and Troost-Cramer, pp. 146-147 Some weapons were removed from forts with the intent of getting US-made artillery into the fight. 8-inch, 10-inch, and 12-inch guns and 12-inch mortars were converted to railway artillery,US Army Railway Guns in World War I while 5-inch and 6-inch guns became field guns on wheeled carriages.Williford, pp. 92-99 12-inch mortars were also removed to improve reload times by reducing the number of mortars in a pit from four to two. Few railway artillery pieces were mounted and few or none saw action before the Armistice. The remounted 5-inch and 6-inch guns were sent to France, but their units did not complete training in time to see action.Coast Artillery Corps Units in France in WWI The 5-inch guns were removed from service in 1920. By this time, pedestal mounts for 6-inch guns were known to be superior to disappearing mounts, being able to more rapidly track targets with a faster rate of fire. Thus, most disappearing guns (except the M1897, shorter than the others) were dismounted for use as field guns, while most of the few pedestal guns dismounted were returned to the forts soon after the war. The removed 6-inch disappearing guns (primarily M1903 and M1905) were stored and many returned to service in World War II. Fort Wetherill lost a 10-inch gun (transferred to Fort Greble) and its three 6-inch disappearing guns. Fort Adams' pair of 10-inch guns was dismounted in 1917, and after some delay transferred in 1919 to Fort Strong in the Harbor Defenses of Boston to replace guns removed there. Fort Greble lost a 10-inch gun (replaced by Fort Wetherill's gun in 1918) and its three 6-inch disappearing guns. Fort Kearny lost four of its six 6-inch disappearing guns. The mortar batteries at Fort Adams and Fort Greble were all halved in size (to eight and four mortars respectively) to improve the rate of fire.Various fort articles at FortWiki.com A pair of 4.72-inch Armstrong guns, transferred from Fort Strong in Boston Harbor, were mounted at Sachuest Point in Middletown to guard the Sakonnet River from 1917 to 1919. A misspelling of Sachuest Point as \\"Sauchet Point\\" on the gun cards for these weapons led to their destination being lost; it is often assumed incorrectly that they were Fort Adams' guns of the same type.Gun and Carriage cards, National Archives and Records Administration, Record Group 156, Records of the Chief of Ordnance, Entry 712 As the Naval Torpedo Station expanded, Fort Wolcott was probably completely demolished in 1917-18. References indicate the authorized strength of CD Narragansett Bay in World War I was 32 companies, including 14 from the Rhode Island National Guard. =Interwar= After World War I two- or three-gun antiaircraft batteries armed with M1917 3-inch (76 mm) guns on fixed mounts were built at Fort Adams, Fort Wetherill, and Fort Greble (at least). Fort Adams also had a pair of truck-mounted M1916 3-inch AA guns.Duchesneau and Troost-Cramer, pp. 164-165Schroder 1998, p. 30 Some of these weapons remained in service through early World War II, others were replaced by towed 3-inch guns in the 1930s. In 1920 a number of weapons deployed in limited quantities, plus the 3-inch gun M1898, were declared obsolete and removed from the forts. These included all of the 4.72-inch Armstrong guns. One of the Sachuest Point guns is preserved as a memorial in Ansonia, Connecticut. Both of Fort Adams' guns survive: one is preserved as a memorial in Equality Park, Newport, RI; the other was initially at Westerly Armory, but was later traded to Fort Moultrie near Charleston, SC. On 1 July 1924 the harbor defense garrisons completed the transition from a company-based organization to a regimental one, and on 9 June 1925 the commands were renamed from \\"Coast Defenses...\\" to \\"Harbor Defenses...\\". The 10th Coast Artillery was the Regular Army component of HD Narragansett Bay from 1 July 1924 through 25 February 1944, although only the regimental headquarters and headquarters battery was active from 1924 through 1939. The 243rd Coast Artillery was the Rhode Island National Guard component of HD Narragansett Bay from 11 July 1924 through 7 October 1944. In 1936 Fort Wetherill's remaining pair of 10-inch guns were transferred to Fort H. G. Wright on Fishers Island, New York to replace guns there.Fort Wetherill at FortWiki.com =World War II= Map of Narragansett Bay mine, net, boom, and magnetic detection defenses in World War II, on a plaque at Fort Wetherill. 16-inch casemated gun, similar to those at Fort Church and Fort Greene. Early in World War II numerous temporary buildings were again constructed to accommodate the rapid mobilization of men and equipment. Two batteries of the 10th Coast Artillery were activated on 1 July 1939 and 1 September 1940, followed by four more batteries on 10 February 1941. The 243rd Coast Artillery was activated on 16 September 1940. After the Fall of France in 1940 the Army decided to replace all existing heavy coast defense guns with 16-inch guns. HD Narragansett Bay became centered on Fort Church in Little Compton and Fort Greene in the Point Judith section of Narragansett. Fort Church was built 1939-1942 and Fort Greene's first 16-inch battery was completed in 1942. Each fort initially had a casemated battery of two 16-inch (406 mm) guns, Battery Gray a.k.a. Battery 107 at Fort Church and Battery Hamilton a.k.a. Battery 108 at Fort Greene.Fort Church at FortWiki.comFort Greene in Narragansett at FortWiki.com Another 16-inch battery, Battery 109 at Fort Greene, was also built but not armed. Two additional 16-inch batteries, Battery 110 and Battery 114, were proposed for Fort Burnside on Beavertail and the Oak's Inn Military Reservation in Misquamicut but were not built. Battery 114 would have been under the Harbor Defenses of Long Island Sound. Narragansett Bay was one area in which, as gun ranges increased, the fort locations moved seaward. Fort Church also had a rare casemated battery of two 8-inch (203 mm) guns, known as Battery Reilly. The 16-inch batteries were supplemented by new 6-inch (152 mm) batteries. These included heavy earth- covered concrete bunkers for ammunition and fire control, with the guns protected by open-back shields. The guns for these batteries were mostly the 6-inch guns removed in World War I for field service and stored since that war; a new 6-inch gun M1 of similar characteristics was developed when this supply of guns began to run out. Three of these batteries were built in HD Narragansett Bay: Battery 211 at Fort Greene, Battery 212 at Fort Church, and Battery 213 at Fort Burnside. Four 155 mm (6.1 inch) batteries were emplaced in Rhode Island in 1942 to quickly provide some defense at key points. These had towed guns on \\"Panama mounts\\", circular concrete platforms to support the guns. Two guns were at Fort Church, four at what is now Brenton Point State Park in the southwest part of Newport, four guns at Fort Greene, and four at the Oak's Inn Military Reservation. The last battery was under the Harbor Defenses of Long Island Sound. As the new defenses were built, in 1942-43 the vast majority of the older guns were scrapped. However, some of the 6-inch pedestal guns and 3-inch guns were retained in service through the end of the war, although most of these were relocated due to the new defenses shifting seaward. Fort Varnum was established as a result of this. This fort had two 6-inch pedestal guns from Fort Getty and emplacements intended for two 3-inch guns from Fort Kearny. However, the 3-inch guns were unserviceable and moved to storage; a 90 mm battery was placed there instead.Fort Varnum at FortWiki.com Fort Wetherill retained its pair of 6-inch pedestal guns. Fort Burnside gained a pair of 3-inch guns from Fort Getty. All the original Endicott-era guns of Forts Adams, Getty, Greble, and Kearny were removed or scrapped by 1944. Five 90 mm gun Anti-Motor Torpedo Boat (AMTB) batteries were built or deployed in the Narragansett Bay area. These had 90 mm dual-purpose (anti-surface and anti-aircraft) guns. Each battery was authorized two 90 mm guns on fixed mounts, two on towed mounts, and two single 37 mm guns, although the weapons on hand varied. AMTB 921 was at Fort Varnum and/or Fort Kearny with two fixed 90 mm guns and two 37 mm guns. AMTB 922 was at Fort Getty (the only armament there) with two fixed 90 mm guns. AMTB 923 was at Brenton Point near the 155 mm battery when completed in July 1943 and moved to Fort Wetherill in July 1944, with two fixed and two mobile 90 mm guns and two 37 mm guns.Battery AMTB 923 (1) at FortWiki.comBattery AMTB 923 (2) at FortWiki.com Along with the move in July 1944, the 37 mm guns in the AMTB batteries were upgraded to 40 mm Bofors guns.Schroder, p. 70 AMTB 924 was at Fort Wetherill with two mobile 90 mm guns. AMTB 925 was at Fort Adams with two mobile 90 mm guns.Schroder, pp. 120-122 The US Navy also participated in defending the Narragansett Bay area with net defenses and submarine-detecting indicator loops, including a station at Fort Burnside (Station 1H).Indicator loop website Four 5-inch (127 mm) antiaircraft guns (probably the widely-available 5\\"/38 caliber gun) were emplaced on Rose Island in 1942, replaced by an Army battery of four 90 mm AA guns in 1943. Following mobilization in 1940 HD Narragansett Bay was subordinate to First Army. On 24 December 1941 the Eastern Theater of Operations (renamed the Eastern Defense Command three months later) was established, with all east coast harbor defense commands subordinate to it, along with antiaircraft and fighter assets. This command was disestablished in 1946.Conn, pp. 33-35 Unlike most of the eastern harbor defense commands, fire control towers in Rhode Island were low-profile. Many were two stories tall and disguised as seaside cottages, or were dug into rock outcroppings. In World War II an Army-Navy harbor entrance control post-harbor defense command post was built at Fort Burnside, resembling a seaside mansion. The removal of most weapons and an Army-wide shift from a regimental to a battalion-based system meant organizational changes in Rhode Island's defenses. On 25 February 1944 the 10th Coast Artillery was effectively disestablished, and on 7 October 1944 the 243rd Coast Artillery was redesignated as the 188th and 189th Coast Artillery Battalions, which themselves were disestablished on 1 April 1945. Personnel from these units were absorbed by HD Narragansett Bay.Schroder 1980, pp. 120-122Stanton, pp. 489, 492 Some of the Rhode Island forts served as POW camps during World War II, including Fort Getty, Fort Greble, and Fort Kearny. The latter was the headquarters of a program to re-educate German prisoners with democratic values, one element of which was the German-language newspaper Der Ruf (The Call). =Post World War II= Following the war, it was soon determined that gun defenses were obsolete, and they were scrapped by the end of 1948, with remaining harbor defense functions turned over to the Navy. In 1950 the Coast Artillery Corps and all Army harbor defense commands were dissolved. Today the Air Defense Artillery carries the lineage of some Coast Artillery units. In Rhode Island the 243rd Regional Training Institute of the Rhode Island Army National Guard at Camp Varnum (formerly Fort Varnum) carries the lineage of the 243rd Coast Artillery. In the 1950s a ring of Nike missile sites was built around Providence, but none of the former coast defense sites were used. The Nike sites were deactivated circa 1972. From circa 1960 to 1974 NAVRADSTA Jamestown, a Navy radio facility, operated at the former Fort Burnside with a tower tall. Present The accessibility, visibility, and state of preservation of Rhode Island's forts varies widely. Fort Adams is in Fort Adams State Park, but the fort is accessible only via guided tours in summer. The Endicott batteries are mostly fenced off. However, major efforts in 2016-2017 have removed overgrowth from much of the main fort, the redoubt, and some of the outlying batteries. Some of the officers' quarters from the Endicott era are preserved, notably the Eisenhower House. In town on the south side of the harbor is a memorial to Rochambeau's landing in Newport; the statue has a duplicate on the Avenue Pierre-Ier-de-Serbie (Peter I of Serbia) in Paris. Fort Wetherill is in Fort Wetherill State Park, in a variable state of preservation but mostly accessible. Parts of the batteries are fenced off or overgrown, but enough is accessible for a good idea of what they looked like. Much of the concrete is crumbling, possibly due to the salty air as well as the heavy graffiti applied. There are some interpretive plaques, especially around the mine support buildings, which are well-preserved. Fort Getty is a recreational vehicle campground with a significant entrance fee, and most of the batteries are buried. The Conanicut Battery is a public park with ruins dating from the British occupation. Fort Burnside is now Beavertail State Park; the 6-inch and 3-inch batteries can be viewed but are overgrown, and the park headquarters in the harbor entrance control post can be seen. Fort Greble is well-preserved but a boat is needed to get to Dutch Island. The Artillery Company of Newport still exists as a reenactor club, and their 19th-century armory in Newport has a museum of weapons and uniforms from all eras of US history that is open to the public. Fort Kearny is now the Narragansett Bay Campus of the University of Rhode Island; the batteries are well-preserved and some have been converted as offices. However, a nuclear research reactor has been built atop one battery. Fort Varnum is now Camp Varnum of the Rhode Island Army National Guard; it is well-preserved but not normally accessible to the public. It includes World War II gun emplacements and several fire control \\"cottages\\". Fort Greene consisted of three separate reservations in Point Judith. The East Reservation is now the Fort Greene Army Reserve Center and has the 16-inch Battery Hamilton, but is not normally accessible to the public. The West Reservation is the campground of Fishermen's Memorial State Park, and includes the 16-inch Battery 109 and a Plotting, Switchboard, and Radio (PSR) bunker housing a plotting room as part of the Coast Artillery fire control system. It also has a fire control tower resembling a barn silo. Battery 109 is overgrown, although a path to the top of the bunker is maintained. The South Reservation is near Point Judith Light and is the seaside portion of the park. The actual Fishermen's Memorial is next to the ammunition bunker of Battery 211, and a path leads to the top of the bunker. A 6-inch gun platform is in front of the bunker, now separated from it by beach erosion. However, no interpretation of the park's military history is provided. Most remains of Rhode Island's other forts have been demolished or buried. Parts of two bastions of Fort Hamilton on Rose Island remain, along with at least three World War II 5-inch gun emplacements. Fort Wolcott is completely demolished, but a plaque on Goat Island commemorates it. Fort Church's batteries are all buried or built on, and are on private property.

Construction Vireo was laid down 14 September 1953, by Bellingham Shipyards, Bellingham, Washington; launched on 30 April 1954, as AMS-205; sponsored by Mrs. Arvin E. Olsen; reclassified as MSC-205, on 7 February 1955; and commissioned on 7 June 1955, Lieutenant (jg) Leland E. Mench in command.  West Coast operations  After completing tests and trials at Seattle, Vireo moved south at the beginning of July, for shakedown training out of San Diego. The cruise occupied her until the second week in September, at which time she began preparations for final acceptance trials to be conducted early in November. Upon passing those tests on 4 November, Vireo became an active unit of Mine Squadron (MinRon) 7. She operated from Long Beach, California, until 1 March 1956, when she stood out of that port, bound for the western Pacific. En route, she stopped at Pearl Harbor and, for the remainder of March, and the entire month of April, the minesweeper conducted training operations in Hawaiian waters. She resumed her voyage westward on 9 May, and arrived in Yokosuka, Japan, on 31 May.  Western Pacific service  Vireo served at Sasebo, Japan, as a unit of MinRon for almost a decade and one-half. Her 14 years and months in the Far East can be divided into two easily discernible periods. The first eight years, from June 1956 to July 1964, were devoted entirely to peace time operations out of Sasebo. These included minesweeping exercises with other ships of the United States Navy and with units of the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force as well as with navies of the Republic of Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand. She visited such diverse places as the Sea of Japan, the coast of Korea, the Philippine Islands, Okinawa, and the East and South China Seas. She punctuated her operations with port calls at Hong Kong, Okinawa, Keelung and Kaphsiung on Taiwan, Subic and Manila Bay in the Philippines, and at a host of Japanese ports including, among others, Beppu, Kobe, Kagoshima, Sasebo, and Yokosuka. The visits allowed her crew to rest after operations at sea, to replenish stores and supplies, and to refurbish the ship. During the crisis in 1958, over the Nationalist- held islands of Quemoy and Matsu, located just off the communist Chinese mainland, Vireo rushed from Japan to join American forces in the area and spent the months of September and October, patrolling near the islands. In November, she resumed her routine peacetime minesweeping exercises, port calls, and occasional salvage or rescue operations. Activities such as these characterized her duty until mid-summer 1964. =Vietnam War service= The war in Vietnam dominated Vireos final six years in the Far East. In July 1964, just before the Tonkin Gulf incident gave impetus to an ever-widening American participation in combat in Vietnam, the minesweeper headed for Southeast Asian waters for a series of \\"special operations.\\" Though she resumed her normal schedule early in August, the minesweeper began regular tours of duty on station off the South Vietnamese coast the following spring when an inshore patrol was established, under the code name Operation Market Time, to interdict the waterborne flow of arms to the Viet Cong insurgents. In carrying out her \\"Market Time\\" duties, Vireo patrolled stretches of the South Vietnamese coast relatively close inshore and stopped suspicious-looking craft, mostly junks but occasionally trawlers, to check their identity and to inspect cargoes and crews for illicit arms and communist infiltrators. During her first year on the patrol, she conducted five tours of duty, each of about two or three weeks duration, on junk surveillance assignments uncomplicated by any combat. Those periods were punctuated by port visits to her old haunts, normal mine exercises, and periods in port for upkeep and repair. The year 1966, however, proved a different story altogether. After completing an overhaul at Sasebo, Vireo departed that port on 10 April, to resume \\"Market Time\\" patrols off the coast of South Vietnam. Exactly one month later, while engaged in those operations, the minesweeper received her baptism of fire. At about 04:30, encountered a steel-hulled trawler trying to make a landfall near the mouth of the Cua Bo De River. The Coast Guard cutter received heavy .50-caliber gunfire when she tried to force the trawler to heave to for inspection but, while requesting assistance in the form of and Vireo, succeeded in forcing the enemy ship aground. At a hasty conference on board Brister, it was decided to attempt to salvage the grounded gun runner. While Point Grey approached the trawler with a towline from Vireo, Brister launched her motor whaleboat to assist. The Coast Guard cutter received a withering machine gun fire from insurgents ashore as she neared the enemy. She answered that fire promptly, and Vireo joined in with 150 rounds of . Brister, her battery masked by the cutter, could not bring her /50 caliber guns to bear on the enemy. Ultimately, the Coast Guard cutter had to break contact and move off in order to get her wounded crewmen medical assistance. Vireo covered her retirement with more 20-millimeter fire and provided a haven for Bristers motor whaleboat while air strikes were called in to silence the enemy machine gun emplacements. Further air strikes eventually destroyed the trawler, and Vireo returned to \\"Market Time\\" duty. For participation in the action at Cua Bo De River, Vireo won the Navy Unit Commendation, and her commanding officer received the Bronze Star Medal. Decommissioning ‚Äì Reserve ship Over the next four and one-half years, Vireo maintained her schedule of \\"Market Time\\" patrols alternated with unilateral and multilateral mining exercises and port visits at various places throughout the Orient. On 1 August 1970, Vireo learned that her home port had been changed from Sasebo to Long Beach, where she was scheduled to begin duty as a Naval Reserve training ship on 1 October. She departed Sasebo on 17 August, and, after stops at Yokosuka and Pearl Harbor, arrived in Long Beach on 17 September. On 1 October, the minesweeper was placed out of commission. That same day, she departed Long Beach for her Naval Reserve duty station, Seattle. Transfer to the Fijian Navy After four years and six months of operations along the northwest coast of the United States, Vireo began deactivation preparations on 1 April 1975. Three months later, on 1 July 1975, her name was struck from the Navy list. On 1 October 1975 she was transferred to the Fijian Navy and renamed Kula. She was discarded in 1985  Notes  ;Citations  Bibliography  Online resources  External links  * Bluebird-class minesweepers Ships built in Washington (state) 1954 ships Cold War minesweepers of the United States Ships transferred from the United States Navy to the Fijian Navy Minesweepers of the Fijian Navy Vietnam War minesweepers of the United States Adjutant-class minesweepers ","title":"USS Vireo (MSC-205)"},{"id":"53572248","text":"El Hilal Sports Club El Obeid or simply El Hilal El Obeid is a Sudanese sports club established in 1931 based in El-Obeid.

He played 192 La Liga matches over nine seasons, scoring a combined 14 goals for Athletic Bilbao and Racing de Santander. Club career =Athletic= Born in Bilbao, Biscay (Basque Country), Rojo joined the youth system of hometown club Athletic Bilbao in his last year as a junior. He made his senior debut with neighbouring SD Indautxu, being loaned twice to the Segunda Divisi√≥n team and being relegated as many times; he also played in this competition with the former's reserves, again dropping down a level in the 1969‚Äì70 season after losing a play-off against Villarreal CF. Aged 22, Rojo was definitely promoted to the first team before the start of the following campaign. By that time his elder brother Jos√© Francisco ('Txetxu') was already an established member of the line-up, and therefore the younger sibling was usually referred to administratively as Rojo II. Jos√© √Ångel made his debut in La Liga on 24 January 1971 when he came on as a late substitute in a 2‚Äì1 away victory against Real Zaragoza, and he went on to start six further league games for Ronnie Allen's team, adding four appearances in the Copa del General√≠simo. In 1971‚Äì72 Rojo began to feature regularly for Athletic, and made his European debut against Southampton, featuring the full 90 minutes in the 1‚Äì2 away loss in the UEFA Cup. The following season he contributed with 37 appearances in all competitions, helping the side to ninth place in the league and victory in the domestic cup, with the player appearing in the final in Madrid, a 2‚Äì0 defeat of CD Castell√≥n. Over the next four campaigns, Rojo was a frequent presence in the midfield for Athletic. In 1976, he was in the side and scored in both legs of a Spanish Cup tie against Sporting de Gij√≥n in which the opponents overturned a 2‚Äì0 first leg deficit to win 5‚Äì2 at San Mam√©s. Although the result itself was an embarrassment, it did prompt the club to pursue the opposition's star player I√±aki Churruca, who would play an important role for the team in the coming years. Rojo missed the first half of 1976‚Äì77 due to injury, scoring what was to be his final goal for the side in a 3‚Äì0 home win over H√©rcules CF as they ended the league in third place. Athletic also reached the final of the UEFA Cup, losing on the away goals rule to Juventus F.C. and with him appearing in the first leg, one of his five games in the run; he departed from Bilbao at the age of 29, with overall totals of 186 matches and 12 goals. =Racing= After signing with Racing de Santander in the summer of 1977, Rojo was a regular in his three seasons in Cantabria, narrowly avoiding top flight relegation in the first (under Nando Yosu) but finishing second from bottom in the second. After nearly dropping down another level in 1979‚Äì80, he retired at 32. International career Having never featured at any youth level for Spain, Rojo came to the attention of the selectors due to his form for Athletic. His first and only cap arrived on 17 October 1973, when he played the entirety of a 0‚Äì0 friendly draw in Turkey ‚Äì his brother also took part in the match. Previously, Rojo featured for the unofficial Basque Country team in 1971 in a match against Catalonia.

Caughman later died of his injuries. Jackson subsequently turned himself in to police custody and confirmed that he traveled from Maryland to New York with the intention of killing black men in order to prevent white women from having interracial relationships with them. Attack Jackson traveled by bus from his home in Baltimore, Maryland to New York City on March 17 with the intention of killing black men in order to prevent white women from having interracial relationships with them, according to reports. He stayed at the Hotel Times Square on West 46th Street. On March 20, Jackson allegedly walked up to Caughman with an 18-inch sword and stabbed him to death in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood. Jackson turned himself in to police on March 22. According to police, Jackson told them that he planned to attack more black men in Times Square. Victim Caughman was born in 1950 or 1951 in Jamaica, Queens. His parents were a home health care aide and a pastor. He was raised in the South Jamaica Houses in Queens. He graduated from Brooklyn College with an associate's degree and earned a living as a social service worker. He took up can and bottle recycling to earn money and keep busy. For the last 20 years of his life, he lived on West 36th Street in Manhattan, in a building known as The Barbour Hotel. It is now housing for people transitioning out of homelessness, but Caughman was not homeless. Perpetrator James Harris Jackson, a Baltimore, Maryland native, turned himself in to police and said he took the bus to Manhattan to kill black men, whom he said he had hated for over ten years. The weapon used by Jackson was a \\"Roman short sword\\" hidden in his pants. Jackson was born to a liberal Democrat household and lived in an \\"almost all-white\\" area outside Baltimore. His grandfather, who was from Louisiana, supported racial integration and frequently was the target of cross burnings on his lawn. Jackson expressed racist views as young as three and shared them only with \\"like-minded people.\\" Jackson had also voted for Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election and opposed Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, saying, \\"I couldn't let Palin get in there. She's stupid.\\" Jackson had graduated in 2007 from Friends School of Baltimore a Quaker school. Jackson would later serve in the United States military as an intelligence analyst in the Afghan capital of Kabul in 2009 stating he enjoyed \\"the sense of mission\\" in 2010 and 2011 before being honorably discharged after winning several awards in 2012. Jackson stated that he had been thinking about killing black men \\"for a long time, for the past couple years, for the past couple years. I figured I would end up getting shot by the police, kill myself, or end up in jail\\". Jackson said he picked New York because he wanted to make a statement. He was charged with second-degree murder at a March 23 arraignment, though the prosecutor is reportedly working on upgrading the charge to the first degree, as well as adding a hate crime charge. He did not apply for bail and was held pending his next court date on March 27. In an exclusive interview at Rikers Island with The New York Daily News, Jackson had mentioned the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer though he had neither confirmed nor denied ever being a reader. Jackson told the Daily News that he regretted killing Caughman and wished to kill younger African-Americans such as \\"a young thug\\" and \\"a successful older black man with blondes\\". Jackson also expressed white nationalist views such as belief in the white genocide conspiracy theory \\"The white race is being eroded [...] No one cares about you. The Chinese don't care about you, the blacks don't care about you\\". Jackson's YouTube channel contained alt-right, neo-Nazi, Holocaust denial, MGTOW, pro-Trump, and white nationalist content. Some of the videos shared were \\"Is It Time for Whites to Start Voicing Displeasure With Black on White Crimes?\\", \\"Blacks Know That Blacks Are Violent So Why Does the White Media Pretend They Are Not\\", and \\"BLACK PERSON TALKS ABOUT ALT-RIGHT DESTROYED  MGTOW RED PILL SEXY TEEN CRINGE\\". Court room and police interview videos were released later. Jackson stated that his killing was \\"an amateurish, slipshod version\\" of \\"a terrorist attack\\". Jackson described interracial couples as \\"an insurmountable problem [...] I mean, that's the main problem for me\\". Jackson believed that blacks \\"need to be exterminated\\" and stated that \\"In my opinion, blacks are inferior people\\" and believed that \\"I think we should just preserve the best people and get rid of all the dead weight.\\" He also said that his killing of Caughman was \\"practice\\" for other attacks on interracial couples and mentioned that he had stalked between 10 and 15 individuals or groups almost carrying out two attacks with the same knife but hesitated though he planned on killing several Blacks with white women. Jackson did not feel remorse for his actions stating \\"No. He's a homeless black guy\\" and said \\"It was weird. I didn't feel great. I didn't feel horrible either. I thought it (the stabbing) would send me into a bloody rage fury.\\" Jackson also stated that the killing was intended to start a race war in a manifesto written by him \\"The racial World War starts today. This political terrorist attack is a formal declaration of a global total war on the Negro races\\". Jackson pled guilty to the murder in January 2019 and was sentenced to life without parole the following month. He is now serving his sentence at Clinton Correctional Facility. Aftermath On March 27, Jackson was charged with one count each of murder in the first and second degrees as an act of terrorism, second-degree murder as a hate crime, and three counts of criminal possession of a weapon in the New York State Supreme Court.

More specifically, Ler regulates the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island genes, which are responsible for creating intestinal attachment and effacing lesions and subsequent diarrhea: LEE1, LEE2, and LEE3. LEE1, 2, and 3 carry the information necessary for a type III secretion system. The transcript encoding the Ler protein is the open reading frame 1 on the LEE1 operon. The mechanism of Ler regulation involves competition with histone-like nucleoid structuring protein (H-NS), a negative regulator of the LEE pathogenicity island. Ler is regulated by many factors such as plasmid encoded regulator (Per), integration host factor, Fis, BipA, a positive regulatory loop involving GrlA, and quorum sensing mediated by luxS. Mechanism Ler positively regulates the LEE genes by competition with its homolog, H-NS. H-NS silences LEE genes via rigid filament structures bound to the DNA that Ler disrupts and replaces through unknown mechanisms. Though little is known of the mechanism of Ler regulation, Ler interacts with DNA in specific ways. Ler binds DNA non-cooperatively, bends DNA in low concentrations, stiffens it in high concentration, and forms toroidal nucleoprotein complexes along DNA in vivo. Regulation The regulation of Ler and its transcript, ler, is complex and many-fold. The plasmid encoded regulator (per) directly activates the region of the LEE1 operon which encodes Ler. Integration host factor is also a direct activator of ler and binds upstream of its promoter. Jeannette Barba and her colleagues at the National Autonomous University of Mexico elucidated a positive regulatory loop between Ler, ler, GrlA, and grlRA. GrlA is also a LEE encoded regulator of the LEE pathogenicity island. They found that GrlA activates ler, and that Ler activates grlRA indicating a loop of activation wherein a protein product activates a transcript whose protein product activates the transcript of the original protein. Ler activates grlRA only if H-NS is present, this is not the case for GrlA activation of ler. Quorum sensing plays a role in Ler regulation. LuxS is an important protein involved in quorum sensing, particularly in the synthesis of autoinducer molecules. Quorum-sensing E. coli regulator A (QseA) is found in LuxS systems and activates transcription of ler. Fis, a nucleoid associated protein essential for EPEC's ability to form attaching and effacing lesions, partly acts through activation of Ler expression. BipA, a ribosomal binding GTPase and prolific regulator of EPEC virulence, transcriptionally regulates Ler from an upstream position where it also regulates other genes. The Ler protein also represses its own transcript on the LEE1 operon through DNA looping which prevents RNA polymerase from completing transcription.

The group consisted of defected officers and soldiers from the Syrian Armed Forces. Unlike the Free Syrian Army led by Colonel Riad al-Asaad, which had links to the Muslim Brotherhood of Syria, the Free Officers Movement was a secular-leaning group. The movement joined the FSA on 23 September 2011, but continued to operate under the name of the Free Officers Movement until mid-2012. History Lt. Col. Hussein Harmoush, founder of the Free Officers Movement of Syria. The Free Officers Movement was formed on 9 June 2011 by Hussein Harmoush, a lieutenant colonel who defected from the Syrian Army. He, along with 30 other defected soldiers, aided other rebels and civilians during the June 2011 Jisr ash-Shugur clashes and helped them escape to Turkey. He himself fled to Turkey during the operation and lived in a refugee camp near the border with Syria. According to reports he covertly headed back into Syria several times between June and August. Col. Riad al-Asaad also joined the Free Officers Movement in July, before forming the Free Syrian Army. On 29 August 2011, Harmoush disappeared while in the camp. On 15 September, he appeared on Syrian state television in an interview. He retraced his previous statements regarding Syrian security forces firing into crowds of protesters and accused the Muslim Brotherhood in instigating the conflict. However, activists claim that the statements came after torture and threats while Col. Harmoush was under detainment by the government. Col. Riad al-Asaad of the Free Syrian Army demanded the Syrian government to release Harmoush and hand him back to Turkey, and threatened to \\"respond harshly ... through military operations\\" otherwise. Asaad also denied claims that Harmoush was captured by Turkish intelligence and handed over to Syrian military intelligence. Harmoush was then detained at the Sednaya Prison. Conflicting reports by human rights organizations stated that he was either executed by the Air Force Intelligence Directorate by firing squad in January 2012 or continued to be imprisoned as of November 2013.

He served two terms as Mayor of the City of Brisbane before its amalgamation with surrounding local authorities into Greater Brisbane in 1925.  Family life  Harry John Charles Diddams was born on 26 April 1864 to John William Diddams and Lydia Mary (n√©e Flower) at Coniston Cottage, Parnell in Auckland, New Zealand. His father was a widower when he married Lydia Flower and there was an elder son, William Henry, born 1855 in Ulverstone Registration District, Lancashire, England to John and Sarah (n√©e Blackhall), who died in 1856. Harry was described in a report of his wedding as \\"the second son\\". New Zealand birth records indicate that he was the eldest of five children from his father's second marriage. He married Henrietta (Hettie) Gibbs Hicks, third daughter of the late Robert McCall Hicks, on 17 April 1895 at All Saints Church, East St Kilda, Victoria.  Employment  Harry served his apprenticeship as a compositor on the Auckland Star in his home city. In 1881, he moved to Melbourne where he joined the printing firm of McCarron, Bird & Co.  Politics  Harry Diddams first attempt to enter local politics came in January 1907 when he opposed the sitting alderman in the South Ward of the Town of Toowong where he was living in Ashton Street. The incumbent was returned comfortably. In August 1907, a casual vacancy arose on the Brisbane Municipal Council through the resignation of the Alderman for West Ward. Although still resident in Toowong, Diddams was qualified as the owner of a business in Brisbane's business district (Adelaide Street), was nominated by several prominent businessmen and appointed by Council. He remained an alderman from 1907‚Äì1921 and served on many of the Committees of Council. Harry Diddams served two terms as Mayor of Brisbane; first in 1911 and then 1921‚Äì1924. The first term, during which Diddams also served as President of the Local Authorities Association of Queensland, coincided with the Coronation of King George V. When he was named a Companion of the Order of st Michael and St George in the New Year's Honours List of 1912, His Worship explained that \\"the citizens of Brisbane are honoured equally\\" and \\"every local authority member ... participates in the honour paid to me\\". A columnist on the Truth offered a more cynical view. In 1916, Diddams' role on Council included representing the town on the ANZAC Commemoration Executive charged by the State Government with the organisation of a suitable public remembrance of the events of the previous April.  Later life  In January 1929, Harry sailed 'home' to New Zealand aboard the Aorangi to visit his sister, Mrs Fred Kenderdine, of Remuera. On the return journey to Brisbane, he fell ill and was admitted to a private hospital in Sydney where he died on 11 March 1929. Harry Diddams' body was returned to Brisbane and on 16 March 1929 his funeral procession left from Albert Street outside the (new) Brisbane City Hall. His coffin was carried to the vehicle by former Mayors of Brisbane honouring their colleague. At Toowong Cemetery he was interred with wife Hettie and their daughter Lorna.

It is a ground orchid with a single, sparsely hairy leaf and one or two yellowish- green flowers with red stripes. It occurs in Victoria and South Australia and resembles the related Caladenia concinna from New South Wales. Description Caladenia toxochila is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single, sparsely hairy leaf, 50‚Äì120 mm long and 10‚Äì15 mm wide. One or two flowers 15‚Äì20 mm wide are borne on a spike 80‚Äì200 mm high. The sepals and petals are yellowish-green with central red stripes. The sepals have thin, club-like glandular tips, 1‚Äì7 mm long. The dorsal sepal is 15‚Äì25 mm long, 2‚Äì4 mm wide and curves forward. The lateral sepals have similar dimensions to the dorsal sepal and are nearly parallel to each other and turned downward, almost touching the ovary. The petals are 12‚Äì20 mm long, 1.5‚Äì3 mm wide and also turn downwards near the ovary. The labellum is pale green, 10‚Äì12 mm long and wide and has a dark red tip. The labellum has many rounded teeth up to 1 mm long on its sides, the tip is curled under and there are four rows of crowded, fleshy, blackish, club-shaped calli up to 1 mm long, along its mid-line. Flowering occurs from August and September. This species is similar to the related Caladenia concinna from New South Wales but differs from that species by in having darker-coloured flowers shorter labellum teeth and fewer calli rows than that species. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia toxochila was first formally described by Ralph Tate in 1889 and the description was published in Transactions, proceedings and report, Royal Society of South Australia. The specific epithet (toxochila) is derived from the Ancient Greek words toxon meaning \\"bow\\" and cheilos meaning \\"lip\\" referring to the bow-shaped labellum of this species. Distribution and habitat The bow-lip spider orchid is found in scattered places in western Victoria and in south-eastern South Australia, growing in woodland and mallee with grasses and shrubs.

Boron nitride nanosheet is a two-dimensional crystalline form of the hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), which has a thickness of one to few atomic layers. It is similar in geometry to its all-carbon analog graphene, but has very different chemical and electronic properties ‚Äì contrary to the black and highly conducting graphene, BN nanosheets are electrical insulators with a band gap of ~5.9 eV, and therefore appear white in color. Uniform monoatomic BN nanosheets can be deposited by catalytic decomposition of borazine at a temperature ~1100 ¬∞C in a chemical vapor deposition setup, over substrate areas up to about 10 cm2. Owing to their hexagonal atomic structure, small lattice mismatch with graphene (~2%), and high uniformity they are used as substrates for graphene-based devices. Structure BN nanosheets consist of sp2-conjugated boron and nitrogen atoms that form a honeycomb structure. They contain two different edges: armchair and zig-zag. The armchair edge consists of either boron or nitrogen atoms, while the zig-zag edge consists of alternating boron and nitrogen atoms. These 2D structures can stack on top of each other and are held by Van der Waals forces to form few-layer boron nitride nanosheets. In these structures, the boron atoms of one sheet are positioned on top or below the nitrogen atoms due to electron-deficient nature of boron and electron-rich nature of nitrogen. Synthesis = CVD = Chemical vapor deposition is the most common method to produce BN nanosheets because it is a well-established and highly controllable process that yields high-quality material over areas exceeding 10 cm2. There is a wide range of boron and nitride precursors for CVD synthesis, such as borazine, and their selection depends on toxicity, stability, reactivity, and the nature of the CVD method. = Mechanical cleavage = A typical electron micrograph of BN nanosheets prepared by ball milling (scale bar 50 nm). Mechanical cleaving methods of boron nitride use shear forces to break the weak van der Waals interactions between the BN layers. Cleaved nanosheets have low defect densities and retain the lateral size of the original substrate. Inspired by its use in the isolation of graphene, micromechanical cleavage, also known as the Scotch-tape method, has been used to consistently isolate few-layer and monolayer boron nitride nanosheets by subsequent exfoliation of the starting material with adhesive tape. The disadvantage of this technique is that it is not scalable for large-scale production. Boron nitride sheets can be also exfoliated by ball milling, where shear forces are applied on the face of bulk boron nitride by rolling balls. This technique yields large quantities of low- quality material with poor control over its properties. = Unzipping of boron nitride nanotubes = BN nanosheets can be synthesized by the unzipping boron nitride nanotubes via potassium intercalation or etching by plasma or an inert gas. Here the intercalation method has a relatively low yield as boron nitride is resistive to the effects of intercalants. In situ unzipping of boron nitride nanotubes to nanoribbons was achieved by Li et al. = Solvent exfoliation and sonication = Solvent exfoliation is often used in tandem with sonication to isolate large quantities of boron nitride nanosheets. Polar solvents such as isopropyl alcohol and DMF are more effective in exfoliating boron nitride layers than nonpolar solvents because these solvents possess a similar surface energy to the surface energy of boron nitride nanosheets. Combinations of different solvents also exfoliate boron nitride better than individual solvents. Many solvents suitable for BN exfoliation are rather toxic and expensive, but they can be replaced by water and isopropyl alcohol without significantly sacrificing the yield. = Chemical functionalization and sonication = Chemical functionalization of boron nitride involves attaching molecules onto the outer and inner layers of bulk boron nitride. There are three types of BN functionalization: covalent, ionic and or non- covalent. Layers are exfoliated by placing the functionalized BN into a solvent and allowing the solvation force between the attached groups and the solvent to break the van der Waal forces between BN layers. This method is slightly different from solvent exfoliation, which relies on the similarities between the surface energies of the solvent and boron nitride layers. = Solid state reactions = Heating a mixture of boron and nitrogen precursors, such as boric acid and urea, can produce boron nitride nanosheets. The number of layers in these nanosheets was controlled by temperature (ca. 900 ÀöC) and the urea content. Properties and applications Mechanical properties. Monolayer boron nitride has an average Young's modulus of 0.865 TPa and fracture strength of 70.5 GPa. In contrast to graphene, whose strength decreases dramatically with increased thickness, few-layer boron nitride sheets have a strength similar to that of monolayer boron nitride. Thermal conductivity. The thermal conductivity of atomically thin boron nitride is one of the highest among semiconductors and electrical insulators; it increases with reduced thickness due to less intra-layer coupling. Thermal stability. The air stability of graphene shows a clear thickness dependence: monolayer graphene is reactive to oxygen at 250 ¬∞C, strongly doped at 300 ¬∞C, and etched at 450 ¬∞C; in contrast, bulk graphite is not oxidized until 800 ¬∞C. Atomically thin boron nitride has much better oxidation resistance than graphene. Monolayer boron nitride is not oxidized till 700 ¬∞C and can sustain up to 850 ¬∞C in air; bilayer and trilayer boron nitride nanosheets have slightly higher oxidation starting temperatures. The excellent thermal stability, high impermeability to gas and liquid, and electrical insulation make atomically thin boron nitride potential coating materials for preventing surface oxidation and corrosion of metals and other two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as black phosphorus. Better surface adsorption. Atomically thin boron nitride has been found to have better surface adsorption capabilities than bulk hexagonal boron nitride. According to theoretical and experimental studies, atomically thin boron nitride as an adsorbent experiences conformational changes upon surface adsorption of molecules, increasing adsorption energy and efficiency. The synergic effect of the atomic thickness, high flexibility, stronger surface adsorption capability, electrical insulation, impermeability, high thermal and chemical stability of BN nanosheets can increase the Raman sensitivity by up to two orders, and in the meantime attain long-term stability and extraordinary reusability not achievable by other materials. Dielectric properties. Atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride is an excellent dielectric substrate for graphene, molybdenum disulphide (MoS2), and many other 2D material-based electronic and photonic devices. As shown by electric force microscopy (EFM) studies, the electric field screening in atomically thin boron nitride shows a weak dependence on thickness, which is in line with the smooth decay of electric field inside few-layer boron nitride revealed by the first-principles calculations. Raman characteristics. Raman spectroscopy has been a useful tool to study a variety of 2D materials, and the Raman signature of high-quality atomically thin boron nitride was first reported by Gorbachev et al. and Li et al. However, the two reported Raman results of monolayer boron nitride did not agree with each other. Cai et al. conducted systematic experimental and theoretical studies of the intrinsic Raman spectrum of atomically thin boron nitride. They reveal that, in absence of interaction with a substrate, atomically thin boron nitride has a G-band frequency similar to that of bulk hexagonal boron nitride, but strain induced by the substrate can cause Raman shifts. Nevertheless, the Raman intensity of G-band can be used to estimate layer thickness and sample quality. BN nanosheets are electrical insulators and have a wide band gap of ~5.9 eV, which can be changed by the presence of Stone‚ÄìWales defects within the structure, by doping or functionalization, or by changing the number of layers. Owing to their hexagonal atomic structure, small lattice mismatch with graphene (~2%), and high uniformity, BN nanosheets are used as substrates for graphene-based devices. BN nanosheets are also excellent proton conductors. Their high proton transport rate, combined with the high electrical resistance, may lead to applications in fuel cells and water electrolysis.

He was governor of San Luis Potos√≠ from 1927 to 1931 through the Partido Nacional Revolucionario (PNR) and served as Secretary of Agriculture on two occasions, one under President Pascual Ortiz Rubio and again under President L√°zaro C√°rdenas. He maintained de facto control of his home state until shortly before his death.Ankerson, Dudley. Agrarian Warlord. Saturnino Cedillo and the Mexican Revolution in San Luis Potosi. Northern Illinois University Press. DeKalb. 1984. Saturnino Cedillo  Biography  Saturnino Cedillo was the son of Amado Cedillo and Pantaleona Mart√≠nez. He was born in 1890 in Palomas, a ranch belonging to the municipality of Ciudad del Ma√≠z. He was one of seven siblings: Elena, Homobono, Magdaleno, Cleofas, Engracia and Higinia. It would be thanks to his brothers Cleofas and Magdaleno that Saturnino went into the revolution. The first actions of dissent by the Cedillo family were not against the government but the wealthy landowners who preyed on their small neighbor's lands and often served as government representatives. The type of practice was widespread throughout the Porfiriato. At first, the Cedillos showed little interest in political issues, much less the anti-reelectionist movement that gained strength after the economic crisis of 1907. Through a school teacher from the nearby Tula, Tamaulipas called Alberto Carrera Torres, a friend of Magdaleno Cedillo the brothers began their involvement in politics. However, even after being introduced to politics, Cedillo didn't show much interest in the Maderista movement, in part due to its lack of positioning regarding the \\"agrarian question\\". The first armed revolt the Cedillo brothers were involved in was against the Maderista government which ruled San Luis Potos√≠ at the time. On November 17, 1912 they participated in a group of coordinated attacks in R√≠o Verde, Tula, and Ciudad del Ma√≠z. At the end, Saturnino and Cleofas read the Plan of Ayala to the peasants. After hearing about the failure of their attack on R√≠o Verde, the brothers retreated to Tula, where they decided to cross the border into the United States in order to flee. Cedillo then got arrested at the American border after trying to return to Mexico with weapons he had bought to arm his men. He was transferred to San Luis Potos√≠, where he spent a relatively short time in prison before being released. After Madero's assassination, the Cedillos momentarily surrendered to the usurper Victoriano Huerta before they rose in arms against him. What followed was a series of political maneuvers that allowed Saturnino to be on the triumphant side of several political conflicts. At first they joined Venustiano Carranza's constitutionalist movement, only to join Villistas and Zapatistas at the Aguascalientes Convention in 1914 when the two groups disavowed Carranza's government.Rojas, Beatriz. La peque√±a guerra: Los Carrera Torres y los Cedillo. El Colegio de Michoac√°n. Morelia. 1983. After the death of his brothers Cleofas and Magdaleno shortly after the Battle of El √âbano in 1915 and after a skirmish near Ciudad del Ma√≠z in 1917, respectively, Saturnino surrendered, but it was not accepted by the Constitucionalistas. After living in hiding for some years, things took a turn for the better with √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n's presidency. Cedillo adhered to the Plan of Agua Prieta and was rewarded with his inclusion in the Federal Army as a Brigade General. Cedillo was also given control of his native state. Saturnino Cedillo thrived under the rule of the sonorenses. After Plutarco El√≠as Calles took power in 1924, Cedillo's cacicazgo became stronger, as did his control over the state's political affairs. Cedillo was granted with even more control after his intervention in the Cristero War in which he was an important asset in fighting the Catholic rebels in Jalisco and Guanajuato, having killed their leader, Enrique Gorostieta in 1929.Paradoxically, Cedillo was himself a Catholic and sympathized with the cristero cause, which led to the antireligious \\"Calles Laws\\" not being enforced in San Luis Potos√≠. His control allowed him to create and maintain military-agricultural colonies in his area of control, where veterans of his army and their widows could live and work the land. After Obreg√≥n's assassination at the hands of a religious fanatic, who also hailed from San Luis Potos√≠, Calles's hold on Mexico's politics became even stronger. In 1930, Cedillo's niece, Mar√≠a Marcos Cedillo Salas, the daughter of his brother Homobono, learned to fly at the Civil Aviation School in San Luis Potos√≠, which he had been instrumental in setting up. She became Mexico's first female pilot and named her plane \\"√Ångel del Infierno\\" (Angel of Hell) after the term that her uncle used to describe aircraft. She then became a flying instructor. Maria died in her plane when it crashed during aerial stunts in 1933. Cedillo is said to have fired all the bullets from his pistol at the remains of the plane, which he blamed for the death of his niece. By 1934, Cedillo had briefly served as the Minister of Agriculture under Sonoran Pascual Ortiz Rubio. He was held in high regard by the agraristas, whom he convinced to support the presidential candidate L√°zaro C√°rdenas. Cedillo and C√°rdenas shared similarities regarding land reform, but their beliefs on the matter differed radically as Cedillo was in favor of land reform based on the concept of private ownership, but C√°rdenas was a firm enforcer of co-ownership, known as ejidos. Similarly, Cedillo was openly against the nationalization of the oil and the electric industries that took place under C√°rdenas's presidency. The differences would prove fatal for the relationship between the politicians.Mart√≠nez Assad, Carlos. Los rebeldes vencidos. Cedillo contra el Estado Cardenista. Fondo de Cultura Econ√≥mica. M√©xico. 1990. After a series of conflicts between the President and his Minister of Agriculture, which resulted in the latter being left out of most of the decision-making process, a downfall in relations between the two became inevitable. They included accusations from Vicente Lombardo Toledano, the leader of the government-endorsed Confederation of Mexican Workers, that Cedillo was a fascist, as well as General Francisco M√∫gica's attacks on Cedillo's proposed solution to the \\"agrarian question\\". The event that led to Cedillo's resignation was a conflict between him and students from Chapingo Autonomous University. Around then, Graham Greene visited Cedillo at his home in Palomas. In his book about his travels to Mexico, Greene briefly describes meeting Cedillo and talks about the concern from the federal government of an uprising led by the agrarian warlord.Greene, Graham. The Lawless Roads. Penguin Books. New York City. 2006. By the fall of 1938, most of Cedillo's private army had been disarmed, and important characters had been trying to convince him not to embark on a suicidal uprising against the cardenista government.Santos, Gonzalo N. Memorias. Grijalbo. M√©xico. 1986. However, Cedillo did not listen and rose up in arms against C√°rdenas at the beginning of 1939. Cedillo was killed, allegedly after a skirmish with federal forces, but theories of treason by one of his men also exist, on January 11, 1939.  Legacy  Largely forgotten by historiography, because he was considered a traitor as he took up arms against the people, thanks in part to Lombardo Toledano's accusations of Cedillo's links to the Nazis, which have since been disproven,Katz, Friedrich. \\"Introducci√≥n\\", in Carlos Mart√≠nez Assad (comp.) El camino de la rebeli√≥n del General Saturnino Cedillo. Oceano. M√©xico. 2013. Cedillo's legacy are the former colonies that he founded in the surroundings of Ciudad del Ma√≠z, and the annual commemoration in the same town on 11 January.

It is well known for the extraordinary technical demands it makes on the singer, and is sometimes performed in recitals and featured in anthologies by basses who are able to sing it. It features rapid precision-coloratura, abrupt octave- leaps between the upper and lower registers, and extended low notes, including a drawn-out low D (D2, one of the lowest notes demanded of any voice in opera). Mozart wrote it with one particular bass in mind: the very famous Ludwig Fischer. Sentiment Osmin, the bad-tempered house-servant to Pasha Selim, has caught his hated enemies trying to rescue a noblewoman from captivity in the Pasha's harem. He taunts them, gleefully anticipating the pleasure of seeing them hanged.
