His sole possessions were a kamandalu (water pot), staff and his two favourite books: the Bhagavad Gita and The Imitation of Christ. Narendra travelled extensively in India for five years, visiting centres of learning and acquainting himself with diverse religious traditions and social patterns. He developed sympathy for the suffering and poverty of the people, and resolved to uplift the nation. Living primarily on bhiksha (alms), Swami Vivekananda travelled on foot and by railway (with tickets bought by admirers). During his travels he met, and stayed with Indians from all religions and walks of life: scholars, dewans, rajas, Hindus, Muslims, Christians, paraiyars (low-caste workers) and government officials. North In August 1888 Swami Vivekananda's first destination was Varanasi, where he visited the places where Gautama Buddha and Adi Shankara preached and met Bengali writer Bhudev Mukhopadhyay and Hindu saint Trailanga Swami. After meeting Vivekananda, Mukhopadhyay said \\"Such vast experience and insight at such an early age! I am sure he will be a great man\\". Narendra also met Sanskrit and Vedic scholar Babu Pramadadas Mitra, with whom he corresponded on the interpretation of Hindu scriptures. After leaving Varanasi, he visited Ayodhya, Lucknow, Agra, Vrindavan, Hathras and Rishikesh. When he was staying in Vrindavan, one day, he saw a man smoking a hookah. He asked to the man to give him a tobacco bowl, but the man refused to do so explaining he was a man of lower caste. Narendra initially accepted his point and started walking, but within few minutes, he started feeling ashamed, as he had been practising \\"non-duality of soul\\" for a long time. He returned to the man, once again requested him to give him a tobacco bowl and despite the man's reluctance, he took the hookah from him and started smoking. While on the way to Haridwar, in September 1888, Narendra stayed at Hathras. There in the railway waiting room Narendra met Sharat Chandra Gupta, a railway station master. Gupta went to Narendra and asked if he was hungry, to which he got a reply in positive. He took Narendra to his home. When Narendra asked him what food he was going to offer, Gupta quoted a Persian poem in reply: \\"Oh beloved, I shall prepare the most delicious dish with the flesh of my heart\\". Narendra told Gupta that he had a great mission in life — he wanted to serve his motherland where starvation and poverty stalk millions of people. He narrated his dream of seeing India regaining her old glory. During the conversations Gupta asked Narendra if he could help him anyhow. Narendra immediately replied— \\"Yes, take up the kamandalu and go begging\\". Gupta understood that he was being asked to renounce his personal interest for the welfare of many. He decided to renounce the world and became a disciple of Narendranath. Narendra and Gupta left Hathras together. After leaving Hathras Narendra and Gupta first went to Haridwar, and from there travelled to Rishikesh, on foot. Here Narendra initiated Gupta into Sannyasa and was named Swami Sadananda. Gupta was the directly initiated monastic disciple of Vivekananda. Vivekananda called him \\"the child of my spirit\\". =Meeting with Pavhari Baba= Between 1888 and 1890, Swami Vivekananda visited Vaidyanath in Allahabad. On 18 January 1890 he went from Allahabad to Ghazipur and met Pavhari Baba, an Advaita Vedanta ascetic who spent much of his time in meditation. At the time he suffered from lumbago, and it was becoming impossible for him to move or sit in meditation. After meeting Baba, Swami Vivekananda wanted to become his disciple and Baba asked him to stay a few more days at Ghazipur. However, the night before his initiation Swami Vivekananda had a dream in which Ramakrishna looked at him with a melancholy face. This dream convinced Swami Vivekananda that no one other than Ramakrishna could be his teacher, and he abandoned the idea of becoming Baba's disciple. Return to Baranagar Math and Himalayan journey (1890–91) During the first half of 1890, after the deaths of fellow Ramakrishna disciples Balaram Bose and Suresh Chandra Mitra, Narendra returned to Baranagar Math because of ill health and to arrange for the math's financial support. After finishing his work in July, he left the math (accompanied by fellow monk Swami Akhandananda) for the Himalayas. This constituted the first phase of a journey which would bring Swami Vivekananda to the West. He visited the sacred sites of Nainital, Almora, Srinagar, Dehradun, Rishikesh and Haridwar. During these travels, he met Swami Brahmananda, Saradananda, Turiyananda and Advaitananda. They stayed at Meerut for several days engaged in meditation, prayer and study of the scriptures. At the end of January 1891, Swami Vivekananda left his colleagues and travelled to Delhi. Rajputana (1891) After visiting historical sites at Delhi, Swami Vivekananda started his travel towards Rajputana. In these days, he drew inspiration from the words of the Gautama Buddha— > Go forward without a path, Fearing nothing, caring for nothing! Wandering > alone, like the rhinoceros! Even as a lion, not trembling at noises, Even as > the wind, not caught in the net, Even as the lotus leaf, untainted by water, > Do thou wander alone, like the rhinoceros! In February 1891, he first went to Alwar, where he was warmly welcomed by the Hindus and the Muslims. There he told a Muslim religion scholar that one significant feature of the Quran is, though it was written a thousand years ago, the book was free from \\"interpolation\\" and retained its original purity. When Swami Vivekananda met the Mangal Singh, king of Alwar, whose outlook was Westernised, Singh challenged Swami Vivekananda and ridiculed Hindu idol worship. Swami Vivekananda attempted to explain to him that Hindu worship is symbolic worship, but failed to make the king understand. Then Swami Vivekananda saw a painting hanging on the wall, it was the a painting of the Singh's deceased father and asked him to spit on it. Singh became angry and retorted how he could spit on his father. Swami Vivekananda explained, though it was just a painting, not the king himself, it reminds everybody about the king, similarly an idol worshipped by a Hindu is actually a symbolic worship of the Supreme. From Alwar, Swami Vivekananda went to Jaipur, where he studied Panini's Ashtadhyayi with a Sanskrit scholar. Swami Vivekananda then went to Ajmer, where he visited the palace of Akbar and the Dargah Sharif. At Mount Abu he met Raja Ajit Singh of Khetri, who became an ardent devotee and supporter. Swami Tathagatananda, a senior monk in the Ramakrishna Order, wrote of their relationship: At Khetri Swami Vivekananda delivered discourses to the Raja, became acquainted with pandit Ajjada Adibhatla Narayana Dasu and studied the Mahābhāṣya on the sutras of Panini. After two-and-a-half months there, in October 1891 he left for Maharashtra. West (1891–92) Swami Vivekananda visited Ahmedabad, Wadhwan and Limbdi; at the former, he completed his studies of Islamic and Jain cultures. At Limbdi he met Thakur Saheb Jaswant Singh, who had been to England and America. From him, Narendra first got the idea of going to the West to preach Vedanta. He visited Junagadh and was the guest of Haridas Viharidas Desai, diwan of the state, who was so charmed by his company that every evening he and all the state officials conversed with Swami Vivekananda until late at night. Swami Vivekananda also visited Girnar, Kutch, Porbander, Dwaraka, Palitana, Nadiad, Nadiad ni haveli and Baroda. He remained for nine months at Porbander, furthering his philosophical and Sanskrit studies with learned pandits. Swami Vivekananda's next destinations included Mahabaleshwar, Pune, Khandwa and Indore. At Kathiawar he heard of the 1893 Parliament of the World's Religions, and was urged by his followers to attend it. After a brief stay in Bombay in July 1892, he met Bal Gangadhar Tilak during a train journey. After staying with Tilak for a few days in Pune, Swami Vivekananda travelled to Belgaum in October 1892 where he met Panth Maharaj, and to Panaji and Margao in Goa, spending three days at Rachol Seminary (the oldest convent in Goa, with rare religious manuscripts and printed works in Latin) studying Christian theological works. South (1892–93) Swami Vivekananda later travelled to Bangalore, where he became acquainted with K. Seshadri Iyer (diwan of the Mysore state). Iyer described Narendra as \\"a magnetic personality and a divine force which were destined to leave their mark on the history of his country\\". Iyer introduced him to the Maharaja (king) of Mysore Chamaraja Wodeyar. Wodeyar invited Swami Vivekananda to stay in his palace as a guest. The maharaja gave Swami Vivekananda a letter of introduction to the diwan of Cochin and a railway ticket. From Bangalore, Swami Vivekananda visited Trissur, Kodungalloor and Ernakulam. At Ernakulam he met Chattampi Swamikal, a contemporary of Narayana Guru, in early December 1892. From Ernakulam, Swami Vivekananda travelled to Trivandrum, Nagercoil and reached Kanyakumari on foot on Christmas Eve 1892. At Kanyakumari, Swami Vivekananda meditated on the \\"last bit of Indian rock\\" (later known as the Vivekananda Rock Memorial). At Kanyakumari, Narendra had a \\"vision of one India\\" (the \\"Kanyakumari resolve of 1892\\"). He later wrote: To realize this, he needed collaborators and funds. The people were easily to find, but the funds were hard to acquire, and therefore Narendra decided to travel to America, \\"to earn money myself, and then return to my country and devote the rest of my days to the realisation of this one aim of my life.\\" From Kanyakumari, Swami Vivekananda visited Madurai and had meetings with the Raja of Ramnad Bhaskara Sethupathi. During his meetings, he had extensive discussions on Hindu philosophy with eminent scholars like Mahavidwan R. Raghava Iyengar. The raja became his disciple, urging him to attend the Parliament of Religions in Chicago. From Madurai, Swami Vivekananda visited Rameswaram, Pondicherry and Madras; there, he met some of his disciples, specially Alasinga Perumal. Perumal went door to door in hopes of getting money for Swami Vivekananda's travel. With funds collected by his Madras disciples, the kings of Mysore, Ramnad, Khetri, diwans and other followers, Swami Vivekananda left Bombay for Chicago on 31 May 1893 with the name \\"Vivekananda\\", as suggested by Ajit Singh of Khetri, which means \\"the bliss of discerning wisdom\\".

He travelled to Britain in 1963, aged 20, to study at the Council of Legal Education with the intention of becoming a lawyer, but that ambition was superseded by his interest in art (he did not complete his legal studies until 1974), although he undertook no formal training in that field: \\"I was self-taught and worked in isolation until I was introduced to [the] Caribbean Artists Movement....

The Pro was replaced in the Fender lineup by its offspring the Pro Reverb.

In 1947 it would be joined by the Dual Professional, the same amplifier with 2 x 10\\" speakers in a V-front cabinet, soon to be renamed the \\"Super.\\" It was built in small numbers on a special- order basis, and used the same circuitry and even the same chassis as the Model 26 (Deluxe), with \\"Model 26\\" on the control plate scratched out and 6L6 tubes and larger transformers driving a 15-inch field coil speaker. The distinctive rear-panel cabinet was uncovered hardwood (maple, mahogany or walnut), with red, gold or blue grill cloth and vertical chrome bars in the center. =Tweed= In 1948 the Pro-Amp was part of Fender's revamped lineup in top-panel cabinets covered in luggage twill (miscalled \\"tweed\\") with redesigned electronics. The first version (1948–53) had a small, round- cornered speaker aperture and is known as the \\"TV-front;\\" this was followed by the \\"wide-panel\\" (1953–55) and \\"narrow-panel\\" (1955–60) cabinets. The circuit over this time evolved considerably, from 6SC7 (or 6SL7) grid-leak biased preamp tubes and paraphase inverter driving a cathode-biased 6L6G push-pull output section (model 5A5) to a more advanced 12AY7 cathode-biased preamp and 12AX7 cathodyne inverter driving fixed-bias 6L6GBs with negative feedback and filter choke (model 5E5-A); while headroom was increased and distortion reduced, output power remained around 25 watts. =Brownface= Mid-1960 Fender Pro Amp, model 5G5. From 1960–63 the Pro along with Fender's other combo amps received a cabinet with front-mounted controls covered in brown Tolex; it shared its circuit with the other members of the \\"Professional Series\\",Pro, Super, Bandmaster, Twin, Concert, Showman and Vibrasonic incorporating the architecture of the 5F6-A Bassman (long-tailed-pair phase inverter), separate bass, treble and volume controls on each channel and a complex \\"harmonic vibrato\\" tremolo circuit (6G5 and 6G5-A). The Pro, like many of the Professional Series, became solid-state rather than tube-rectified, eliminating rectifier sag; output was now pushed up to 40 watts through a pair of 5881s or 6L6GCs. Earliest brownface Pro Amps featured prototype aluminum knobs, these models primarily contain parts from 1959. =Blackface= In late 1963 the Fender amplifier line was reclothed in black Tolex with black-painted control panels. The Pro circuit (AA763) was largely the same as its predecessor, but reverted to tube rather than solid-state rectification and dropped the costly \\"harmonic vibrato\\" for a simpler electro-optic tremolo circuit. The Pro was joined in 1965 by the Pro Reverb, essentially the same amplifier with spring reverb and 2×12\\" speakers; the non-reverb Pro was discontinued the following year.

Starting as a lieutenant, Batet quickly escalated ranks during the Cuban War of Independence. After the Disaster of Annual, as a colonel, Batet took part in the investigation of the defeat taking part in the drafting of the Picasso Files. During the Second Spanish Republic, Domènec Batet was designated chief of the IV Organic Division in Catalonia and crushed the Catalan Uprising of October the 6th. With the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War Batet remained loyal to the Republic and was deployed in Burgos, where his subordinates betrayed him and captured him for the Nationalists. After months of captivity, Franco ordered the execution of Batet.  Biography  = Early military career = Domènec Batet i Mestres started his career in the Spanish Army as a volunteer lieutenant in the Cuban War of Independence. During the war, he received decorations and was promoted multiple times. He also developed a pacifist ideology. After that, during the Rif War, as a colonel he was one of the instruction judges who wrote the Picasso Files, a report directed by Juan Picasso González that pointed out the corruption of the African deployed Spanish officers, including Francisco Franco. = The Catalan uprising = Shortly after the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic, Domènec Betet was deployed in Catalonia as chief of the IV Organic Division. In that position Batet was always deferent with the Generalitat of Catalonia, treated well the soldiers and promoted the use of the Catalan between them. In 1932, Batet led the repression of the general strike of the Alt Llobregat. Instead of using terror tactics, ordered by Manuel Azaña, he acted quickly and avoided unnecessary bloodshed. Its most important action during the Republican years was the successfully suffocation of the Events of October the 6th, a Catalan attempt of secession. The uprising was fuelled by multiple issues, the most important: the inclusion of anti-republican ministers of the CEDA, a right wing Spanish political party that won the 1933 elections, and the cancellation of the Law of Contracts of Cultivation (Llei de Contractes de Conreu). This law was approved by the government of Lluís Companys and later on banned by the Spanish government, arguing that it exceeded the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of 1932. The Law of Contracts of Cultivation protected the peasants and when the Spanish government banned it infuriated the Catalan working class. On 5 October 1934 a general strike collapsed several cities of Spain. The following day, Lluís Companys decided to declare the Catalan Republic and numerous heavily armed squads occupied the streets of Barcelona and other towns, supporting the initiative and capturing public offices. Lluís Companys also telephoned Domènec Batet, asking for support, but Batet remained loyal to the central government and gained some time demanding a written request. While Companys wrote the request, Batet prepared the Army, Guardia Civil, and Guardia de Asalto troops and directly attacked the Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya. He was able to avoid any big confrontation with the revolted militias and Mossos d'Esquadra, because they were ordered not to attack until they were told so. Batet managed to surround the building, breaking the Catalan government chain of command, and shoot multiple warning shots with a howitzer. After 10 hours, and isolated from the militiamen and Mossos d'Esquadra, that had no orders, Lluís Companys was forced to surrender. Acting efficiently, Batet minimised the casualties and used the minimal force to fulfil the Spanish government orders. Some sources say that in order to avoid further fights against his own people Batet asked to be redeployed somewhere else while others claim that he was ordered to change of position as a punishment for his passivity during the confrontation. In any case, Niceto Alcalá-Zamora transferred him to Burgos. = Spanish Civil War and execution = On June 13, 1936 Batet was transferred to the Organic Division of Burgos, where the general Emilio Mola, leader of the Nationalist faction, was also deployed. When the Spanish Civil War started, Batet was betrayed by his own men and they imprisoned him. While Mola, who respected Batet as a military man, was the leader of the Nationalists, Batet was kept in prison. When Franco became the Generalissimo of the Nationalist forces he ordered the execution of Batet, according to leftist sources, in retaliation for the Picasso Files, where Batet accused Franco of corruption during the Rif War.

It was the most westerly townhouse in the City of Westminster. History The mansion was built by John Mordaunt, 1st Earl of Peterborough and remained the property of his descendants until the death in 1735 of Charles Mordaunt, 3rd Earl of Peterborough. It was then purchased by a member of the Grosvenor family. It has been erroneously stated that it was purchased or built in 1660 by Alexander Davis of the adjoining manor of Ebury, whose sole daughter and heiress, Mary Davis, in 1676 married Sir Thomas Grosvenor, 3rd Baronet (1655–1700), and was the mother of Sir Richard Grosvenor, 4th Baronet (1689–1732) who inherited the house, and further vast property in London, in right of his mother. However Pennant (1793) stated: \\"that here, in his boyish days, he had often experienced the hospitality of Sir Robert Grosvenor (i.e. the 6th Baronet (1695–1755), younger brother of 4th and 5th baronets) and that this house came by purchase of one of his family (doubtless his maternal grandfather) from the Mordaunts Earls of Peterborough\\".Pennant, Thomas, Some Account of London, 1793, quoted in Londina Illustrata In Hollar's four sheet View of London and Westminster, published in 1666, the mansion is clearly shown with the name \\"Peterborough House\\" under it, \\"a distinction not very likely to be given, had the Earl of Peterborough only been tenant to the Davis family, and not the ostensible proprietor himself\\".Londina Illustrata Before 1708 it had been let to Mr. Bull, a merchant,As shown in Hatton's New View of London, 1708 at which time the Earl of Peterborough was serving his country in Spain, and in the years 1710 and 1711 was employed on an embassy to Turin, and other Italian courts. \\"These engagements rendered an expensive establishment at home to him quite unnecessary\\".Londina Illustrata \\"The present (1892) Earl Grosvenor's grandfather resided in this house until 1755 after which time it was inhabited by Lord Delaval, and Mr. Symmons. Lord Delaval then had it in his own occupation, and occasionally lived in it for nearly 20 years, until 1809, when it was demolished to facilitate the redevelopment of Millbank by the Grosvenor Estate. Peterborough House and grounds occupied about seven acres, bounded on the east by the River Thames on the south by the former estate of the Marquis of Salisbury, later owned by the UK Government, on the west by Tothill Fields, owned by the Dean and Chapter of Westminster Abbey, and on the north by the Horseferry Road, originally leading from the fields to the ferry to Lambeth. In 1822 the estate was leased by the Grosvenor Estate to John Johnson, who in 1822 was \\"considerably improving this quarter of the Metropolis, by forming new streets, etc.\\" Thomas Pennant in his Some Account of London related of Peterborough House (by then \\"Grosvenor House\\"): :\\"Here, in my boyish days, I often experienced the hospitality of the late Sir Robert Grosvenor, its worthy owner, who enjoyed it, by the purchase by one of his family from the Mordaunts, Earls of Peterborough. All the rest of his vast property about London devolved on him in right of his mother, Mary, daughter and heiress of Alexander Davies, of Ebury, in the County of Middlesex. I find, in the plan of London by Hollar, a mansion on this spot under the name of Peterborough House. It probably was built by the first Earl of Peterborough. It was inhabited by his successors, and retained its name till the time of the death of that great but irregular genius, Charles, Earl of Peterborough, in 1735.\\" Pennant also referred to the mansion as \\"Millbank House\\", which name is corroborated by an entry in the minutes of the Vestry of St John's Church, Westminster. On 28 February 1812, a committee appointed to visit the parish boundaries at Millbank reported an alteration of the public footway in front of the site where Lord Grosvenor's house \\"called Millbank House formerly stood\\", apparently made under Section 51 of the Act of Parliament 49 Geo. III., cap. 142, the Vauxhall Bridge Act. This is the first mention of the bridge in the Vestry minutes. According to the Act the footpath should not have been closed until \\"each branch road from the intended bridge through the forecourt of Earl Grosvenor's house should have been completed.\\" According to Dod's Peerage Robert Grosvenor, 1st Baron Ebury was born at Millbank House, Westminster, on 24 April 1801. It was whilst living here, in 1735, that Charles Mordaunt, 3rd Earl of Peterborough (d.1735), was privately married to his second wife, Mrs. Anastasia Robinson, the celebrated contralto vocalist. He died the same year, after which the house was rebuilt by the Grosvenor family. The Earl of Wilton, brother of the late (1822) Marquess, and uncle of the present (1822) Duke of Westminster, was also born here. This mansion was the subject of a witty joke made by Joe Miller (1684–1738) in his jest book under the title of \\"high living\\" and referencing the house's position as the most westerly in Westminster: \\"Peterborough House, which is the very last in London one way, being rebuilt, a gentleman asked another 'who lived in it'? His friend told him 'Sir Robert Grosvenor.' 'I don't know,' said the first, 'what estate Sir Robert has, but he ought to have a very good one; for nobody lives beyond him in the whole town.'\\" Another joke is recorded as follows: As the dramatist and poet William Congreve (1670-1729) was being rowed in a ferry up the Thames at Millbank, the waterman remarked that, owing to its bad foundation, Peterborough House had sunk a story. \\"No friend,\\" said Congreve, \\"I rather believe it is a story raised.\\" Sources *Wilkinson, Robert, Londina Illustrata: Graphic and Historical Memorials of Monasteries, Churches, Chapels, Schools, Charitable Foundations, Palaces, Halls, Courts, Processions, Places of Early Amusement, and Modern Present Theatres, in the Cities and Suburbs of London and Westminster, Volume I, 1819–1825; with 1666 engraving of Peterborough House. *Smith, J.E., St John the Evangelist, Westminster: Parochial Memorials, Westminster, 1892, pp.355–8,362 References Category:Former houses in the City of Westminster ","title":"Peterborough House"},{"id":"47729015","text":"The Eselsweg (English: \\"donkey trail\\") is a long-distance hiking trail that follows an ancient trade route through the Mittelgebirge Spessart, in the states of Hesse and Bavaria, Germany. It is 111 km long and leads from Schlüchtern in the valley of the Kinzig river to Großheubach on the river Main. The trail follows an ancient trade route on which donkey caravans used to transport salt, thus giving rise to the name. History The historic road Eselsweg has likely been in use since prehistoric times. It may have connected Celtic circular ramparts, found for example at Bürgstadt and Miltenberg to similar places near the Kinzig, such as the '. Since in pre-modern times the valleys of the Spessart were often swampy and water-logged, the path stuck to the higher elevations. This route also avoided the need for constant climbing into and out of the river valleys. The route's name derives from the caravans of donkeys used in the Middle Ages to transport salt from Orb to Miltenberg, where it was either loaded on ships or carried on by land. Miltenberg was an important toll station set up by the Archbishop of Mainz. The Eselsweg was first mentioned in 1339 as \\"Eßelspfadt\\". Route Dr.-Kihn-Platz where Eselsweg and Birkenhainer Strasse meet Official detour sign on the Eselsweg near Heigenbrücken due to forestry work conducted by Deutsche Bahn, 2013 Schloss Luitpoldshöhe near Rohrbrunn The modern hiking trail mostly follows the historic route and crosses the Spessart as a high route which sticks to the peaks and ridges and avoids the valleys and villages. It is maintained and signposted by the ' with a black \\"E\\" on white. The Eselsweg hiking trail starts at the train station of Schlüchtern, Main-Kinzig. It then climbs from the Kinzig valley into the Spessart hills and goes roughly southwest and then south. Near the , it reaches the Bavarian border and follows it west before turning south again, entering the Landkreis Aschaffenburg. In this area, the Eselsweg also touches another ancient trade route, the Birkenhainer Strasse. The two trails run alongside each other to the Dr.-Kihn-Platz, where they part ways. The Eselsweg continues to lead mostly in a southerly direction, until it crosses the Autobahn 3 at Weibersbrunn before looping west and south back to the Autobahn at Rohrbrunn, a possible location of the inn that inspired a story by Wilhelm Hauff and the movie The Spessart Inn. The trail passes a hunting lodge used by Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria, ', and snakes southwards and southwest, entering the Landkreis Miltenberg. It reaches the Main valley at the Kloster Engelberg, above Großheubach and then leads down over 600 steps (Engelsstaffeln) into the town. For most of its length after the initial climb the trail stays at an elevation between 400 m and 500 m and sports few significant climbs. It mostly passes through mixed coniferous forest. The only villages the trail directly touches are: Lettgenbrunn (a part of Jossgrund) and Weibersbrunn. It also passes quite close to the villages of Flörsbach (a part of Flörsbachtal) and Wildensee (a part of Eschau) as well as to Heigenbrücken, a larger town.

On the night of August 8–9, four members of the Manson Family invaded the rented home of actress Sharon Tate and movie director Roman Polanski at 10050 Cielo Drive in Los Angeles. They murdered Tate, who was 8½ months pregnant, along with three friends and an 18-year-old visitor who was slain as he was leaving the home. Polanski was not present on the night of the murders, as he was working on a film in Europe. The murders were committed by Tex Watson, Susan Atkins, and Patricia Krenwinkel under the direction of Charles Manson. Watson drove Atkins, Krenwinkel, and Linda Kasabian from Spahn Ranch to the residence on Cielo Drive. Manson was a would- be musician who had tried to get a recording contract with record producer Terry Melcher, who was a previous renter of the house with musician Mark Lindsay and Melcher's girlfriend Candice Bergen. Melcher had snubbed Manson, leaving him disgruntled. Manson was allegedly displeased with the panic of the murder victims, so he took the four murderers plus Leslie Van Houten and Steve \\"Clem\\" Grogan on a drive the following night \\"to show them how to do it\\". He considered a number of murders and attempted one over the course of the next few hours, then he ordered Kasabian to drive the group to 3301 Waverly Drive. This was the home of supermarket executive Leno LaBianca and his wife Rosemary, co-owner of a dress shop. The house was located in the Los Feliz section of Los Angeles next door to a house at which Manson and Family members had attended a party the previous year. Manson and his followers murdered both Leno and Rosemary LaBianca in the early morning hours of August 10.  Tate murders  \\\\--> }} On the night of August 8, 1969, Tex Watson took Susan Atkins, Linda Kasabian, and Patricia Krenwinkel to \\"that house where Melcher used to live\\", as Manson had instructed him, to \\"totally destroy\\" everyone in it, and to do it \\"as gruesome as you can\\".Bugliosi, Vincent with Gentry, Curt. Helter Skelter: The True Story of the Manson Murders 25th Anniversary Edition, W. W. Norton & Company, 1994. . . Manson told the women to do as Watson instructed them. Krenwinkel was one of the early Family members and had met Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys when he picked her up hitchhiking. The occupants of the house at 10050 Cielo Drive that evening were movie actress Sharon Tate, who was 8½ months pregnant and the wife of film director Roman Polanski; her friend and former lover Jay Sebring, a noted hairstylist; Polanski's friend and aspiring screenwriter Wojciech Frykowski; and Frykowski's lover Abigail Folger, heiress to the Folgers coffee fortune and daughter of Peter Folger. Polanski was in Europe working on a film project. Music producer Quincy Jones was a friend of Sebring; he had planned to join him that evening but did not go. Sebring had invited Steve McQueen to the party at Tate's house on the night of the murders; McQueen said that he invited his girlfriend to come along but she suggested an intimate night at home. This specific house was chosen because both Watson and Manson had been there on at least one other occasion, and Watson was familiar with the layout. The murder team arrived at Cielo Drive just past midnight on August 9, 1969. Watson climbed a telephone pole near the entrance gate and cut the phone line to the house. The murderers backed their car to the bottom of the hill that led to the estate and walked back up to the house. They thought that the gate might be electrified or equipped with an alarm, so they climbed a brushy embankment to the right of the gate and entered the grounds. Headlights approached them from within the angled property, and Watson ordered the women to lie in the bushes. He stepped out and ordered the approaching driver to halt. Steven Parent had been visiting the property's caretaker William Garretson, who lived in the guest house. Watson leveled a .22-caliber revolver at Parent, and the frightened youth begged him not to hurt him, claiming that he would not say anything. Watson lunged at Parent with a knife, giving him a defensive slash wound on the palm of his hand that severed tendons and tore the boy's watch off his wrist, then he shot him four times in the chest and abdomen, killing him. Watson ordered the women to help push the car farther up the driveway. Watson next cut the screen of a window, then told Kasabian to keep watch down by the gate; she walked over to Parent's car and waited. Watson removed the screen, entered through the window, and let Atkins and Krenwinkel in through the front door. He whispered to Atkins and awoke Frykowski who was sleeping on the living room couch. Watson kicked him in the head, and Frykowski asked him who he was and what he was doing there. Watson replied, \\"I'm the devil, and I'm here to do the devil's business.\\" On Watson's direction, Atkins found the house's three other occupants with Krenwinkel's help and forced them to the living room. Watson began to tie Tate and Sebring together by their necks with rope which he had brought, and he slung it over one of the living room's ceiling beams. Sebring protested the murderers' rough treatment of the pregnant Tate, so Watson shot him. Folger was taken momentarily back to her bedroom for her purse, and she gave the murderers $70. Watson then stabbed Sebring seven times. Frykowski's hands had been bound with a towel, but he freed himself and began struggling with Atkins, who stabbed at his legs with a knife. He fought his way out the front door and onto the porch, but Watson caught up with him, struck him over the head with the gun multiple times, stabbed him repeatedly, and shot him twice. Kasabian had heard \\"horrifying sounds\\" and moved toward the house from her position in the driveway. She told Atkins that someone was coming in an attempt to stop the murders. Inside the house, Folger escaped from Krenwinkel and fled out a bedroom door to the pool area. Krenwinkel pursued her and caught her on the front lawn where she stabbed her and tackled her to the ground. Watson then helped finish her off; her assailants stabbed her a total of 28 times. Frykowski struggled across the lawn, but Watson murdered him with a final flurry of stabbing. Frykowski suffered 51 stab wounds, and had also been struck 13 times in the head with the butt of Watson’s gun, which bent the barrel and broke off one side of the gun grip, which was recovered at the scene. In the house, Tate pleaded to be allowed to live long enough to give birth, and offered herself as a hostage in an attempt to save the life of her unborn child, but both Atkins and Watson stabbed Tate 16 times, killing her. Manson had told the women to \\"leave a sign—something witchy\\", so Atkins wrote \\"pig\\" on the front door in Tate's blood.  LaBianca murders  Manson took the four murderers plus Leslie Van Houten and Steve \\"Clem\\" Grogan for a drive the following night. He was displeased with the panic and flight of the victims in the previous night's murders, and he was taking those six followers out \\"to show them how to do it\\". He considered a number of murders during the next few hours' ride and attempted one, then told Kasabian to drive to 3301 Waverly Drive. This was the home of supermarket executive Leno and Rosemary LaBianca, co-owner of a dress shop, located in the Los Feliz section of Los Angeles next door to a house where Manson and Family members had attended a party the previous year. According to Atkins and Kasabian, Manson disappeared up the driveway and returned to say that he had tied up the house's occupants. He then sent Watson up with Krenwinkel and Van Houten. Watson states in his autobiography that Manson went up alone, then returned to take him up to the house with him. Manson pointed out a sleeping man through a window, and the two entered through the unlocked back door. Watson added at trial that he \\"went along with\\" the women's account because it made him \\"look that much less responsible.\\" As Watson related it, Manson roused the sleeping Leno LaBianca from the couch at gunpoint and had Watson bind his hands with a leather thong. Rosemary was brought into the living room from the bedroom, and Watson followed Manson's instructions to cover the couple's heads with pillowcases which he bound in place with lamp cords. Manson left, sending Krenwinkel and Van Houten into the house with instructions that the couple should be killed. Watson had complained to Manson earlier of the inadequacy of the previous night's weapons. He sent the women from the kitchen to the bedroom, where Rosemary LaBianca had been returned, while he went to the living room and began stabbing Leno LaBianca with a chrome-plated bayonet. The first thrust went into his throat. Watson heard a scuffle in the bedroom and went in there to discover Rosemary LaBianca keeping the women at bay by swinging the lamp tied to her neck. He stabbed her several times with the bayonet, then returned to the living room and resumed attacking Leno, whom he stabbed a total of 12 times. He then carved the word \\"WAR\\" into his abdomen. He then returned to the bedroom and found Krenwinkel stabbing Rosemary LaBianca with a knife from the LaBianca kitchen. Manson had instructed Watson to ensure that each of the women played a part, so he told Van Houten to join in stabbing her. She did, stabbing her approximately 16 times in the back and the exposed buttocks. Van Houten claimed at trial that Rosemary LaBianca was dead when she stabbed her. Evidence showed that many of the 41 stab wounds had, in fact, been inflicted post-mortem. Watson then cleaned off the bayonet and showered, while Krenwinkel wrote \\"Rise\\" and \\"Death to pigs\\" on the walls and \\"Healter Skelter\\" on the refrigerator door, all in LaBianca's blood. She gave Leno LaBianca 14 puncture wounds with an ivory-handled, two-tined carving fork, which she left jutting out of his stomach. She also planted a steak knife in his throat. Meanwhile, Manson drove the other three Family members who had departed Spahn with him that evening to the Venice home of an actor. He left them there and drove back to Spahn Ranch, leaving them and the LaBianca killers to hitchhike home. Manson wanted his followers to murder the actor in his apartment, but Kasabian thwarted this murder by deliberately knocking on the wrong apartment door and waking a stranger. The group abandoned the murder plan and left, but Atkins defecated in the stairwell on the way out.  Investigation  In initial confessions to cellmates of hers at Sybil Brand Institute, Atkins said she killed Tate. In later statements to her attorney, to prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi, and before a grand jury, Atkins indicated Tate had been stabbed by Tex Watson. In his 1978 autobiography, Watson said that he had stabbed Tate and that Atkins had never touched her. Since he was aware that the prosecutor, Bugliosi, and the jury, that had tried the other Tate–LaBianca defendants, were convinced Atkins had stabbed Tate, he falsely testified that he did not stab her.  Helter Skelter  After leaving the DA's office, prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi, jointly with Curt Gentry, wrote a book about the Manson trial called Helter Skelter (1974). The book won an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for the best true crime book of the year. It was adapted twice for television movies (one produced in 1976 and one in 2004). As of 2015, it is the best-selling true crime book in publishing history, with more than seven million copies sold.Rebecca Trounson and Elaine Woo, \\"Famed Manson family prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi dies at 80,\\" Los Angeles Times, June 9, 2015.David Stout, \\"Vincent T.

Aftermath  The five perpetrators Atkins, Krenwinkel, Manson, Van Houten, and Watson were each tried and convicted for their roles in the TateLaBianca murders. Originally, each defendant received a death sentence. However, in 1972, the Supreme Court of California ruled in People v. Anderson that the state's then-current death penalty laws were unconstitutional. As a result, the Anderson decision spared the lives of 107Jonathan R. Sorenson, James W. Marquart & Madhava R.

Subsequently, the death sentences for each of the five perpetrators convicted in the TateLaBianca murders were commuted to life in prison, which by law included the possibility of parole. * Susan Atkins (19482009): Atkins remained in prison until her death from brain cancer at age 61 in 2009. At the time of her death, she was California's longest- serving female inmate. Atkins had been denied parole 14 times, and her request for compassionate release had also been denied. * Patricia Krenwinkel (born 1947): Imprisoned in 1971, Krenwinkel remains incarcerated. Following the 2009 death of fellow Manson gang member, Susan Atkins, Krenwinkel is now the longest-incarcerated female inmate in the California penal system. She has been denied parole 14 times, most recently in 2017. * Charles Manson (19342017): Manson remained imprisoned until his death from cardiac arrest resulting from respiratory failure and colon cancerWhere Are Charles Manson's 'Family Members' Now?

He was just a few days past his 83rd birthday, and had spent all but 13 years of his life in some sort of supervised setting (either prison, reformatory or boys' home). While in prison, Manson had been denied parole 12 times. After 1997, he refused to attend any of his parole hearings. * Leslie Van Houten (born 1949): Upon her conviction and death sentence in 1971, at the age of 21, Van Houten became the youngest woman ever put on California's death row, as well as the youngest member of the Manson \\"Family\\" convicted of murder.Leslie Van Houten Was A 19-Year-Old Homecoming Queen When She Met Charles Manson (Her original conviction and death sentence was overturned on appeal.

C. (2000) All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book. McFarland & Company. . The AAGPBL emerged in the spring of 1943, being formed as a non-profit organization as an initiative of Philip K. Wrigley, chewing gum magnate and owner of the Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball club. Wrigley conceived the idea as a promotional sideline to maintain interest in baseball as the World War II military draft was depleting Major League rosters of first-line players. By sending out scouts and setting up tryouts in dozens of major cities, Wrigley attracted hundreds of girls from all over America and Canada who were eager to play in this new professional league. Of these, only 280 were invited to the final tryouts at Wrigley Field in Chicago where 60 were chosen to become the first girls to ever play professional baseball.All- American Girls Professional Baseball League History . Born in Cudahy, Wisconsin, Ellen Tronnier joined the league when she was only 16 years old, after surviving two exhausting tryouts.Heaphy, Leslie A; May, Mel Anthony. Encyclopedia of Women and Baseball. McFarland & Company. . The first was held locally at Borchert Field, where only 16 ladies were chosen to go on to in Chicago for the decisive tryout. Tronnier was one of the lucky ones and was assigned to the South Bend Blue Sox. After one season, Tronnier decided to return to school and enrolled in the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse. Upon completion of her degree, she taught physical education in the Milwaukee Public Schools during 33 years, working at South Division High School and Sholes Middle School. Besides, Tronnier played softball for a long time, competing in several tournaments as an accomplished women's fast pitch softball player for nearly 27 years. During this period, her teams won league, state and regional championships and, in 1956, her club won the National Invitational Tournament. Then, during the 1970s she opened a baseball school for girls as part of the Milwaukee Recreation Department. The AABPBL folded after the 1954 season. Twenty-six years later, June Peppas, a former star pitcher in the league, began assembling a list of names and addresses of former AAGPBL players and worked into a newsletter that resulted in the AAGPBL’s first-ever reunion at Chicago's Wrigley Field in 1982.SABR Biography Project – June Peppas article by Jim Sargent. Starting from that reunion, a Players Association was formed in 1986 and many former AAGPBL players continued to enjoy reunions, which became annual events in 1988. Tronnier attended the reunions and regained communication with her teammates and old friends. Of the approximately 560 ladies who had played in the league, most had lost touch with the others, at least not until the reunion held in Chicago. Through the organization of the All American Girls Professional Baseball League Players Association, the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum opened in 1988 an AAGPBL permanent display at Cooperstown, New York, which is dedicated to the entire league rather than any individual personalities. Tronnier, along with the rest of the league's girls, is now enshrined in the Hall. It was inspiration enough for the 1992 film A League of Their Own, directed by Penny Marshall and starred by Geena Davis, Tom Hanks and Madonna, where was depicted what these pioneering girls endured.IMDb.com – A League of Their Own (1992 film). Tronnier gained induction into the Wisconsin Amateur Softball Association Hall of Fame in 1990.

The term outrage porn was coined in 2009 by political cartoonist and essayist Tim Kreider of The New York Times. Overview The use of the term was first attributed to Tim Kreider in a New York Times article in July 2009, where Kreider said: \\"It sometimes seems as if most of the news consists of outrage porn, selected specifically to pander to our impulses to judge and punish and get us all riled up with righteous indignation\\". Kreider made a distinction between authentic outrage and outrage porn by stating, \\"I'm not saying that all outrage is inherently irrational, that we should all just calm down, that It's All Good. All is not good...Outrage is healthy to the extent that it causes us to act against injustice\\". Kreider is also noted as saying: \\"It spares us the impotent pain of empathy, and the harder, messier work of understanding\\". The term has also been frequently used by Observer media critic, Ryan Holiday. In his 2012 book Trust Me, I'm Lying, Holiday described outrage porn as a \\"better term\\" for a \\"manufactured online controversy\\" to describe the fact that \\"People like getting pissed off almost as much as they like actual porn\\". In general use, outrage porn is a term used to explain media that is created not in order to generate sympathy, but rather to cause anger or outrage among its consumers. It is characterized by insincere rage, umbrage and indignation without personal accountability or commitment. Media outlets are often incentivized to feign outrage because it specifically triggers many of the most lucrative online behaviors, including leaving comments, repeat pageviews and social sharing, which the outlets capitalize on. Salon, Gawker, and affiliated websites Valleywag and Jezebel have been noted for abusing the tactic. Traditional media outlets, including television news and talk radio outlets have also been characterised as being engaged in outrage media. Research In 2014, Jonah Berger, a professor of marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania conducted a study on the spreadability of emotions via social media and concluded that \\"Anger is a high-arousal emotion, which drives people to take action...It makes you feel fired up, which makes you more likely to pass things on\\". Additionally, online audiences may be susceptible to outrage porn in part because of their feeling of powerlessness to managers, politicians, creditors, and celebrities. In 2014, Tufts University professors Jeffrey Berry and Sarah Sobieraj in their book The Outrage Industry characterised outrage media as being a genre as well as a discursive style of media, which attempts to provoke emotions through the use of overgeneralisation, sensationalism, and misleading or false information. They also characterised it as being personality-centred, focusing on a particular media professional, and as being reactive, responding to already- reported news rather than breaking stories of its own. In their 2009 study of political media in the United States, they found outrage journalism to be widespread, with 90 percent of all content analyzed including at least one example of it; and that \\"the aggregate audience for outrage media is immense\\".

The Esen Buqa–Ayurbarwada war was a war between the Chagatai Khanate under Esen Buqa I and the Yuan dynasty under Ayurbarwada Buyantu Khan (Emperor Renzong) and its ally the Ilkhanate under Öljaitü. The war ended with the victory for the Yuan and the Ilkhanate, but the peace only came after the death of Esen Buqa in 1318.  Background  The Yuan emperor Ayurbarwarda maintained friendly relations with Öljaitü, ruler of the Ilkhanate. As for the relations with the Chagatai Khanate, the Yuan forces had, in fact, already for a long time been entrenched in the east. This was originally meant to keep Chapar in submission, but since the latter's defeat in 1310, the garrisons were perceived as a threat to the Chaghadaid state. In order to solve the shortages of pasture grounds, Esen Buqa I, ruler of the Chagatai Khanate sent envoys in an attempt to negotiate with the border garrison commander Tughaji Jinsank in order to convince them to adjust their position in 1312. The negotiations, however, did not go well, and strained relations between the two. Esen Buqa sent tributes to Ayurbarwada in 1312 and 1313, but the Yuan court's attempts to restrict trade between the two states kept tensions high. Ayurbarwada's emissary, Abishqa, to the Ilkhanate while travelling through Central Asia, revealed to a Chaghadayid commander that an alliance between the Yuan and the Ilkhanate had been created, and the allies forces were mobilizing to attack the khanate. Esen Buqa ordered Abishqa to be executed and decided to attack the Yuan because of these events, thus breaking the peace that his father Duwa had brokered with China in 1304. At the same time, Muslim Ozbeg Khan mounted the throne of the Golden Horde in 1312. He proscribed Buddhism and Shamanism among the Mongols in Russia, reversing the spread of the Yuan culture. Yuan envoys seems to have backed Toqta's son, a rival candidate, against Ozbeg.C. P. Atwood Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, p. 206. Esen Buqa attempted to gain an alliance of Ozbeg Khan against the Yuan and the Ilkhanate, but without success. The war The element of surprise, however, was lost when a Chaghadaid official defected to Tughaji's camp and revealed the plan. Tughaji withdrew his troops to beyond the Irtysh, then defeated Esen Buqa's troops in the spring of 1314. The magnitude of the defeat was such that Esen Buqa sought peace, claiming to the Yuan court that Tughaji had moved to attack first. Chunqur, a son of Tughaji, convinced the Chagatai khan that none of the Yuan troops besides Tughaji's would move against him if he attacked again. Tughaji, however, again kept Esen Buqa's troops from victory. The Yuan Emperor Ayurbarwada, growing impatient with Esen Buqa, ordered all of the garrisons to invade the Chagatai realm. Hami was conquered soon afterwards. After his failure, Esen Buqa warned Ozbeg Khan that the Yuan emperor Ayurbarwada would replace him with another from the House of Jochi in 1315.V. Vernadsky The Mongols and Russia, p. 328. This testimony was never corroborated with any evidence. Ozbeg was suggested not to believe it by one of his vizirs and he therefore refused to help Esen Buqa. In an attempt to make up for some of his losses, Esen Buqa dispatched his brother Kebek with a large force to attack Khorasan, a part of the Ilkhanate, sometime after 1315. Before that, the Ilkhan Öljaitü drove out the Qaraunas of Dawud Khoja, son of Qutlugh Khwaja from Afghanistan. The invasion of the Ilkhanate was initially successful. Kebek and Yasa'ur defeated Öljaitü's army at the Murgab River and advanced to Herat. But it turned sour when news reached the army that Talas and the pasture of Issyk Kül had been captured by Yuan forces under the Kipchak commander Chongur.René Grousset The Empire of the Steppes, p. 340. Many of the Chaghadaid troops' families had been located there, and, already tired of campaigning, they fled back home. The defection of a Yuan contender, Khutughtu, to Esen Buqa's side did little to improve the situation. Around this time Yasa'ur defected to Öljeitü and engaged in battle with Kebek's troops. The Yuan army crushed Esen Buqa's resistance and plundered his winter quarters on the Issyk Kul as well as his summer residence in Talas. The disaster was completed when prince Tore Temür deserted to the Yuan. Only after Esen Buqa's death in 1318, his brother and successor Kebek mitigated the situation with the Yuan and the Ilkhanate. He enjoyed peaceful relations with the Yuan despite Ayurbarwada's reestablishment of nominal authority in Turfanistan. This allowed peace to prosper again in the region.

She raced for the connections of her more famous older sister Lochsong and while never matching the achievements of her sibling she became a top-class racemare who excelled in sprint races on firm ground. As a juvenile she was beaten on her debut before winning at Ascot Racecourse in the sixth of what became known as Frankie Dettori's \\"Magnificent Seven\\". After failing to win in four attempts in 1997 she reached her peak as a four-year-old in 1998 when she won two races including the Group One Nunthorpe Stakes at York Racecourse in August. She failed to win again and was retired from racing in 1999. Background Lochangel is a chestnut mare with a white star and two white socks bred by her owner, Jeff Smith's Littleton Stud. She was sired by the American-bred stallion Night Shift, a son of Northern Dancer. Night Shift sired many other good racehorses in a long stud career, including In The Groove, Azamour, Well Chief, Barons Pit (Diadem Stakes) and Nicolotte (Queen Anne Stakes). Lochangel's dam Peckitt's Well was a useful racemare who won five races over sprint distances and was rated 98 by Timeform in 1985. As a broodmare she made an immediate impact with her first foal Lochsong who was twice champion sprinter in Europe and was voted Cartier Horse of the Year in 1993. Peckitt's Well was a distant descendant of the broodmare Fair Terms, the female-line ancestor of several major Japanese winners including Narita Brian. Like Lochong, Lochangel was trained throughout her racing career by Ian Balding at Kingsclere in Hampshire. Like many of Balding's trainees, she usually raced in a white sheepskin noseband. Racing career =1996: two- year-old season= On her racecourse debut, Lochangel finished second in a maiden race over six furlongs at Kempton Park Racecourse on 7 September 1996. Three weeks later she was ridden by Frankie Dettori and started 5/4 joint favourite for the Blue Seal Stakes (for fillies with no more than one previous start) at Ascot Racecourse. She led from the start and won by three-quarters of a length from the Henry Cecil-trained Corsini. Her win was significant as it was the sixth of Dettori's \\"Magnificent Seven\\": the 25-year-old Italian jockey won all seven races on the card including the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes on Mark of Esteem, driving several bookmakers to near financial ruin. =1997: three-year-old season= Lochangel began her second season in the Listed Chartwell Fillies' Stakes over seven furlongs at Lingfield Park Racecourse on 10 May. Starting the 5/2 favourite she led for most of the way but tired and was overtaken in the final furlong, finishing third behind Supercal and Baked Alaska. The filly was off the course for four months before returning in an all-aged handicap race at Goodwood Racecourse on 13 September in which she finished a close fourth under top weight of 139 pounds. Two weeks later she was stepped up in class for the Group Three Diadem Stakes at Ascot but finished unplaced behind Elnadim. On her only other appearance of the year she finished seventh of nine behind the five-year-old Bowden Rose in a handicap for fillies and mares at Newmarket Racecourse in October. =1998: four-year- old season= On her first appearance as a four-year-old Lochangel started favourite for a minor stakes event over five furlongs at Bath Racecourse on 28 April and finished second, two lengths behind the five-year-old gelding Speed On. At the same track two weeks later the filly contested the Listed Somerset Stakes and started favourite against eight opponents including Carranita (winner of the Summer Stakes and the Hopeful Stakes), Nadwah (Queen Mary Stakes) and Hever Golf Rose. Ridden by Martin Dwyer, she took the lead a quarter of a mile from the finish and drew away in the closing stages to record her first win for seventeen months, beating Desert Lady by three and a half lengths. Frankie Dettori resumed his partnership with the filly when she was stepped up in class for the Temple Stakes at Sandown on 25 May. She took the lead a furlong out but was overtaken and beaten three quarters of a length by the six-year-old gelding Bolshoi, with Elnadim in third and Compton Place among the unplaced runners. At Royal Ascot in June she was one nineteen sprinters to contest the King's Stand Stakes. She led for most of the way but was again caught by Bolshoi in the final strides and was beaten one and a quarter lengths by the winner. In the King George Stakes at Goodwood in July she started favourite but finished third behind Land of Dreams and Lady Alexander after being hampered inside the final furlong. On 20 August Lochangel, with Dettori in the saddle, contested the Group One Nunthorpe Stakes over five furlongs on firm groundat York Racecourse and started the 6/1 third choice in the betting behind Elnadim and Land of Dreams. Bolshoi was again in the field whilst the other runners included Arkadian Hero (Mill Reef Stakes), Sainte Marine (Prix du Gros Chêne), Bollin Joanne (Duke of York Stakes), My Best Valentine (Bentinck Stakes), Averti (King George Stakes, 1997), Rambling Bear (King George Stakes, 1996), Yorkies Boy (Palace House Stakes) and Almaty (Molecomb Stakes). The French challenger Sainte Marine went into the lead and set a strong pace with Lochangel among her closest pursuers. In the last quarter mile Dettori tracked to the right and Lochangel made her challenge along the stands-side rail. She overtook the French filly inside the final furlong and won by a length, with the outsiders Dashing Blue (also trined by Ian Balding), Bishops Court and Rambling Bear filling the next three places. Her win was enthusiastically received by the York crowd, many of whom had backed the filly owing to Dettori's popularity. Asked to compare the winner to her older sister, Balding said \\"They're both super movers with devastating speed, but Lochangel is an awful lot easier to train. I adored Lochsong but she was half crazy\\". Lochangel was tried over six furlongs for the first time in almost a year when she started 9/2 second favourite for the Haydock Sprint Cup in September and finished sixth behind the three-year-old Tamarisk. On her final appearance of the year she was sent to France for the Prix de l'Abbaye over 1000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse in October. She finished sixth behind My Best Valentine after fading in the last 200 metres. =1999: five-year-old season= Lochangel remained in training in 1999 but failed to win in six starts. She produced her best performance on her seasonal debut when she finished second to Tipsy Creek in the Temple Stakes on 31 May. She then finished fourth in the King's Stand Stakes before running unplaced behind Stravinsky in the July Cup and the Nunthorpe Stakes. She was then sent to Ireland and dropped in class for the Flying Five at Leopardstown Racecourse in September and started favourite but finished third to Tedburrow. Lochangel made her final appearance later that month in the World Trophy (then a Listed race) at Newbury. She never looked likely to win and finished seventh of the thirteen runners behind Imperial Beauty. Her retirement was announced shortly after her run at Newbury. Balding said \\"She's been a wonderful mare for the stable, and had so much class and a lovely temperament. I actually think Lochangel has been desperately unlucky this season. She was badly drawn in the King's Stand Stakes, which I thought she had a great chance of winning, and since then the going has gone against her... Now I just hope she produces lots of lovely babies – and you can be sure they'll be coming to me!\\" Breeding record Lochangel was retired from racing to become a broodmare for the Littleton Stud. The mare was offered for sale at Tattersalls in December 2007 but was bought back by Jeff Smith when the bidding stopped at 150,000 guineas. To date she has produced eight named foals: *Star Pupil, a chestnut colt, foaled in 2001, sired by Selkirk. Won one race. *Angel Wing, chestnut filly, 2002, by Barathea.

Most Mayan Americans originate from western Guatemala and Chiapas.Ancient Mayan languages are creating problems for today's immigration courts - LA Times  Guatemalan civil war and reasons for migration  The Cold War led to the spread of Communist ideology to Latin America. Fidel Castro and The Cuban Revolution influenced an uprising from the Guatemalan working class, indigenous Mayans and peasant Ladino workers. With the success of Communist uprisings in Cuba, other Latin American countries began opting for Revolution. These two demographics began forming left-wing factions and Guerrilla groups like the MR-13, Guatemalan Party of Labor, and The EGP. This armed conflict was a result of a coup d'Etat supported by the CIA against the democratically elected government of Jacobo Arbenz in 1954. Mayan Population of Guatemala found themselves caught in the crossfires of the Guatemalan Civil War from 1954-1996. During this time period, food shortages, political oppression, and violence led to the death of over 200,000 Guatemalan Mayans. To combat the Communist Guerilla groups, the Guatemalan military issued a policy of Tierras Arrasadas which was essentially a scorched earth policy. The Guatemalan military raided areas suspected of revolutionary actions. The military burned the peasant villages and all their resourceful crops. This led to famine and harsh economic conditions in the widely Mayan peasant class. The Guatemalan government was run by a series of puppet dictators during the conflict. Funded by the U.S, The regime attempted maintain order by repressing the Mayans in rural areas. The government-funded repression and massacre of Ethnic Mayans in Guatemala during the Civil War along with Leftist-Guerilla group interaction with indigenous peasants led to waves of Mayans emigrating to avoid military persecution. Political instability, Lack of opportunity, and Natural disasters are also factors which influenced reasons of migration.  Post-war migration  The socioeconomic conditions of war eventually triggered a mass migration of Mayans into America in 1970. This migration lasted until the end of the Guatemalan Civil War. The Three waves on Mayan refugees consisted of The initial refugee wave, the Family Reunification wave and the Economic Adventurer wave. Many Mayan families were split up because the Males of the Household would move to America and send money back home to Guatemala. The number of Mayan migrants rapidly increased until the 21st century. However, during the war, Mayan migration spiked because the conditions became too much for the families of already emigrated immigrants. As the War continued, Immigration Laws in the U.S began to interfere with asylum seekers. The Reagan administration proved to be very particular on who was granted asylum in the United States. Other problems stemmed from leaving the family unit and the documentation process for immigrants. The Guatemalan Civil War was at its peak during his presidency and due to his anti-communist doctrine, the administration rarely considered Guatemalan Refugees for asylum because the doctrine says they weren't to grant asylum to economic refugees from Communist countries. Although the war was the reason for migration during the 1970s, it was difficult for Mayans to be granted asylum. The Post-War period migrants are mostly Labor Migrants. Today, more Mayans are arriving to America from Post-War Guatemala to for better economic conditions. Mayans migrated to other Central American countries like Mexico but a large amount migrated to the United States. Today, Mayans have settled in places like San Francisco, Miami, and The Great Plains.  The Maya in North America  Mayan-Americans are mostly found along the Sunbelt. They inhabit many urban cities like Los Angeles and Houston but they also occupy rural areas due to their agricultural roots. Many Mayan Migrants moved to poor neighborhoods in big cities which led to even more violence, resource shortages, and racial oppression. Most of the Mayan immigrants are labor migrants therefore, they occupy a number of manual- labor positions. Also, migrant Mayans deal with problems in communication and contacting relatives. The postal service in Guatemala is unreliable so many of Mayan Americans must use special courier services to contact relatives. The United States Postal service only forwards mail to the Guatemala postal service. Therefore, Many Mayan-Americans do not use it. Settlements in places like Nebraska are home to large meatpacking factories that hire Migrant Mayans but still pay them low-wages. Although some Mayans were placed in crowded urban areas, they still own businesses such as restaurants, culture classes, and other sources of revenue. The communal aspect of Mayan society is very strong as more majority Mayan populations start to occupy more U.S land and form their own means of sustenance for those economies. Other ethnic Mayans formed settlements in agricultural societies like Indiantown, Florida. Indiantown is located in Martin County Florida and has a growing Latin American population. Most of this population consists of displaced indigenous people with roots in Central America. Certain areas have larger Mayan populations than others. Still, there are harsh economic conditions and less mobility due to language barriers and forced assimilation. The agricultural and communal background of Mayans confides a large percentage of them to their communities. The generational gap of Mayan migrants also shows the transition from different perspectives as we see third-generation migrants began to succeed in the factory setting rather than the Rural settings. Although a large percent of Mayan Americans still do farm, a large number of them are in more industrial settings. Factory life has been a staple in Mayan Society in the United States. Mayan presence in the workforce is prevalent in many areas. Industrial Work, Farm Labor, and leadership roles are all things that Mayans help contribute to the U.S economy.  Culture  The conditions that influenced the waves of Guatemalan migration caused for the forced migration of the Mayan people. Some Mayans would consider themselves as displaced refugees who have a hard time of assimilating into the American culture. The process of forced assimilation leads to Mayans forming more exclusive migrant communities on U.S Soil. The cultural transition is far too complicated to make for some migrants. Another problem facing Mayan Americans is distinction and categorization. Mayan dialect is different from regular Spanish and this leads to more problems in schools, work, and recreational life for Mayan Americans. The Mayans speak a large range of dialects and languages. Some speak Spanish and others speak Mam, Yucatec, Kekchi, or another language. Processing of their immigration papers is more difficult due to the specificity of their cultural distinction. Due to being a racial minority, The masses in the United States group Mayans with other Latin Americans rather than with their own ethnic groups. Identity issues for Mayan Americans have always been a barrier for Ethnic Mayans. Relatively, Guatemalans immigrants are not dominant in fleeing refugees and labored migrants so their identity in America is unknown to other racial groups and ethnicities. The village and family structures are still prevalent among Mayans in the United States. This sometimes proves to be problematic in Mayan communities and especially in the workplace. These hierarchal systems put in place are oftentimes challenged by the workplace due to the fact that the tasks are distributed by private ownership rather than communal ownership. Their indigenous roots prove to be strong because most Mayan Americans live in Mayan Communities. Outside of their communities, we see a big sphere of influence in places where Mayans sought refuge. In Los Angeles, The Mayan Theater was once seen as a revival of Mayan architecture and art. In the 1990s, The theater was deemed a historical monument. Mayan culture is still being used for financial gain in many other areas. The Maya Lagoon is a lucrative night club located in Houston.

According to the stories, first collected by folklorist L.F. Newman, the lights, believed to be evil spirits trying to draw victims to their death in the reed beds, were drawn to the sound of whistling and could be evaded by lying face down on the ground with your mouth in the mud. The phenomenon, which seems to be a variation of will-o'-the-wisp folklore, is now dismissed as the result of combustible marsh gas. Encounters A local fisherman recounted to parapsychologist Peter Underwood how he had once thrown himself to the floor to escape the attention of a lantern man which had been drawn to his whistling. Another local man recounted to folklorist L.F. Newman how he had attracted the attention of a lantern man while whistling to his dog while walking on the fen. The man had taken shelter at the home of a friend, who hung out a horn on a long pole to distract the spirit. The following morning the horn was found to have been burnt up.

Wijk's spelling system is moderate compared to other 20th century reforms. Instead of replacing current English spelling with, for example, a fully phonetic notation, Wijk's aim was to replace \\"inconsistencies with more regular equivalents.\\" Furthermore, certain inconsistencies such as the use of for two separate consonant sounds (as in gent and goat) are preserved, as are , and for /k/ and and ~~for /s/. The digraph is abandoned, but is preserved where used silently: thus high but not rough. Consequently, Regularized Inglish agrees with 90-95% of words spelled using the current English spelling system. Wijk proposed that there should be a separate American and English standard orthography, each based on \\"the dialect of its cultivated circles\\". However, he felt that this variation should not be extended to English regional varieties.  Example text  The following is a version of the story of Dick Whittington written by Wijk and slightly simplified and Americanized by John Cowan: ::Wunce upon a time thare livd a poor boy named Dick Whittington, hooze faather and muther were bothe ded.

In 1976 as a rookie in the NFL he led the league in several kick return categories. He played college football at Alabama. College career Shelby played college football for the Alabama Crimson Tide in 1973, 1974 and 1975. He served primarily as a kick returner in 1973, but became the starting halfback as a junior in 1974. He ran 84 times in 19974 for 541 yards, a 6.4 average. One of his best games came on October 5 against the University of Mississippi, when he scored 2 touchdowns, including on a 58-yard run. The game was particularly sweet to Shelby, as he had been called a \\"traitor\\" for attending Alabama instead of his home state school of Mississippi and had received a racist letter before the game. As a senior in 1975 he dropped to 315 yards as fullback Johnny Davis became Alabama's primary ball carrier. Shelby was disappointed with his senior season. He had also set a goal when he entered college \\"to be remembered as the best ever\\" but realized that hadn't happened, although he felt he would be able to become a good professional running back. Professional career Shelby was drafted by the Bengals with the 138th pick of the 5th round of the 1976 NFL draft. He got little work as a running back in 1976, rushing just 5 times all season for 9 yards. But he served as the Bengals' primary kick returner. He returned 30 kickoffs for 761 yards, for a 25.4 yard per return average. He also scored a touchdown on a 97-yard kickoff return against the Cleveland Browns on October 3. His 761 kickoff return yards led the NFL that season, and his 97-yard return was the longest in the NFL that season. His one touchdown tied with Cullen Bryant of the Los Angeles Rams for the NFL lead. His 30 kickoff returns tied for 2nd in the NFL, one behind league leader Lou Piccone, and his 25.4 yards per return average tied for 9th. Shelby also returned 21 punts for 162 yards, a 7.7 yard per return average. Shelby was less successful as a kick returner in 1977 and the Bengals waived him before the 1978 season. He was signed by the Atlanta Falcons, but the Falcons returned him to the Bengals when a physical exam showed that he had suffered a broken collar bone in the Bengals' final preseason game against the Green Bay Packers. The Bengals waived him again a few days later and he was claimed by the St. Louis Cardinals. He played 3 of 7 games for the Cardinals as a running back and kick returner in 1978 before being waived in October in order to make room on the roster to sign running back Lawrence Barnes. He ended his pro career with 7 rushing attempts for 14 yards, 2 receptions for 14 yards, 58 kickoff returns for 1375 yards (a 23.7 yard average) and 42 punt returns for 302 yards (a 7.2 yard average).

He has achieved notoriety in a battle over the European \\"Right To Be Forgotten\\" (RTBF), in particular whether current articles written about the RTBF are also subject to that regulation. TLD Network complaint and settlement TLD Networks was an alternative domain name network set up by Thomas Goolnik in 2001. On February 28, 2002 the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, in Chicago, issued an injunction that suspended the registration of certain web sites that were registered with TLD Networks. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had filed the complaint, alleging that TLD Network Ltd, TLD Networks, Quantum Management Ltd, TBS Industries Ltd and Thomas Goolnik advertised and sold alternative DNS root domains, i.e. having top-level domains not approved by ICANN. The story of the original indictment was reported by The New York Times in an article on March 12, 2002. Regulators alleged that the defendants raised $1 million in registration fees during their nine months of operation. A settlement was reached with the FTC in 2002 which, among other things, barred TLD Networks and Thomas Goolnik \\"from making misrepresentations about the usability of domain names or about the nature of any product or service they sell over the Internet.\\" In November 2003 the FTC took additional action, filing an amended complaint adding Barclays Bank PLC as a post-judgment relief defendant in the case. RTBF requests and responses In September 2014, Goolnik was successful in getting articles removed under the right to be forgotten. The UK Government Information Commission Office also ruled in Goolnik's favour. The New York Times was notified by Google that five articles had been removed from its search results to comply with a European \\"Right to be Forgotten\\" request. The paper published an article describing the five items removed Three were on matters of small public importance (two wedding notices and a paid death notice); one was a favorable review of a theater production. The remaining article, and the one receiving most of the attention, was the 2002 story on the injunction against TLD Network, et al. On October 6, 2014, the web site Techdirt wrote a brief commentary on the 2014 Times article. Techdirt and the article's author, Mike Masnick, are frequent critics of the Right to be Forgotten. On August 25, 2015, Techdirt reported that its article commenting on the 2014 New York Times article had similarly been removed from European searches due to a Right to be Forgotten request. While there is no proof, Masnick surmises that there is a \\"decent likelihood\\" that the request came from Goolnik. On September 4, 2015 when the August 25 article was also removed from Google search in Europe. The article points out that the EU states that an RTBF request should be evaluated to see if the information is \\"inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive in relation to the purposes for which they were processed and in the light of the time that has elapsed,\\" while Techdirt argues that their article, \\"discusses newsworthy and relevant information about Thomas Goolnik today, which is that he's filing a series of right to be forgotten requests to Google.\\" The New York Times September 2014 story has become a commonly used example of the effects of RTBF, for example an October 2015 story by Daphne Keller. Keller's article linked to the Times article, but did not mention Goolnik by name, elliptically referring to him as \\"a European businessman ....\\" On March 27, 2019 Techdirt published another article by Mike Masnick indicating another RTBF request had resulted in the previous articles on the site about Thomas Goolnik again being delisted.

Ireland has competed in the Six Nations (formerly known as the Five Nations, and originally known as the Home Nations) rugby tournament since 1883. The Ireland national rugby union team has also competed at the Rugby World Cup every four years since its inception in 1987. Early years First Ireland rugby team: played England on 19 February 1875 and lost by 2 goals and a try to nil Dublin University was the first organised rugby football club in Ireland, having been founded in 1854. The club was organised by students who had learnt the game while at English public schools. During the third quarter of the nineteenth century, and following the adoption of a set of official rules in 1868, rugby football began to spread quickly throughout Ireland, resulting in the formation of several other clubs which are still in existence, including NIFC (1868); Wanderers (1869); Queen's University (1869); Lansdowne (1873); Dungannon (1873); Co. Carlow (1873); UCC (1874); and Ballinasloe (1875) which amalgamated with Athlone to form Buccaneers. In 1874, the Irish Football Union (reconstituted as the Irish Rugby Football Union after unification with the North of Ireland Union) was formed by Dublin University Football Club, Wanderers, Engineers, Lansdowne Football Club, Bray, Portora, Dungannon RFC and Monaghan. Ireland lost their first test match against England 7–0 at the Oval on 15 February 1875. Both teams fielded 20 players in this match, as was customary in the early years of rugby union; it was not until 1877 that the number of players was reduced from 20 to 15. Ireland's first home game was also against England in the same year held at the Leinster Cricket Club in Rathmines as Lansdowne Road was deemed unsuitable. The first match at Lansdowne Road was held on 11 March 1878, with England beating Ireland by 2 goals and 1 try to nil. The 1898 Ireland team before playing England It was not until 1881 that Ireland first won a test, beating Scotland at Ormeau in Belfast. Ireland turned up two men short for their game in Cardiff in 1884 and had to borrow two Welsh players. The first victory Ireland had at Lansdowne Road took place on 5 February 1887. It was also their first win over England, by two goals to nil. On the third of March 1888, Ireland recorded their first win over Wales with a goal, a try and a drop goal to nil. In 1894, Ireland followed the Welsh model of using seven backs instead of six for the first time. After victory over England at Blackheath, Ireland won back-to-back matches for the first time when recording their first win over Scotland on 24 February 1894. Ireland went on to beat Wales in Belfast and win the Triple Crown for the first time. In the 1890s, Rugby was primarily a game for the Protestant middle class, the only Catholic in Edmund Forrest's 1894 team was Thomas Crean. Of the eighteen players used in the three games, thirteen were from three Dublin clubs – Wanderers, Dublin University and Bective Rangers – and the remaining five were from Ulster. They went on to win the Home international championship twice more before the old century was out (1896 and 1899), so that by 1901 all four of the Home Unions had tasted success at a game that was growing in popularity with players and spectators. Early 20th century: 1901–45 1920 illustration of the Ireland versus Wales match Such was the level of interest in the visit of the first All Blacks team to Dublin in November 1905 that the IRFU made the match the first all-ticket rugby international in history. Ireland played only seven forwards, copying the then New Zealand method of playing a \\"rover\\". The game ended New Zealand 15 Ireland 0. On 20 March 1909, Ireland played France for the first time, beating them 19–8. This was Ireland's biggest victory in international rugby at that time, their highest points tally and a record five tries. 30 November 1912 was the first time the Springboks met Ireland at Lansdowne Road, the 1906 tour game having been played at Ravenhill. Ireland with seven new caps were overwhelmed by a record margin of 38–0, still a record loss to South Africa who scored 10 tries. In 1926, Ireland went into their final Five Nations match unbeaten and with the Grand Slam at stake lost to Wales in Swansea. Ireland again came close to a grand slam in 1927 when their sole loss was an 8–6 defeat by England. Post-war: 1945–59 W.J. Hewitt (Ireland) and Miguel A. Sarandón (Argentina) during the tour to South America of 1952 In 1948, inspired by tactician and fly-half Jack Kyle, Ireland beat France in Paris, England at Twickenham and a 6–0 win over Scotland at Lansdowne Road. They clinched their first Grand Slam in the Five Nations with a win against Wales at Ravenhill, Belfast. Ireland were champions and Triple Crown winners again in 1949. The Irish used only 19 players in clinching the 1949 Championship and Triple Crown, only the fourth time that the Triple Crown had been retained. In 1951, Ireland were once more crowned outright Five Nations champions and were unbeaten going into their final game. They failed to win the Grand Slam or Triple Crown following a 3–3 draw with Wales in Cardiff. The year of 1952 saw only Ireland's second overseas tour, the first for over half a century – as they headed to Argentina for a nine-match trip which included two Test matches. Ireland won six, drew two and lost one of the matches, their Test record being won one, drawn one. On 27 February 1954, Ireland were due to play Scotland at Ravenhill in Belfast. The new Irish captain, Jim McCarthy, told IRFU president Sarsfield Hogan that the eleven Republic-based players would not stand for \\"God Save the Queen\\" alongside the Scottish team. It was agreed that an abbreviated anthem, known in Ulster as \\"the Salute\\", would be played that afternoon and that the Irish team would never play again at Ravenhill. Ireland went on to beat Scotland 6–0 but did not play in Northern Ireland again until 2007. On 18 January 1958, Ireland beat Australia 9–6 in Dublin, this was the first time a major touring team had been defeated. Later 20th century: 1960–94 Ireland managed just three victories in the Five Nations Championship; against England in 1961, Wales in 1963 and England again in 1964. There were also draws against England and Wales at Lansdowne Road to the end of 1964. 1965 saw an improvement as Ireland drew with France before beating England and Scotland, only for their Triple Crown hopes disappear against Wales in Cardiff. On 10 April 1965 Ireland recorded their first ever win over South Africa. The match, held at Lansdowne Road, was heading for a draw with the score at six points each, when Tom Kiernan won the match for Ireland with a late penalty. Ireland beat Australia again in Dublin in 1967 and became the first of the home nations to win in the Southern Hemisphere when they beat Australia in Sydney in May 1967. On 26 October 1968, Ireland made it four successive wins over the Wallabies with a 16–3 win at Lansdowne Road. In 1969, Ireland claimed a 17–9 victory over France at Lansdowne Road in the Five Nations, a first victory over Les Bleus in 11 years. They were again unbeaten going into their final game in Cardiff but Wales denied them a Grand Slam for the third time. In the autumn of 1969, the Irish Rugby Football Union decided to appoint a coach for the national team for the first time, the role went to Ronnie Dawson. The 1972 Five Nations Championship was not completed when Scotland and then Wales refused to play in Ireland following threatening letters to players, purportedly from the IRA. The championship remained unresolved with Wales and Ireland unbeaten. In 1973, despite similar threats, England fulfilled their fixture and were given a standing ovation that lasted for five minutes. Ireland won 18–9 and at the after-match dinner the England captain, John Pullin famously remarked \\"We might not be very good but at least we turn up\\". Ireland came close to a first win over the All Blacks on 20 January 1973 but with the score at 10–10 an Irish conversion attempt was pushed wide by a gust of wind. In the final match of the 1974 season, Ireland won their first Five Nations Championship since 1951. Roly Meates was national coach from 1975 to 1977 and Noel Murphy from 1977 to 1980. Willie John McBride was coach until 1984. In 1982 Ireland came close to winning a Grand Slam but were beaten by France in Paris. They beat Scotland, Wales and England to win the championship and their first Triple Crown in 33 years. Three years after their last Triple Crown win, Ireland, coached by Mick Doyle, came out in 1985 and won the Championship and the Triple Crown again. They beat Scotland and Wales. The French again prevented Ireland from claiming a Grand Slam after a 15–15 draw in Dublin. Ireland played England at Lansdowne Road and won the championship with a last minute drop goal from Michael Kiernan. The match ended 13–10 to Ireland. It was Ireland's last silverware until 2004. Ireland were whitewashed in the 1986 Five Nations Championship but on 1 November 1986, Ireland made history when they scored 10 tries against Romania in a 60–0 win. It was the biggest win in international rugby at the time, equalling the French record set in 1967. At the inaugural World Cup in 1987, two straightforward victories over Tonga and Canada were enough to see Ireland through to the quarter-finals, when they travelled to Sydney to face the joint hosts Australia, only to be beaten 33–15. In the Five Nations, England and France were dominant throughout the decade, resulting in the others scrapping around for the odd Championship title. Ireland didn't manage to win the trophy once in the whole decade and worse never finished outside the bottom two. In 1991, they lost their test series against Namibia. The second Rugby World Cup took place in Britain, Ireland and France in 1991. Ireland found themselves in the same pool as Scotland. After two easy wins over Japan and Zimbabwe, Scotland sneaked a 24–15 win at Murrayfield. Ireland played the Wallabies at Lansdowne Road in the quarter final and appeared to be on the verge of a shock victory over Australia, when Michael Lynagh scored the winning try to clinch a 19–18 win for Australia. At the 1994 Five Nations Championship, Ireland beat Will Carling's all-conquering England at Twickenham. Professional era begins: 1995–2005 Ireland playing at Croke Park. At the 1995 World Cup in South Africa, Ireland were in a group containing the All Blacks and Wales. In a close game in Johannesburg, Ireland went through 24–23 against Wales to make their third consecutive quarter-final appearance. Unfortunately, France proved too strong, with Ireland going down 36–12. The start of the professional era was disappointing for Ireland who finished bottom in the Five Nations Championship three years in succession (1996, 1997 and 1998) and lost to Italy thrice, at home(29-37) and abroad (22-12 and 37-22) . Englishman Brian Ashton was head coach between 1997 and 1998, but after a series of disappointing results resigned barely 12 months into the six-year contract he had been awarded by the IRFU. Warren Gatland took over as coach in 1998, but was unable to produce immediate success and 1999 was the first time Ireland failed to reach the last eight at a Rugby World Cup. The 1999 World Cup was staged in Wales though Ireland played all their pool games in Dublin. A defeat by the Wallabies in pool play meant Ireland having to go down the play-off route. Playing away from Lansdowne Road for the first time in the competition, Ireland were beaten 28–24 by Argentina in Lens. From this nadir, however, Irish rugby improved rapidly. With the advent of professionalism, the Irish Rugby Football Union decided to convert the four representative provincial sides into de facto club sides, with the financial capacity to retain top talent in Ireland, yet retaining strong links with amateur clubs and schools to enable young talent to be brought up through the ranks. The close geographical proximity of most of the Irish international squad helped cement relationships between the players. The later formation in 2001 of the Celtic League (now called the Pro14) cemented this strategy by ensuring that provincial sides had a regular schedule of competitive rugby. The advent of the new Six Nations format coincided with this Irish resurgence, and they became the strongest of the Celtic nations. In 2001 the rugby union season was disrupted due to the foot and mouth crisis in Britain. Ireland were good enough to beat France but were unable to play Scotland until the Autumn and were caught cold losing 32–10. They were still good enough to beat England, spoiling their hopes of a Grand Slam, and finishing second on points difference. Eddie O'Sullivan took over as coach from Warren Gatland in November 2001 following the New Zealander's sacking. The 2003 Six Nations Championship came down to the wire with Ireland and England playing a Grand Slam decider at Lansdowne Road. England, however, won 42–6. That defeat ended an unbeaten run that stretched back 10 Tests to their Rugby World Cup qualifiers warm up against Romania in September 2002 and included defeats of Pool A rivals Australia and Argentina at Lansdowne Road. In 2004 they lost their opening game against France but became the first team to beat England following their World Cup win. They finished second in the table behind France and won the Triple Crown. In 2005 Ireland were considered slight favourites entering the Six Nations Championships, and won their first three matches, including a 19–13 defeat of England in Dublin. However, Ireland's dreams of their first Grand Slam since 1948 were ended with a 26–19 home loss to France. In the final round, Wales defeated Ireland 32–20 at Millennium Stadium in Cardiff to win the Grand Slam. Ireland finished in 3rd place. 2006–2009 In 2006, Ireland showed the capacity to play top class rugby, but only inconsistently – a rout of Wales was balanced by uncertain victories against England, Scotland and Italy and a comprehensive defeat by winners France. Ireland finished second and won the Triple Crown for the second time in three years, incidentally the first ever time a trophy had been awarded for the feat. They then embarked on their annual tour to the southern hemisphere. There they ran New Zealand close twice before a tired Ireland were thumped by the Wallabies in Perth. In the last Autumn Internationals at Lansdowne Road, Ireland beast he South African experimental side 32–15. Next were Australia, with Ireland posting a 21–6 victory to propel Ireland to a best ever height of 3rd in the IRB World Rankings. In the final international match at Lansdowne, Ireland thumped the Pacific Islanders 61–17. Paul O'Connell winning the line- out against Argentina in 2007. In March 2007, the IRFU created the \\"High Performance Select Group\\" of up and coming Irish players who have been earmarked for future Irish teams. This group included Luke Fitzgerald, Tommy Bowe, Rob Kearney, Stephen Ferris, and Jamie Heaslip. The aim of the group is to provide young players with support and infrastructure and to ease their future transition into the Irish team. With the announcement of the rebuilding of Lansdowne Road, a new venue was required to stage Ireland's home internationals. The only stadium in Ireland capable of holding major rugby internationals was Croke Park, home of the Gaelic Athletic Association. To accommodate this, the GAA temporarily relaxed its rule governing the playing of so-called \\"foreign games\\" on its property. Initially, two Six Nations games were played at Croke Park during 2007; the first was a 17–20 loss to France, and the second a 43 to 13 win over England. Ireland began their 2008 Six Nations Campaign with a narrow win over Italy. France then edged Ireland out in Paris, before they went on to beat Scotland in Dublin, Ireland then lost to eventual Grand Slammers Wales and England. In March 2008, Eddie O'Sullivan resigned as Ireland coach after the disappointing Six Nations and World Cup campaigns. Declan Kidney was subsequently appointed as manager but did not take up this role formally until after Ireland's tour of New Zealand and Australia (losing to the All Blacks 21–11 and Australia 18–12). His first official game in charge was against Canada at Thomond Park which Ireland won 55–0. Brian O'Driscoll lifting the 2009 Six Nations Grand slam trophy. Ireland won the 2009 Six Nations Championship and Grand Slam by beating Wales at the Millennium Stadium 15–17 on 21 March 2009, the decisive score coming from a dropped goal by Ronan O'Gara. It was the first time they had won the championship since 1985, and the first time they had won the Grand Slam since 1948. Ireland also became only the second team (after Wales in 2005) to win a Six Nations Grand Slam after playing more away games than at home.

Built in 1906, the building held Pekin's U.S. government offices; the first floor served as the city's main post office, while the second floor held various offices, including a Department of the Treasury office and an Army recruitment office. Supervising Architect James Knox Taylor designed the building in the Renaissance Revival style, in keeping with the tradition of using classical styles for federal buildings. The building's design features a red brick exterior with a limestone base and quoins; fanlights and keystones above the first-floor windows; and a limestone cornice with a parapet wall and a cartouche above the main entrance. The Post Office moved out in 1966 and the building was sold to private owners in 1967. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 9, 1980. Eventually the building was bought by the Tazewell County government. County board meetings were held in the building for a time. Several county offices still operate in the building. The east side of the building's addition settled unevenly, developing a large crack between the addition and original structure in 2016; due to the historic static of the building, the county immediately asked for bids to shore up the east side.

V. Raman Pillai. Allusion to legends, history and politics =Characters based on legends, history and real life= =Events based on legends, history and politics= Treaty with Madura Nayaks According to V. Nagam Aiya, during the reign of king Rama Varma besides the troubles caused by confederate chiefs and nobles such as Ettuveetiil Pillas and Madambies, the other petty chieftains were also refracted from contributing to the revenue of the state; and sovereign was unable to defend the atrocities of armed dacoits, as there were not enough money and manpower with the state. In Kollavarsham 901 king Rama Varma, headed to Tiruchirappalli and made a pact with the Madurai Nayaks to supply additional forces to Travancore for a fixed annual payment. T. K. Velu Pillai cites the references of payment to Madurai from Travancore. In the novel, it is presented that king Rama Varma and Thirumukhathu Pilla proceed to Tiruchirappalli in Kollavarsham 901 to arrange additional forces, which later camps at Boothapandi. Lethal attempts on Marthanda Varma =Attempt at a Temple= In the novel, while Rama Varma and Thirumukhathu Pilla headed to Tiruchirappalli, prince Marthanda Varma and Ananthapadmanabhan were staying at Nagercoil, from where latter among the duo at Nagercoil heads to his mother's house following the news of her illness. While Ananthapadmanabhan was away, the prince was chased away by the men of Padmanabhan Thambi and an attempt on his life was made at Kalliyankattu temple. The incident is further referred as the escape of Marthanda Varma as a Brahmin. Dr. P. Venugopalan cites the references of the incident in the history of Travancore and Marthandamahathmyam Kilippattu. The incident took place at a temple of Shiva near to Kumarakovil (2 miles north to Thakkala), where Marthanda Varma took shelter while evading the attackers. At the temple Marthanda Varma was aided by the temple priest to escape in the outfit of the latter, and the priest was killed by the attackers as he was in the outfit of the former. There are references in the novel about attempts on the life of Marthanda Varma by his enemies as his successful escapes through the groove at Panathara, the Ezhava house at Perunkadavila, and the Nedumangad fort. =Escape at an Ezhava house= According to the legends, after evading the Ettuveettil Pillas and their men at Dhanuvachapuram, Eithukondamkani, and Marayamuttom, when Marthanda Varma was refreshing himself at a river near to Malakulangara he was spotted by the men of Thambi brothers and in urgency to escape from them, he headed into a nearby Ezhava house, Alayil Puthur Veedu at Perumkadavila, where he was aided by the Kalipanikkathi (Lady Kali) to hide under the rattan enclosures. The men of Thambi brothers were unsuccessful in finding the prince. =Aid by a Channan and Hiding inside a tree= In the novel, while running away from Velu Kuruppu and his men, Marthanda Varma is helped by a mad Channan who hides him in a tree and misdirects his pursuers. According to Dr. P. Venugopalan, the above account of actions is a collaboration of two situations where Marthanda Varma escaped from the enemies. Once, when Marthanda Varma was returning after some confidential visits to Kanyakumari and Suchindram, he was tracked by the men of Ettuveettil Pillas and Thambi brothers. While running away from the chasers, he was suggested by a Channan plougher of the nearby field to hide inside the hollow statue of the elephant at the adjacent temple of Shasthavu. When the chasers reached the cultivation field and questioned the plougher, he misdirected them to the southern provinces. In another occasion, when Marthanda Varma was chased by the enemies, he evaded them by hiding inside the big hole within a jack tree at the Neyyattinkara Sree Krishna Swami Temple. The tree is still preserved at the temple compound and known as Ammacciplāvŭ (Mother jack tree). Lethal attempt on Karthika Thirunal Rama Varma The incident is referred as the attempt to murder the little prince, Karthika Thirunal Rama Varma and his mother by Ramanamadathil Pilla along with his men in Kollavarsham 903, while the mother-son duo were heading from Trivandrum to Attingal, but only to evade the attempt with the help of Kilimanoor Koithampuran (Lord of Kilimanoor), who led the duo to a nearby safe village and took their place in the palanquin en route, confronted the attackers and eventually got killed, as described in the History of Travancore from the Earliest Times by P. Shangoony Menon. The above account of incident is in conflict with the version described by Pachumuthathu in the Tiruvitāṁkūṟ Caritraṁ, which recounts the same at Budhanoor in the then district of Chengannur, where ruffians from Kayamkulam did the attack and states that lord of Kilimanoor who defended the attackers was the husband of the Queen. V. Nagam Aiya states the incident inline with the version by P. Shangoony Menon and mentions that lord of Kilimanoor, Kerala Varma Koithampuran as the consort of the Queen. T. K. Velu Pillai supports the version of Pachumuthathu and condemns the version by P. Shangoony Menon; which is cited by Dr. A. P. Ibrahim Kunju, who points out the deliberation of T. K. Velu Pillai in supporting the version of Pachumuthathu by purposefully avoiding the references of incident in the British records, Letters to Tellicherry. Heirship claim by Thambi brothers Dr. A. P. Ibrahim Kunju refers to the legend that Thambi brothers made a claim to the throne of Venad during the final period of king Rama Varma as they were the linear descendants, which was against the tradition of collateral descent through maternal nephew followed by the Venad kingdom in selecting the heir to the throne. P. K. Parameswaran Nair claims that there is a legend in which Rama Varma promises to his spouse, Abhirama to let the children she will bear, to ascend to the throne of Venad; however Dr. P. Venugopalan states that the above account of legend is not valid as Rama Varma was neither the king nor the next heir to the throne during the early days of his relationship with his spouse and he ruled the kingdom only in the last five years of his life. P. Shangoony Menon and V. Nagam Aiya state that Thambi brothers were persuaded by feudatory chiefs and nobles, Ettuveettil Pillas and Madambies to make the claim to the throne. Dewan Nanoo Pillay states that Thambi duo manifested the claim, as they felt degraded from the royal rank after the accession of Marthanda Varma, so Madambies and Ettuveettil Pillas fomented their disaffection. T. K. Velu Pillai states that Thambi brothers attempted to seize the throne for themselves against the custom of Marumakkattāyaṁ (collateral descent through maternal nephews). Even though the above claim and dispute happened after the demise of Rama Varma, in the novel, it is presented that the conspiracy by Thambi brothers were started long before the king was ill and also shows that Padmanabhan Thambi and Sundarayyan lay the plans against Marthanda Varma, to get him deprived from the line of succession. In the novel, it is mentioned that Ettuveettil Pillas gave assurance to Padmanabhan Thambi that they will make him king after the period of king Rama Varma. In the novel, it is also referred that Padmanabhan Thambi did not want to emphasize on Makkattāyaṁ (lineal descent through sons) by raising the concern to Sundarayyan that such a succession may bring his younger brother Raman Thambi against him. Treaty of Thambi brothers with foreign forces The heirship claim of the Thambi brothers against the then existing custom in Venad led them to seek the aid of foreign forces to confront Marthanda Varma. According to P. Shangoony Menon the elder Thambi brother, Papu Thamby went to Tiruchirapalli in Kollavarsham 905 (1730) to seek aid from Pandyan governor. V. Nagam Aiya states that the Thambi brothers went together to Tiruchirapalli in 1729 to seek aid from Pandyan governor. According to Dewan Nanoo Pillai, only one of the Thambi brothers proceeded to Tiruchirapalli in Kollavarsham 905 (1729-1730). T. K. Velu Pillai mentions that the Thambi brothers secured the mercenary services of a foreign contingent in Kollavarsham 905. In the novel, the younger brother, Raman Thambi goes to Nanjinadu to arrange for additional forces in Kollavarsham 903. Council of Ettuveettil Pillas Ettuveettil Pillas formed a council at the convention area of an inn at Venganoor, where they held consultation about the plans against the king Marthanda Varma and, the members resolved to assassinate the king on the Aaraattu festival day during his procession. The decision was scripted as palm leaf notes and hidden in the footwears of messengers. According to P. Shangoony Menon and V. Nagam Aiya, the conference happened sometime after Kollavarsham 906. Dr. A. P. Ibrahim Kunju states that above event as happened in Kollavarsham 912. The messengers with the council notes were later detained by the king's men following the lead by a Paṇṭāraṁ (keeper of the inn), who spied on the council members and eventually the plan was foiled. In the novel, the council of Ettuveettil Pillas is convened at the maternal house of Kudamon Pilla near to Andiyirakkam. The council passes the resolution to assassinate the prince Marthanda Varma after the demise of king Rama Varma, when the prince will be heading back after the last rites of the then deceased King. A council note of the same is prepared for Padmanabhan Thambi and entrusts the same to Sundarayyan, who on the way back puts up a fight with Ananthapadmanabhan disguised as a beggar, who tries to snatch the council note and, eventually the note is lost in the Killiyar. In the novel the above events are shown as happened in Kollavarsham 903 before the accession of Marthanda Varma. Coup attempt by Thambi brothers When the foreign contingent arrived under Azhagappa Mudaliyar as an aid to Thambi brothers from Pandyan governor, the Thambi duo joins them at the Nanjinadu camp to mobilize the forces; meanwhile Marthanda Varma tried to arrange necessary counter forces at Kalkulam, however as there were not enough forces to confront the contingent and men of Thambi duo, Marthanda Varma negotiated with the officers of Azhagappa Mudaliyar, lieutenant Kanimiyavu and captain Kapalipara Sokkalingam Pillai, thus secured a safe passage out of Kalkulam fort with an escort to Neyyattinkara, in order to go to Perakathavazhi at Kollam; en route, on realizing that the little prince Karthika Thirunal Rama Varma and his royal mother at Puthenkotta were about to be attacked by a team led by Kudamon Pilla, Karakulathu Pilla and Vanchikoottathu Pilla, Marthanda Varma rushed there and moved the mother-son duo to Attingal and headed to Kollam. Meanwhile, the team led by Azhagappa Mudaliyar and Thambi brothers started from Kalkulam to Thiruvananthapuram, where they tried to take the possession of treasure at Sree Padmanabha Swamy temple, but only to foil the plans by the local inhabitants, to whom the charge was entrusted by Vanchikoottathu Pilla before he moved from there. The protests by local people made the team of Thambi brothers to retract, so Azhagappa Mudaliyar and forces headed to eastern provinces. Mathilakam Records mentions the above account of events as happened in Kollavarsham 905, one year after the demise of king Rama Varma. In the novel, it is presented that the foreign forces, the forces from Nanjinadu are led by Raman Thambi. The men of Thambi brothers and Ettuveettil Pillas together plan to siege the palace to slay the prince, however prince Marthanda Varma evade the coup as he is timely tipped by Subhadra, who also insists to move the little prince and the mother to a safe place.

She was a prominent woman in the labour movement, and served as the Australian Labor Party's South Australian assistant state secretary for forty years. Hanretty grew up in poverty after her father died, leaving his widow to raise young children. She was educated at the North Adelaide public school, but left school at twelve to provide an additional income for the household. She was a housemaid and helped with children, worked in a store in Rundle Street, and later worked as a presser in a laundry, where she joined the nascent Women Employees' Mutual Association, an early women's union, along with most of her colleagues. She was a keen reader despite her circumstances, and became heavily interested in politics; she subsequently studied typewriting at a business college on the basis that these skills would prove useful in that work. She joined the North Adelaide local committee of the Labor Party in 1905, and was heavily involved in the union, holding every executive position, and serving as its representative to the United Trades and Labour Council of South Australia. Hanretty was a representative of employees on the first Laundries Wages Board from 1909, and in 1911 was appointed as one of three Trades and Labor Council representatives to that year's Royal Commission into the shortage of labour. In June 1913, she founded and served as the first president of the Women's Political Education Association. She was appointed as lady organiser of the Labor Party in April 1914, serving in the role in a period in which time Labor won the 1914 federal election and 1915 state election. She resigned from that role after eighteen months, feeling that there was less need for her services, and briefly returned to pressing laundry. In 1916, she was vice-president of the Anti-Conscription League during the 1916 referendum on introducing conscription during World War I. She was an assistant state secretary of the Australian Labor Party from 1917 until 1956. She was returning officer for the Labor preselection plebiscites for the 1924 state election. She served for nine years on the Mental Defectives Boards from the mid-1920s. She unsuccessfully sought the office of state secretary in 1924, though she would become the first woman to act in the role in 1947. She was the first president of the state Labor Women's Central Organising Committee in 1928, and was vice-president of the Labor Women's Interstate Executive in 1931. She was a staunch advocate for a livable wage for all women workers, and opposed employment discrimination against married women. She also advocated for increased representation within the party, equal rights and privileges for women in public office, and for women's parental rights. She consistently encouraged other women to run for public office, although she never did so herself. Hanretty was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1957. Hanretty Place in the Canberra suburb of Bonython is named for her.

She was photographed by Ansel Adams in both 1943 and 1944 for his book, Born Free and Equal: The Story of Loyal Japanese Americans. In the 2001 reprint of the book, Okazaki's photograph appeared on the book cover. She is the treasurer of the Manzanar Committee, an NGO which promotes education about the World War II incarceration of Japanese-Americans. Biography Joyce Yukiko Nakamura was born on July 29, 1934, in Los Angeles, California to parents of Japanese heritage. Her mother Yaeko Kusayanagi was a US citizen and her father, Genshiro Nakamura came to the US in 1916 when he was eleven years old. She attended school until second grade at Maryknoll School, where she studied both English and Japanese. On April 2, 1942, her family were restrained and taken to the camp at Manzanar, where they were imprisoned with other Japanese- Americans and lived in Manzanar for about two and a half years. During their forced detainment, Nakamura, her mother, and her younger sister were photographed by Ansel Adams. Her father was not in the photographs as he was away on the potato harvest during the 1943 photo shoot and during the second one, her father had already left camp permanently. In July 1944, her family left the camp after swearing a loyalty oath and her mother clearing an additional examination. As Kusayanagi's father had been arrested, not detained, she underwent additional questioning before being released. In Chicago, Nakamura attended both a parochial elementary school and a Catholic high school. She attended one year of classes at University of Illinois at Navy Pier and in 1952, Nakamura returned with her family to Los Angeles, where she attended UCLA and was in the Chi Alpha Delta sorority. After graduating with a BS in business administration, Nakamura worked briefly at Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company and then went to work for the Department of Employment, where she remained for thirteen years. One of her projects while she was there was to rewrite the manual of Dictionary of Occupational Titles. In 1962, Nakamura met another Manzanar detainee, James Okazaki, whom she married in 1963. In the late 1980s Okazaki began working for the Los Alamitos School District, where she served in libraries and media centers for 20 years before retiring. In 2000, Okazaki returned to the camp for the first time with her mother. Witnessing the dilapidated state of decay, she did not return for 4 years. In the interim, the National Park Service had developed the site adding an interpretive center and auditorium. Okazaki decided to join the Manzanar Committee and become more involved. Until her retirement, she attended meetings and events only, but after her retirement, she began speaking and conducting educational courses at various schools in the area, as well as volunteering at the center. Okazaki is the current treasurer for the Manzanar Committee, an NGO which promotes education about the World War II incarceration of Japanese-Americans. Born Free and Equal Adams' book, Born Free and Equal: The Story of Loyal Japanese Americans was published in 1944. In 2001, a second edition was printed with a foreword by Toyo Miyatake.

He is best remembered as the vocalist of Siege, a pioneering Massachusetts-based hardcore punk band whose speed and discord influenced the formation of the grindcore and powerviolence subgenres of punk rock and heavy metal. Mahoney's incongruous lead vocal style also influenced the development of these genres.Mudrain, Albert. Choosing Death: The Improbable History of Death Metal and Grindcore. Feral House, 2004, pp. 47 Mahoney was a member of Siege from 1983 to 1985, their main productive years. He also led the group The Spoils with Siege drummer Rob Williams from 2006 to 2008. Biography =Early years= Mahoney grew up in Braintree, Massachusetts. He had two sisters, Keren and Kathy, the latter his twin. Keren's husband Rick Jones was a member of the Boston-area hardcore punk band Jerry's Kids, an influential early Boston hardcore group. Prior to joining Siege, Mahoney played in a ska band. =Siege= In 1983, Mahoney joined guitarist Kurt Habelt, drummer Rob Williams, and bassist Hank McNamee, all from nearby Weymouth, to form Siege. Siege played an extreme style of hardcore punk, combining exceptionally fast tempos with Mahoney's screeching and howling vocals. In addition to serving as the band's lead vocalist, Mahoney occasionally played saxophone with the group, creating an additional layer of noisy texture in the band's chaotic sound. Siege recorded a demo cassette and three tracks released on the Cleanse the Bacteria compilation, and performed throughout New England over the next few years. They disbanded in 1985 when Mahoney failed to attend their first gig in New York City, which was subsequently canceled.Mudrain 51 Although the band wrote only 20 minutes of music and never played outside of New England, they achieved significant posthumous fame. The group is now cited as a catalyst of the grindcore and powerviolence genres, and has influenced such noteworthy bands as Napalm Death, Carcass, and Dropdead. After years of being bootlegged, their recorded output was officially released by Relapse Records as the Drop Dead album in 1994. =Later activity, The Spoils= Mahoney did not participate in the brief Siege reunion in 1991. He began working in information technology in the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston in 1992, and remained there for over a decade. He later worked in a similar capacity at the Boston Children's Hospital. He also was active in theater in Cambridge. He and Williams later formed the punk band The Spoils along with Cotie Cowgill of Williams's post-Siege band Nightstick and several other musicians. The group's sole release was the album ...To the Victor on Deep Six Records in 2008. They disbanded shortly after the album was issued. =Death= Mahoney died suddenly on October 14, 2011, due to complications of diabetes mellitus. He was living in Stoughton, Massachusetts at the time. Numerous prominent heavy metal and punk rock musicians mourned his death in the media, including members of Napalm Death, Agoraphobic Nosebleed, Eyehategod, and Soilent Green.

She was briefly a co-owner of Berenberg Bank, and was also noted for her work for the homeless in Norway. During her life she was a citizen of the city-republic of Hamburg, of France during the Napoleonic Wars, and finally of Norway from 1824. Childhood in Hamburg Henriette Seyler, drawn by her sister Molly in 1822, aged 17 Born Henriette Seyler in the city-republic of Hamburg, she was the youngest daughter of the banker L.E. Seyler and Anna Henriette Gossler, and a granddaughter of the Swiss-born theatre director Abel Seyler and of the Hamburg bankers Johann Hinrich Gossler and Elisabeth Berenberg, whose Belgian- origined family had founded Berenberg Bank in 1590. Her father L.E. Seyler was a co-owner of Berenberg Bank for 48 years as well as President of the Commerz- Deputation and a member of the Hamburg Parliament, and her family was one of Hamburg's most prominent Hanseatic families. On her father's side, she was a descendant of the Swiss Calvinist theologian Friedrich Seyler and of the Basel patrician families Burckhardt, Socin, Merian, Faesch and Meyer zum Pfeil; on her mother's side she was also descended from families like Amsinck and Welser.Percy Ernst Schramm, Neun Generationen: Dreihundert Jahre deutscher Kulturgeschichte im Lichte der Schicksale einer Hamburger Bürgerfamilie (1648–1948), vol.

During the French occupation, her father was held as a hostage along with a handful of the city's other prominent merchants for some time, and Berenberg Bank later moved its headquarters to their private home.

He later also acquired several other enterprises and estates in Norway. They lived at Fossum Manor until 1836, when they acquired Frogner Manor in what is now the borough of Frogner in west end Oslo; the estate also included Frognerseteren and parts of Nordmarka. The 1820s neoclassical pavilion found in Frogner Park was a wedding gift given to her, which was moved from the family's former home Fossum Manor in the late 1830s.Lars Roede: \\"Industriherren Benjamin Wegner på Frogner,\\" in Lars Roede, Frogner hovedgård: Bondegård, herskapsgård, byens gård (pp. 148–161), Pax forlag, 2012Henriette Wegner, ca. 1860 As the wife of one of Norway's leading industrialists and mistress of Frogner Manor, she was one of the leading women of Norwegian high society, particularly from the 1830s, when the family moved from rural Modum to Frogner Manor outside the capital.

He was the last Arab to hold the governorship of Egypt under the Abbasid caliphs, his successors thereafter being Turks.  Governorship of al-Sind  The scion of an Arab family originating from al-Basrah, Anbasah was appointed to be resident governor of al-Sind for the Turkish officer Itakh, who had been granted the administration of the province by the caliph. At the time of his appointment, al-Sind was in a state of disorder, and its previous governor 'Imran ibn Musa al-Barmaki had been killed during infighting among the local Arabs. When Anbasah arrived in the province, however, most of the notables willingly submitted to him, and he was eventually able to pacify the region. During his administration of al- Sind, Anbasah tore down the tower of a Buddhist stupa in Daybul and converted the stupa into a prison. He also took the stone from the demolition and began a project to rebuild Daybul, but he was dismissed from the governorship before the work was completed. For the dates for Anbasah's governorship, the historians al-Ya'qubi and al-Baladhuri provide variant information. Al-Ya'qubi claims that he was appointed by Itakh during the caliphate of al-Wathiq (r. 842–847) and remained governor for nine years, before departing from his post and returning to Iraq following Itkah's downfall in 849. Al-Baladhuri, on the other hand, states that he was governor during the reign of al-Mu'tasim (r. 833–842).  Governorship of Egypt  In 852 Anbasah was appointed as resident governor of Egypt, placing him in charge of security and the prayers and additionally giving him joint control over the taxes (kharaj), together with the local finance officer. The appointment was given to him by the Abbasid prince al-Muntasir, who had been assigned the province as part of al- Mutawakkil's (r. 847–861) succession arrangements.; ; While the governor of Egypt, Anbasah worked to reduce the abuses of the tax collectors and built a new musalla in Fustat, and the Egyptian historian al-Kindi regarded him as a just and devout administrator. He also was responsible for carrying out al- Mutawakkil's anti-dhimmi decrees, and additionally banned the public display of Christian symbols and the possession of wine. In 853, the Byzantines launched a surprise attack against Damietta, destroying it and taking a large number of captives. The city had been undefended at the time, as Anbasah had summoned the local troops to Fustat to celebrate the Day of Arafah. In the aftermath of the raid, Anbasah received an order from al-Mutawakkil to build fortifications around Damietta to protect it from future attack, and construction was begun in the following year.; ; To the south, the Beja ceased paying the tribute that they customarily rendered to the Egyptian authorities and in 855 they began raiding the fringes of Muslim territory, causing several casualties. These activities prompted al-Mutawakkil to organize a punitive expedition, and Anbasah was instructed to provide all of his available troops for the campaign. Despite the difficult nature of the terrain, the Muslim army compelled the Beja to sue for peace, and their chieftain agreed to travel to Samarra and make a personal submission to the caliph. In 855, Anbasah's administration over taxes was revoked, leaving him in charge of security and prayers alone. In the following year, he was dismissed from the governorship and replaced with Yazid ibn 'Abdallah al- Hulwani, a Turkish officer, and he returned to Iraq around the end of 858. Al- Kindi notes that Anbasah was the last Arab to serve as governor, as well as the last to lead the people in the Friday prayers; henceforth the governorship was given to Turks, eventually leading to the foundation of the Tulunid dynasty in 868.

The two polypurine domains interact by intramolecular reverse- Hoogsteen bonds allowing the formation of this specific hairpin structure. PPRH structure showing the two homopurine domains bound by Reverse Hoogsteen bonds  Properties  Template-PPRHs bind to the template strand of the dsDNA. Coding-PPRHs bind to the coding strand of the dsDNA PPRHs can bind to polypyrimidine stretches in either single- or double stranded DNA by Watson and Crick bonds establishing triple-stranded DNA structures. The formation of PPRHs triplexes takes place at physiological pH. PPRHs provoke a strand displacement. of the homopurine sequence of the target dsDNA, opening the two strands of the DNA. There are two types of PPRHs: i) Template-PPRHs that bind to the template strand of DNA, inhibiting transcription; and ii) Coding-PPRHs that bind to the coding strand of the DNA altering splicing. Both types of PPRHs decrease gene expression. PPRHs present high stability in serum and cells and show lack of immunogenicity not activating the innate inflammatory response. PPRHs do not have off-target effects and do not show hepatotoxicity or nephrotoxicity.  Applications  PPRHs could be used as gene silencing tools acting by different mechanisms than triplex forming oligonucleotides (TFOs), antisense oligonucleotides or siRNAs. Upon binding to their targets, PPRHs can decrease the mRNA and protein levels of the selected genes. Their action has been demonstrated in vitro for a number of genes involved in metabolism (DHFR), proliferation (mTOR), DNA topology (TOP1), lifespan and senescence (telomerase), apoptosis (survivin, BCL2), transcription factors (MYC), proto-oncogenes (MDM2), replication stress (WEE1, CHK1) and Thymidilate synthase (TYMS) as part of a cancer gene therapy strategy. Their preclinical proof of principle has been proven in vivo using the antiapoptotic survivin gene. PPRHs have also been applied as tools in cancer immunotherapy by silencing CD47 in MCF7 breast cancer cells and SIRPα in macrophages, and the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in human tumor cells.  Design and improvements  206x206px PPRHs can be designed for virtually any gene in the genome by searching for polypirimidine stretches in the sequence of the desired gene. Optimal lengths for each domain of the PPRHs are within 20–30 nucleotides. The total length of a typical PPRH is 55 nucleotides considering two domains of 25 bases plus 5T for the linking loop. If purine interruptions are encountered (up to three) within the polypirimidine target, the highest affinity of PPRH binding is achieved by placing in the hairpin the complementary base (a pyrimidine) in front of the purines (Wild type-PPRH).  Wedge-PPRH  A further development consists in extending the 5' flank of the PPRH with a sequence complementary to the displaced polypurine strand of the target dsDNA which stabilizes the strand displacement, producing additional binding and functionality.centre  WEB tools for mapping and analysis of triplex formation target DNA sequences in the human genome  A triplex target DNA site (TTS), a stretch of DNA that is composed of polypurines, is able to form a triple-helix (triplex) structure in genomic DNA. Integrative WEB tools for identification and analysis of the triplex formation target DNA sequences, including PPRH sequences, associated with genes and regulatory elements (e.g., transcription factor binding sites, repeats, G-quadruplet motifs, SNPs, and non-protein coding regulatory DNA elements) in the human genome are publicly available (see External links). These tools could be used to search biologically meaningful genome polypurine stretches, help to understand biological roles of the natural paired polypurine domains like PPRH and to optimize experimental design of anti-gene treatment.

His last name has several spelling variations and his first name is sometimes given as Pierre-Joseph. Biography He was the son of a goldsmith. His mother died five days after his baptism. When he came of age, he was apprenticed to an engineer in Sercus, but soon realized that he was not learning the skills that matched his aspirations. Aged barely sixteen, he managed to find a position in the studios of François Boucher.Jules Hédou, P. C. Le Mettay, peintre du roi, 1726-1759, Henry Boissel, 1881 Complete text @ Google Books Within five years, he was ready to compete with other artists at the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture and was awarded the Prix de Rome for painting in 1747. When he arrived at the French Academy in Rome, he spent much of his time doing religious painting rather than following the school's curriculum. In 1751, nevertheless, the new Director, Charles-Joseph Natoire, chose him as one of four students who would do paintings for the General Directorate of Naples, despite opposition from the Marquis de Marigny who felt that Mettay had no talent and had ignored his studies too much. He went to Naples in 1753, followed by a trip through the main Adriatic ports. He remained in Turin long enough to be presented at court and receive several commissions. In 1756, he returned to Paris. Venus Bathing With some assistance from Boucher, he created paintings from sketches of Greece, made by the architect Julien-David Le Roy on his recent visit there, then did the same for a set of engravings by Jacques-Philippe Le Bas, which were issued in two folios. On the basis of this work, he presented himself for membership in the royal academy and was accepted as a candidate in 1757. Shortly after, he began to exhibit at the Salon and received great praise from the Mercure de France. He became a full member of the academy in 1759, but died only twenty-six days later. His health had always been fragile and he may have succumbed to overwork. Many of his works were widely distributed after being made into engravings by , and Adrian Zingg. Most of the drawings he made in Italy were sold to the Ribards; a well known merchant family in Rouen. Some eventually found their way into the possession of Jean-Baptiste Descamps, the founder of the \\"École de dessin de Rouen\\".

The word \\"revenant\\" means someone who has risen from the grave to terrorize the living. The novel was later adapted as a screenplay for a 2015 feature film directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu. The novel was republished in January 2015 in anticipation of the upcoming film release. Development Many of the outdoor adventures depicted in the novel are based on Punke's outdoor interests and hobbies, such as fishing and exploring the backcountry, which he enjoyed while growing up in Wyoming. Punke had originally intended to write a political novel. He started archival research and writing in 1997, and it took four years for him to complete the novel, with the long hours taking a toll on his health. Maxim reporter Walter Bonner interviewed Punke's brother who described the novel as an attempt by Punke to \\"write his way out of D.C. and back to the big sky country\\". The novel is dedicated to his high school English teacher, Roger Clark. The novel was republished in January 2015 in anticipation of the upcoming film release, but Punke's role as an ambassador to the World Trade Organization (WTO) prevented him from participating in pre-release publicity. Critical reception Reception of the novel has been largely positive. Publishers Weekly described the novel as \\"Told in simple expository language, this is a spellbinding tale of heroism and obsessive retribution.\\" Similarly, Kirkus Reviews called the novel \\"A good adventure yarn, with plenty of historical atmosphere and local color.\\" When reviewing the novel for its 2015 re-release to coincide with the film, critic Brian Ted Jones described the novel as not fulfilling the expectation of \\"the novel's higher bar\\", describing it as more like Punke's non-fiction, and stylistically not very well executed. Jones also described the novel's subtitle \\"A Novel of Revenge\\", as misrepresentative, claiming the novel's real plot device \\"is actually more prosaic: He wants his stuff back.\\" A review of the same edition by Library Journal, called the novel \\"A must-read for fans of Westerns and frontier fiction and recommended for anyone interested in stories that test the limit of how much the human body and spirit can endure.\\" Film adaptation Development of The Revenant began in August 2001, with producer Akiva Goldsman acquiring the rights to Punke's unpublished manuscript for The Revenant. David Rabe wrote the first script. The production was picked up by Park Chan-wook, who had Samuel L. Jackson in mind to star. Park later left the project. Development stalled until 2010, when Mark L. Smith wrote a new adaptation. Alejandro G. Iñárritu signed on to direct in August 2011. Weed Road Pictures, New Regency Productions, Anonymous Content, and 20th Century Fox supported development and distribution of the film. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy were cast in the lead roles. The film had a limited release in the United States on December 25, 2015, and had its wide release in the United States on January 8, 2016. After the novel was optioned for adaptation, publishers chose to republish it in hardback in January 2015. However, because Punke had become a Deputy United States Trade Representative and US Ambassador to the World Trade Organization, the State Department prohibited him from doing any publicity for his book in preparation for the film release (one representative noted that \\"He can't even sign copies\\").

In 1648Cock, p.174 for the sum of £900 he purchased the manor of South Molton from Sir George Whitmore (d. 1654), Master of the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers 1621-2 and Lord Mayor of London in 1631. This entitled him to various customary income due to the lord of the manor from tolls, fairs, markets and other profits. In 1654, the year after his father's death, he granted a 99-year lease of the manor of South Molton jointly to his mother and to his brother Hugh Squier, at an annual rent of £20 7s.Cock, pp.174/5 The manor formed a large part of Hugh Squier's benefaction to the town. Christopher was one of the founding trustees or governors of Hugh Squier's School, appointed in 1686 by his brother the founder. His son was William Squier (d.1699), later also a governor,Cock, p.184 father of John Squier (1694-1715), in 1710 appointed a governor in place of his deceased great-uncle, whilst still a schoolboy at Eton College. John was the last in the male line of the Squire family and died aged 21 without progeny. He and his sister Elizabeth Squire (d.1734) were the main beneficiaries of the will of Hugh Squier.Morey, p.9 Elizabeth died unmarried, having lived all her life at Townhouse and having been a donor to the Blue Coat School in South Molton and other charities in South Molton.General Index to the First Fourteen Reports of the Commissioners Appointed to Inquire Concerning Charities in England and Wales, House of Commons, 1827 , vol xi, pp.122, 126 *Richard Squier (d.1669), 2nd elder brother, a soldier who died unmarried. *William Squier (d.1681), 3rd elder brother, who married a certain Priscilla by whom he had two daughters.

South front viewed from East Street His children having all died young and having no heirs he thus decided to devote his wealth to philanthropical causes in his native town. In 1686 he built and endowed a school in East Street, South Molton, known as Hugh Squier's Free School. The original Deed of Endowment and Appointment of Trustees is held at North Devon Record Office in Barnstaple. The school's running expenses were mainly funded by income from Northam estates held on a rolling lease from the Dean and Canons of Windsor. In 1867 the South Molton trustees were notified that the leases would terminate in 1881. The trustees saved £2823 during the period of notice. £2315 was invested in Government stock and £508 was held in the bank. The Charity Commission issued an order dated 12/01/1883 \\"that the clear amount of the annual income .. after all proper outgoings and expenses shall be expended … on highways maintenance or suitable public works\\".

Partial demolition The school building survived intact until the 1960s when purchased by George Wallace for use in his Honey Farm, when he demolished one third of the structure to provide an entrance for articulated lorries. In 1978 the Honey Farm was moved to the old Union Workhouse in North Road and the remaining structure of the school was converted into a private dwelling in which form it remains today.

He seemingly died unmarried. The almshouses he built were demolished in about 1840 and occupied a site on the present Caxton Street. The funds of the almshouses were used to acquire new houses in Lambeth, which still exist. His charity was eventually amalgamated with one established for women by his relative Judith Kifford. *Donation to the Mayor of South Molton for repairs of the School and of highways, especially the road between the bridge over the River Mole and the school. Several of the footpaths in the streets and through the churchyard were much improved in the year 1894 by the South Molton municipal charity trustees at an outlay of about £500, out of funds in their hands belonging to Hugh Squier's charity. *Donation to the trustees of his school =1st President of Grey Coat School= He was the first President of the Grey Coat School School, in the parish of St Margaret's Church, Westminster, founded in 1698 by 8 local tradesmen and supported by voluntary subscriptions, whose aim was to educate \\"40 of the Greatest Objects of Charity (orphans and neglected children) in the principles of the Christian religion, teaching to read and instructing them in the Church catechism, the discipline of the Church of England as by law established, and for teaching to write and cast accounts\\" and (when fit) \\"binding them apprentices to honest trades and employments\\". As premises the school was granted rent-free by the Vestry of St Margaret's Church use of the large building of the \\"Grey Coat Hospital\\" in Tothill Fields within the parish. the true owner of the freehold of Tothill Fields was disputed between the Vestry of St Margarets, the Vestry of St John's and the Dean and Chapter of Westminster Abbey. In 1696 the Dean and Chapter asserted their claims to the freehold and a committee, consisting of Mr. Justice Railton, Mr. Hugh Squier, Mr. John Parker, Mr. Charles Rampayne, and others were directed to investigate the claim, and to search the ancient deeds and records relating to the title.Smith, J.E., St John the Evangelist, Westminster: Parochial Memorials, westminster, 1892, p.308 In 1706 the trustees obtained a royal charter from Queen Anne which formed them into a corporation legally capable of holding land and receiving donations, when the name of the school was changed to \\"Grey Coat Hospital\\". \\"Hugh Squier, Esquire\\" is listed as one of the many subscribers and benefactors, along with Rev. George Smalridge, DD (who presided at the chapel of ease attended by Hugh Squier). The aims of the school emphasised training in \\"casting accounts\\" (which aim together with an emphasis on mercantile arithmetic was also given to Hugh Squier's school in South Molton) and \\"such of them (pupils) as are capable are also kept to work at spinning, knitting, sewing and other employments to inure them to honest labour and industry\\".Text of Royal Charter in: \\"Report from select Committee on the Education of the Lower Orders in the Metropolis\\", Westminster, 1816, pp.44-7 =Connection to Blue Coat School, Westminster= He was long connected with the Blue Coat School in Westminster, founded in Duck Lane in about 1688 by voluntary subscription as a charity school for the education of poor boys to teach them reading, writing, religion, and trades.

The Attorney-General\\" :\\"And whereas I have, about twenty-eight years ago, erected and built a free school in the town of South Molton, in Devon, for the teaching of thirty poor people's children to write and keep accounts, thereby to fit them for any ordinary trades and employments; and whereas the said school hath prospered hitherto very well under the government of five trustees, who had managed that affair according to divers rules and directions contained in a book of orders left with them by me the founder for that purpose; and my will is that, as often as any two of the five trustees shall die away, &c.;, and it is expected from those particular men, the five trustees, that they shall take upon them the care of paying out of the revenue of Northam and Upcott and Westminster £29 2s. 9d. to the Church of Windsor every year, and to do it betwixt Michaelmas and Christmas, for rents and tenths, and £15 at the end of every four years for a fine, for the adding of four years de novo unto their lease, or else £30 at the end of every seven years, as their custom of renewing is, together with £3 17s. lOd. for the charges of passing and making every new lease, and adding either four or seven years thereunto, and by this renewing at every four or seven years' end, to make their estate perpetual; and, having observed that the Church of Windsor did take it more kindly when I renewed at four than at seven years' end, therefore I do recommend to the five trustees to renew at every four years; and for their taking this care particularly upon themselves they shall receive a reward of 20s. I say twenty shillings, per annum, unto each trustee, for all the time they are in this employment; and for the defraying of this charge, and for the aforesaid intent and purpose, and also to the further uses that are hereinafter expressed: I do give and bequeathe, unto the mayor and aldermen of the borough of South Molton, in Devon, and to their successors, forever, all my right, title, and estate which I have, or hereafter shall have, in the parish of Northam, in Devon, except the presentation, which is reserved for reasons which hereinafter are expressed, provided and upon condition that they do permit ... Ayres, the present vicar of that parish, and his successors forever, to have, hold, and enjoy the vicarage-house, with the gardens, orchards, and the glebe lands, lands thereunto belonging, or therewith now enjoyed, and also all the oblations, offerings, and surplice fees, and Easter duties that may arise out of the same, and do also pay him, the said Mr. Ayres, and his successors, £16, I say sixteen pounds, per annum, by quarterly payments; and do also pay the above-mentioned sums, which the hurch of Windsor doth usually and reasonably require for a fine upon every such renewing of their lease, as their custom of renewing is ; and do also pay £5 15s. per annum yearly unto George Whicher his almshouses in Westminster; and also do pay £40 per annum towards the maintenance of South Molton free school, that is to say, £25 to the schoolmaster, £5 to the trustees, £3 for their two usual feasts at their visitation, and £7 for the reparations of the school and schoolhouse, and the highways between the schoolhouse and Mole Bridge — in all £40 per annum; and the overplus which the said Upcott and Northam do produce, beyond and more than all these disbursements do amount unto, (which I do find and compute to be about £60 per annum) shall go, the one half thereof always unto him who is and shall be mayor of South Molton for the time being, towards the expenses of mayoralty, and the other half towards the mending of the highways in and near the town of South Molton, in Devon.\\" The testator then gave three leasehold houses in St Martin's-le-Grand to the parish of St. Margaret's, Westminster, the rents of which were to be appropriated to various purposes; and then proceeded: :\\"And because that several sums, whilst they stand written in words at length, and until they are set down in figures, (the one sum under the other) cannot well be cast up, therefore, I have drawn up several accounts — the one of all I have now given unto the corporation of South Molton, in Devon, and to the free school which I built there about 28 years ago; and the other of all I have given unto the parish of St Margaret's, Westminster. Both of these accounts I do make to be part of this my will; and my will and meaning is, that all what I have given unto the corporation of South Molton, and to the free school which I built there, shall be delivered over unto them by my executors from the time of my death; but what I have given to the parish of St Margaret's, Westminster, my executors shall continue to keep, and the profits of it, in their own hands, and to their own use, for one year after my decease.\\" Monuments *Miniature portrait.

In November 2014, Mikael Lindnord was in Ecuador as leader of the four-person Team Peak Performance, competing in the Adventure Racing World Championship in the Amazon rainforest, when he offered a canned meatball to a street dog. The dog then followed the team for the rest of the race. He sometimes had to be hauled out of deep mud, and during an ocean kayaking leg he jumped into the water and swam alongside until Lindnord hauled him aboard, after which he delayed the team by jumping back in after fish. Lindnord named him Arthur after King Arthur of Britain. After the team raised money through a Twitter campaign, received assistance from the Ecuadorian Minister for Social Affairs, and obtained permission from the Swedish Board of Agriculture, Lindnord was able to bring Arthur back to Sweden. Arthur required veterinary care for wounds that he had apparently had for several months and had to remain in quarantine for 120 days; in March 2015, after dental surgery, a \\"small operation\\" and a press conference, he went to live with Lindnord and his family in Örnsköldsvik. According to Lindnord, Arthur was seven years old when brought to Sweden. In May 2015 Arthur accompanied the team in the Wings For Life World Run in Kalmar. The team started a charity named Arthur's Foundation to help street dogs in Ecuador. There are plans for a \\"Community Dog\\" project to provide food and veterinary care, and Lindnord has co-written a book about Arthur, which was published in 2016. In late November 2014 Vicente Quiñónez of Quinindé told an Ecuadorian newspaper that Arthur was his dog, Barbuncho, and by late December others had also claimed to be the dog's owner, but after a petition was started by Ecuadorians asking for his former owners to be punished for causing his wounds, all the claims were dropped.

Attracted to the French art scene, she moved to Paris in 1926, where she studied for four years at the Academie de la Grande Chaumière. She was part of the art movement called the Ateliers d'Art Sacré and loved the new style of painting taught by the masters George Desvallieres and his co-founder Maurice Denis, where everyday scenes were permeated with religious undertones. Although she had been separated from the South African art world, Sumner was invited by Walter Battiss to exhibit with the New Group in 1938. She was awarded the Medal of Honour by the Suid- Afrikaanse Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns in November 1971, accompanied by a sensationally successful \\"semi-retrospective\\" exhibition at the South African Association of Arts Gallery in Pretoria.

Designed by Thomas Bouch, it was long and 22 feet (6.70 m) wide, and included a tea room, camera obscura, and a concert hall. The final construction costs were £10,000.  History  In 1869, Parliament passed a Bill for the erection of a pier at Portobello with the view of developing and promoting the town \\"as a place of pleasure and enjoyment to its inhabitants and to the many visitors from Edinburgh and from afar\\". It opened on 23 May 1871. In August of that year, on the holiday to mark the centenary of the birth of Sir Walter Scott, over 2500 people visited the pier, at a cost of one penny. The success of the pier saw day-trippers come by train from all over southern Scotland to Portobello. Pleasure boat excursions to the Isle of May, Elie, North Berwick, and Bass Rock were also offered. However, the fact that the pier was open on a Sunday caused controversy. In 1892, the pier changed ownership when the North British Railway Company bought the Galloway Company, maintaining steamer services from the pier until the Forth fleet was requisitioned by the Government for the World War I, leading to the closure of the pier. Along with falling into disuse, the pier was also damaged by storms and the iron supports of the pier corroded, which led to its demolition in 1917.  Attempted revivals  In 1933, Plans were drawn up by a group of private entrepreneurs to build a new pier which would have connected the existing promenade with three gangways opposite Bath Street, Melville Street, and Wellington Street respectively. The plans included an enclosed bathing pond, enclosed boating and sand space, restaurants, shops, and a concert hall as well as facilities for pleasure steamer services. Construction was planned at an estimated cost of £60,000, but proposals were rejected by the town council. The plans were eventually abandoned due to World War II. In 2015, a proposal was made to build a new pier on the original site. Big Things on the Beach Trust and Architecture firm Smith Scott Mullan Associates presented plans for a multi- function pier with performance and live events space, a cafe, meeting rooms, and facilities for sports clubs.

At the age of 13, he relocated with his family to Chicago. There, he continued to study piano, and composed gospel songs and arranged spirituals for Beth Eden Baptist Church and for Liberty Baptist Church. In 1925, he founded Pace Jubilee Singers, a gospel group which recorded songs written by himself, Charles Albert Tindley, and others for Victor and for Brunswick Records 19261929. Thomas A. Dorsey briefly accompanied the group. In 1936, Pace moved to Pittsburgh, where he founded the Pace Gospel Choral Union: an ensemble of 25 singers, enlarged to around 300 on special occasions, which performed gospel songs and spirituals. African-American churches in Pittsburgh and its suburbs would raise funds by having the ensemble perform for them. He also founded two music publishing houses in Pittsburgh: Old Ship of Zion Music Company (1936-51) and Charles H. Pace Music Publishers (195263), through which he published most of his 104 sacred compositions and arrangements and his 26 secular songs. Between 194145, Old Ship of Zion Music Company had 301 agents committed to selling its songs, and 2,511 direct mail order customers in the U.S.; making it one of the best-known publishers of gospel music in America. His gospel songs \\"are in the style of Tindley’s songs, with a verse-chorus structure, memorable melodies, and simple, effective harmonies\\". In a 1980 doctoral thesis for the University of Pittsburgh, Mary Tyler divided his 104 gospel songs into five categories: (1) personal testimonies, (2) questioning belief and introspection, (3) scriptural messages, (4) dialogue with God, and (5) personal counsel to listeners.

McKnight plays a physicist who invents a time machine and becomes suspicious that others may be trying to steal the technology. It premiered at the 2015 Fantasia International Film Festival and had a limited release in theaters and on video on demand and iTunes on January 22, 2016.  Plot  Physicist Jim Beale, working with two colleagues (Chuck and Matt), invents a machine that makes time travel possible. The machine operates by creating one half of a wormhole during one run, the other half during a second run. In addition, the process is expensive and dangerous. To activate the process requires radioactive material created by KMC, a company owned by Klaus Meisner, a venture capitalist. If the material is mishandled as part of the process, the machine will malfunction - creating a devastating explosion. During the first test, Beale receives a genetically-created Dahlia flower from the wormhole. Beale cannot prove his invention actually works without Meisner's material for a second test. Meisner demands 50% ownership of the process in exchange for the material, but he gets 49%. The second test is scheduled for one week after the first. Soon after the first test, Beale meets Abby Ross, who seems to know too much about him for their meeting to be coincidental. He is attracted to her, but also suspicious. His suspicions are apparently confirmed when Chuck calls him on his cell phone and tells Beale that Abby is not to be trusted and the test has succeeded much more than they thought. Beale leaves Abby and rushes back to the lab, but Chuck refuses to explain. Beale later ignores his suspicions and starts a relationship with Abby. They discover a deep bond, which is broken when Chuck's warning is confirmed: Abby tells Meisner about the flower. Meisner threatens Beale with knowledge of the flower, the intellectual property of another of his companies. Meisner extorts Beale for another 50% ownership of Beale's research, leaving Beale with 1%. Heartbroken and not thinking clearly, during the second test Beale jumps into the wormhole and is transported one week into the past to the time of the first test. Beale is convinced that on this \\"second run\\", he can outwit Meisner and Abby and prevent his research from falling into their hands. He seduces Abby but soon learns that she was honestly attracted to him: a science writer herself, she had read an article about him and crafted a fanciful story in a journal about what he must be like. Having learned more about him from Meisner and from learning about his work, she is powerfully attracted to him. Beale reads the fictional story but finds that it is both a somewhat inaccurate representation of his work and is unfinished. Complications arise: the \\"second run\\" Beale becomes physically weakened, and experiences pain when in close proximity to \\"Jim Prime\\", the Beale from before jumping into the wormhole. Beale reveals himself to Chuck and Matt in the hopes of securing their help to protect the research. They both assist Beale and conceal his presence from Jim Prime, explaining several confusing interactions in the week before the second test. Beale is jealous of Jim Prime, but there is no need: Jim Prime is still suspicious of Abby and it is clear that he will have nothing to do with her after the second test because of her betrayal. Beale continues to weaken. He encounters Abby's journal again (this time in Matt's hands) and is confused - in the first timeline, it was at Abby's apartment. Matt says he found it in Jim's coat pocket when he came out of the wormhole. The journal is now subtly different and it makes it clear that Beale has jumped not back in time, but into the past of a parallel universe, slightly different from the one he left. Slight inconsistencies Beale has not noticed in this timeline are explained. Chuck says that it is impossible for two Beales to exist in the same universe, so the \\"second run\\" Beale will die and only Jim Prime will remain. Beale enlists Chuck and Matt's help in making an unscheduled wormhole to send himself to the past with his new knowledge to try and prevent the research from being stolen. A mistake is made in the process, preventing the time jump and wasting the radioactive material. The date of the second test arrives. Beale finds another time-displaced Jim dead in a hotel after trying to leave the city. He returns to the Grand Hotel, where he sees Abby's apparent betrayal was to get more material to make the second test happen to send Jim Prime away and save Beale's life. The second test happens as before, but when Abby returns to the Grand Hotel, Beale has already died. After, Abby is alone in a cafe when Jim Prime - apparently healthy - sits down across from her. Jim reveals a deep attraction to Abby, and introduces himself. Abby acknowledges his similarity in appearance to the physicist \\"John Bain\\" whom she is writing a novel about. However, as far as she knew, John Bain was killed in a devastating explosion in his lab. The unspoken implication is that Jim Prime would not wither away like Beale did, as he entered a universe with no other Jim present.  Cast  * Chad McKnight as Jim Beale * A. J.

The theater, dedicated to the playwright Carlo Goldoni, has a main facade on the narrow Via Santa Maria #15, it is near the corner with Via de Caldaie. Facade History The monastery took its name from Annalena Malatesta, the wife of Baldaccio d'Anghiari, a 15th-century condottiero, known to Dante, who was killed by treachery by a rival at the Palazzo Vecchio. Annalena after the subsequent death of her only son, converted her house into a convent.

In the early 19th- century, the monastery was vacated and the property expropriated. The theater producer Luigi Gargani obtained the property, and commissioned the design from architect Giuseppe del Rosso. On opening, the theater had 80 booths and sat 1600 spectators.Guida della citta di Firenze, Presso Antonio Campani, Florence (1830), page 207. The theater was restored and reopened in 1997.Opera di Firenze, entry on Teatro Goldoni.

It could house 1500 spectators in seven ground rows and two upper floors. In 1819, the church at the site became a school, and later the studio of the 19th-century sculptor Francesco Pozzi.Federico Fantozzi (1845), page 258.

The owner of the Nation-Wide Detective Agency, where Myrna Winslow (Jane Wyman) works asks her to testify against Mona.

Jim is thrilled when Myrna arrived at the police station and wish to be married that night. However, Myrna is distracted when she overhears an incoming call from Millard, demanding police protection because Mona has threatened his life.

Denise also stars in the first season of its spin-off sitcom, A Different World (1987). The second-born child of Cliff and Clair Huxtable, Denise is known for her eccentric clothing and free-spirited, rebellious nature, earning her a reputation as the Huxtable family's wild child. Alternating between regular and recurring character, Denise appears on the sitcom on-and-off throughout its eight-year run, from its pilot \\"Theo's Economic Lesson\\" to the seventh season episode \\"Cliff and Jake\\", for a total of 98 episodes, after which Bonet departed for the remainder of the series. Created by comedian Bill Cosby, Denise was originally conceived as the Huxtable's eldest child until older sister Sondra was introduced in the show's second episode to establish that her parents had already successfully raised a college-educated daughter. Struggling academically, Denise drops out of school shortly after enrolling at the historically black Hillman College and briefly returns home to explore various career opportunities before traveling to Africa. While there, she meets and marries Lt. Martin Kendall, becoming stepmother to his daughter Olivia. Bonet was quickly cast as Denise because the producers found that she naturally embodied some of the character's unique traits. Based on Cosby's daughter Erinn, the show's creator incorporated real-life experiences from his relationship with his own daughter into Denise's storyline about self- discovery and independence. Bonet had a difficult professional relationship with Cosby while working on The Cosby Show, particularly regarding her decisions to appear in the controversial film Angel Heart (1987) and subsequently pose nude for various magazines. Although Cosby denies having been opposed to Bonet's career trajectory, he developed A Different World amidst their dispute to provide the actress with a more mature platform. However, Bonet was soon fired from the spin-off shortly after its first season and temporarily rejoined the cast of The Cosby Show when she became pregnant because Cosby was unwilling to entertain the prospect of the sitcom's main character being a pregnant teenager. After leaving The Cosby Show for one year to give birth to her child, Bonet returned as a series regular at the beginning of its sixth season until Cosby ultimately fired her during season seven due to creative differences. Within months of her debut, Denise became The Cosby Show's most popular character, well-received by young adult viewers who identified with her unique sense of fashion and free-spirited attitude, while establishing Bonet as one of the decade's most popular actresses. Bonet's performance earned her a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series in 1986. Some fans criticized Bonet's role in Angel Heart for dishonoring the wholesome reputation of her best-known character. Denise did not fare as well on A Different World; critics found Bonet uninteresting and often blamed her performance for the show's unimpressive early reviews. Revered as a fashion icon, the character's eclectic style has had a profound impact on modern fashion trends; media publications frequently rank Denise among television's best-dressed characters.  Role  The Cosby Show follows the daily goings-on of the Huxtable family, an upper-middle class African American family who reside in Brooklyn, New York. The family is run by Dr. Cliff Huxtable (Bill Cosby), an obstetrician, and his wife Clair (Phylicia Rashad), a lawyer. The second eldest of their five children, Denise is a younger sister of Sondra (Sabrina Lebeauf) and an elder sister to Theo (Malcolm-Jamal Warner), Vanessa (Tempestt Bledsoe) and Rudy (Keshia Knight Pulliam). After graduating from high school, Denise leaves home to pursue post-secondary education at the fictional, historically black Hillman College, the college both her parents and grandparents had attended. A Different World originally focuses on the character during her freshman and sophomore years at Hillman, revolving around her as she meets new friends and adjusts to college life. However, Denise constantly struggles with her finances and academics to the point of which she ultimately drops out, becoming the first member of her family to drop out of college. After leaving Hillman, Denise returns to her childhood home in the hopes of forging her own \\"alternative path\\" towards success. Initially interested in becoming either a fashion designer or record producer, Denise pursues several short-lived part-time jobs, from which she is either fired or quits after a brief period of time, before traveling to Africa to work as a wildlife photographer's assistant. Denise returns to the Huxtable household one year later, this time as the second wife of a divorced Naval officer, Lt. Martin Kendall (Joseph C. Phillips) – who she marries without her family's knowledge – and stepmother to his three year-old daughter Olivia (Raven- Symoné). After developing an interest in teaching children with learning disabilities, Denise eventually decides to enroll at Medgar Evers College. Finally, Denise relocates to Asia to live with Martin, where he is stationed for the remainder of the series, while Olivia remains in Brooklyn with her parents. In the series finale, Denise phone calls her family from Asia to announce that she is pregnant with her and Martin's first child. Development =Creation and writing= Comedian Bill Cosby became interested in developing The Cosby Show partially because he was unimpressed with popular family sitcoms airing at the time, some of which often depicted children talking back to and disrespecting their parents without suffering serious consequences. Cosby intended for The Cosby Show's children to remain intelligent while emphasizing that \\"their parents were always smarter and—most importantly—in charge.\\" Originally, Denise was intended to be the eldest of the Huxtable family's four children. However, Cosby also wanted the show to feature a character who was an example of parents Cliff and Clair having already successfully raised a college-educated child, hence the writers introduced eldest sibling Sondra, a Princeton University graduate, in the second episode, while Denise was relegated to the role of the Huxtable's second eldest child instead. Cosby himself is the father of five children, four daughters and one son, much like his character Cliff. All five Huxtable children are based on Cosby's own; Denise in particular was based on the creator's daughter Erinn, who was approximately Denise's same age when the series began in 1984. According to Cosby: His Life and Times author Mark Whitaker, Cosby conceived Denise as a \\"hip, fashion-conscious, and a bit flaky\\" character. Early storylines included Denise fighting with younger sister Vanessa over the latter borrowing her sweater without permission, getting her braces removed, announcing her decision to attend college away from home, promising younger brother Theo that she is capable of sewing him a replica of an expensive designer shirt he had purchased, and tricking her parents into believing she had spent a night at a male friend's house to prove a point about their parenting style. An episode entitled \\"Jitterbug Break\\" was written to explore Cosby's interest in the ways in which different generations dance. When Denise's parents deny her permission to attend a concert, some of her friends are invited into their living room which has been converted into a dance floor by rearranging some of the furniture, allowing them room to break dance. They are eventually joined by a pair of Cliff and Clair's swing dancing friends, and a dance battle ensues between the younger and older dancers. In one of the show's more serious episodes, Denise struggles with the revelation that a teenage friend of hers is pregnant. Several episodes revolving around Denise explore her boyfriends and dating life. = Casting and portrayal = Denise is portrayed by American actress Lisa Bonet, whose professional acting experience prior to The Cosby Show had been limited to television commercials for Barbie and McDonald's, and a guest appearance on the medical drama St. Elsewhere. Casting the role of Denise, who was still intended to be the Huxtable's eldest child at the time, was a relatively quick process. Bonet first auditioned for the show's directors, followed by its producers, then finally Cosby himself and the network executives. Cosby immediately became interested in then-15 year-old Bonet because she was wearing makeup on only one side of her face, already demonstrating some of the quirky characteristics Cosby had envisioned for the character simply by being herself. Impressed by the young actress' strong sense of self, producer Marcy Carsey recalled that Bonet attended her audition wearing braces, a \\"real kid\\" hairstyle, and an \\"off-center\\" sense of fashion that was very similar to what the show's creators had envisioned for Denise. They soon labelled Bonet a young woman who refuses to be anything but herself after the actress read for the role quite naturally, as though \\"she were just doing life.\\" According to People, Denise \\"didn’t fit into any mold, a role that seemed made for Lisa Bonet.\\" The actors were eventually narrowed down to three top choices for each child character, including Bonet for Denise, although she felt discouraged after overhearing one of the other two actresses vying for the same role say \\"She'll never get it ... Because she has braces.\\" After Bonet learned that she had in fact been chosen for the role from director Jay Sandrich, she met with Cosby one more time, who admitted to liking her braces. According to Cosby: His Life and Times author Mark Whitaker, Cosby enjoyed \\"the naturalness of [Bonet's] delivery\\", which he found refreshing in comparison to the \\"stagey quality\\" most child actors who auditioned for the role tended to rely upon, in addition to her \\"exotic beauty\\", which he likened to that of singer Lena Horne. Once Bonet was cast, the writers began to incorporate some aspects of her personality into her character, although her own fashion sense and behavior is viewed as more \\"outlandish\\" than Denise's. At Cosby's request, costume designer Sarah Lemire was granted a weekly budget of $3000 to outfit the show's characters and frequently took significant risks with Bonet's wardrobe. However, the costume designer did have some restrictions; Lemire would have liked to have been \\"more outrageous with [Bonet's] hair and hats\\" but limited herself because she had little control over the actress hair. Praising Bonet's own taste in clothing, Lemire likened costuming her to \\"dressing myself if I was 20 years younger.\\" Bonet often selected her character's outfits herself with little input from the wardrobe department. Denise was Bonet's first major television role. Being of mixed ethnicity, her character's upbringing \\"as a teen-ager in a well-adjusted, upper-middle-class black family\\" is remarkably different from how Bonet herself grew up, which took some time for the actress to adjust to; she never knew her father and was raised by her mother in a lower-middle-class, mostly white neighborhood. However, Bonet credits her role on The Cosby Show with \\"helping resolve her own identity crisis\\". Bonet described the show's environment in 1987 as \\"the perfect family, where you go to work, you get tired of them and you go home\\", and at the time likened working alongside Cosby to \\"learning from a master\\", from whom she often sought both professional and personal advice. Actress Phylicia Rashad, who portrays Bonet's on-screen mother Clair, described Bonet as \\"one of the best young actresses today ... She is phenomenal for someone of her years.\\" = Creative conflicts and A Different World = Bonet had a tense relationship with both Cosby and the show's producers throughout most of her time on the series. Although the co-stars are believed to have gotten along well during her first three seasons on the show, their dispute first became public in 1987. According to Kara Kovalchik of Mental Floss, Bonet's alleged unprofessionalism consistently aggravated Cosby, reportedly being constantly argumentative on set, late for tapings and sometimes neglecting to attend tapings altogether. Bonet first expressed interest in pursuing a career as a dramatic film actress midway through the show's first season, originally intending to leave the series after only two years. Aged 19 at the time, she decided to make her film debut as Epiphany Proudfoot in the controversial horror film Angel Heart (1987), a role that required Bonet to film a sex scene with actor Mickey Rourke. By this time, Denise had already become the show's most popular character, while Bonet's fame increased when the film was initially assigned an X rating for its graphic content. Although her role shocked several of Bonet's fans and Cosby himself, Cosby claims that he did not mind the actress' decision to appear in the film, explaining to her \\"if this is something you want to do, fine. You have my blessings\\", and maintaining that he and Bonet have a good relationship in which he would have voiced his disapproval if he had felt otherwise. Bonet confirmed that she sought Cosby's advice when she was first offered the role because \\"he's a generous enough man to see beyond The Cosby Show and to see my career as what it is and what it could be\\". Despite granting her his approval, Cosby refused to see the film. The show's producers and NBC executives declined to comment on Bonet's decision, citing \\"what Bonet did off the Cosby set was her business.\\" alt=Black and white headshot of a middle-aged African American man with a half-smile donning business attire while looking off to the side of the image. Tensions increased between Bonet and Cosby when the actress posed nude for Interview and Rolling Stone magazines to promote Angel Heart. Bonet insisted \\"I was not concerned with how Denise was going to feel ... Nor was I looking to destroy her reputation. Instead, I felt obligated to my career and my (freedom of) artistic choice.\\" After hearing that the photograph was generating a lot of negative feedback and press, Cosby purchased a copy of Interview himself and claims that, upon seeing Bonet's photographs for the first time, he felt \\"There's nothing wrong with it ... Lisa has matured due to the immediacy of her responsibilities ... I think that she is doing magnificently well for someone [at her age] doing and making decisions on her own, and she is deeply loved in my heart\\". The media continued to circulate Bonet's photographs heavily, which is believed to have instigated a highly publicized dispute between the actress and Cosby towards the end of the 1980s. Cosby expressed concern over how the photographs would affect The Cosby Show's younger audience and Bonet's younger cast mates. Although producers felt that the scandal would disturb \\"the squeaky-clean Huxtable image\\", Cosby eventually decided to provide Bonet with her own television series, a spin-off of The Cosby Show entitled A Different World. The network agreed that Bonet was ready to star in her own series, a revelation by which she was surprised. A Different World originally revolved around an entirely different premise and main character, starring actress Meg Ryan as Maggie Lauten – a white student adjusting to a historically black college. When Ryan left the project to focus on her film career, she was replaced with actress Marisa Tomei; Tomei's Maggie was re-written into a supporting role, becoming one of Denise's roommates, while the premise was revised into a series following Bonet's character as she adjusts to college and living away from home. The first and only Cosby Show cast member to receive their own spin-off, the media speculated that A Different World had been developed into a star vehicle for Bonet because she frequently protested the way in which Cosby directed the family-oriented Cosby Show; Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club agreed that the spin-off was revised as a means of removing Bonet from The Cosby Show \\"in a way that would bruise fewer egos.\\" Additionally, Cosby's decision to cast Bonet in A Different World allowed \\"viewers to explore the new environment through the eyes of a familiar character\\". Strategic Reinvention in Popular Culture: The Encore Impulse author Richard Pfefferman agreed that Denise \\"was at the perfect stage of development to star in a series of her own.\\" Filming A Different World required Bonet to relocate from New York, where The Cosby Show was taped, back to her hometown San Francisco, California. A Different World's pilot revolves around Denise as she struggles to pay her dormitory fees while meeting her new roommates, Jaleesa Vinson (Dawnn Lewis) and Maggie, respectively. In addition to a diverse group of friends, Denise would also meet and be influenced by new friends and teachers \\"with different perspectives on life\\", allowing the character to \\"grow in profound and interesting ways.\\" The majority of the first season revolves around Denise, the show's lead character at the time, struggling to maintain her grades. = Return to The Cosby Show = While appearing on A Different World, Bonet married musician Lenny Kravitz in 1988 and became pregnant with their child soon afterward. Fearing how Cosby would react to the news based on previous experiences with on-set pregnancies, Bonet first consulted with producer Debbie Allen, who suggested that they approach Cosby about the pregnancy together. Allen suggested that Bonet's pregnancy be written into the series, explaining that it \\"would be a great thing. To see a girl who’s upper class kid, having a baby, not married because she didn’t want to be married…and the girls could root for her.\\" Although Cosby listened to Allen's ideas, he and some of the show's other producers did not want to explore teen pregnancy via A Different World's main character, fearing that depicting a popular, well-behaved character like Denise pregnant at such a young age would offer the wrong message to audiences. Cosby in particular was strongly opposed to the idea of a Huxtable child experiencing an unplanned pregnancy and becoming an unwed mother, concluding, \\"Lisa Bonet is pregnant not Denise\\" and rejecting Allen's proposal. Allen was reportedly upset with Cosby over his decision but understood that \\"he just wanted her back\\", and Denise's pregnancy would alter Cosby's creative vision for both series. Bonet was fired from A Different World at the beginning of its second season, and Cosby re-hired her to appear on The Cosby Show's fifth season while A Different World underwent several changes in her absence. Robert E. Johnson of Jet reported that Bonet's cast mates happily welcomed her back to the series, with Cosby assuring her \\"there's nothing but love here for you\\". While struggling at first to determine the best way to approach the return of both Bonet and Denise, Cosby ultimately decided to incorporate some real-life experiences from his relationship with his own daughter Erinn who, similar to Denise, had dropped out of school in order \\"to find herself\\", into the character's re-introduction, which evolved into a storyline about children sometimes disappointing their parents but remaining loved by them regardless. Erinn attended Spelman College, the historically black institution upon which Hillman is based. The episode in which Denise returns home premiered on October 6, 1988. Since Cosby did not intend to add an infant character to the series, the show concealed Bonet's pregnancy using loose-fitting clothing, large coats, sofas and grocery bags. To allow Bonet time to have her baby, her character was temporarily written out of the series for one year by having Denise announce that she has decided to drop out of Hillman permanently in favor of relocating to Africa and pursuing a job opportunity as a wildlife photographer's assistant (after briefly attempting to become a fashion designer or record producer). Denise was downgraded from a main to recurring character for the remainder of the season. Despite NBC producers alluding to the possibility of Bonet returning to A Different World permanently after giving birth, Bonet would only make one final appearance on the spin-off, a cameo during its third season, by which time the series had begun to focus on other characters. Allen created an entirely new character, Freddie Brooks, and recruited actress Cree Summer to occupy Bonet's vacancy as the show's \\"earthy, bohemian\\" character. In the wake of Bonet's departure, Tomei was also fired and her character written out of the series despite Allen's original intentions to retain \\"the dynamic of having a white girl in a black college.\\" Although A Different World would remain a spin-off of The Cosby Show, Denise's absence severed connections between the two shows apart from the fact that Hillman is her father's alma mater during its earliest seasons. = Departure = Following Bonet's exit, some media outlets dubbed actress alt=Photograph of a young African-American woman looking attentive; her long, black hair is pulled back into a low ponytail and she is wearing a sleeveless white top. Having spent the majority of season five away on maternity leave, Bonet resumed her role on The Cosby Show full-time upon giving birth to daughter Zoë Kravitz; Denise returns home after secretly marrying Lt. Martin Kendall (Joseph C. Phillips), a Naval officer she had met while working in Africa, becoming stepmother to his three year-old daughter Olivia (Raven-Symoné). Philips originally guest starred in an early episode of The Cosby Show as one of Sondra's love interests before he was recast as Denise's husband for the remainder of the series. The sixth season premiere \\"Denise: The Saga Continues\\", in which Denise returns home to Brooklyn unannounced and introduces her parents to her new family, established the sitcom's season premieres as episodes in which a Huxtable child would inform their parents about very surprising news. Bonet would continue to appear on the show regularly over the next several episodes until Cosby fired her altogether at the end of season seven, officially citing \\"creative differences\\". The season's 24th episode \\"Cliff and Jake\\", which aired on April 11, 1991, marks Bonet's final appearance on the show. Cosby claims that he fired Bonet because The Cosby Show's material was no longer challenging for her, blaming himself for her character lacking development: \\"it's not funny to have someone 21 acting like she's still about 12.\\" However, he commended Bonet's acting talent. Cosby then decided to divide Bonet's screen time among new young actors \\"on the show who are working hard, studying so heard and really deserve a shot during what will be our final year.\\" Introduced during the show's later seasons, Pam Tucker (Erika Alexander), a cousin of the Huxtable family, is considered to be a \\"replacement\\" for Denise; StyleBlazer believes that Pam was created because the sitcom \\"needed another character to play a free-spirited problem child.\\" Bonet developed a reputation for being difficult to work with on The Cosby Show. Although nearly every main and recurring character who played a significant role on the series returned for The Cosby Show's finale \\"And So We Commence\\", which revolves around Denise's younger brother Theo graduating from New York University, Bonet was not invited back to make a final appearance on the show after having being fired the previous year. Her character is, however, mentioned and used sparingly throughout the episode. Unseen, Denise calls her family on the telephone from Singapore to announce that she is pregnant with her and Martin's first child, and everyone receives an opportunity to congratulate her except Cliff. Bonet appeared on The Cosby Show on and off from 1984 to 1987, and from 1989 to 1991, for a grand total of 98 episodes between the ages of 17 and 24. She is credited as a main cast member from seasons one to three and six to seven, and a recurring cast member during seasons four and five. According to PopCrunch, Bonet's feud with Cosby \\"has become just as legendary as the show\\" itself. Bonet has famously continued to avoid attending Cosby Show-related reunions and specials in the years since the show has ended. When Bonet declined to attend The Cosby Show: A Look Back, a retrospective television special hosted by NBC in 2002, she explained, \\"The whole experience and energy behind it felt disingenuous and motivated by corporate profit. I felt devalued and disrespected.\\" When the Cosby Show cast was honored with the Impact Award at the 2011 TV Land Awards, Bonet was noticeably absent, citing \\"scheduling conflicts\\" as the official reason for her nonattendance. Actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner, who portrays Bonet's on-screen brother Theo, said \\"Lisa has always danced to the beat of her own drummer, which has worked for and against her\\"; Warner recalled being \\"surprised\\" when Bonet once attended a smaller-scale reunion that featured him and on-screen sisters Tempestt Bledsoe (Vanessa) and Keshia Knight Pulliam (Rudy) for Nickelodeon's Favorite Huxtable Contest. However, he admitted he admires Bonet for following her passion. Bonet and Tomei, both of whom were fired during the first season of A Different World, have remained close friends. In 2018, Bonet, who has had little to no comment about the recent sexual assault allegations made by several women against Cosby, revealed that she had always felt a \\"type of sinister, shadow energy cannot be concealed\\" during her time working with Cosby. She maintains that her memories of her experience on the show have not been influenced by the allegations, insisting, \\"No, it’s exactly as I remember it\\".  Characterization and fashion  According to Eudie Pak of Biography, Denise was first introduced \\"as the popular girl with ever-changing hair and fashion\\". Martin Gitlin, author of The Greatest Sitcoms of All Time, described the character as \\"Stunningly attractive ... independent, intelligent, and proud.\\" Denise eventually became known as \\"the wild child\\" of the Huxtable family as a result of her rebellious nature, outspokenness, eccentric clothing and tendency to date boys her father does not approve of. Josh Axelrod of College Magazine dubbed Denise \\"Cliff Huxtable's most frustrating child\\", standing apart from her siblings due to her inherent flightiness and restlessness. As \\"the most mellow Huxtable kid with a slightly boho style\\", the character also dresses in a manner that is distinguished from the moderate way in which her siblings dress. Denise's style has been described as bohemian and boho-chic. Developing a reputation as \\"a stylish dresser\\", the character frequently makes bold fashion statements, particularly via her vast assortment of hats and accessories, and variety of hair styles. Kamille Cooper, contributing to Vibe, described the character's wardrobe as \\"synonymous with 90’s trends and groovy 70’s-inspired prints–even more so perpetuated by her carefree persona\\", identifying \\"her ability to mix prints and patterns effortlessly to embellished adornments on fedoras and blazers\\". Denise typically wears oversized smocks, harem pants, jumpsuits, large blazers and head wraps with vibrant patterns, as well as denim and vintage tops. Glamour contributor Tracey Lomrantz Lester wrote that, in addition to fitted vests, the character dons \\"some of the most memorable headwear I've ever seen on TV.\\" Alison Feldmann, writing for The Etsy Blog, described Denise as \\"fearless when it came to her appearance and could get away with seemingly anything\\". Refinery29 contributor Fara Prince agreed that Denise \\"got away with wearing the craziest outfits and changed her hairstyle constantly, all while maintaining that relaxed, cool-girl vibe.\\" Brit + Co writer Rachel Aschenbrand-Robinson believes that the character's choice of clothing gave viewers the impression \\"that she actually gave no f**ks what anyone thought of her look.\\" College Fashion cited the character's interest in experimenting with geometric patterns, bright colors and a variety of textures. Bustle's Cherise Luter believes that Denise's wardrobe \\"expressed [her] inner rebel.\\" Jamie Broadnax of Black Girl Nerds identified Denise as a hipster, writing that the character was \\"a hipster before the word hipster was even a thing\\" due to her unconventional clothing choices and tendency to avoid imitating others, as well as her own method of doing things that she incorporates into the way she dresses. Denise's sense of fashion is also reflected in her hair; the character experiments with various hairstyles throughout The Cosby Show's run, ranging from \\"androgynous short hair to natural curls [and] waist-length dreads.\\" In later seasons, the character \\"exhibited more of a hippy-chick free spirit\\" closer to the way in which Bonet dresses outside of The Cosby Show. Denise's sense of fashion endures during her enrollment at Hillman. Andrea Linett, author of I Want to Be Her!: How Friends & Strangers Helped Shape My Style, described the character's wardrobe as \\"drapey and Japanese-y and so perfectly '80s\\", which she believes only improves once she transitions from The Cosby Show to A Different World. On the spin-off, Denise often gravitates towards menswear, high-waisted pants, and vintage clothing. Richard Pfefferman, author of Strategic Reinvention in Popular Culture: The Encore Impulse, described Denise as \\"Young, hip, trendy and colorful\\". Pfeifferman continued to describe the character as a \\"fun- loving, fashion-conscious, light-hearted teenage girl\\" who was \\"perfectly poised for gradual transformation into a serious and more thoughtful adult\\" on A Different World. Tara Ariano, author of Television Without Pity: 752 Things We Love to Hate (and Hate to Love) about TV, wrote that Denise embodies \\"the height of sophisticated teenager-hood\\" due to her \\"inexhaustible supply\\" of jewelry, blouses and leggings. According to Bonet, her character showed audiences \\"that it's okay to be a freak\\". However, Racked's Nadra Nittle argued that Denise remains rather \\"straight-laced\\" despite her artsy, unconventional wardrobe consisting of high-waisted trousers and tropical shirts. Denise has been identified as a \\"drifter\\". Author Mark Whitaker wrote in his book Cosby: His Life and Times that the character resembles a \\"laconic mixture of sweetness and sarcasm that captured the ironic detachment that was becoming a hallmark of Generation X.\\" Each Huxtable child \\"represents a different aspect on life.\\" As a rebel who has been described as the Huxtable's \\"most troublesome child\\", Denise was often depicted as the opposite of Sondra, struggling to perform well academically unlike her older sister; Denise receives five Ds, one C and seven incompletes during her time at Hillman. While Sondra successfully graduates from Princeton University, Denise drops out of Hillman, travels to Africa and marries a Navy lieutenant instead, representing \\"that children don’t always grow up how parents expect\\", according to the Ames Tribune. The Odyssey Online's Tawana Charles observed that \\"Denise did what she had to do to get by, even when she had to call her parents to get out of a jam. She realized that there are things that you have to do for yourself, without your parents' help, and she did just that.\\" Clover Hope of Jezebel agreed that the character \\"is determined to be independent—with no discipline or follow-through—and doesn’t want her parents, Cliff and Clair Huxtable, to pay her way through college.\\" Denise also stands apart from her college friends by being a \\"quirky, naive, indecisive flower child.\\" Mike Vago of The A.V. Club observed that the Huxtable home begins to suffer from \\"Full Nest Syndrome\\" once Denise returns home from Africa, married and with a step child. Writing for the same publication, Joshua Alston believes that Bonet's real-life \\"earth-mother persona was integrated into the character, and became a riff on what rich-kid rebellion might look like for a wealthy black family.\\" Denise has been nicknamed the Huxtable's \\"prodigal daughter\\" by the media. Reception = The Cosby Show = Denise quickly established herself as an audience favorite during the show's earliest seasons, which Mental Floss contributor Kara Kovalchik attributes to her \\"typical teenage carefree attitude and her cutting-edge fashion sense\\". Denise ultimately became the show's most popular character, and her unique fashion sense became a trademark of the series. Essence wrote that the character's clothes \\"captured the hearts of wholesome teeny-boppers all over America\\", while Abby White of the Nashville Scene agreed that the character \\"won our hearts with her sense of style from day one\\". White also joked that being one of Denise's three less popular sisters \\"must have really sucked\\". Popular and beloved by fans until her departure, Bonet became a \\"media darling\\", by whom she was crowned \\"America's Sweetheart\\". Idolized by teenage boys, she received the most fan mail out of the show's cast. Adored by millions of fans, Bonet's popularity grew almost overnight, soon establishing her as the show's breakout star and a household name. Fans swarmed the actress in public, often approaching her for fashion advice. Karen Heller of The Philadelphia Inquirer dubbed Bonet their \\"sartorial role model.\\" Girls were drawn towards her bohemian sense of fashion, while boys found her to be very attractive and \\"a major heartthrob\\", admitting to having crushes on the actress throughout her tenure. According to Hollywood.com, Bonet \\"struck a chord\\" among The Cosby Show fans with \\"her ethereal beauty and quiet strength\\". Vibe's Greg Tate believes Bonet's performance \\"won the heart of just about every young black woman who didn't fit the mold of debutante, fly girl or hoochie mama\\". Hillary Crosley Coker of Jezebel described Bonet as \\"the coolest of The Cosby Show cast\\", while Refinery29's Kara Kia believes that Bonet and Denise were equally \\"admired for [their] rebellious, elusive approach to celebrity.\\" In \\"An Ode To Lisa Bonet As Denise Huxtable\\", Uproxx contributor Greg Whitt praised the actress: \\"I loved how you were never willing to mute your personality in a house full of squares. Your hair was short and untamed. Your outfits never matched but always worked ... You were sexy before I knew what sexy was. Vanessa was too annoying, and Rudy was too young, but, Denise ahem Lisa, you were the one.\\" Julee Wilson of HuffPost described the character as \\"head- strong yet lovable\\". Rebekah Williams, writing for Her Campus, called Denise's personality \\"charming\\". In a retrospective review of the series, Funny or Die dubbed Denise \\"your Tumblr crush\\", writing, \\"She was wild. Sexy. Artistic. A free spirit. But mostly, she was just fierce. Girls wanted to be her. Boys wanted to be with her. Boys also probably wanted to be her.\\" Who What Wear identified Denise as the main reason they continue to watch reruns of The Cosby Show, citing her clothes as the primary factor in their \\"dedicated viewership\\" while dubbing her \\"a total 80's urban dreamgirl.\\" Writing for The Atlantic, Joe Reid ranked Denise the best Huxtable child, praising both Bonet's performance and the character's \\"flakiness\\". Reid concluded, \\"Denise managed to be equal parts cool and disaster, without ever selling out either part.\\" Writing for the same publication, Kevin O'Keefe ranked Denise lower at number five because he often struggled to \\"understand her motivations\\", finding it implausible that a free-spirited woman like Denise would be interested in \\"a straight-edge [man] like Martin\\". However, O'Keefe admitted that he enjoyed her role in the episode \\"A Shirt Story\\". The episode is often positively reviewed as one of the character's best; Zeba Blay, senior culture writer for HuffPost, called the moment Theo screams \\"Denise!\\" upon trying on the shirt Denise sewed for her brother as her favorite scene. Bonet was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series at the 38th Primetime Emmy Awards in 1986. Bonet's controversial role in Angel Heart was met with strong backlash from devoted Cosby Show fans, some of whom felt that she had betrayed Denise's \\"wholesome\\" image. Some media headlines, such as USA Today's \\"X has Cosby kid's film on spot\\", gave readers the impression that \\"all 77 million weekly watchers are outraged by the behavior of their little Denise\\", according to Trustman Senger of The Washington Post. The fact that Bonet, a Cosby Show cast member, had been cast in a sex scene with co-star Mickey Rorke garnered far more media coverage than whether or not the film deserved the X rating it had originally been assigned. Maintaining that he had never seen an episode of The Cosby Show prior to casting Bonet, Angel Heart director Alan Parker admitted he was unprepared for the public's reaction, elaborating, \\"I was naive not to realize ... what she represented within that show was maybe a role model for young black American kids.\\" When the film was released, an overwhelming number of The Cosby Show fans asked Bonet to reveal what Cosby thought of her performance. Cosby eventually said that he was not particularly fond of Bonet's role in the film, which he dismissed as \\"a movie made by white America that cast a black girl, gave her voodoo things to do and have sex.\\" Envisioning Black Feminist Voodoo Aesthetics: African Spirituality in American Cinema author Kameelah L. Martin believes that Cosby's avoidance of the film only augmented the controversy surrounding Bonet's role. Victor Valle of the Los Angeles Times wondered if the sex scene would harm Bonet's \\"wholesome TV image\\" on both The Cosby Show and the then-upcoming A Different World. Maintaining that she had been unaware of Denise's wholesome reputation prior to appearing in Angel Heart, Bonet insisted \\"My obligation wasn't to Denise. I felt obligated to myself and my career.\\" = A Different World = As one of the decade's most popular actresses, A Different World initially attempted to capitalize on Bonet's fame by featuring Denise prominently. Although the spin-off garnered strong viewership due to airing immediately after its parent program, critics were largely unimpressed with its first season and Denise's role, often blaming her characterization and Bonet's performance for the show's lackluster reviews. Mark Harris, contributing to Entertainment Weekly, wrote that \\"Bonet proved hollow as the center of a sitcom\\". People television critic Jeff Jarvis accused NBC of \\"steal[ing] Lisa Bonet away, diluting Cosby only so she could star in a watery, bland series of her own.\\" Jarvis continued, \\"I only hope NBC has the sense to forgive Bonet and welcome her home, where she’s always been terrific, on Cosby.\\" The Chicago Tribune's Clifford Terry felt that Bonet was not \\"a compelling enough actress to carry a show by herself\\". Nadra Nittle of Racked accused Denise's \\"dull\\" personality of causing the show's inaugural season to \\"fall flat\\". Emily VanDerWerff, writing for The A.V. Club, agreed that the actress \\"wasn’t yet ready to carry a show\\", blaming her \\"sleepy demeanor and subdued line readings\\" for prompting audiences to gravitate towards more interesting supporting characters. Emily Nussbaum, television critic for The New York Times, reviewed Denise as \\"so diffident she seemed barely there.\\" However, Tawana Charles of The Odyssey Online appreciated A Different World for not depicting Denise as \\"an honor[s] student.\\" Despite initially being inspired to attend college by watching her \\"favorite character ... take off on her own via 'A Different World', Jeneé Osterheldt, writing for The Kansas City Star, similarly enjoyed Denise's arc for proving that \\"I didn’t need to be flawless like her.\\" Writer and executive producer Susan Fales defended Bonet's acting: \\"the character was far more at fault [than Bonet]. Denise was not very interesting, and we were asked to make her into Mary Tyler Moore or Tinkerbell, always bringing everyone together. We couldn’t.\\" Critics and audiences found that the character was constantly being upstaged by Whitley Gilbert (Jasmine Guy). After Bonet's departure, Whitley replaced Denise as A Different World's main character, and the series underwent major revisions to focus on her and other supporting characters. Although the producers expected viewers to miss Denise, critics generally conceded that Whitley, in whom audiences had always shown more interest, offered better television than Denise. Linda Hobbs of Vibe wrote that A Different World's \\"success only grew after Bonet left\\". However, some fans lamented Denise's departure. AfterEllen.com contributor Dana Piccoli found it difficult to continue enjoying A Different World without Bonet, expounding, \\"I hung on for a couple of seasons but my heart wasn’t in it with Bonet gone.\\" Recognizing Denise's characterization on A Different World among 752 Things We Love to Hate (and Hate to Love) about TV, author Tara Ariano wrote that young female fans were generally unbothered by Bonet's tendency to \\"deliver her lines either in a monotone or screechy whine\\" while \\"looking at Denise with the eyes of love.\\" Erin Faith Wilson of AfterEllen.com called A Different World one of her favorite shows \\"because of my love for Denise Huxtable\\", elaborating, \\"her clothes were amazing, she was incredibly intelligent and she didn’t put up with shit from anyone ... At the time, she seemed to scream feminism and I couldn’t get enough.\\" Bustle's Rikki Byrd wrote, \\"Although it was sad to see her go, the little bit of time she was on offered up enough style inspiration to last a decade.\\" Although most viewers dismissed the show as an unsuccessful spin-off of The Cosby Show in the immediate wake of Bonet's departure, A Different World proved successful and would go on to air for five more seasons without Bonet. In a retrospective review of Denise's role on A Different World, Jezebel's Clover Hope wrote \\"there’s nothing that fascinating about Denise\\", who she described as \\"an atrocious student.\\" However, Hope admitted that the character is popular due to her wardrobe and audiences being able to relate to \\"her frazzled state of mind\\", concluding, \\"Really, we weren’t all that different from Denise.\\" Some of My Best Friends Are Black: The Strange Story of Integration in America author Tanner Colby reported that applications to historically black colleges and universities in America increased by 14% one year after Denise started attending Hillman, while mostly white colleges experienced their first noticeable decrease in African American enrollment since the civil rights era.  Impact and legacy  Denise remains Bonet's best-known role. In his biography of the actress, Michael Hastings of AllMovie wrote that Bonet \\"quickly asserted herself as one of the most memorable kids in the Huxtable clan\\", since then \\"enjoying a longevity that few former child stars can claim.\\" Bob McCann, author of Encyclopedia of African American Actresses in Film and Television, believes an entire generation of African-American teenagers \\"grew up with a crush on\\" Denise. The Root's Erin E. Evans summarized Denise as \\"the eccentric daughter whom every young Cosby fan either wanted to be like or be with.\\" Established as a style icon, The Guardian's Danielle Henderson credits the character with introducing television viewers to \\"boho chic 30 years before\\" it became a popular fashion trend. Evans agreed that Denise \\"was setting trends with her eclectic style\\", which was largely embraced by the public. Vibe's Kamille Cooper crowned the character \\"the epitome of the Bohemian Chic\\" while dubbing her fashion sense an iconic \\"pop culture phenomenon\\", crediting Lemire with most of its success. Cooper believes that women continue to adore and \\"channel\\" Denise's clothes more than 20 years after the show's finale. Kara Kia of Refinery29 dubbed Denise's bohemian aesthetic one of the decade's most defining looks. In 2014, Bustle recognized 15 ways Denise \\"Proved She Was A Fashion Icon\\", comparing her impact to those of Carrie Bradshaw from Sex and the City and the cast of Gossip Girl. Author Cherise Luter wrote, \\"While well suited for the '80s, the mix of boho punk would mesh perfectly with any current street style blog or indie magazine, which is a testament to Lemire's talent as a designer.\\" The same website published a list of \\"Lisa Bonet's Best Style Moments\\" during her tenure on A Different World.Bustle url-status=livearchive-url=archive- date=access-date=July 31, 2017}} Similarly, The Odyssey Online's Bianca Eugene cited \\"15 Reasons Why Denise Huxtable Is A Fashion Icon\\", elaborating that the character \\"has proven that no matter how outrageous her outfit or hairstyle may be, she still looks good.\\" Agreeing that Denise is a precursor to Carrie Bradshaw and Cookie Lyon from Empire, Julee Wilson, senior fashion editor for HuffPost, named the character \\"one of our first TV style crushes\\", crediting her with teaching audiences how to layer and accessorize their outfits. The Etsy Blog's Alison Feldmann wrote that Denise's \\"loud style remain[s] iconic as ever.\\" Brit + Co dubbed Denise \\"the eclectic style queen of college\\", describing her as \\"the epitome of cool\\". In her book I Want to Be Her!: How Friends & Strangers Helped Shape My Style, author Andrea Linett crowned Denise \\"The first television character who really had style\\", claiming she was the main reason she watched The Cosby Show weekly. Linett concluded, \\"To this day, there is no one I would rather look like than [Bonet].\\" Elle included Denise in an article recognizing \\"The 50 Best Dressed Women on TV\\". Unranked, Glamour featured the character among \\"The 9 Best Dressed TV Characters Of All Time\\", with author Tracey Lomrantz Lester dubbing her \\"the best dressed kid on The Cosby Show\\". Essence considers her to be among \\"TV's Best-Dressed Characters\\", while Harper's Bazaar recognized her for having one of \\"The 15 Most Iconic TV Wardrobes\\". BuzzFeed ranked Denise the most fashionable television character of the 1990s, crowning her the \\"undisputed style icon of the '80s and '90s\\". StyleCaster ranked Denise eighth on their countdown of \\"The 50 Most Stylish TV Characters Of All Time\\", writing, \\"Few TV characters have been as fearless when it comes to fashion as The Cosby Show's Denise Huxtable ... we'll forver (sic) be in awe of Denise's style.\\" HelloGiggles placed Denise at number four on the website's ranking of \\"17 TV Moms We Would Totally Borrow Clothes From\\"; author Sophia Elias declared, \\"Denise Huxtable may very well go down as one of the most stylish characters in television history\\" and \\"boho-chic executed to perfection.\\" Marie Claire included Denise at number six on their \\"15 Female TV Characters That Have Incredible Hair\\" ranking. HelloGiggles featured her among \\"The Best Beauty Looks From Your Fave '90s Characters\\", with author Farah Prince dubbing her the \\"one person from the ‘90s I wanted to emulate the most\\" while complimenting praising her sparse use of makeup. Refinery29 crowned Denise one of their \\"favorite '80s fashion heroes\\", calling her a constant source of \\"inspiration (and hairspiration).\\" Glamour ranked Bonet among the best style icons of the decade, describing her as \\"he most beautiful and wholesome girl on TV\\" at the time. Sherri Williams of The Washington Post described both Denise and Bonet as \\"an it-girl of the 1980s whose unique style and independence endeared audiences.\\" According to Nick Slay of The Source, Denise established herself as a \\"pop culture icon\\". AfterEllen.com's Erin Faith Wilson called Denise one of her favorite television crushes from the 1980s and 1990s. Refinery29 featured Denise in an article recognizing \\"TV Sisters We Always Wanted In Our Family\\". HelloGiggles ranked Denise first on its ranking of \\"10 TV Characters Who Would Make Awesome Big Sisters\\", calling her \\"magnetic to watch\\" due to her free-spirited personality and sense of fashion. The Washington Post recognized Denise as a template for \\"How TV handles beloved characters going off to college\\", which Uproxx's Alan Sepinwall described as \\"Tak[ing] the most popular/exciting/funny character who’s not the lead, and trust that they can carry a new show on their own\\". College Magazine ranked Denise the fifth best fictional college student. Denise's \\"replacement\\" Pam was not particularly well-received by fans after she was written out of the series. StyleBlazer included Denise in an article recognizing \\"7 Replaced Classic TV Characters We Never Got Over\\", writing, \\"Dont (sic) get us wrong, Pam was comedy, but we never stopped missing Denise.\\" In 2012, clothing company Urban Outfitters created a clothing line inspired by Denise entitled \\"A Different World\\", describing it as \\"a nod to the coolest older sister ever\\". Business Insider criticized the organization for hiring a white model Dana Boulos to promote the clothing line, arguing \\"that most Urban customers wouldn't even know who Denise is.\\" Denise has served as a blueprint for and inspired a generation of young, middle-class female television characters attending college. According to Soraya Nadia McDonald of The Undefeated, \\"Girls modeled on Denise are smart, but their intellect isn’t necessarily reflected in their grades. They’re sheltered, and they move through college under ideal, manageable circumstances. And they’re presented as typical, pleasant girls who should be completely relatable for white America.\\" In 2018, a spin-off of the sitcom Black-ish premiered. Entitled Grown-ish, the spin-off revolves around one of the show's characters Zoey (Yara Shahidi) leaving home and attending college; the spin-off's college-related storyline and main character have drawn extensive comparisons to Denise, with both series initially \\"focus[ing] on the college experience of the oldest daughter in a middle-class black family.\\" A. Bottinick of TV Insider identified both characters' pursuit of higher education and African American heritage among their similarities, dubbing them both \\"the teen style icons of their time and—quite surprisingly, considering their shows take place years apart—have donned quite a few of the same looks.\\" The York Dispatch's Rick Bentley anticipated that Zoey would be successful because she is imbued with \\"the same kind of sweetness that was written into Bonet’s character so many years ago.\\" The Glow Up contributor S. D. Chrismon believes it is unfair to compare Zoey to her predecessor \\"any more than Black-ish really compares to The Cosby Show\\", despite both characters' similarities that include fashion and wit.

The argument is used to argue for the knowledge by presence. Background It has been said that Avicenna wrote the argument while imprisoned in the castle of Fardajan, in the Iranian province of Hamadan. He reached the conclusion that the soul is immaterial and substantial. He also claimed that all humans cannot deny their own consciousness and awareness. According to Avicenna, the floating man could attain the concept of being without any sense experience. Concept The floating man argument is concerned with one who falls freely in the air. This subject knows himself, but not through any sense perception data. Floating or suspending refers to a state in which the subject thinks on the basis of his own reflection without any assistance from sense perception or any material body. This mind flutters over the abyss of eternity. Premises of the argument According to Avicenna, we cannot deny the consciousness of the self. His argument is as follows: This argument relies on an introspective thought experiment. We have to suppose a man who accidentally comes into existence fully developed and formed, but he does not have any relation with sensory experience of the world or of his own body. There is no physical contact with the external world at all. According to Avicenna, this subject is, nonetheless, necessarily conscious of himself. In other words, such a being possesses the awareness of his own existence. He thereby believes that the soul has an unmediated and reflexive knowledge of its own existence. Thus appealing to self-consciousness, Avicenna tries to prove the existence of soul, or Nafs. This argument is not supported by the concept of substance in metaphysics. This experiential field shows that the self is not consequently a substance and thereby there is no subjectivity. On the other hand some scholars like Wisnovsky believe that the flying man argument proved the substantiality of the soul.Wisnovsky in Ibn Sina believes that innate awareness is completely independent of sensory experience.  Floating man and Descartes's Cogito  Before the French philosopher Descartes (1596-1650) pointed out the existence of the conscious self as a turning point in epistemology, using the phrase \\"Cogito ergo sum,\\" the 11th century Iranian philosopher Avicenna had referred to the existence of consciousness in the flying man argument. Thus, long before Descartes, Avicenna had established an argument for the existence of knowledge by presence without any need for the existence of the body. There are two stances on the relationship between the arguments of Avicenna and Descartes. Some scholars believe that there are apparent similarities between the floating man and Descartes' cogito. Others consider these similarities trivial and superficial.Wisnovsky in Both Avicenna and Descartes believed that the soul and self are something other than sense data. Also, Avicenna believed that there is no relation logically between the self and the body. In other words, there is no logical dependency between them.  Criticism  Adamson thinks that the weakness in the argument is that, even if the flying man would be self-aware, the thought experiment does not prove that the soul is something distinct from the body. One could argue that self-awareness is seated in the mind. In this case, in being self- aware the flying man is only aware because of his mind that is doing the experiencing, not because of a distinct soul. He just does not realize that the self-awareness is a property of his nervous system.

Whereas the former is a necessary component of any society, being the organization through which that society meets its physical wants, i.e. reproduces itself, the latter is a modern institution that is neither autonomous nor stable. The fallacy can occur either by narrowing the genus \\"economic\\" to merely market phenomena, or overextending \\"the market\\" to encompass all aspects of human economic activity. These moves can be seen as equating the conceptual content of \\"economics\\" with what is in fact mere form or ideology, instead of with the substance embodied by the specific decisive relations in which humans are engaged in any given period and locale. Polanyi considered the roots of this fallacy to lie in a particularly pervasive form of subjectivity specific to the conditions of life in nineteenth century industrial economies, describing it as the \\"central illusion of an age\\". Contemporary scholars support the enduring prevalence of the fallacy, which is further explained by Polanyi's analysis of its entrenchment in various institutions. Polanyi developed the concept over time, devoting the first chapter of his posthumously-published book The Livelihood of Man to the subject.The Economistic Fallacy. Karl Polanyi. Review (Fernand Braudel Center) Vol. 1, No. 1 (Summer, 1977), pp. 9-18 It elaborates on his concept of embeddedness, that humans are social creatures and that economic activity takes place in, and because of, social contexts. The economistic fallacy is used to criticize both Marxist economics and classical liberalism, focusing on their assumptions built on materialism and rationality. The economistic fallacy is also used to reject the tendency of Marxists and classical liberals alike to separate economics from other fields of human life and study and to reduce those aspects and fields to mere aspects of economics.Somers, M.

Critique of commodification For Polanyi, the effort by classical and neoclassical economics to make society subject to the free market was a utopian project and, as Polanyi scholars Fred Block and Margaret Somers claim, \\"When these public goods and social necessities (what Polanyi calls \\"fictitious commodities\\") are treated as if they are commodities produced for sale on the market, rather than protected rights, our social world is endangered and major crises will ensue.\\" Polanyi's insight follows the Marxian notions of \\"commodification\\" and \\"Commodity fetishism.\\" Fetishism in anthropology refers to the primitive belief that godly powers can inhere in inanimate things, e.g., in totems. Marx uses this concept to describe \\"commodity fetishism.\\" For Marx, \\"a commodity appears at first sight an extremely obvious, trivial thing. But its analysis brings out that it is a very strange thing, abounding in metaphysical subtleties and theological niceties.\\" And what is a social relation between people, between \\"capitalists\\" and \\"exploited laborers,\\" instead assumes \\"the fantastic form of a relation between things.\\" David Bollier wrote that, according to Polanyi, \\"prior to the rise of the market as an ordering principle for society, politics, religion and social norms were the prevailing forces of governance. Land, labor and money itself were not regarded chiefly as commodities to be bought and sold. They were embedded in social relationships, and subject to the moral consideration, religious beliefs and community management.\\" As Polanyi points out, these are actually “fictitious commodities” in the sense that they are not truly discrete “products.” Land and human beings have their own sovereign dynamics apart from their treatment as market commodities.

Folta is a professor and chairman of the horticultural sciences department at the University of Florida. From 2007 to 2010 he helped lead the project to sequence the strawberry genome, and continues to research photomorphogenesis in plants and compounds responsible for flavor in strawberries. Folta has been active as a science communicator since 2002, especially relating to biotechnology. He has faced controversy over what his critics say are his industry connections. In 2017 he was elected as a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry.  Education and career  Folta received his B.S. and M.S. in biology in 1989 and 1992, respectively, from Northern Illinois University, and his Ph.D. from the University of Illinois at Chicago in molecular biology in 1998. He completed postdoctoral research at the University of Wisconsin, and joined the faculty of the horticulture department at the University of Florida in 2002. He assumed the role of Interim Department Chair in 2012 and became the Chair in 2013. =Awards and honors= *Borlaug CAST Communication Award, 2016 *Northern Illinois University LA&S; Golden Alumni Award (top 50 distinguished graduates), 2009 *National Science Foundation Young Faculty CAREER Award, 2008 *Howard Hughes Medical Institute Distinguished Mentor of Undergraduate Research, 2007 *Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, a program of the Center for Inquiry: Fellow, 2017  Research  Folta's laboratory has two primary research areas: controlling plant traits using light, and using genomics to identify molecular markers for key fruit-plant traits. = Plants and light = Folta's work with light began in 1987, while working with genes associated with the phytochrome response in plants. This research resulted in the discovery that exposure to blue light mediates specific gene responses and physiology in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana through cryptochrome and phototropin receptors. Since then, Folta has continued this work to explore new findings in how plants grow and move in green-enriched environments, which are the challenging conditions in which plants have to grow while under the shade of other plants, and the unusual effects this produces. His work in plant biology would later extend to using light emitting diodes (LEDs) to control specific attributes of plants, such as quality, flavor, aroma, nutrition, and texture. On this, Folta says that each plant's genetic makeup gives it a certain genetic potential that can be altered by selection or genetic modification, but how this potential is reached depends on environmental conditions that can be manipulated through photomorphogenesis. He says this depends entirely on how genes that are responsible for controlling the plant's growth are activated or deactivated in response to light. Folta believes this research would be of interest to farmers wanting to get the most genetic potential out of their crops without the need for chemicals or genetic modification, and he believes his research involving red and far-red light could be used on postharvest fruits to improve their flavor while stored in grocery stores and home refrigerators. = Strawberry genomics and flavors = Folta's work in strawberry genomics began in 2002. Folta was the contributing author in sequencing the strawberry genome in 2011. During the project, they discovered molecular markers that speed traditional breeding for enhanced flavors. Folta's more recent work with strawberries has involved identifying the compounds responsible for taste that are present in different varieties of the fruit in order to breed these characteristics back into commercial varieties; characteristics which have been lost over time due to strawberries having been bred, traditionally, to select for disease resistance, firmness, size, and yield instead of flavor. As a result of this research, his team has identified 30 compounds present in strawberries that affect its flavor, including some that resemble other fruits such as grapes and pineapples, and 6 associated with a human's perception of sweetness. These findings can also be used for other staple plants in the rose family such as peaches, almonds, apples, raspberries, and blackberries, and contribute to a growing list of compounds that can be used in the future to produce more flavorful foods without using as much sugar. Folta's research can be used to produce more flavorful and aromatic strawberries using conventional breeding techniques, without the use of genetic modification.  Science communication  The Amaz!ng Meeting 8 in 2010 Folta has formal training in communication and has been recognized for his skill by scholarly institutions. He uses his experience to provide workshops to teach scientists and farmers how to communicate science effectively, and engages with the public through outreach programs, the internet, and other means. Nature Biotechnology described Folta as \\"a gifted communicator—one of the rare scientists who has engaged the public, with over 12 years experience behind him. Not someone who merely discusses public engagement; but someone who actually communicates directly with non-expert audiences—at science fairs, in schools, at retirement homes, in blogs and podcasts.\\" In 2016, Folta was awarded the Borlaug CAST Communication Award by the Council for Agricultural Science and Technology (CAST), named after fellow agricultural biologist and 1970 Nobel Peace Prize winner Norman Borlaug. CAST cited Folta's ability to focus on \\"clear, credible information\\" and his use of multiple venues to engage the public, in addition to his communication workshops for scientists and farmers. Julie Borlaug, daughter of Norman Borlaug, added, \\"[Folta] has not shied away from controversial subjects and has often been the number one target of the anti- science movement on behalf of all of us who support biotechnology.\\" Writing about the award in The Des Moines Register, Jack Payne, University of Florida's senior vice president for agriculture and natural resources and leader of the Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, praised Folta for his dedication to science communication and willingness to speak to all audiences about food biotechnology. Payne wrote that Folta \\"wants to replace fear with fact\\" to counteract misinformation about biotechnology and its use in food production. Folta has considered his outreach efforts among his proudest achievements, and stated that his most important contributions to science \\"won't come out of my lab. They'll come out of my mouth.\\" = Views = Folta has been active in the public discussion of politically controversial topics such as evolution, climate change, vaccines, and agricultural biotechnology since 2002.Other sources:  He views a disconnect between science and the public's understanding, and believes a priority should be given to increase public awareness and \\"give scientists the tools to effectively participate at that interface.\\" He believes that communication between scientists and the public is increasingly important: \\"In 2050, we will look back at this age as a time when our command of biology changed. From being able to manipulate viruses to attack cancer, to precision- change genetic information in a cell, to tweaking a gene and making a crop immune to a disease—breakthroughs like this are real and gaining momentum.\\" He has compared the scientific consensus regarding the safety of genetically modified foods to those regarding global warming and vaccines. He is an outspoken critic of food blogger Vani Hari's claims about the alleged dangers of certain food additives that regulators generally recognize as safe. Folta advocates for a \\"soft and effective\\" approach in handling anti-GMO activists, believing overly inflammatory responses from the scientific community will alienate the public audience. Folta regards the term \\"GMO\\" as imprecise and not as descriptive as the term \\"genetic engineering\\". His supportive view is also expressed in an interview at CSICon made by Jonathan Jarry, recalling Kevin Folta's recent visit to Uganda where he saw Ugandan scientists using genetic engineering to solve a food crisis, although initially being denied the use of this technology. As an example of the importance of public education, Folta says of the changes in crop technology: \\"Gene editing is this method of changing a single base (or maybe a few bases) of targeted DNA in an amazingly precise way. And unlike the old methods of genetic engineering that left some of the hardware of the process in the cell, the new methods can yield tiny alterations that solve a problem with a precision change. While scientists celebrate the technology and see it as a way to precision-breed new plants and animals, activists call it the most 'dangerous and insidious form of screwing with nature known to man'.\\" =Podcasting= Folta operates the Talking Biotech podcast which is billed as \\"A science-based assessment of new technology and the future of food\\", in which he interviews agriculture scientists and experts in the fields of science and communication to discuss the genetic improvement of plants, animals, and microbes and other issues in biotechnology. He has also created the Science Power Hour podcast, which is a parody of an AM talk radio show hosted by Folta's alter ego \\"Vern Blazek\\". Folta describes the show as an attempt to deliver science communication in an entertaining way that would appeal to a more general audience, and as a way to convey serious topics using humor. Kevin Folta has been a guest on numerous other podcasts such as Talk Nerdy, Heartland Daily Podcast, Food and Farm, Science for the People, Vegan Chicago, The Joe Rogan Experience, and The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe.  Conflict of interest allegations  In February 2015, US Right to Know (USRTK), an Oakland, California-based group whose sole major funder is the Organic Consumers Association, filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the University of Florida as part of a campaign targeting the emails of public scientists who have spoken out in favor of biotechnology. USRTK was concerned that scientists such as Folta may have been pressured by food and agricultural companies into claiming that GMOs are safe. The university released documents which indicated that Folta had not committed any scientific misconduct. Folta told Science that he was willing to comply, but was concerned with how USRTK would use the information and how his emails could be taken out of context and used to \\"smear\\" him. In a Nature article from August 2015 Keith Kloor wrote that Folta had \\"close ties to Monsanto and other biotechnology interests\\". Folta denied these claims, and wrote that the accusation was based on a few dozen emails, three professional direct interactions over thirteen years, and a reimbursement of customary travel expenses by Monsanto for $719.76, covering airfare, a rental car, 2 hotel nights, and parking for one event to speak to farmers in Colorado in September 2014. Folta has maintained that he has always communicated information consistently according to his research and understanding as a scientist working for a public institution. In September 2015, Eric Lipton writing for the New York Times reported that the agriculture industry had enlisted academics, including Folta, to use their \\"independent voices\\" to advocate for public perception and policy, which appeared favorable to the industry. He reported that the University of Florida had received a $25,000 grant from Monsanto to be used at the university's discretion which was earmarked for an established biotechnology communication program. Folta submitted expense reports to use the biotechnology communication fund to pay for travel expenses, a small projector, coffee and food. Most of these expenses had since been reimbursed to the fund with honoraria from his talks and private donations from individuals and small businesses, while none of the donation from Monsanto was used. In response to the controversy and personal threats against Folta and his family, the university offered to return the donation, which Monsanto refused; instead, funds were redirected to a university food pantry. Folta has promised a complete accounting for his research and extension activities, which he says \\"defines a new standard of transparency and a new tool to cultivate trust\\" he hopes other scientists and advocates will adopt. In October 2015, Nature Biotechnology wrote that scientists like Folta have been \\"targeted because they speak inconvenient truths about GM technology\\" and stated that the funds \\"were tied neither to [Folta] directly nor to his research. His conflict of interest disclosures were wholly compliant with his university's rules. He never used industry funds for personal gain.\\" The journal criticized the journalists for \\"cherry- picking\\" and creating \\"hostile environments [for scientists] that threaten vibrant rare species with extinction.\\" Many experts were highly critical of the move by USRTK. Jack Payne, head of the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, characterized this as an example of activist groups attempting to silence scientists who wish to engage in public discussion of politically controversial topics, describing it as a \\"spiral of silence\\". Gretchen Goldman, writing for the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), a nonprofit science advocacy organization, criticized the FOIA requests for being \\"overly wide\\", saying it would create \\"chilling effects on researchers and confuse the public about the state of the science.\\" Nina Fedoroff, Peter Raven, and Phillip Sharp, three former presidents of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, wrote in The Guardian comparing the USRTK's use of FOIA against scientists to \\"Climategate\\" and criticized the organization backing them for \\"promoting the interests of the organic food business\\", calling their activities \\"anti-science\\". Ralph Nader expressed support for the use of FOIA requests on scientists, calling them \\"appropriate subjects\\". Professor and science communicator Steven Novella wrote that \\"The shill witch hunt is just getting started, and now they are emboldened by the PR bonanza they have found in FOIA requests for e-mails. All of this is likely to have a chilling effect on scientists speaking out in the public square on controversial issues.\\" In 2018, Folta sued The New York Times for defamation, following the Times' coverage of Folta's connections to agriculture companies. Folta's lawsuit was dismissed by the court in 2019. Personal life He trained and competed in karate for many years, and he won a bronze medal in kumite (sparring) at the 2012 USA National Karate-do Federation national tournament (over 45 Masters division).

Private life MacKenzie was born in 1992 and grew up in the Waihopai Valley. Her parents are Aiden and Alison MacKenzie, and she has a brother and a sister. She attended Marlborough Girls' College in Blenheim and being from a remote farm, she hasn't lived at home since age 13, but has either lived in flats or for board. She is and continues to be a member of the Wairau Rowing Club, despite having moved to Cambridge in 2012 to train at the national rowing centre. MacKenzie is gluten-intolerant and for that reason, much of her food is homemade rather than bought. She promotes healthy food recipes through a website that she runs with her friend from school, Megan Craig, a squash champion. Rowing career At the 2012 World Rowing U23 Championships in Trakai, Lithuania, she won a bronze medal in the U23 lightweight women's double sculls with Georgia Hammond. At the 2013 World Rowing U23 Championships in Linz, Austria, she won another bronze medal in the same boat class, this time partnered with Lisa Owen. At the 2014 World Rowing U23 Championships in Varese, Italy, she became U23 world champion in this boat class with Zoe McBride. A week before the U23 world championships, she was told that she would row at elite level at the 2014 World Rowing Championships in Amsterdam, Netherlands, with Julia Edward. Lucy Strack, Edward's previous partner, had missed selection in 2014. MacKenzie and Edward had five weeks of training together before the world championships, and they became world champions in the lightweight women's double sculls in August 2014.

By the fall of 2018, Canadaland featured podcasts on the media, art and culture, cooking, medicine, and politics; among these are Commons, launched in 2015, and Oppo, launched in 2018. Canadaland has been funded partly through advertisements, and since 2014, through the crowdfunding site, Patreon. In October 2018, Canadaland featured a five part podcast called Thunder Bay narrated by Anishinaabe comedian, and writer, Ryan McMahon. Canadaland network Canadaland podcast was launched in the fall of 2013. By 2015, it had become a \\"podcast network and a news organization with staff\\". The original Canadaland podcast covered predominantly Canadian media and media criticism. By September 2018, the Canadaland podcast network also included Commons, a politics podcast Imposter, an art and art criticism podcast; Oppo, a politics podcast; Taste Buds, a food and food critic podcast; and Wag the Doug, an ad-hoc, irregularly scheduled podcast about Ontario Premier Doug Ford. =Commons= In 2015, Commons was launched as a \\"politics show for people who have been neglected by legacy media\\" with \\"activist and journalist\\" Desmond Cole and Andray Domise as hosts. According to a 2015 article by Jonathan Goldsbie, at a meeting held as part of a province-wide public consultation on carding, Cole confronted then-Toronto police chief Mark Saunders on \\"whether he ha[d] data to back up his assertions about [its] usefulness\\". In the same article, Domise described an incident that took place when he was fifteen. After being stopped by police who asked if he was carrying weed in his backpack, he ended up \\"cuffed, on the ground, while the officers dumped out the contents of my backpack. In front of my peers at school.\\" In 2015, Elizabeth May appeared as a guest on The Commons. On their December 16 podcast, Cole interviewed three family members of missing and murdered Indigenous women (MMIW). In 2015, over 12,000 listeners downloaded the show weekly. In 2016, the most downloaded episodes of the Commons were \\"Legal Weed is Bad for Poor People\\", \\"Don't Let Harper Happen Here: Wab Kinew on Entering Politics\\", \\"White Men Gotta Speak on This\\", \\"The Government Finally Admitted They Illegally Spy On Us and Nobody Cares\\", \\"Drunk on Liberal Power\\", and \\"Kellie Leitch on Anti-Canadian Values.\\" Now hosted by Arshy Mann, the focus of The Commons will be on corruption in Canada in the 2018-2019 season. =The Imposter= Canadaland's art and art criticism show, The Imposter was launched in 2016. In their first year, the most downloaded episodes were \\"Brushes With Drake\\", \\"Spoiler Alert\\", \\"Degrassiland\\", \\"Tanya Tagaq is Unreconciled\\", and \\"Sex Canoe\\". Artist, Aliya Pabani, is the show's host and producer. =OPPO= OPPO, a politics podcast, was launched on February 6, 2018 with journalists Jen Gerson and Justin Ling as co-hosts, presenting opposing views on various politic-related topics. The producer is David Crosbie. =DDx= By March 2018, Canadaland Media's DDx, a new medical show, which was the \\"first program from Canadaland's new branded podcast unit, Earshot, ranked as \\"one of the top medical podcasts in iTunes’ Canadian and U.S. rankings\\". =Cool Mules= The investigative six-part series Cool Mules, topped itunes most popular podcast charts for several weeks. It tells the story of former VICE Canada Media editor, Yaroslav Pastukhov (aka Slava Pastuk), who abused his authority to manipulate interns, young journalists and a model into smuggling $20 million worth of cocaine to Australia. The series included a series of exclusive interviews with Pastukhov, who ultimately pleaded guilty and was sentenced to nine years in prison. =Thunder Bay= In this five-part 2018 podcast series entitled Thunder Bay , McMahon builds on the meticulous investigation by Toronto Star reporter Tanya Talaga—published in an award-winning 2017 book Seven Fallen Feathers: Racism, Death and Hard Truths in a Northern City. In Seven Fallen Feathers , Talaga described the deaths of seven youths in Thunder Bay, Ontario, revealing shoddy police investigations, and systemic racism, facing Indigenous youth, their families, and communities. Talaga began investigating the deaths in 2011. She wrote, \\"I can't imagine having to send them 500 kilometers away to go to school. I find it incredibly difficult to fathom that we don't have school for Indigenous kids in their communities. This isn't right. I knew I had to write this book. I had to do it.\\" She began the book in 2016, and wrote it in one year. Shortly after Talaga published Seven Fallen Feathers , McMahon pitched the idea of a podcast about Thunder Bay to Brown and they launched a crowd-funding campaign. In the podcast, McMahon opened up the shady nature of the city's authorities. Management and staff Canadaland's staff reporters include Allison Smith, Ryan McMahon, Jaren Kerr, and Jesse Brown, among others. Jesse Brown is the founder, host and publisher. David Crosbie is the producer and host of OPPO and Short Cuts.

Corey Marr is head of business development and ad sales. TK Matunda is a producer of the COMMONS. Ryan McMahon is the host of Thunder Bay. Kevin Sexton is the managing editor of podcasts. Allison Smith is the co-host of Wag the Doug. Canadaland podcast Brown launched his podcast and blog called Canadaland in October 2013. In an article in the Times Colonist, Mike Devlin described Brown as the \\"controversial host of the popular Canadaland podcast and crowdfunded news site.\\" Devlin wrote that Brown was \\"polarizing...mostly because of his irreverent critiques and smart-ass attitude\\" whose \\"media and cultural critiques\\" are handled in a \\"gloves-off manner.\\" According to Devlin, Brown became \\"something of a bad boy in Ontario\\" for attacking Canadian media \\"sacred cows\\" such as The Globe and Mail. In his 2014 article in The Walrus, Brown described how guest journalists were reluctant to appear on the program until his \\"first big scoop\\", less than six months after the podcast was launched. Brown, and Canadaland, by extension, earned \\"credentials\\", and \\"journalistic credibility\\" with stories such as the February 2014 \\"scoop\\" on The National anchor Peter Mansbridge. =Stories covered= Since the fall of 2013, Canadaland \\"has spilled secrets about newsroom misdeeds, broken stories about TV journalists taking money from groups they cover, and challenged reporting that [Jesse Brown] he believe[d] has fallen short.\\" This included the February 2014 story about Mansbridge, who had been paid $28,000 to speak at a December 2012 Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) event. This raised conflict of interest concerns as Mansbridge had accepted money from an entity with a vested interest in the oil sands issue, a topic Mansbridge regularly reported on from a national platform. The story got picked up on by The Huffington Post, Vice, and reporter Andrew Mitrovica, forcing Mansbridge to address the issue, sparking a lively debate in the Canadian mainstream media outlets. CBC Ombudsman Esther Enkin investigated the issue, concluding there was no problem with Mansbridge taking money to speak before an oil lobby group, though adding that CBC should \\"think about the appearance of getting paid by interest groups who are likely to feature prominently in the news\\".Conflict of Interest Wednesday, March 12, 2014;March 12, 2014CBC Ombudsman;March 12, 2014 Although, Canadaland does not believe that their show was the sole catalyst, by April 2014 CBC announced changes in its rules regarding speaking engagements for its journalists. =Episodes= In 2016, the most downloaded episodes of Canadaland were \\"How To Save Our CBC\\", \\"Notes on the Ghomeshi Trial\\", \\"White Pundits Matter\\", \\"Edmonton Is Weird\\", and \\"Newfoundland Is Screwed.\\" Media response The Globe and Mail's Simon Houpt compared Brown to an \\"action star in a Hollywood blow-'em-up: throwing fireballs and kicking asses\\" but added \\"he has a track record of playing fast and loose with facts\\". In the Toronto Life review of Toronto's most \\"addictive podcasts\\" in 2016, Vibhu Gairola, included Canadaland. Gairola wrote that \\"Unless you’re a journalist, you probably know Canadaland as that podcast that broke the Ghomeshi scandal\\". While Canadaland self-described as a \\"non-sensationalist watchdog and a flag bearer for responsible reporting\\", Brown is known for routinely challeng[ing] and condemn[ing] the big names in Canadian news.\\" Gairola compared Canadaland to \\"earnest whistle-blowing of TVO’s The Agenda With Steve Paikin or HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher. National Post's Christie Blatchford wrote that Canadaland's 2017 fake obituary by \\"Indigenous activist and freelance writer\\" Robert Jago on Canadaland's website, of the Post's founder, former publisher, columnist, and Blatchford's former employer—Conrad Black—was \\"vicious\\", \\"petty and unfunny.\\" Blatchford called it a \\"a cruel and juvenile piece that no newspaper would ever publish, let alone with such relish. It shames the profession.\\" Audience =Viewers and downloads= A year after the podcast was launched, it was attracting about 10,000 listeners every week. By late 2018, Canadaland's five podcasts reached 100,000 weekly listeners. Funding Canadaland has been funded partly through advertisements, and since 2014, through the crowdfunding site, Patreon. Canadaland publishes an annual \\"Transparency Report\\" that details their finances.\\" Their most successful fundraising Patreon campaign, was the 2017-2018 pitch by Ryan McMahon, for Canadaland's investigative podcast, Thunder Bay. McMahon pitched Thunder Bay as the S-Town, of the north, in reference to the popular investigative journalism podcast by producers of Serial about a town in Alabama. By November they had surpassed their \\"funding threshold\\", an unprecedented success. McMahon, was \\"blown away by the support—not just from people across the country, but within Thunder Bay itself.\\" National NewsMedia Council Canadaland is a member of the National NewsMedia Council (NNC), a national independent press council, established in 2015 to improve media transparency and accountability in Canada. The NNC replaced regional press councils in their role of overseeing complaints from the general public regarding Canadian news media. There are over 400 newspapers including major newspapers, such as the Toronto Star, the Globe and Mail, Macleans, Montreal Gazette, Postmedia, the Calgary Herald, the Edmonton Journal, and Sun Media that are members of the Council. The Canadaland Guide to Canada In her review of Jesse Brown's 2017 book The Canadaland Guide to Canada, author Charlotte Gray described Jesse Brown as a \\"crowdfunded media critic and self-described 'public irritant'\\" Gray cited Brown in describing Canada as \\"shapeless, beige haze,\\" that we created and that \\"it's time we grew up and told the truth.\\" Notes  References  External links * Category:Canadian podcasters Category:Internet television channels Category:Podcasting companies ","title":"Canadaland"},{"id":"47731935","text":"Vincenzo De Luca (born 8 May 1949) is an Italian politician, member of the Democratic Party, currently serving as President of the Campania region since 18 June 2015.

In early 2015, Ling became national champion in the lightweight men's single sculls at Lake Ruataniwha, beating Peter Taylor. At the 2015 World Rowing Championships in Aiguebelette, France, with \\"almost textbook-perfect race strategy\\" he won the A final ahead of Rajko Hrvat of Slovenia and Miloš Stanojević of Serbia. At the 2016 Final Olympic Qualification Regatta in Lucerne, Switzerland, Ling was partnered with Toby Cunliffe-Steel in the lightweight men's double sculls. They would have had to be within the first three spots to qualify for the 2016 Summer Olympics, but came sixth and thus missed out. At the 2017 New Zealand rowing nationals at Lake Ruataniwha, he came second to Matthew Dunham in the premier lightweight singles.

Swinnerton was one of the first Englishmen to study at Wittenberg University when he enrolled there in 1526. Later sources claim that he studied at Oxford or Cambridge, but this is unlikely and his contemporary, Bishop John Longland of Lincoln claimed in 1536 that he never attended an English university. By 1531, Swinnerton was back in England, where he was accused of abducting one Eleanor Wakefield, the servant of a wealthy London merchant. According to his own account, he was merely staying with the girl in the house of her uncle, William Wakefield, in Yorkshire.This William Wakefield was a clerk who later became chaplain to Thomas Cranmer. To avoid prosecution, Swinnerton adopted the alias Thomas Roberts and perhaps also John Roberts, as claimed by Bishop John Bale of Ossory, who claimed he was being persecuted by the Catholic lord chancellor, Thomas More. In 1534, in defence of the Act of Supremacy, which broke the English church from Rome, he published two books attacking the Papacy for corruption and for sowing division both within the church and within Europe.Karl Gunther, Reformation Unbound: Protestant Visions of Reform in England, 1525–1590 (Cambridge University Press, 2014), pp. 65–66. Neither was published under his name: A litel treatise ageynste the mutterynge of some papistis in corners was anonymous and A mustre of scismatyke bysshoppes of Rome was released under his alias Thomas Roberts.His use of the alias Thomas Roberts is confirmed in certain Suffolk records, cf. Rex (2004). The former is \\"dull [and] brief\\". He defends the Act of Supremacy by crediting King Henry VIII and his counsellors for having discovered Papal corruption and broken with Rome out of concern for the spiritual welfare of the people. He was influenced by William Tyndale's Obedience of a Christian Man (1528), despite Tyndale's scepticism of the king's motives.Brad C. Pardue, Printing, Power, and Piety: Appeals to the Public during the Early Years of the English Reformation (Brill, 2012), pp. 75–76. In labelling Papal discourse as the \\"mutterings of some papists in corners\\", Swinnerton discredits all speech or writing that lacks royal approval and takes place, so to speak, \\"in blind alleys\\".Pardue (2012), p. 10n45. His Mustre, a \\"far superior\\" work to the Litel treatise, is a preface to his translation of the Gesta Romanae ecclesiae contra Hildebrandum of Cardinal Beno of Santi Martino e Silvestro. Beno was one of the cardinals who abandoned Pope Gregory VII in 1084 in favour of the Antipope Clement III. Swinnerton provides a list of antipopes with commentary intended to refute the doctrine of Papal infallibility. In 1535, Archbishop Thomas Cranmer of Canterbury, under the Ecclesiastical Licences Act 1533, granted Swinnerton a licence to preach anywhere in the kingdom, probably in the expectation that he would promote the royal supremacy he had so ardently defended in print. That same year he attempted unsuccessfully to convert the monks of the London Charterhouse to the Reformation. Between 1535 and 1537 he travelled throughout England spreading evangelical teachings and attacking the Papacy. Conservatives within the church of England, who opposed the doctrines of evangelicalism, raised opposition to his mission in Bedfordshire and Rye, and Bishop Longland complained to Thomas Cromwell, the king's principal secretary, but to no avail. Around 1537 Swinnerton composed a work entitled Tropes and figures of scripture and dedicated it to Cromwell. In it he combined Renaissance humanism and rhetoric with an evangelical application of Scripture to topics like purgatory and monasticism. This humanistic Protestantism is reminiscent of that which took shape around Martin Luther at Wittenberg, but in theological specifics there is evidence that he was being influenced by Swiss Protestantism and the Institutes of the Christian Religion of John Calvin, published in 1536. Although intended for publication, Tropes and figures was never printed and survived only in manuscript form until edited by Richard Rex and published in 1999.Richard Rex (ed.), A Reformation Rhetoric: Thomas Swynnerton's ‘Tropes and Figures of Scripture’ (Cambridge University Press, 1999). Sometime before 1537 Swinnerton received a curacy in the parish of St Mary Elms in Ipswich. He remained there until 1541, having a distinct evangelical effect on the parish. In 1538, the will of the wealthy local merchant Robert Cutler commissioned him to preach three sermons in place of masses in memory of the deceased. He was at some point accused before Bishop William Rugg of Norwich of having a wife in Colchester, perhaps the Eleanor Wakefield he had allegedly \\"abducted\\" or merely \\"stayed with\\" in 1531. Summoned before the diocesan consistory to answer the charge, he never appeared, perhaps through the intervention of Cromwell, who appears to have protected him from Bishop Longland a couple years earlier. In 1541 he was transferred to the vicarage of St Clement's in Sandwich as part of the archbishop of Canterbury's effort to evangelise Kent for the Reformation. In St Clement's, he was presented by the archbishop's nephew, Edmund Cranmer. If indeed he was married to Eleanor Wakefield, whose father was the archbishop's chaplain, it would appear that Swinnerton enjoyed the protection of two of the most powerful men in England: Cranmer and Cromwell. In 1553, when the Catholic Mary I ascended the throne, he left Kent and went into exile at Emden in Germany. There he died the following year.

Fruechte played college football at Rochester Community and Technical College and Minnesota as well as high school in-state at Caledonia. Early years Fruechte is a graduate of Caledonia High School in Caledonia, Minnesota. Under the guidance of his father Carl, who is a legendary football and basketball coach at Caledonia, Isaac played as a wide receiver and safety and helped lead the Warriors to two consecutive state championships (2007, 2008), three section championships and two 3 Rivers Conference titles. He was a two-time Associated Press Honorable Mention All- State selection and a three-time All-3 Rivers conference selection. Following his senior season, he was named to the St. Paul Pioneer Press All-State team. In addition to football, Fruechte was also a standout track and field athlete at Caledonia, earning four straight berths at the state championships. He had a personal-best time of 10.82 seconds in the 100-meter dash and was timed under 4.4 seconds in the 40-yard dash. College career =RCTC= Fruechte had been asked to walk on at the University of Minnesota out of high school, but due to Minnesota's strict admission standards, Isaac's math score in high school wasn't good enough, therefore he opted to enroll at Rochester Community and Technical College in the fall of 2010 instead. Listed at 6-foot-3, 200-pound, Fruechte played his freshman season in 2010 with the Yellowjackets, catching 30 passes for 805 yards and nine touchdowns, helping the team finish with a 10-2 record, beating Central Lakes 34-31 in the state championship game before falling to Iowa Central 32-7 in the North Star Bowl.Fruechte signs with Gophers For his efforts, he was named second-team All-Minnesota Junior and Community College. After graduating from Rochester in December, Fruechte enrolled at Minnesota for the spring semester. =Minnesota= In his first season with the Gophers, Isaac started 9 out of 12 games. He recorded 19 receptions for 256 yards and 2 touchdowns for the run-heavy Minnesota offense. The Gophers improved their record to 6-7 and went to the Texas Bowl, their first bowl game in years. Fruechte was named Minnesota's Wide Receiver of the Year at the Gophers annual football banquet. As a sophomore in 2013, Fruechte started 6 out of 13 games. He recorded 13 receptions for 154 yards in a year where the passing game struggled and the running game flourished. The Gophers improved their record to 8-5, and went back to the Texas Bowl for the second year in a row. During his senior year, Fruechte played in all 13 games and set career-highs in receptions with 18 and receiving yards with 292 yards. As the year went on, his role on the team expanded. He had 3 receptions for 46 yards against Northwestern in Week 6, and a 45-yard catch against Purdue the following week. On October 25 against Illinois, he had a career-game with 3 receptions for 105 yards, including his lone touchdown of the season on a 52-yard pass from quarterback Mitch Leidner. The Gophers went 8-5 again, beating Michigan, Iowa, and Nebraska, to earn a New Years Day bowl game in the Citrus Bowl.Isaac Fruechte's football dreams became reality at the University of Minnesota Statistics { class=wikitable style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! rowspan=2Season !! rowspan=2Team !! colspan=2Games !! colspan=4Receiving !! colspan=4Rushing - !

In addition to recording two officially released singles and several previously unissued demos, they cut a self-titled album, Bohemian Vendetta, released by Mainstream Records in 1968. History Bohemian Vendetta was formed as the Bohemians in 1966 in Long Island, New York. Their original lineup consisted of Arthur Muglia (also known as Brian Cooke) on lead vocals and organ, his cousin Victor Muglia on bass, Randy Pollock on rhythm guitar, Richard Martinez on lead guitar, and Richie Sorrento on drums. Initially the band had a strongly blues-based sound, reminiscent of Pretty Things, and the Shadows of Knight. Under this line-up the band recorded two demo acetate singles in 1966 at Ultrasonic Studios in Hempstead (on Long Island), \\"Irresistible\\" b/w \\"Petrified, Like Stoned\\" (later referred to as \\"Like Stoned\\") and \\"I Don't Go that Way\\" b/w \\"All Kinds of Lows and All Kinds of Highs\\". The band recorded demos of several more songs and released the single \\"Enough\\" b/w \\"Half of the Time\\" on the United Artists label. While the single got a spot on the \\"Rate a Record\\" segment of Dick Clark's American Bandstand, it failed to chart. However, the band's demos came to the attention of Bob Shad's Mainstream Records, a company known for minimal production values and promotion, often releasing albums by unknown bands targeted for the underground FM radio market, and who released the first album by Big Brother and the Holding Company and the first three albums by the Amboy Dukes, Ted Nugent's early band (including their popular hit \\"Journey to the Center of the Mind\\"). From Long Island's Lynbrook, future member Nick Manzi had played in a number of bands in the area, including the Cavaliers. He and Faine Jade had formed the Rustics who recorded \\"Cant' Get you Out of My Heart\\" b/w \\"Look at Me\\" for the Ye Old King Label. After the Rusics broke up Manzi joined the Bohemians, replacing lead guitarist Richard Martinez, who went on the join the Cats Meow, who recorded a few singles for Decca. In 1967 the Bohemians changed their name to Bohemian Vendetta. More personnel changes were to come that year. After Nick Manzi's entry, Randy Pollock switched from guitar to bass, and Chuck Monica replaced Richie Sorrento on drums. Bohemian Vendetta played at venues such as the Action House with such bands as the Vagrants and Vanilla Fudge. Bohemian Vendetta had already recorded demos of most of the songs intended for their album to be released on Mainstream, but Bob Shad insisted that they re-record all of the songs, so they cut new versions in 1968. However, some have noted that the results did not capture the feel of the demos, which were more representative of the band's actual sound. Nearly all of their material was written by the band, but Shad asked them to record the Rolling Stones' \\"Satisfaction\\". Bohemian Vendetta's self- titled album, finally came out in the fall of 1968. The album reflected both psychedelic and R&B; influences an included standout tracks such as \\"Riddles & Fairlytales,\\" \\"Paradox City,\\" \\"I Wanna Touch Your Heart,\\" and \\"Love Can Make Your Mind Go Wild,\\" not to mention renditions of songs previously recorded by other artists, such as \\"Satisfaction,\\" and \\"House of the Rising Sun.\\" However, Mainstream did little to promote the album or its single, \\"Riddles and Fairytales\\" b/w \\"I Wanna Touch Your Heart,\\" resulting in disappointing sales. That year, the band also backed Faine Jade on his Introspection album. In late 1968 Bohemian Vendetta broke up. Over the intervening years since their breakup, Bohmian Vendetta's work has been included on several anthologies. Their song \\"Enough\\" was included on the 1979 Ear-Piercing Punk compilation put out by Greg Shaw's Bomp! Records, then later on Essential Pebbles, Volume 1. \\"All Kinds of Highs\\" has also been reissued on compilations. In 1998 the band's complete work, including their 1968 album and all of their acetates, was released on the Enough anthology.

Background and early career  Conn was the son of Calvagh O'Donnell, ruler of Tyrconnell. Calvagh had positioned his branch of the O'Donnell dynasty, settled at Lifford, as friendlier to Crown interests than that of Hugh mac Manus, who had rendered himself suspicious by his alliance with the rebellious Shane O'Neill. Calvagh had been considered several times for elevation to the peerage as Earl of Tyrconnell, although this was never put into effect. Conn spoke English as well as the Irish language, probably as a result of fosterage under Sir Thomas Cusack.Calendar of the State Papers Relating to Ireland of the Reign(s) of Henry VIII., Edward VI., Mary and Elizabeth; Vol. 1, page 518.

Initially, Conn sought Crown assistance to release his father. But in 1562 Conn allegedly entered into an agreement with Shane by which Conn would consent to the continued imprisonment of his father in exchange for safe possession of his father's estates. However, in May 1564 Conn found himself in Shane's captivity as a result of a failed attempt to oust from Donegal Castle his great uncle, Hugh mac Hugh Dubh Óg, a partisan of his rival, Hugh mac Manus O'Donnell.The Annals of the Four Masters, translation, University College Cork's CELT project,entry M1564.2Calendar of the State Papers Relating to Ireland of the Reign(s) of Henry VIII., Edward VI., Mary and Elizabeth; Vol. 1, page 237.

In early July 1568 Conn raided Armagh town, which at that time was under the authority of the Archbishop of Armagh, whose nomination was controlled by the English Crown.Calendar of the State Papers Relating to Ireland of the Reign(s) of Henry VIII., Edward VI., Mary and Elizabeth; Vol. 1, page 383.

Family and legacy  Many accounts of Conn's family, probably based on the work of 19th century historian John O'Donovan, state that Conn married a daughter of Turlough Luineach O'Neill.John O'Donovan, ed., Annala Rioghachta Eireann, Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland by the Four Masters from the Earliest Period to the Year 1616, 2nd ed. (Hodges, Smith & Co., 1856), Vol. IV page 2384. However, the only accounts citing specific contemporary documents state that Conn married Rose, daughter of Shane O'Neill, sometime after 29 September 1562.Eleanor Knott, trans., The bardic poems of Tadhg Dall Ó hÚigínn, University College Cork, Celt Project p. 1. Rose is specifically mentioned as the daughter of Shane O'Neill, mistress of Lifford Castle and wife of O'Donnell. The date of the poem is unknown, but given Tadhg's own birth year of approximately 1550 and the lengthy course of study required by traditional bards, it is not likely to be much before the birth of Conn's son, Niall Garve (1569–1626). The confusion may arise from Shane's aggressive behavior towards the O'Donnells and a reference to Conn as \\"cousin\\", interpreted wrongly in the broader Elizabethan sense of \\"relative\\", to Turlough Luineach.Calendar of the State Papers Relating to Ireland of the Reign(s) of Henry VIII., Edward VI., Mary and Elizabeth; Vol. 2, page 384. Conn and Turlough most certainly were cousins in the fully modern sense, as Turlough's mother, Rose O'Donnell, was a sister or half-sister of Conn's father, Calvagh. Conn's wife, Rose O'Neill, died in 1585.The Annals of Loch Cé, translated, University College Cork, Celt Project entry 1585.8. Conn had four notable sons Niall Garve, Hugh Boy, Donal and Conn Oge O'Donnell.Morgan p.114 After Conn's death and while these sons were minors, the claim to chieftainship of the O'Donnell clan and lordship over Tyrconnell of this branch of the dynasty was upheld by Hugh \\"mac an Déagánaigh\\" (English: \\"son of the dean\\") O'Gallagher who was presented as a natural son of Calvagh but was probably actually Conn's son-in-law.Darren McGettigan, Red Hugh O'Donnell and the Nine Years War, (Four Courts Press, 2005). All traceable branches of the O'Donnell dynasty which are currently known to have survived the 17th century descend from Conn in the direct male line, although these also descend from his rival Hugh mac Manus through female ancestors.

Beginning February 29, 1928 on NBC, Socony Oil reached radio listeners with a comedy program, Soconyland Sketches, scripted by William Ford Manley and featuring Arthur Allen and Parker Fennelly as rural New Englanders. Socony continued to sponsor the show when it moved to CBS in 1934. In 1935, it became the Socony Sketchbook, with Christopher Morley and the Johnny Green orchestra. In 1931, Socony merged with Vacuum Oil to form Socony-Vacuum.\\"Business & Finance: Socony-Vacuum Corp.\\" Time, 1931-08-10, retrieved on 2009-12-10. In 1933, Socony-Vacuum and Jersey Standard (which had oil production and refineries in Indonesia) merged their interests in the Far East into a 50–50 joint venture. Standard-Vacuum Oil Co., or \\"Stanvac,\\" operated in 50 countries, including New Zealand, China, and the region of East Africa, before it was dissolved in 1962. In 1937 the Standard Vacuum Oil Company of New York helped establish and fund an exploration team to explore for oil in China. They joined with some wealthy Chinese backers who had an oil concession covering several provinces in north-western China, to make an assessment of recent oil discoveries and to possibly join them in the development of oil resources in the region.Marvin Weller (1984), p. 3.

It was nominated for the 2013 Nordic Children's Book Prize.'Játningar mjólkurfernuskálds tilnefndar', RÚV, 6 December 2012, http://www.ruv.is/frett/jatningar-mjolkurfernuskalds-tilnefndar. The title refers to the Icelandic custom of publishing children's poems on the side of milk cartons; the main character of the novel has been published in this way, and it marks her as a goody two-shoes and overachiever.Kolbrún Bergþórsdóttir, 'Saga um að vera maður sjálfur, Morgunblaðið', 24 October 2011, p. 26. Summary The novel is a first-person story of Halla, who is the daughter of a gay male couple, Aðalsteinn and Tryggvi. She is 13, from the affluent Vesturbær district of Reykjavík, doing spectacularly well in her studies, given to wearing pink, and popular among her classmates. However, she is caught in possession of cannabis and expelled from her school and abandoned by her old friends, most prominently her best friend Jenný. Meanwhile, the 2008 Icelandic financial crisis means that her family has to move to her aunt Salóme's house in a working-class district, where Halla starts in a new school. Labelled as a troublemaker at her new school, not least by her maths teacher Björgvinur and the local alpha-female Bára Sif, who bullies Halla and emerges as the book's main antagonist, Halla decides to live up to the label and be a 'vandræðaunglingur' (teenage delinquent). She shaves her head; endeavours to become friends with the Goth Anna Ninja and her friend Alexander Filippus, who, it emerges, suffers from depression; tries to start smoking; and concludes that she will not attend confirmation (a traditional and important rite of passage for Icelandic teenagers). However, Halla's nerdy tendencies are spotted by a popular and academically successful boy, Emil, who tries to convince her to compete on the school team for the TV quiz show Gettu betur. Halla fancies Emil and wants to participate, but is afraid to dilute her new, delinquent identity. As Halla explores her new situation, she starts to understand that she had perhaps been the Bára Sif of her previous school, a realisation which promotes her character development. Anna Ninja introduces Halla to the art of shoplifting in the shopping centre Smáralind, and also to a range of political issues: 'illegal distribution of copyrighted material on the Internet (in favor), the ban on head scarves in schools (opposed), gender quotas (in favor) and stem cell research (in favor)'.'Ólöglegri dreifingu höfundarréttarvarins efnis á netinu (hlynnt), banni við höfuðklútum í skólum (andvíg), kynjakvótum (hlynnt) og stofnfrumurannsóknum (hlynnt)', p. 112. Halla's friendship with Anna Ninja is disrupted when Anna discovers that Halla has been lying about her identity and that she is a milk-carton poet. Emil supports Halla, and she explains to him that she only got involved in selling cannabis because Jenný's elder brother Leifur claimed it would raise money for his baby brother Ármann to receive medical treatment in the USA. Shortly after this, however, she discovers that Leifur has been arrested and was in fact dealing for his own gain. She confesses the story to her parents and in the knowledge that her name has been cleared attempts to return to her former milk-carton poet identity, agreeing to compete in Gettu betur. The school wins, to Halla's delight. Jenný renews her friendship with Halla and looks forward to attending confirmation. But Halla finds that she cannot readily return to her previous identity, and Anna Ninja mocks her for her theologically inconsistent about-turn on attending confirmation. The resolution of the novel comes when Halla discovers that Anna Ninja and Alexander are planning to protest at the general awfulness of the world by throwing paint at politicians. She is at Emil's at the time, and is shortly to be visited by Jenný. Halla realises that this protest is both too vague and too violent to achieve a useful outcome and eventually convinces Anna and Alexander, along with Emil, to come to her house, where they meet Jenný. Halla is thus able to draw together her different friends in a common purpose, distilling her own new sense of self. Halla leads the group in deciding to paint a huge banner to hang on the parliament building in an act of civil disobedience, protesting on themes close to their hearts: Reykjavík's children's hospital, Chad's fourth civil war, child obesity and economically stressed parents' excessive reliance on daycare services, and poor support for children with mental health problems. Early the next morning, the children hang the banner on the building and tip off the press. An epilogue explains that Halla decides not to take confirmation on theological grounds, but attends as an audience member in celebration of her friends' confirmation. It emerges that the banner enjoys international media coverage; provokes parliamentary debates on the situation of children in Iceland and the situation in Chad; and fetches up in the National Gallery of Iceland.

History The original headhouse in 1898layout of Adams Square station An unusual northbound-only station with a unique layout, Adams Square station was opened with the rest of the northern section of the Tremont Street subway on September 3, 1898. Initially designed for streetcars only, the station was retrofitted in 1901 to also handle Main Line Elevated trains, which ran through the subway until the completion of the Washington Street tunnel in 1908. Thereafter the station reverted to exclusive streetcar use. Scollay Square and Adams Square had similar baroque granite headhouses with four-sided clock towers designed by Charles Brigham. Unlike Adams Square, the Scollay Square headhouse had its entrance at one end of the structure. A small exit structure was located to the north, while the Brattle Loop used a separate entrance built into a building at Court Street and Brattle Street. The headhouses of the Tremont Street subway were sharply criticized as \\"pretentiously monumental\\", with the Scollay Square headhouse compared to \\"an enlarged soda fountain\\". Later stations on the East Boston Tunnel and Washington Street tunnel incorporated this criticism into their more modest headhouses. In 1931, the headhouse was removed to improve visibility for automobile drivers and was replaced by a significantly smaller structure of modern design. (Large headhouses at Scollay Square and Harvard were also torn down for similar reasons in that era.) Adams Square was closed on October 28, 1963 as part of the Government Center renewal project, and was subsequently largely demolished and covered during the construction of Boston City Hall.

Career Born in 1964, Brumby turned professional in 1989. His first season brought a run to the last 32 at the 1990 Classic, where he defeated Eric Lawlor 5–4, having trailed 2–4, the declining John Spencer 5–1 and benefited from the withdrawal of his last-64 opponent Jimmy White. His last-32 match against Silvino Francisco was a one-sided affair; Francisco beat Brumby 5–0. In qualifying for that year's World Championship, Brumby defeated two veterans - sixty-five-year-old Bert Demarco and seventy-six-year-old Fred Davis, both 10–6, but was eliminated by Paddy Browne in the last 96 by the same scoreline. The following season was barren, Brumby's only notable performance coming in the 1990 International One-Frame Shoot-out, where he beat Matt Gibson, Ian Black, Steve Meakin and Neal Foulds before losing his quarter-final 'match' 29–69 to Jason Whittaker. Further poor form riddled the early 1990s, but Brumby recorded his first round-of-32 finish at a ranking event in the 1994 International Open; there, opponents included Steve Newbury and Doug Mountjoy, but he exited the tournament with a 1–5 loss to James Wattana. At the end of the 1993/1994 season, Brumby reached his highest ranking of 69th, and the next season heralded another last-32 finish, at the 1994 Grand Prix, where he beat Michael Judge, Nick Fruin, Drew Henry and Mick Price to set up a meeting with Jimmy Michie. In their match, Michie trailed 1–4, but fought back to win 5–4.http://cuetracker.net/Players/Ian- Brumby/1994-1995 At the 1996 European Open, Brumby again progressed to the last 32 but no further; en route to a match against Dave Harold, he had beaten Martin Dziewialtowski, whitewashed Nick Walker, veteran Cliff Thorburn and Jeff Cundy and overcome another Canadian, Alain Robidoux, but Harold was comfortable in defeating him 5–2. By 2000, Brumby had slipped to 103rd in the rankings, and a run in the 2000 Scottish Open - again to the last 32, where Marcus Campbell overcame him 5–3 - brought little relief. He was unable to arrest his slide the following season, and lost his place on tour, ranked 136th, in 2001. Brumby entered qualifying tournaments in the next two years to regain his place, and was successful in his latter attempts. The 2003/2004 season was poor, however, and Brumby again returned to the amateur ranks at its conclusion, aged 39. Further attempts to re-qualify over the following five years did not come to fruition. As an amateur, he entered two Players Tour Championship events during the 2011/2012 season, losing to Ali Carter and Jimmy White respectively, and latterly reached the fourth qualifying round in the 2015 World Seniors Championship, where Rory McLeod beat him 2–0.

Seven polymorphs are known for anhydrous VOPO4, denoted αI, αII, β, γ, δ, ω, and ε. These materials are composed of the vanadyl group (VO) and phosphate (PO43−). They are yellow, diamagnetic solids, although when contaminated with vanadium(IV) derivatives, samples exhibit EPR signals and have bluish cast.

The Raid was carried out by the French Major General Alexandre de Rainier de Droue, Marquis de Boisseleau a French officer serving with James' Irish Army. It was largely unsuccessful and the Jacobite forces withdrew having suffered casualties. Background After capturing Carrickfergus in August 1689 and advancing towards Dublin, the Williamite commander Marshal Schomberg had halted his army at Dundalk Camp during a stand-off with the Jacobite forces defending the capital. In November Schomberg dispersed his forces into winter quarters across Ulster.Childs p.169-79 As soon as Schomberg had withdrawn from Dundalk, the Jacobites issued orders to Boisseleau to lead a force to Newry with the intention of rolling-up the various Williamite garrisons in the area. Boisseleau's force, which consisted of 1,700 infantry accompanied by six troops of cavalry and dragoons left on 23 November and reached the River Clanrye at dawn on 24 November. Colonel Toby Purcell the commander at Newry, had several companies of Sir Henry Ingoldsby infantry regiment as a garrison. Purcell had deployed his troops by sending detachments to various crossings and strongpoints in the area leaving him only sixty troops in Newry itself, twenty of whom were not fit for duty.Childs p.179 Fight Boisseleau sent a hundred men to the ford the Clanrye north of Newry Bridge as a diversion, while two hundred men attacked across Newry Bridge. They managed to kill the first sentry before he could sound the warning, but the second sentry was able to discharge his musket and alert the town. Purcell hastily assembled some of his troops in the market square, assisted by some of the local townsmen. The two Jacobite forces converged at the market square and a brisk fight began. Several of the sick members of the garrison joined in by firing muskets from their windows. The Jacobite soldiers became convinced that they were facing a much larger force than had previously been estimated and began to creep backwards. Although their officers tried to rally them, this quickly turned into a full-blown retreat with many men swimming across the Clanrye River.Childs 179-80 Boisseleau tried to persuade the remainder of his force to advance across the bridge, they refused. Boisseleau was forced to abandon the operation and retreat southwards. He had lost a Lieutenant Colonel and around a dozen killed and wounded, as well as some prisoners. Williamite casualties were slightly less, although they had lost two Captains as they were coming out of their billets during the attack. Although some of the garrison made a half-hearted attempt to pursue the retreating Jacobites, this went no further than Newry Bridge.Childs p.180 Aftermath Following the raid Schomberg took a number of measures to secure Newry. Cavalry were sent to the area, the bridge over the Clanrye was demolished and an artillery battery set up to defend the ford which the Jacobites had used.Childs p.180 Later in November reports were received that the Earl of Antrim's regiment at Dundalk were planning a fresh attack on Newry. Brigadier William Stewart led a Williamite force which defeated Antrim's men in the Moyry Pass, killing thirty and taking seventeen prisoners.Childs p.181 After the Duke of Berwick's defeat at the Battle of Cavan in February 1690, the policy of raids into Ulster was discontinued. The following summer the decisive Williamite victory at the Battle of the Boyne was won. References Bibliography * Childs, John. The Williamite Wars in Ireland. Bloomsbury Publishing, 2007.

It is made out of carved wooden anthropomorphic and then overlaid with metal. It was donated to the Museum in 1979 by the Bambara people. N'tomo masks are used by the Bambara people of West Africa. There are six male initiation societies that young males must pass through before becoming a man. N'tomo Dyo is the first of these through which boys pass before their circumcision. The mask represents the legendary ancestor of the Bambara and it is a symbol of protection. The mask is made of wood and may be covered in shells, seeds or brass. The face maybe more or less abstract, but is always topped by a row of vertical projections. The number of spikes indicates whether the mask is masculine, feminine or androgynous. Three, six or nine are male; four and eight are female; and two, five and seven are androgynous. The mask was also used at agricultural festivities and to prevent illness.  History  Research indicates that the Bambara mask dates back to the early to mid-18th century. It was used for ceremonial purposes. Many rituals such as weddings, births, circumcisions and funerals were performed with these masks. The mask was given offerings and sacrifices and on specific cases were ritually buried when their uses were no longer and their character was lost. The mask is also used in agricultural rituals. The Bambara people are primarily concerned with agriculture, and the fertility of the land. They have a strong connection with the earth and believe the mask will ensure a good harvest and it celebrates an excellent farmer. The Bambara people had six male societies and each society had its own unique mask. One of the societies called ‘jo’ is about initiation, a procedure that every boy had to go through to become a man. This initiation only stopped a few decades ago. At each stage of the procedure or initiation the young man is required to wear a mask. One of the procedures involves the young man going to live in the bush for one week. After this he would return to the village where he would perform in the mask the dances and songs he learnt in the bush and then be given small gifts from spectators. After that, they are ritually bathed which signals the end of their animal life and the beginning of their new life as ‘jo’ children. Another mask depicts the culture as well as the life of the tribe. Without this the tribe believed that chaos would come upon them as their crops wouldn’t grow, and they couldn’t perform weddings or initiations. Today, the mask is still used for the same purposes in the tribe and also has a few extra ones. As well as its preexisting uses it is now used for educational, decorative and display purposes. People can now purchase the masks online. Commercially they can be sold for between $200 and $1,000. People place them in their house as decoration or to represent their love for African culture. They are put in museums for display and educational purposes. People can see them in the museum and learn about the history of the mask, as it depicts the culture and life of the tribe. These masks play a significant role in the culture and spiritual world of the Bambara people. The masks are visually expressive and have high attention to detail. The masks illustrate the craftsmanship of the tribe and how this has been passed on to other generations. The masks allow the traditions of rites and ceremonies of the tribe to continue in some form today. There is clearly a special relationship between the Bambara people and their masks. The masks are more than just art to them; they represent the life of the tribe.

Preliminaries  A person has to decide between two or more options. The decision is based on the attributes of the options. The simplest case is when there is only one attribute, e.g.: money. It is usually assumed that all people prefer more money to less money; hence, the problem in this case is trivial: select the option that gives you more money. In reality, there are two or more attributes. For example, a person has to select between two employment options: option A gives him $12K per month and 20 days of vacation, while option B gives him $15K per month and only 10 days of vacation. The person has to decide between (12K,20) and (15K,10). Different people may have different preferences. Under certain conditions, a person's preferences can be represented by a numeric function. The article ordinal utility describes some properties of such functions and some ways by which they can be calculated. Another consideration that might complicate the decision problem is uncertainty. This complication exists even when there is a single attribute, e.g.: money. For example, option A might be a lottery with 50% chance to win $2, while option B is to win $1 for sure. The person has to decide between the lottery <2:0.5> and the lottery <1:1>. Again, different people may have different preferences. Again, under certain conditions the preferences can be represented by a numeric function. Such functions are called cardinal utility functions. The article Von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem describes some ways by which they can be calculated. The most general situation is that there are both multiple attributes and uncertainty. For example, option A may be a lottery with a 50% chance to win two apples and two bananas, while option B is to win two bananas for sure. The decision is between <(2,2):(0.5,0.5)> and <(2,0):(1,0)>. The preferences here can be represented by cardinal utility functions which take several variables (the attributes). Such functions are the focus of the current article. The goal is to calculate a utility function u(x_1,...,x_n) which represents the person's preferences on lotteries of bundles. I.e, lottery A is preferred over lottery B if and only if the expectation of the function u is higher under A than under B: :E_A[u(x_1,...,x_n)] > E_B[u(x_1,...,x_n)]  Assessing a multi- attribute cardinal utility function  If the number of possible bundles is finite, u can be constructed directly as explained by von Neumann and Morgenstern (VNM): order the bundles from least preferred to most preferred, assign utility 0 to the former and utility 1 to the latter, and assign to each bundle in between a utility equal to the probability of an equivalent lottery. If the number of bundles is infinite, one option is to start by ignoring the randomness, and assess an ordinal utility function v(x_1,...,x_n) which represents the person's utility on sure bundles. I.e, a bundle x is preferred over a bundle y if and only if the function v is higher for x than for y: :v(x_1,...,x_n) > v(y_1,...,y_n) This function, in effect, converts the multi- attribute problem to a single-attribute problem: the attribute is v. Then, VNM can be used to construct the function u. Note that u must be a positive monotone transformation of v. This means that there is a monotonically increasing function r: \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}, such that: :u(x_1,...,x_n) = r(v(x_1,...,x_n)) The problem with this approach is that it is not easy to assess the function r. When assessing a single-attribute cardinal utility function using VNM, we ask questions such as: \\"What probability to win $2 is equivalent to $1?\\". So to assess the function r, we have to ask a question such as: \\"What probability to win 2 units of value is equivalent to 1 value?\\". The latter question is much harder to answer than the former, since it involves \\"value\\", which is an abstract quantity. A possible solution is to calculate n one-dimensional cardinal utility functions - one for each attribute. For example, suppose there are two attributes: apples (x_1) and bananas (x_2), both range between 0 and 99. Using VNM, we can calculate the following 1-dimensional utility functions: * u(x_1,0) \\\\- a cardinal utility on apples when there are no bananas (the southern boundary of the domain); * u(99,x_2) \\\\- a cardinal utility on bananas when apples are at their maximum (the eastern boundary of the domain). Using linear transformations, scale the functions such that they have the same value on (99,0). Then, for every bundle (x_1',x_2'), find an equivalent bundle (a bundle with the same v) which is either of the form (x_1,0) or of the form (99,x_2), and set its utility to the same number. Often, certain independence properties between attributes can be used to make the construction of a utility function easier.  Additive independence  The strongest independence property is called additive independence. Two attributes, 1 and 2, are called additive independent, if the preference between two lotteries (defined as joint probability distributions on the two attributes) depends only on their marginal probability distributions (the marginal PD on attribute 1 and the marginal PD on attribute 2). This means, for example, that the following two lotteries are equivalent: * L: An equal-chance lottery between (x_1,x_2) and (y_1,y_2); * M: An equal- chance lottery between (x_1,y_2) and (y_1,x_2). In both these lotteries, the marginal PD on attribute 1 is 50% for x_1 and 50% for y_1. Similarly, the marginal PD on attribute 2 is 50% for x_2 and 50% for y_2. Hence, if an agent has additive-independent utilities, he must be indifferent between these two lotteries. A fundamental result in utility theory is that, two attributes are additive-independent, if and only if their two-attribute utility function is additive and has the form: ::::u(x_1,x_2)=u_1(x_1) + u_2(x_2) PROOF: \\\\longrightarrow If the attributes are additive-independent, then the lotteries L and M, defined above, are equivalent. This means that their expected utility is the same, i.e.: E_L[u]=E_M[u]. Multiplying by 2 gives: :u(x_1,x_2)+u(y_1,y_2)=u(x_1,y_2)+u(y_1,x_2) This is true for any selection of the x_i and y_i. Assume now that y_1 and y_2 are fixed. Arbitrarily set u(y_1,y_2)=0. Write: u_1(x_1) = u(x_1,y_2) and u_2(x_2) = u(y_1,x_2). The above equation becomes: :u(x_1,x_2) = u_1(x_1)+u_2(x_2) \\\\longleftarrow If the function u is additive, then by the rules of expectation, for every lottery L: :E_L[u(x_1,x_2)] = E_L[u_1(x_1)] + E_L[u_2(x_2)] This expression depends only on the marginal probability distributions of L on the two attributes. This result generalizes to any number of attributes: iff preferences over lotteries on attributes 1,...,n depend only on their marginal probability distributions, then the n-attribute utility function is additive: ::::u(x_1,\\\\dots,x_n) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n{k_i u_i(x_i)} where u and the u_i are normalized to the range [0,1], and the k_i are normalization constants. Much of the work in additive utility theory has been done by Peter C. Fishburn.  Utility independence  A slightly weaker independence property is utility independence. Attribute 1 is utility-independent of attribute 2, if the conditional preferences on lotteries on attribute 1 given a constant value of attribute 2, do not depend on that constant value. This means, for example, that the preference between a lottery <(x_1,x_2):(y_1,x_2)> and a lottery <(x'_1,x_2):(y'_1,x_2)> is the same, regardless of the value of x_2. Note that utility independence (in contrast to additive independence) is not symmetric: it is possible that attribute 1 is utility-independent of attribute 2 and not vice versa. If attribute 1 is utility-independent of attribute 2, then the utility function for every value of attribute 2 is a linear transformation of the utility function for every other value of attribute 2. Hence it can be written as: :u(x_1,x_2)=c_1(x_2)+c_2(x_2)\\\\cdot u(x_1,x_2^0) when x_2^0 is a constant value for attribute 2. Similarly, If attribute 2 is utility-independent of attribute 1: :u(x_1,x_2)=d_1(x_1)+d_2(x_1)\\\\cdot u(x_1^0,x_2) If the attributes are mutually utility independent, then the utility function u has the following multi-linear form: :u(x_1,x_2)=u_1(x_1)+u_2(x_2)+k\\\\cdot u_1(x_1)\\\\cdot u_2(x_2) Where k is a constant which can be positive, negative or 0. * When k=0, the function u is additive and the attributes are additive-independent. * When k eq 0, the utility function is multiplicative, since it can be written as: :[k u(x_1,x_2)+1]=[k u_1(x_1)+1] \\\\cdot [k u_2(x_2)+1] :where each term is a linear transformation k\\\\cdot+1 of a utility function. These results can be generalized to any number of attributes. Given attributes 1,...,n, if any subset of the attributes is utility-independent of its complement, then the n-attribute utility function is multi-linear and has one of the following forms: * Additive, or - * Multiplicative: ::::1 + k u(x_1,\\\\dots,x_n) = \\\\prod_{i=1}^n{1+k k_i u_i(x_i)} where: * The u and the u_i are normalized to the range [0,1]; * The k_i are constants in [0,1]; * k is a constant which is either in (-1,0) or in (0,\\\\infty) (note that the limit when k\\\\to 0 is the additive form).  Comparison of independence concepts  It is useful to compare three different concepts related to independence of attributes: Additive-independence (AI), Utility-independence (UI) and Preference- independence (PI). AI and UI both concern preferences on lotteries and are explained above. PI concerns preferences on sure outcomes and is explained in the article on ordinal utility. Their implication order is as follows: :::AI ⇒ UI ⇒ PI AI is a symmetric relation (if attribute 1 is AI of attribute 2 then attribute 2 is AI of attribute 1), while UI and PI are not. AI implies mutual UI. The opposite is, in general, not true; it is true only if k=0 in the multi-linear formula for UI attributes. But if, in addition to mutual UI, there exist x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2 for which the two lotteries L and M, defined above, are equivalent - then k must be 0, and this means that the preference relation must be AI. UI implies PI. The opposite is, in general, not true. But if: * there are at least 3 essential attributes, and: * all pairs of attributes {1,i} are PI of their complement, and: * attribute 1 is UI of its complement, then all attributes are mutually UI. Moreover, in that case there is a simple relation between the cardinal utility function u representing the preferences on lotteries, and the ordinal utility function v representing the preferences on sure bundles. The function u must have one of the following forms:This idea is attributed to Richard F. Meyer and John W. Pratt. * Additive: u(x_1,...,x_n) = v(x_1,...,x_n) * Multiplicative: u(x_1,...,x_n) = [exp(R\\\\cdot v(x_1,...,x_n))-1]/[exp(R)-1] where R eq 0. PROOF: It is sufficient to prove that u has constant absolute risk aversion with respect to the value v. * The PI assumption with n\\\\geq 3 imply that the value function is additive, i.e.: ::::v(x_1,\\\\dots,x_n)=\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\\\lambda_i v_i(x_i)} * Let x_1, z_1 be two different values for attribute 1. Let y_1 be the certainty- equivalent of the lottery . The UI assumption implies that, for every combination (w_2,\\\\dots,w_n) of values of the other attributes, the following equivalence holds: ::::(y_1,w)\\\\sim<(x_1,w):(z_1,w)> * The two previous statements imply that for every w, the following equivalence holds in the value space: ::::\\\\lambda_1 v_1(y_1) + \\\\sum_{i=2}^n{\\\\lambda_i v_i(w_i)} \\\\sim <\\\\lambda_1 v_1(x_1) + \\\\sum_{i=2}^n{\\\\lambda_i v_i(w_i)} : \\\\lambda_1 v_1(z_1) + \\\\sum_{i=2}^n{\\\\lambda_i v_i(w_i)}> * This implies that, adding any quantity to both sides of a lottery (through the term \\\\sum_{i=2}^n{\\\\lambda_i v_i(w_i)}), increases the certainty-equivalent of the lottery by the same quantity. * The latter fact implies constant risk aversion.

In addition to providing general care to patients, it also operates a number of specialized programs, such as its cancer center. The hospital was founded in 1893 as a four-room hospital. As of 2012, White Plains Hospital treated 170,000 patients annually and is a member of the Montefiore Health System network. The total capacity of the hospital is 292 beds.  History  White Plains Hospital was founded in 1893 before White Plains was incorporated as a city, though after there was an established village of White Plains. The 22 women and 3 men who founded the hospital sought to have medical care that could serve the surrounding community. A four-room building on Chatteron Hill comprised the facilities of the hospital. In its first year of operation, 31 patients were treated. By 1907, the hospital had constructed a new brick building (that was demolished in 1940) in the location of the present-day emergency room. An additional wing was built in 1924, bringing the total bed capacity to 100. Beginning at the 120th anniversary of the founding of White Plains Hospital, a major modernization and expansion project was undertaken. New facilities have been constructed to both increase the medical capabilities of the hospital and renovate its aesthetic qualities. A six-story tower was built that includes private rooms while operating rooms were updated with newer capabilities. Additionally, the hospital constructed a second cardiac catheterization lab and labor, delivery, and maternity units. The cancer center was expanded to double its size as well. White Plains Hospital is Magnet Designated twice over in 2014 and 2016 and has won several awards. Healthgrades Outstanding Patient Experience in 2018. AACN Beacon Award of Excellence 2014 and 2017.

The line runs from Rochester, Pennsylvania to Cleveland, Ohio along a former Pennsylvania Railroad line. Amtrak's Capitol Limited uses the Cleveland Line between Cleveland and Alliance. Both the eastbound and westbound train are scheduled to use the line during midnight and early morning.  Routing  From Rochester, the line travels west following the Ohio River between Beaver, Pennsylvania and Yellow Creek Ohio, where the line turns northwest towards Cleveland. Along the way, the line junctions with the Fort Wayne Line at Alliance, Ohio. At Alliance, most trains are routed off of the Fort Wayne Line, and diverge on to the Cleveland Line to reach the Chicago Line in Cleveland. From Alliance, the line continues northwest, going through locations such as Ravenna, Hudson, and Maple Heights until the line ends and merges with the Chicago Line in downtown Cleveland.  History  The Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad was chartered in 1836, due to public support in building a railroad line between Cleveland and Pittsburgh. Construction of the line was completed in 1852, with additional branch lines to Akron, Ohio and Wheeling, West Virginia. In 1871, the C&P; was leased to the Pennsylvania Railroad for a 99 year lease, thus, giving the PRR access to Cleveland. During the Pennsylvania Railroad years, the line mainly hosted coal and mineral trains from the Ohio River Valley area that were bound for Cleveland. In 1968, the Pennsylvania Railroad merged with long time rival New York Central Railroad, to form Penn Central Transportation Company. The merger essentially failed, which resulted in the Penn Central declaring bankruptcy by 1970. Conrail was created in 1976 to pick up the pieces of several railroads that had fallen into bankruptcy including the Penn Central. By 1981, Conrail was turning into a profitable operation, due in part to the Staggers Rail Act of 1980. Around this time, Conrail began upgrading the former C&P; line between Alliance and Cleveland, as the line was soon to host several trains. Conrail began to remove all of the Chicago-bound train traffic that had previously used the Fort Wayne Line, and rerouted that traffic to the Chicago Line, using the Cleveland Line as the connector line. Upgrading of the line was eventually completed, and Conrail began routing a majority of Chicago bound traffic out of Pittsburgh to the line, to connect with the former New York Central mainline in Cleveland. Ownership of the line was passed on to Norfolk Southern after the Conrail split between CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern in 1999.

The engagement was part of the East Africa Campaign and was the culmination of the Tabora Offensive in which a Belgian force from the Belgian Congo crossed the border and captured the settlement of Kigoma and Tabora (the largest town in the interior of the German colony), pushing the German colonial army back. The victory not only left much of the Ruanda-Urundi territory under Belgian military occupation but gave the Allies control of the important Tanganjikabahn railway.1916-1917 Tabora-Mahenge, The Congo and the war, klm-mra.bePaice, E. (2008). Tip and Run: The Untold Tragedy of the Great War in Africa (Phoenix ed.). London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson. . Prelude East African Campaign, 1916-1917. Within the framework of the neutral Belgian Congo, the Force Publique could only adopt a defensive position. This changed on 15 August 1914 when German ships, stationed on Lake Tanganyika, bombed the port of Mokolobu (south of Uvira) and the Lukuga post a week later. On 24 September the Germans occupied Kwijwi Island, in this way taking control of Lake Kivu.Strachan, H. (2001). The First World War: To Arms. I. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 585. . After the conquest of Ruanda in May 1916 and of Urundi in June by the Belgo- Congolese forces, two columns were formed to take Tabora. In the north, the first column (Brigade Nord) reached Lake Victoria near Mwanza on 30 July, after heavy fighting in the Ussewi region. Early July the second column (Brigade Sud) advanced southwards from Kitega along the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika. On 28 July this column captured the port of Kigoma, terminus of the strategic railway line from Dar Es Salaam passing through Tabora to Kigoma. In early August both columns started their converging marches to Tabora. The smaller British force, commanded by the South-African Brigadier General Charles Crewe, was in a race with the Belgian forces to reach Tabora. The British force dailed and blamed heavy German resistance and severe supply problems. Battle of Tabora The southern brigade commanded by Colonel Frederik Valdemar Olsen advanced to Tabora following the Tanganyika Railway (Tanganjikabahn), which the Germans destroyed as they withdrew to the east.Tucker, Spencer C., ed. (2014). World War I: The Definitive Encyclopedia and Document Collection (2nd ed.). Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO. pp. 1529-1530. . Tabora was an open plain surrounded by hills, which German Maj. Gen. Wahle had used to build his defences. The southern brigade took control of the German railway station at Usoke on 30 August, in response Wahle sent reinforcements from Tabora to Usoke by train. The German Schutztruppen launched the counterattack on Usoke from 2 to 3 September, which was repelled by the Force Publique. On the 7th, General Wahle launched another counterattack on the train station of Usoke, this time a naval gun was mounted on one of the railway wagons. Both sides suffered heavy losses, the train station was bombarded, the Force publique launched an attack, and the Germans were pushed back.Stiénon, C. (1918). La campagne anglo-belge de l'Afrique Orientale Allemande. pp. 197-198. When the last resistance in Usoke (west of Tabora) was broken, the Belgians advanced to reach the German defences of Tabora at Lulanguru on 8 September. The southern brigade led the offensive actions for the next 4 days, closing in on Tabora from the west. Wahle established his main positions at Itaga, north of Tabora. From 10-12 September the northern brigade encountered heavy German resistance in the hills of Itaga, where they suffered considerable casualties.Stiénon, C. (1918). La campagne anglo-belge de l'Afrique Orientale Allemande. pp. 155-157.Delpierre, Georges (2002). \\"Tabora 1916: de la symbolique d'une victoire\\". Belgisch Tijdschrift voor Nieuwste Geschiedenis. p. 358. By this time Wahle's forces were reduced to 1.100 rifles and the desertion of his askari soldiers multiplied. On 16 September the Germans intercepted a letter from Crewe for colonel Molitor (Brigade Nord), which stated that the main offensive from the north was planned for the 19th.Strachan, H. (2001). The First World War: To Arms. I. New York: Oxford University Press. . After heavy fighting, the German army retreated to the southeast, in three columns. The civilian authorities of Tabora surrendered to the troops of the Force Publique on 19 September.WWI in Africa , be14-18.be Aftermath The Belgians liberated around 200 Allied prisoners of war (mainly Belgians and British) and 228 German soldiers were captured. The Force Publique lost 1,300 soldiers. On 3 October, after the Allies had established control of the African Great Lakes region, Lake Force was disbanded. Wahle, in anticipation of an Allied pursuit, was retreating at a rapid pace to Mahenge and found himself in unexplored and uninhabited terrain, with no water and food at his disposal.

She was an Academician of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and is known for her fundamental contributions to the condensed matter spectroscopy. Career Prikhot'ko was accepted to the Leningrad Polytechnical Institute in 1923 and graduated in 1929. Still as a Junior, she started research on spectroscopy under the supervision of Ivan V. Obreimov, and finally earned a PhD in this field under his guidance. In 1930, she moved to the newly established Kharkov Institute of Physics and Technology for working with Obreimov on low-temperature spectroscopy of molecular crystals, a field pioneered by him, in the first in the USSR cryogenic laboratory created by Lev Shubnikov. This research was primary focused on comparing the spectra of vapors and crystals of weakly interacting molecules that at low temperature manifest a number of narrow bands due to the freezing- out the thermal motion of molecules. In this way Obreimov and Prikhot'ko investigated a wide class of inorganic and organic molecular crystals and detected optically low-temperature transitions between their different phases. The principal technical advances were in taking absorption spectra in polarized light and measuring dispersion, including the anomalous dispersion near the absorption lines, at low temperatures. During WWII Prikhot'ko worked in the city of Ufa where a number of Institutions of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences was evacuated. Since 1944 Prikhot'ko worked in Kyiv, in the Institute of Physics, where here husband, a prominent Soviet nuclear physicist Aleksandr Leipunskii, was appointed as a Director. There she established a Division of the Physics of Crystals. The principal discovery of Prikhot'ko was published in her 1944 paperA. Prikhotjko, Absorption Spectra of Crystals at Low Temperatures, J. Physics USSR 8, 257 (1944) based on the experimental data collected still in Kharkov, and in her 1948 follow-up paper.A. F. Prikhot'ko, Izv, AN SSSR Ser. Fiz. 7, 499 (1948) http://ujp.bitp.kiev.ua/files/journals/53/si/53SI18p.pdf She reported the discovery in the absorption spectra of monocrystals of naphthalene two new bands that were polarized along the symmetry axes of the crystal, as distinct from the majority of bands that there present in both components of the spectrum at the same frequencies. Because individual molecules in crystalline naphthalene are tilted with respect to the crystal axes, existence of strongly polarized absorption bands proved unambiguously that electronic excitation is not localized at individual molecules but propagates across the crystal. Prikhot'ko' discovery stimulated development of Davydov' theory of molecular excitons for crystals including several molecules in a unit cell.A. S. Davydov, Theory of Absorption Spectra of Molecular Crystals, Zh. Eksp. Teor. Fiz. 18, 210 (1948) http://ujp.bitp.kiev.ua/files/journals/53/si/53SI14p.pdf While existence of excitons was predicted previously by Yakov Frenkel and afterwards by Gregory Wannier and Nevill Mott, Prikhot'ko' was the first convincing experimental discovery of excitons. The follow-up experiments on low-temperature spectra of benzine crystalsV. L. Broude and A. F. Prikhot'ko, Spectry Pogloshcheniya Monocrystallov Benzola v Polarizovannom Svete, Zh. Eksp. Teor.

Prikhotjko, Spectral Investigations of Benzene Crystals at 20.4 K degrees, Opt.Spektrosk. 2, 317 (1957) confirmed agreement between the theory and experiment. During the following years Prikhot'ko and her collaborators investigated spectra of a number of crystals, and her personal favorite has been crystalline oxygen where electronic excitations combine with magnetic ones. Since 1965 Prikhot'ko served as a Director of the Institute of Physics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. She was awarded a Lenin prize for her scientific achievements and a title of a Hero of Socialist Labor.

Notable artists represented have included Anthony Caro, David Hockney and Leon Kossoff. Juda introduced several Japanese artists to the London art market. Life Anneliese Emily Brauer was born in Kassel in 1914 and she was brought up in Germany. Her father was a chemist and he had bought a building that had belonged to Goethe. Her family were Jewish and they left to escape persecution following her father being arrested in 1933. Juda's grandmother decided to stay and she eventually committed suicide to avoid being deported by the Nazis. Juda's family went to work in Palestine but after three years she left to find her fortune in London. In London she met Paul Juda and his family financed her to study dress design and art at the Reimann School.Philip Carter, 'Juda , Anneliese Emily [Annely] (1914–2006)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Jan 2010 accessed 6 Sept 2015 She married Paul Juda on 15 November 1939 and he was able to arrange for her parents to join them in England. In 1939 the war started and she volunteered to work for the Women’s Royal Voluntary Service delivering food to people who had been bombed out of their homes during the blitz. After the war, in 1949, the couple returned to Germany. The couple separated in 1955 and Juda left her husband and returned to England with her son and two daughters. Juda worked to earn money to feed her three children and she was assisted by Wilma Kuvecke in 1956. Kuvecke had worked for her in Germany and she followed Juda to London where she took a job so that she could be the Juda children's unpaid nanny. =Art= In 1956 Juda found work assisting in the art business and by 1960 she had started the Molton Gallery. The Hamilton Gallery followed from 1963 to 1967, with backing from Nika Hulton. She exhibited American art, including work by Jackson Pollock and British artists such as William Turnbull, Robyn Denny and Gillian Ayres. Her exhibitions were full of abstract pictures that visitors could interpret with the gallery's brochures. In 1968 she opened the first gallery called Annely Juda Fine Arts with the assistance of her son. The gallery educated London about abstract art and her first exhibition was titled the Non-Objective World. The gallery's shows featured artists such as Piet Mondrian and Theo van Doesburg from the De Stijl group of artists. In 1998 Juda was appointed as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire and she took Wilma Kuvecke with her to the ceremony. Kuvecke remained with Juda until she died in London in 2006.

Geography  The chapel is located next to the Stadtpfarrkirche Rapperswil ( away to the west) and next to the Rapperswil Castle ( away to the east). It is situated on the Lindenhof hill's eastern slope named Herrenberg, just west of the Stadtmuseum Rapperswil. The Catholic city cemetery is situated to the north, hence, the chapel is used as cemetery chapel.  History  staircase in the south and crucifixion scene details of the crucifixion scene showing Maria and Magdalena The chapel respectively the ossuary was built around 1253 or earlier when the parish passed from the Busskirch church to the Rapperswil church and accordingly a cemetery was established inside the town walls of the medieval city of Rapperswil. The first chapel was associated to the Rapperswil Castle, but it was built outside of the castle'swalls, as a castle chapel for its inhabitants, probably as the family chapel for the members of the House of Rapperswil, later also for the citizens of Rapperswil. The preceding building of the Liebfrauenkapelle was built as an ossuary around 1220 to 1253. The charnel house was first mentioned as intra cymeterium ecclesia, meaning the church in the cemetery. The present chapel was erected above the ossuary, and latter was rebuilt in our times into a funeral service room. In the second half of the 15th century, the supposedly preceding building (maybe the second one) was mentioned as capellum novam in ceometerio (\\"new cemetery chapel\\"). From the ossuary a staircase led in the overlying interior of the chapel; in turn, the access to the ossuary took place from the south via another staircase. The construction of the new building, presumably the third construction phase of the small church, was initiated by the religious Brotherhood of Our Lady (German: Bruderschaft Unserer Lieben Frau) which was founded in 1489 to probably finance the present Liebfrauenkapelle.  Architecture  interior view towards the small altar upright the mixed Gothic and Art Nouveau interior decorations towards the peal of bells in the west The chapel stands on an approximately high base – that in fact are the foundation walls of the ossuary – as a rectangular single naved church. It measures about x , with an eaves height of about , having an east-facing apse, a small ridge turret with a single bell and a steep gable roof. The late Gothic stone building was built in 1489. The consecration to the Virgin Mary took place on 20 June 1493. The altar was ordained to Mary, the apostles Peter and Paul, Sebastian, Christophorus, Anna and All Saints. On its eastern side, a five- sided closed choir was added in 1675. Two ogival north-facing windos and one south-facing window illuminate the nave, two arched windows illuminate the choir. The interior is decorated with neo-Gothic furniture and, on occasion of the extensive renovation works in 1917, with Art Nouveau paintings. In 1875, just before the adjacent parish church burned down, the sloping terrain had to be refilled for an extension of the cemetery. For this reason, a staircase to the lower part of the churchyard was built on the west side, and the access to the ossuary was made now one level higher than before. After the fire of 1882 some of the epitaphs of the parish church were attached to the outside wall of the chapel. The former ossuary was converted into a storage facility for the funeral service in 1964. The outside decoration of the chapel was renewed in 1978/79. On occasion of the exterior renovation, the grave stones, except one at the entrance, were removed and two epitaphs moved into the former ossuary in the basement of the chapel.

On the cross hung a corpus from the period around 1490, part of the late Gothic decoration of the neighbouring parish church where it found a place in its choir in 1979. The small church is used as the cemetery chapel of the Roman Catholic city cemetery and is popular for weddings.  Interior  In 1916/17 the interior with the small choir was redesigned fundamentally as the then designers sought a \\"stylistic unification\\" with the parish church that had to be renewed in 1885. The original plaster ceiling was replaced by a wooden ceiling according to the Gothic style, as well as the seating and the vault of the choir. Jean Rotenfluh, a native of Rapperswil, carried out the decorations, only the decorative painting, as the angel in the choir arch, have Art Nouveau elements. The semicircular chancel arch is decorated on its side walls with the figure of a guardian angel with child and a statue of Joseph with the infant Jesus. The originally Baroque altar stands today in the Saint Pancras church in Bollingen; it was replaced by a neo-gothic altarpiece whose center is a lovely statue of Our Lady. Due to the liturgical reform in 1979, a simple altar table was added. The original Gothic windows were widened, and the interior designed for the purposes of historicism. Inside the church, the wall paintings from the 17th century were unfortunately removed, and the walls decorated with oil paintings from the late Gothic and the Baroque periods with religious motifs: The wooden relief with Christ on the Mount of Olives by an unknown woodcarver originates around 1530, just as the late-Gothic Crucifixion panel. One painting on the back wall dates from the Baroque and presents Mary as intercessor for the poor souls, the oval image of Aloysius Gonzaga may be a work by the Rapperswil artist Elisa (Louise) Fornaro (1726–1796).

It stars José Luis Manzano and Fernando Guillén. The films centers on the relationship between a Civil guard and his heroin addict son who falls in an escalating life of crime. El Pico 2 is a follow-up to El pico which was more successful.Torres, Diccionario Espasa Cine Español, p. 376 Drugs, delinquency, generational problems and the underworld of heroin are the themes of the two films.D’Lugo, Guide to the Cinema of Spain, p. 86  Plot  Paco, a young drug addict, recently mourning the death of his best friend from a heroin overdose, is unable to overcome his addiction on his own. Withdrawal is too painful for Paco, who is under the watchful eye of his severe but concerned widower father, Evaristo Torrecuadrada, a civil guard commandant. To find a detox treatment for Paco, father and son move to Madrid. They are welcome in the household of Paco's feisty grandmother who lives with her faithful old maid, Adela. Both women naively believe that Paco ailment is diabetes completely unaware of his drug addiction. While Paco begins a methadone treatment with a Chilean doctor, Miguel Caballero, a journalist, investigates the killing of a drug dealer and his wife. An eye witness testimony points out to Paco and his death friend as the killers. Paco is questioned by the police. He confesses to be implicated in the case and he is sent to jail. At his arrival in prison, Paco is beaten up and robbed by his cellmates. A fellow inmate, El Pirri befriends Paco and gives him a new pair of shoes to replace the stolen ones. Pirri introduces Paco to El Lehendakari, a Basque gang member influential in prison. Lehendakari takes Paco under his wing and arranges for Paco and Pirri to move to his cell which Lehendakari already shares with his transsexual lover. Soon, however, Paco begins to shoot heroin in jail with Pirri. El Tejas, a member of a rival gang has also taken an interest in Paco, bullying him. Betty, Paco's former girlfriend, comes to visit him. She forgives Paco for abandoning her with the body of his death friend. Torrecuadrada hires Laureano Alons, a savvy lawyer, to get Paco out of jail. They locate the only witness against Paco, a neighbor of the slayed couple. She claims to have seen Paco leaving the scene of the crime. Laureano pays her a visit intimating, with subtle threats, that she must change her testimony . When the woman returns home, she finds her pet canary death. Afraid, she withdraws her previous testimony implicating Paco. Meanwhile, Lehendakari stabs himself in the abdomen so seriously as to be taken to a hospital from where he plans to escape. Lehakandit's lover fails to follow him using the same ruse and commits suicide while Paco and Pirri were dazed by their heroin consumption. Lehendakari's departure leaves Paco and Pirri without their heroin provision or money. Desperate to get the drugs they crave, Paco visits El Tejas and his gang, but he is robbed and raped by El Tejas and his three friends who swindle Paco out of the little money he had left. When Paco returns without drugs or money and Pirri finds out that Paco has been raped, Pirri confronts El Tejas in a knife fight. Pirri manages to slash Tejas in the face, but they are separated by the guards. At that very moment, Paco is released from jail. Free again, Paco initially returns to his grandmother's household, but moves shortly after with Betty. They begin to live out of her tricks as a prostitute and Paco's dealing pushing drugs. Their crimes escalate as Lehendakari, who has escaped from the hospital, joins the couple. The two men begin to share Betty's apartment and Betty herself. The three friends, in an escalating life of crime, carry out a number of robberies to earn money in and around Madrid. As the trio attacks an armored van, Lehendakari is injured in one shoulder so they flee to an abandoned house in Bilbao. The journalist locates Paco and passes the information to Torrecuadrada who goes in search of his son in order to arrest him. Torrecuadrada confronts the trio alone while the other civil guards wait outside the house. In the ensuing confrontation Torrecuadrada is killed by Lehendakari who tries to escape through a window. Stunned by the death of his father, Paco kills Lehendakari while the civil guards enter to arrest Paco and Betty.

It sells towels, apparel and accessories, and donates a portion of each sale to non-profit marine conservation organizations.  History  Sand Cloud was founded in San Diego in 2014 by Bruno Aschidamini, Steven Ford and Brandon Leibel. The original concept for the brand was to create a pillow towel hybrid that would allow for better naps on the beach. While the original prototype was popular, customers sought out the company's colorful towels, without the attached pillow. In 2014, the three friends quit their corporate jobs to work on Sand Cloud towels full-time, building out the brand, product and mission of marine conservation. They raised $15,000 on Kickstarter and then made their appearance on Shark Tank in 2017, securing a deal with Robert Herjavec for a $200,000 investment in exchange for 15% of the business. To date, the company has done more than $20 million in sales.  Marine Conservation  10% of Sand Cloud's net profits goes toward local non-profit partners including the Marine Conservation Institute, the San Diego Surfrider Foundation, the Pacific Marine Mammal Center, San Diego Coastkeeper, the Hawaii Wildlife Fund, and Ocean Connectors. In 2018, Sand Cloud was honored as Philanthropist of the Year by the Pacific Marine Mammal Center. Sand Cloud's network of 250,000 ambassadors uses social media to spread awareness on issues surrounding marine life and regularly participates in local beach clean-up efforts. The company's mission is hashtagged as #SaveTheFishies to spread awareness socially about issues like ocean plastic pollution and coral reef degradation.  Products  Sand Cloud's signature towels are made from handwoven Turkish cotton. According to Sand Cloud, the material allows the towels to be comfortable lightweight, durable, absorbent and sand resistant.

The estate is 225 hectares of land situated by Lyngbygård River, 4 km. west of Tilst in Aarhus. The manor building was listed by the Danish Heritage Agency on 9 July 1918. The estate is today family owned and much of the surrounding land has been turned into golf courses under Lyngbygaard Golf. The park is open to the public according to an agreement with the owner and Aarhus Municipality.  History  The area is known from the 14th century when the lands is thought to have belonged to the nunnery Ring by Skanderborg Lake. After the reformation in 1536 the lands were confiscated by the crown, like all other church owned property. In 1579 the lands were taken over by the noble woman Anne Skram and a number of small farms on them were merged to form Lyng-bygård (Lit. Ling-townfarm). The following year Anne Skram married Christian Munk and it is believed they were the ones to build the original farm buildings in 1596. The buildings no longer exist, but traces can be found in the form of an arched basement under the western section of the current main building. Over the following century until 1686 ownership of the estate changed a number of times until 1686 when Johan Arentsen Althalt buys it. The estate would stay in the Althalt family until the 19th century. In 1766, Johan Arent Althalt, had the eastern part of the manor house built in 1755. In 1775 his widow had the former main building torn down and the current two-storey half-timbered structure in red brick was constructed in its place. Ownership of the estate has since changed a number of times and many additions and restorations has been made including new stables and barn. The farm has since 1945 been owned by the family which bought it in 1945. It is operated as a modern agricultural operation along with two neighbouring farms.  Architecture  The west building is a well-preserved example of a large half- timbered structure divided between an east building from 1775 and a west building from 1755. The external walls are built of granite boulders and the low and wide barrel vault with groins over the windows are formed by large medieval bricks. Both buildings have wooden cornices, hip roofs, spires and ridge turrets. The east building has a front dormer over the main entrance which is decorated with an architrave. Steep steps lead to the entrance which has wooden pilasters. The interior has much of the original furniture, wing doors, panels and stucco. Many rooms have Dutch doors, with brass mountings. There are iron stoves throughout the building including a Norwegian one with rococo decorations. The kitchen section of the manor house had a four-sided tower built in 1876. The western section of basement is arched and is the oldest remains from the original structures. In the middle of the basement sits a four-sided substructure, which carries the great brick fireplace in the hall.

Distribution Ophrys speculum is spread throughout the Mediterranean region, and is particularly prolific in the Algarve region of Portugal. It becomes more scarce in the east. Other countries in Europe where this orchid is known to occur include Spain, Cyprus and Greece. It occurs up to 1,200 m above sea level. Habitat Mirror orchid is found in stony and rocky places, grassland, scrub and pine forests, on dry to moist calcareous soils, in full sunlight or light shade. Pollination It is pollinated exclusively by the wasp Dasyscolia ciliata. Males are lured by the flower, which resembles the female wasp. The flower and wasp are both hairy and the blue patch on the lip appears to mimic the reflection of the sky on the wasp's wings. Moreover, the floral scent resembles the mating pheromones of the female wasps, and males become highly excited and try to copulate with the flowers, pollinating them in the process. Varieties Ophrys speculum subsp. speculum Ophrys speculum subsp. regis-ferdinandii Ophrys speculum subsp. lusitanica *Ophrys speculum subsp. speculum Link - The plant diffusion is circum-Mediterranean (Morocco and the Iberian Peninsula to Anatolia and Lebanon), characterized by dark petals and a lobe from the lip moderately convex, with marginal brownish hairs. *Ophrys speculum subsp. regis- ferdinandii – The plant is found in the eastern Aegean Islands at elevations of 0 to 800 meters.

Content The PWP projects an increase of 1.6 million people from 2013, or an average of 100,000 more people in Singapore each year. The PWP argued that up to 30,000 new permanent residents and 25,000 naturalized citizens each year are needed to sustain Singapore's population due to the falling birth rates in Singapore. It also justified immigration and presence of foreign workers as helping local businesses thrive and \\"create good jobs for Singaporeans\\".A Sustainable Population for a Dynamic Singapore: Population White Paper, p. 31-32 The PWP also included additional measures to encourage marriage and increase the birth rate. The motion was passed in Parliament to endorse the PWP by 77 votes to 13 (the 13 opponents included all members of the opposition and three nominated MPs), albeit after amendments made to leave out \\"population policy\\" and add focus on infrastructure and transport development.Amended motion on white paper adopted; 6.9 million is not a target. The Straits Times. 9 February 2013. Political reactions Several parties opposing the PWP have taken it to be a targeted increase of Singapore's population to 6.9 million. Citizens reacted to the PWP with shock and anger, and this has led to the largest public protest ever organized in Singapore's history. In an 8 February 2013 speech in support of the White Paper, Prime Minister Lee said that he expected the 2030 population to be \\"significantly below\\" the 6.9 million figure, but that 6 million would not be enough, because of the declining birth rate and the needs of aging people. Criticism Many Singaporeans have attributed the government's population and immigration policy as the cause of overcrowding and falling reliability of its public transportation system, increasing property prices for housing, suppressed wage level, increased competition for jobs (especially for professionals, managers, executives and technicians) and education, increasing income inequality and other social problems. Academics have also criticized the PWP as being \\"overly mechanistic, economically simplistic and astonishingly sociologically and politically naive\\".

He was one of the bishops who abandoned Pope Gregory VII (Hildebrand) in 1084 and consecrated Antipope Clement III, the candidate of Emperor Henry IV, in Rome. He wrote the Gesta Romanae ecclesiae contra Hildebrandum, an account of the alleged misdeeds of Gregory. Nothing is known of his date or place of birth, but since the time of Onofrio Panvinio in the 16th century he has been regarded as a German. He may have been from Lorraine. In his writings he praises Duke Godfrey III of Lower Lorraine and according to Alfonso Chacón, also writing in the 16th century, Pope Stephen IX, who was Godfrey's brother, appointed him cardinal of Santa Sabina. In fact all that is known with certainty is that he was the cardinal-priest of Santi Silvestro e Martino before the pontificate of Gregory VII. On 4 May 1082, Beno participated in a meeting of cardinals that found it was illegal to use church property in the fight against the antipope, declaring that \\"the sacred things of the church are by no means to be expended on a secular army\\" (sacras res ecclesiarum nullatenus in militia saeculari expendendas) but are to be reserved for charitable use. Since earlier that year Pope Gregory had used the property of the church of Canossa against the antipope, the cardinals decision must be regarded as a direct rebuke of the pontiff. Most of these cardinals, including Beno, abandoned the pope two years later. In 1084, when the emperor came to Rome to have Clement enthroned in the Lateran thirteen cardinals, all deacons or priests, agreed to declare Gregory deposed and confirm the election of Clement. On 4 November, Beno and eleven other cardinals (including two bishops recently created by Clement) witnessed Clement grant a privilege to the church of San Marcello al Corso. Prior to the 19th century, the Gesta Romanae ecclesiae contra Hildebrandum (\\"Deeds of the Roman Church Against Hildebrand\\") was widely printed under the misnomer Vita et gesta Hildebrandi (\\"Life and Deeds of Hildebrand\\"). The editio princeps was published either at Cologne (1532?) or Basel (1530×34), certainly before a second edition appeared at Cologne in the Fasciculus rerum expetendarum et fugiendarum of Ortwinus Gratius in 1535. Gesta Romanae is actually the title, found in the manuscript, for the first two letters in a collection of eight written by the anti- Gregorian cardinals. This eight-letter document has the collective title Benonis aliorumque cardinalium scripta (\\"Writings of Beno and the Other Cardinals\\"). The third letter, Contra decreta Hildebrandi (\\"Against Hildebrand's Decrees\\"), was written by the copyist. Beno's two letters are addressed, respectively, to \\"the most revered mother of the holy Roman church\\" (reverentissimae matri sanctae Romanae aecclesiae) and to \\"the venerable fathers of the Roman church\\" (venerandis aecclesiae Romanae patribus), that is, the cardinals. In the first letter, Beno says that at the time of writing he was the archpriest (cardinalium archipresbyter), the head of the cardinal- priests, and that John of Santa Maria in Domnica was then archdeacon, head of the cardinal deacons. This places the writing later than November 1084, at which time Leo of San Lorenzo in Damaso was archpriest and Theodinus archdeacon. In the second letter, Beno explicitly refers to the pontificate of Urban II (1088–99), whom he nicknames \\"Turbanus\\". The anti-Urbanist tract De Albino et Rufino was attributed to Beno on slim evidence by Julius von Pflugk- Harttung in the 19th century. Beno was probably dead by 18 October 1099, when he did not sign a bull issued by Clement in favour of Roman, cardinal-priest of San Marco, and signed by almost the entire college of cardinals loyal to the antipope. His church was next found in the hands of Benedict, a cardinal loyal to Urban. __NOTOC__ Notes References =Citations= =Bibliography= * Category:11th-century cardinals Category:11th-century Roman Catholic clergy Category:11th-century German people ","title":"Beno of Santi Martino e Silvestro"},{"id":"47733606","text":"A Collections Management System (CMS), sometimes called a Collections Information System, is software used by the collections staff of a collecting institution or by individual private collectors and collecting hobbyists or enthusiasts. Collecting institutions are primarily museums and archives and cover a very broad range from huge, international institutions, to very small or niche-specialty institutions such as local historical museums and preservation societies. Secondarily, libraries and galleries are also collecting institutions. Collections Management Systems (CMSs) allow individuals or collecting institutions to organize, control, and manage their collections' objects by “tracking all information related to and about” those objects. In larger institutions, the CMS may be used by collections staff such as registrars, collections managers, and curators to record information such as object locations, provenance, curatorial information, conservation reports, professional appraisals, and exhibition histories. All of this recorded information is then also accessed and used by other institutional departments such as “education, membership, accounting, and administration.\\"Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), MRM5: Museum Registration Methods (5th ed.), p. 161. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums. Though early Collections Management Systems were cataloging databases, essentially digital versions of card catalogs, more recent and advanced systems are being used to improve communication between museum staff and to automate and manage collections-based tasks and workflows. Collections Management Systems are also used to provide access to information about an institution's collections and objects to academic researchers, institutional volunteers, and the public, increasingly through online methods. Development and history of collections management systems Ever since machine-readable standards were developed for libraries in the 1960s, museums have had an interest in utilizing computers to record information about their collections. However, museums have very different needs from libraries; while bibliographic information about a library collection object is usually static, museum records are ever-changing because of the continuous need for new information about museum objects to be added to the records.Carpinone, Elana C. (May 2010), Museum Collection Management Systems: One Size Does NOT Fit All, p. 11. Retrieved 5 December 2015. As early as 1967, the Museum Computer Network (MCN), an informal group of New York museums, attempted to create a collections management database called GRIPHOS, and at a Metropolitan Museum of Art and IBM conference in 1968, speakers discussed current and proposed projects to automate collections management.Sully, Perian (8 July 2006). Inventory, Access, Interpretation: The Evolution of Museum Collection Software. John F. Kennedy University, pp. 23-24. Retrieved 19 November 2015. In an effort to coordinate research into developing these systems, professional associations such as the Museum Data Bank Coordinating Committee (MDBCC), formed in 1972, were created to disseminate information about computers and databases to museums interested implementing computerized collections systems.Sully, Perian (8 July 2006). Inventory, Access, Interpretation: The Evolution of Museum Collection Software. John F. Kennedy University, p. 29. Retrieved 19 November 2015. During the 1980s, Collections Management Systems became more advanced with the rise of relational databases that “[relate] each piece of data to every other piece,\\"Reibel, Daniel B. (2008). Computers. In ‘’Registration Methods for the Small Museum’’ (4th ed.), p. 126. Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press. and during this time some of today's popular systems were originally developed for specific institutions “based on generic relational databases” — such as Gallery Systems' The Museum System for the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Re:discovery Software's Proficio for the Thomas Jefferson Foundation's Monticello — before being released as commercial products.Carpinone, Elana C.

What was once “a simple tool for collections care and inventory” has become “a robust and powerful instrument for saving all information about museum objects,\\" including interpretive material, digital objects, and digital surrogates. Since some Collections Management Systems now incorporate Digital Asset Management and content information storage, many museum professionals have started to use the acronym CMS to stand for “Content Management System.\\"Sully, Perian (8 July 2006).

Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 162. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums. =Flexibility= An efficient CMS, like a good relational database, should not have duplicate records and should not require that the same information be recorded in more than one place in the system. At the same time, the system should be flexible enough to accommodate more data as the collections expand.Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A.

The user must also understand that not all information must be entered into a Collections Management System; for example, complex information such as complicated dimensions and measurements. Some institutions may not want to record confidential information such as private donor information in a CMS and instead keep it in a manual file or a separate, secure digital file, with pointers to the file's location recorded in the CMS.Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 169. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums. However, others argue that such confidential information should be recorded in the CMS to protect the information in the event of a disaster where manual files may be destroyed. =Backup and redundancy= A CMS should have \\"a built in backup and recovery process\\" to protect data against not only equipment failure and disaster but also human error, which may result in loss or corruption of data. Redundant copies of the information should be stored in multiple locations, and the backup process may be automated.Canadian Heritage Information Network (2012). Collections Management Software Criteria Checklist – 2012. Retrieved 14 November 2015 =Data standards= Because a computerized system “demands a much greater degree of precision in the use of language for cataloging and data retrieval than does a manual system,” data and metadata standards should be applied in a Collections Management System.Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 173. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums. Data standards provide rules for how information is entered into the system, and data that has been entered into the system in a consistent manner allows for more accurate and precise information retrieval and for easier exchange of data between different systems.Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 172. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums. The three types of data standards are structure, content, and value: * Data structure standards describe the fields and categories of information (sometimes called elements) that are required to identify an object. In a museum CMS, these fields often include accession number, title/name of object, maker/creator of object, place of creation/origin, date of creation, dimensions, material, and source of object (for example, name of donor or seller).Reibel, Daniel B. (2008). Computers. In ‘’Registration Methods for the Small Museum’’ (4th ed.), p. 122. Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press. Examples of widely used data structure standards used for cultural objects are the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set (DC), Categories for the Description of Works of Art (CDWA), the MARC formats, the element sets of Cataloging of Cultural Objects (CCO), and the VRA (Visual Resources Association) Core Categories.Zeng, Marcia Lei;Qin, Jian. (2008). Chapter 2: Current Standards. In ‘’Metadata’’ (pp.15-32). New York, NY: Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc. * Data content standards provide guidelines for the formatting of information being entered into the fields, “controlling the syntax, style, grammar, and abbreviations” that should be used.Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 172. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums. Examples of data content standards used in institutions that collect cultural objects include Cataloging of Cultural Objects (CCO) and Describing Archives: A Content Standard (DACS). * Data value standards provide the preferred terms and vocabulary to be used in the fields, often in the form of authority lists, lexicons, data dictionaries, and thesauri. Examples include the Getty's Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT) and Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN), Nomenclature 4.0 for Museum Cataloguing, and Iconclass.Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), pp. 175-176. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums. While most of these data standards apply to the cataloging and description of cultural objects, efforts are also being made to create data standards for natural history collections. Based on Dublin Core, the Darwin Core (DwC) standard is a data structure standard for biodiversity information whose “glossary of terms” are the “fields” and “elements” needed to catalog biological and natural history specimens and samples.Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG). Darwin Core. Retrieved 5 December 2015. Recognizing the importance of data standards to many users, some developers advertise that their Collections Management Systems are compliant with certain standards. For example, the Adlib Museum CMS is “certified as SPECTRUM compliant by the Collections Trust” and “also incorporates other international standards such as the ‘CIDOC’ guidelines and Getty ‘Object ID.’”Adlib Software. Adlib Museum.

Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 162. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums. However, there is a growing demand for public access to some of the collections and object information contained in the CMS, which “helps fulfill a museum's mission to educate the public and prove that the objects held in public trust are used to public benefit” while also encouraging collections staff to “support basic collection stewardship” by ensuring that information about the object is accurate before being made publicly accessible.Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 182. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.

Collections Management Software Criteria Checklist – 2012. Retrieved 14 November 2015 =Rights and reproductions= A CMS should also allow collections staff to manage information on reproduction rights of the objects for which the institution is responsible, including type of copyright scheme being applied (for example, U.S. copyright or Creative Commons license), copyright ownership, and digital watermarks.Canadian Heritage Information Network (2012). Collections Management Software Criteria Checklist – 2012. Retrieved 14 November 2015 Considerations when selecting a system Since every museum has different needs, a museum should make a needs assessment before selecting a Collections Management System. The museum should determine what collections processes it needs the system to manage.Reibel, Daniel B. (2008). Computers. In ‘’Registration Methods for the Small Museum’’ (4th ed.), p. 118. Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press. The museum should also identify who will be using the system and consider such factors as collection size (both present and future), staff technology skills, and budget/pricing.Kozak, Zenobia (Jan-Feb 2013), How Do We Select a Collections Management System? ‘’MUSEUM’’. American Association of Museums,. Retrieved 13 November 2015. Another recommendation is to map out both the short- and long-term goals for the new CMS and then determine how the system can help increase the museum's efficiencies. Conservation information management systems Collections Management Systems have their origins in cataloging and registration, and consequently, most systems manage information and records “from a curatorial and collections management perspective.\\"Canadian Heritage Information Network (2012). Collections Management Software Criteria Checklist – 2012. Retrieved 14 November 2015 Conservation information in these systems is often limited to condition reporting and documentation of treatment history. While some advanced systems allow registrars to manage workflow tasks such as approvals and receipts, most systems are unable to manage conservation workflows. Many conservators also need a system that can not only store and manage conservation documentation but also easily share that information with other conservators and institutions.

It is specifically approved to treat non-metastatic castration- resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) in conjunction with surgical or medical castration. The medication is taken by mouth twice per day with food. Side effects of darolutamide added to castration may include fatigue, asthenia, pain in the arms and legs, and rash. Darolutamide is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen (NSAA), and acts as a selective antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR). It has been referred to as a second- or third-generation NSAA. Darolutamide was patented in 2011, and was approved for medical use in July 2019. It was approved for medical use in the European Union in March 2020, and in Australia in July 2020. Medical uses Darolutamide is approved for use concurrently with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist or bilateral orchiectomy in the treatment of non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) in men. It is used at a dosage of 600 mg orally twice per day (1,200 mg/day total) with food. In individuals with severe renal impairment or moderate hepatic impairment, darolutamide is used at a dosage of 300 mg orally twice per day (600 mg/day total) with food. No dosage adjustment is needed for mild to moderate renal impairment or mild hepatic impairment, whereas appropriate dosage adjustment for end-stage kidney disease and severe hepatic impairment is unknown. =Available forms= Darolutamide is provided in the form of 300 mg oral film-coated tablets. Contraindications Darolutamide has no contraindications in men. However, the medication may have teratogenic effects in male fetuses due to its antiandrogenic effects and hence should not be used by women who are pregnant. Side effects The most common side effects of darolutamide in clinical trials (≥2% incidence) in castrated men included fatigue and asthenia (16% vs. 11% for placebo), pain in extremities (6% vs. 3% for placebo), and rash (3% vs. 1% for placebo). Darolutamide was also associated with higher incidences of ischemic heart disease (4.0% vs. 3.4% for placebo) and heart failure (2.1% vs. 0.9% for placebo). In terms of laboratory test abnormalities, darolutamide was associated with decreased neutrophil count (20% vs. 9% for placebo), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (23% vs. 14% for placebo; Grade 3–4: 0.5% vs. 0.2% for placebo), and increased bilirubin (16% vs. 7% for placebo). In the clinical studies, 88% of patients treated with darolutamide were age 65 years or older. No seizures have been observed with darolutamide in clinical trials. Darolutamide is an expected teratogen and has a theoretical risk of birth defects in male infants if taken by women during pregnancy. It may impair male fertility. When used as a monotherapy (i.e., without surgical or medical castration) in men, NSAAs are known to produce feminizing breast changes including breast tenderness and gynecomastia. Overdose Darolutamide has been studied at a dosage of up to 1,800 mg/day in clinical trials. There were no dose-limiting toxicities seen at this dosage. Due to its saturable absorption and lack of acute toxicity, overdose of darolutamide is not expected to result in systemic toxicity in people with intact hepatic and renal function. There is no specific antidote for overdose of darolutamide. In the event of darolutamide overdose, if there is no toxicity, treatment can be continued as normal. If there is suspicion of toxicity, general supportive measures should be undertaken until clinical toxicity has decreased or resolved and then treatment may be continued.  Interactions  Combined P-glycoprotein and strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampicin may decrease exposure to darolutamide, while combined P-glycoprotein and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole may increase exposure to darolutamide. Darolutamide is an inhibitor of the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) transporter and can increase exposure to substrates for this protein such as rosuvastatin. It has been found to increase exposure to rosuvastatin by approximately 5-fold. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= Darolutamide is second- or third-generation nonsteroidal antiandrogen (NSAA). It acts as a selective competitive silent antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Its affinity (Ki) for the AR is 11 nM and its functional inhibition () of the AR is 26 nM. The major metabolite of darolutamide, ketodarolutamide, has similar antiandrogenic activity relative to darolutamide (Ki = 8 nM; IC50 = 38 nM). In addition to its actions as an AR antagonist, darolutamide has been found to act as a silent antagonist of the progesterone receptor (PR), with approximately 1% of the potency of its AR antagonism. A dosage of darolutamide of 1,200 mg/day has been found to result in a mean decrease in prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels of more than 90% in men with prostate cancer. The addition of darolutamide to castration has been found to decrease PSA levels by more than 50% in about 50% of men at 200 mg/day, 69% of men at 400 mg/day, 83% of men at 1,200 mg/day, and 86% of men at 1,400 mg/day. Darolutamide shows some advantages in comparison to enzalutamide and apalutamide, two other second- generation NSAAs. It appears to negligibly cross the blood–brain barrier, and hence has reduced risk of seizures and other central side effects from off- target GABAA receptor inhibition. In accordance with its diminished central penetration, darolutamide does not appear to increase testosterone levels. Darolutamide has been found to block the activity of all tested/well-known mutant ARs in prostate cancer, including the recently identified clinically- relevant F876L mutation that produces resistance to enzalutamide and apalutamide. The medication shows higher affinity and inhibitory potency at the AR relative to enzalutamide and apalutamide in vitro (Ki = 11 nM relative to 86 nM for enzalutamide and 93 nM for apalutamide; = 26 nM relative to 219 nM for enzalutamide and 200 nM for apalutamide). Darolutamide inhibits the organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in vitro. It shows no inhibition or induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4) at clinically relevant concentrations. Similarly, darolutamide shows no inhibition of a variety of other transporters (P-glycoprotein, MRP2, BSEP, OATs, OCTs, MATEs, OATP2B1, NTCP) at therapeutic concentrations. =Pharmacokinetics= The absolute bioavailability of darolutamide with oral administration of a single 300-mg dose without food is approximately 30%. The bioavailability of darolutamide is increased by about 2- to 2.5-fold when administered with food, with a similar increase in exposure occurring for ketodarolutamide. Exposure to darolutamide and ketodarolutamide increases in a nearly linear or dose-proportional manner across a dose range of 100 to 700 mg (or about 0.17- to 1.17-fold the recommended 600-mg dosage). No further increase in exposure to darolutamide was observed at a dosage of darolutamide of 900 mg twice per day (or 1.5 times the recommended 600-mg dosage), indicating a saturation of absorption at doses above 700 mg. Following a single 600-mg dose of darolutamide, peak levels of darolutamide occur after approximately 4 hours. Steady-state levels of darolutamide occur after 2 to 5 days of continuous administration with food, during which time an approximate 2-fold accumulation in darolutamide levels occurs. At steady state with 600 mg/day darolutamide, mean levels of darolutamide are 4.79 μg/mL and area-under-the-curve levels of darolutamide over time 0 to 12 hours (AUC0–12) are 52.82 h•μg/mL. Total exposure to ketodarolutamide is approximately 1.7-fold that of darolutamide. The volume of distribution of darolutamide with intravenous administration is 119 L. The plasma protein binding of darolutamide is 92%, with 8% circulating freely, and of ketodarolutamide is 99.8%, with 0.2% circulating unbound. As such, free levels of darolutamide in the circulation are about 40-fold higher than those of ketodarolutamide. Both darolutamide and ketodarolutamide are bound mainly to albumin. Darolutamide and ketodarolutamide appear to negligibly cross the blood–brain barrier both in mice and humans. Darolutamide is primarily metabolized into ketodarolutamide via dehydrogenation by CYP3A4 in the liver. The medication is also conjugated via glucuronidation by UGT1A9 and UGT1A1. The elimination half-life of darolutamide and ketodarolutamide has been reported to be approximately 20 hours. A clinical study found that the elimination half-lives of darolutamide and ketodarolutamide at steady-state were 15.8 hours and 10.0 hours, respectively, with these half-lives being independent of dosage across a dose range of darolutamide of 200 to 1,800 mg/day. The elimination half-life of darolutamide is far shorter than that of enzalutamide (e.g., 1.6 hours vs. 18.3 hours in mice). The clearance of darolutamide following intravenous administration is 116 mL/min. After a single oral dose of darolutamide, more than 95% of the dose is excreted in urine and feces within one week following administration. A total of 63.4% darolutamide-related material is recovered in urine (about 7% as unchanged darolutamide) and a total of 32.4% darolutamide-related material (about 30% as unchanged darolutamide) is recovered in feces. No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of darolutamide have been observed in men with nmCRPC on the basis of age (48 to 95 years), race (white, Asian, black), mild-to-moderate renal impairment, or mild hepatic impairment. In non-nmCRPC individuals with severe renal impairment not on dialysis, exposure to darolutamide was increased by about 2.5-fold relative to healthy people. In non-nmCRPC individuals with moderate hepatic impairment, darolutamide exposure was increased by about 1.9-fold compared to healthy controls. The pharmacokinetics of darolutamide have not been assessed in end-stage kidney disease or severe hepatic impairment. Chemistry Darolutamide is a nonsteroidal compound and is structurally distinct from other marketed NSAAs, including enzalutamide and apalutamide. History Darolutamide was developed by Orion Corporation and Bayer HealthCare. Orion Corporation applied for a patent on darolutamide in October 2010, and this patent was published in May 2011.https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2011051540A1 Darolutamide entered phase I clinical trials in April 2011, with the results of the first clinical study of darolutamide initially published in 2012. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved darolutamide in July 2019, under the agency's priority review designation. Approval was based on ARAMIS, a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 1,509 patients with non- metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive either 600 mg darolutamide orally twice daily (n=955) or matching placebo (n=554). All patients received a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog concurrently or had a previous bilateral orchiectomy. Twelve patients with previous seizure histories were treated on the darolutamide arm. The primary endpoint was metastasis free survival (MFS), defined as the time from randomization to first evidence of distant metastasis or death from any cause within 33 weeks after the last evaluable scan, whichever occurred first. The median MFS was 40.4 months (95% CI: 34.3, not reached) for patients treated with darolutamide compared with 18.4 months (95% CI: 15.5, 22.3) for those receiving placebo (hazard ratio 0.41; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.50; p<0.0001). OS data were not mature. Society and culture =Generic names= Darolutamide is the generic name of the medication and its and . It is also known by its developmental code names ODM-201 and BAY-1841788. =Brand names= Darolutamide is marketed under the brand name Nubeqa. =Availability= Darolutamide is available in the United States and the European Union. Research Darolutamide monotherapy is being studied in comparison to androgen deprivation therapy with GnRH agonist or antagonist monotherapy in men with treatment-naive prostate cancer. As of 2018, it is entering a phase II clinical trial for this indication. This study is expected for completion in 2021 or 2022. Darolutamide is being studied for the treatment of breast cancer in women. As of November 2019, it is in phase II clinical trials for this indication.

Description The Richmond's wrasse is a small fish that can reach a maximum length of 19 cm.Lieske & Myers,Coral reef fishes,Princeton University Press, 2009, It has a thin, elongate body with a terminal mouth and a more pointed snout than other wrasse belonging to genus Halichoeres. Body coloration has few variations according to age. The juvenile has a light blue-green background color with many orange stripes. It has also two black ocellus: the first one on top part of its caudal peduncle and the second one in the middle of its dorsal fin. A black spot occurs on the first rays of the dorsal fin. Juveniles and females have in common an orange anal fin. Mature male are quite different. Their body is greenish with many fin blue lines that are chain-like. A concave head profile with a green-brown color. The external border of their dorsal, caudal and anal fins are blue. Distribution & habitat The chain-lined wrasse is widespread throughout the tropical and subtropical waters of the central Indo-Pacific, from Indonesia to Philippines and from Solomon Islands to south Japan. This wrasse occurs in shallow waters from lagoons and channels rich in soft coral down to a depth of 12 meters.Lieske, E. and R. Myers, 1994. Collins Pocket Guide. Coral reef fishes.

Fusiliers - Dragonets, Caesionidae - Callionymidae. Zoonetics, Australia. 304-622 p.Rudie Kuiter, \\"Labridae fishes: wrasses\\", Aquatic Photographics, 2010, Biology The chain-lined wrasse lives and feeds in small loose groups. It is a benthic predator that feeds mainly on small marine invertebrates such as crustaceans, molluscs, worms and echinoderms captured on or in the substrate. Like most wrasse, the chain-lined wrasse is a protogynous hermaphrodite, i.e. individuals start life as females with the capability of turning male later on. Conservation status The species is targeted but not thought to be threatened by the aquarium trade. It is listed as Least Concern (LC) on the IUCN. Species description and etymology Halichoeres richmondi was described in 1928 by the American ichthyologists Henry Weed Fowler and Barton Appler Bean with the type locality given as Inamucan Bay on Mindanao in the Philippines. The specific name honours the ornithologist Charles Wallace Richmond (1868-1932) of the United States National Museum.

It stood at the corner of Telegraph Avenue and Russell Street, and featured several notable artists. The club was particularly frequented by pre-groups formed by future members of Country Joe and the Fish. The building was demolished two years after the business's closing in 1967. History The Jabberwock was previously a jazz club called the Tsubo. The Tsubo had been opened by entrepreneur Glenn Ross in September 1961 with the Berkeley jazz radio station, KJAZ-FM, also housed in the same building. As a jazz club, the venue is best-remembered for being where guitarist Wes Montgomery recorded his live album Full House on June 25, 1962. Although the establishment was favored among Berkeley residents for not serving alcohol and welcoming minors, Ross could not sustain upkeep on the establishment. It finally closed on October 15, 1962 with having invested $35,000 into Tsubo and consequently emerging in debt. Shortly thereafter, the name of the building was changed to the Jabberwock. In 1963, the Jabberwock transitioned into catering for enthusiasts of the folk movement under the leadership of new owners Belle Randell and her husband John Stauder, a classically-trained guitarist and accompanist. The Jabberwock was less than a mile from UC Berkeley, and accommodate a young fan base of students and graduates, especially when the university became ground zero for anti-war sentiment and the Free Speech Movement in 1964. Poster artist Tom Waller described the club as a \\"beatnik sort of place at that point, walls all painted black and espresso and cool jazz. The club also featured some classical music, including a recorder trio consisting of Michael Rossman (of FSM fame), Stewart Kiritz, and Phil Nathanson), who played for free meals and passed a hat around for funds. A few years later it became part of the folk scene and then the hippie scene\\". The venue was open on a daily basis and during Randell and Stauder's tenure of ownership it featured future Joy of Cooking guitarist Terry Garthwaites, Bob Dylan, Jesse Fuller, Bukka White, Ian and Sylvia, and Perry Lederman, among others. On March 23, 1965, Randell and Strauder sold the Jabberwock to Bill \\"Jolly Blue\\" Ehlert. Around this time, it was regularly the venue for performances by future Country Joe and the Fish members Country Joe McDonald and Barry \\"The Fish\\" Melton in the Instant Jug Band and Bruce Barthol. Following Country Joe and the Fish's success with Electric Music for the Mind and Body, the group still returned to the Jabberwock, but with an emphasis on psychedelia. The Jabberwock reached the peak of its popularity in 1966 as many musical artists began converting to psychedelic music, the club still hosted folk musicians. In the same year, Ehlert hired Jesse Cahn, who had been a guest drummer for the Chambers Brothers, to co-manage the Jabberwock while he ran the Matrix in San Francisco. After several unsuccessful co-management partners, Sally Henderson took the helm for the club's final few months. In 1967, Health and Building Departments reclassified the building as hazardous due to an increased occupancy load. A complete renovation was required that was not financially viable, forcing the Jabberwock to close on July 7, 1967. Two years after its closure, the Jabberwock was demolished. A garden was grown on the vacant lot where the building had stood.

History Global Cash Access was founded in July 1998 as a joint venture of three payment processing companies: BA Merchant Services (majority-owned by Bank of America), First Data, and USA Processing Inc. First Data contributed the assets of its gaming business, First Data Financial Services, which provided cash services at over 800 gaming properties; it had purchased the business earlier in the year from Ceridian Corporation. BA Merchant Services contributed $35 million in cash, plus its existing gaming assets, for a 21 percent stake in the business. The company underwent a recapitalization in March 2004, repurchasing First Data's shares for $435 million, leaving M&C; International with a 95% share of the company, with Bank of America owning the rest. Two months later, M&C; sold a large portion of the company to a group of private equity firms led by Summit Partners for $316 million. GCA debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in September 2005, raising $240 million in an initial public offering. In 2009, gaming regulators recommended denying renewal of the company's license to do business in Arizona casinos, because of allegations that Global Cash Access had defrauded banks out of $26 million in transaction fees between 1999 and 2002, by miscoding Visa cash advance transactions as retail purchases. In response, co-founders Karim Maskatiya and Robert Cucinotta, who had been sharply criticized by the regulators, sold their 26 percent interest in the company, and GCA ultimately paid $1 million to Arizona to settle the investigation. Global Cash Access expanded into the slot machine business by purchasing Texas-based slot maker Multimedia Games for $1.2 billion in December 2014. The company changed its name to Everi Holdings in August 2015, to reflect its broader business model.

The film stars Jason Momoa as Joe Braven, with Garret Dillahunt, Stephen Lang, Jill Wagner, and Brendan Fletcher. Principal photography began in December 2015 in Newfoundland, Canada. The film was released on February 2, 2018. Plot Logging company owner and family man Joe Braven (Jason Momoa), lives with his wife Stephanie (Jill Wagner) and their daughter Charlotte (Sasha Rossof). Braven's father Linden (Stephen Lang), who suffers from brain trauma due to a head injury, gets into a bar room brawl after mistaking a woman for his wife, requiring Joe to come to his aid and resulting in hospitalization for Linden. On Stephanie's suggestion, Joe and Linden decide to spend some time together at the family's secluded mountain cabin unaware that Charlotte was hiding in the back of the vehicle so she could tag along. While transporting logs by truck, Joe's co-worker, a driver named Weston (Brendan Fletcher) is asked by Hallett (Zahn McClarnon), a drug trafficker, to recruit other drivers into Hallett's criminal activities, but Weston refuses. During the exchange, Weston loses control of his truck, causing a crash that displaces all the logs and cocaine from the vehicle. After they resolve to go to Joe's mountain cabin to store the cocaine there, Weston and Hallett are picked up by a police patrol car. Hallett relays the news of the crash to his employer, drug lord Kassen (Garret Dillahunt). After Joe, Linden and Charlotte arrive at the cabin, Joe discovers the cocaine hidden in the shed so he hides Charlotte in a storage closet before being surrounded by Kassen's mercenaries and when Weston tries to act as a go- between, Kassen kills him. Unable to call for help because of lack of cellular signals at the cabin, Joe, armed with a bow and arrow, and Linden with a gun, kill some of the mercenaries during the ensuing standoff. Needing higher ground in order to access a cellular network, Joe drives out of the house on a quad bike with the original cocaine bag and Charlotte, hidden under a blanket. Joe drops off Charlotte and instructs her climb to the mountain, where she calls her mother, who calls the sheriff. Circling back, Joe dispatches more of Kassen's men. Kassen finds the bag, but it is empty. Discovering where Joe sent Charlotte, Kassen sends one of the mercenaries, Ridley, to find her, though when Hallett enters the cabin, he is stabbed twice by Linden, who then retreats, and is later wounded by another mercenary, Essington. Just before Ridley catches up to Charlotte, a bow-wielding Stephanie arrives and shoots Ridley with an arrow. A hand-to-hand fight ensues, during which she stabs Ridley before fleeing. Meanwhile, Joe returns to the cabin, where he dispatches Clay and kills Essington. Charlotte is picked up by the sheriff as Ridley continues to pursue Stephanie. Kassen takes Linden hostage and after Joe pleads for his life, Kassen fatally stabs him. Kassen shoots the sheriff and escapes the cabin, later retrieving the lost cocaine. Joe chases after him and after a knife fight in which Kassen bests Joe, Joe pushes Kassen off a cliff, killing him, before reuniting with Stephanie and Charlotte.

The Arabian Horse Association of Arizona, with Ed Tweed as their president, sponsored the first show, which was then called the \\"All- Arabian Horse Show\\". It is the largest Arabian horse show in the world, and one of the largest breed shows in the world. The show is sanctioned by the United States Equestrian Federation and the Arabian Horse Association.

Bomgaars serves the Midwest to the Rockies in Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota, South Dakota, Colorado, Idaho and Wyoming. It is operated by the Bomgaars family. History Bomgaars store number 66 in Gillette, Wyoming In the small town of Middleburg, Iowa at the age of 18, William Bomgaars was operating a general store, selling gingham from the bolt, and crackers from a barrel. Also from this store, he stocked horse-drawn wagons with all the needs of the rural family and drove them on a farm route. From this beginning, after various positions, including selling violin lessons in Chicago, and washing machines in South Dakota, Bill decided to venture out on his own. In 1931, in Sioux City, he borrowed $125.00 on his Army insurance to purchase a Ford Model A, and Mr. Bob Bowes, of Bowes Seal Fast, extended time credit for a beginning inventory of $125.00. Bill loaded his merchandise into the car and started out to build up a territory. By 1932, the midwest was deep in depression and growth was very slow. However, by 1934 he was eating 3 meals a day on a regular schedule. Before this, he had been on an inventive program that let him eat breakfast, lunch or dinner, as the case may be, as soon as he made his first sale of the day. In January 1944, the operation had expanded to the point where it could no longer be contained in their home, and was moved to the first downtown location at 819 Pearl Street, in Sioux City, Iowa. At this time the work force consisted of two extra employees, Bill's sister, Ann, in the office, and his brother, Gerald, as a salesman on the road. In 1944 Sioux City sustained extensive damage from a major flood on the west side and the building had to be sand-bagged. The next move was to the building at 611 Pearl Street in 1945. The business consisted mainly of tire and repair materials. By 1946, Bomgaars became the jobber for NAPA Auto Parts and had two office girls and four salesman traveling through the territory. Harold Bomgaars (Bill's son) graduated from the University of Iowa in 1947 and entered the business on a full-time basis as a traveling salesman. In July, 1952, Bill heard of an innovation in Grand Forks, North Dakota that caught his attention: the sending of fleet cards to farmers entitling them to discounts. Manufacturers at that time were selling at a discount to businesses on a fleet basis; that is, any business operating five or more fuel powered vehicles and/or equipment, were qualified to buy at a discount. Bill's wife, Tena, and Bill's sister-in-law compiled the lists of people operating 5 or more vehicles from the tax roles in the county seats. It was in Milbank, South Dakota, in 1952, that four men, including Bill Bomgaars, instituted the Mid-States buying group and Bomgaars went into the farm fleet business. Many new lines were added and this resulted in the beginning of more rapid growth, necessitating a move to larger quarters at 204 Fourth Street in 1955. Expansion began taking place in the form of opening branch stores, and the first one was in Yankton, South Dakota in 1956. By 2001, the company had 15 stores; it nearly doubled the chain's size by acquiring 13 former Country General stores after that chain's owner filed for bankruptcy. In 2012 Bomgaars acquired five Shoppers Supply stores in Iowa. In 2015, Bomgaars took over 12 former locations of the defunct ALCO Stores chain. In 2019, Bomgaars took over 13 former locations of the bankrupt Shopko discount chain; seven of the sites are for relocations of existing stores, while six are stores in new markets. Bomgaars operates distribution centers in Sioux City, Iowa and in Gering, Nebraska.

The film tells the story of Dane Jensen, a Corporate Recruiter from Chicago, who must balance his career aspirations and his increasingly complex family life. The film stars Gerard Butler, Willem Dafoe, Anupam Kher, Alfred Molina, Alison Brie, and Gretchen Mol. Principal photography began on October 26, 2015 in Toronto. It screened at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival.  Plot  Dane Jensen (Gerard Butler) is a successful Chicago- based corporate headhunter who works at the Blackridge Recruitment agency. His life revolves around closing deals in a survival-of-the-fittest boiler room. As the film opens Jensen is shown to be focused on his job, but he also tries to be a family man. His boss Ed Blackridge (Willem Dafoe) is offering Jensen a promotion that will lead to Jensen controlling the company. In order to secure the promotion, he must beat his ambitious rival Lynn Wilson's (Alison Brie) numbers. Jensen's focus on the job becomes a detriment to his family. His wife Elise (Gretchen Mol) asks for more of his time with the family. Jensen tries to spend some quality time with his oldest child Ryan (Maxwell Jenkins), to prepare Ryan for the adult world. Jensen finds Ryan on the verge of childhood obesity and takes him jogging in the morning. Jensen notices that his son is constantly complaining of tiredness and has bruises. Jensen works harder and spends more time at the office to try to get the promotion, but it does not sit right with Elise. She asks him to prioritize. Ryan is later diagnosed with cancer, which shocks Jensen. He spends more time with his son, which causes his numbers — a prerequisite of the promotion — to drop. Meanwhile, Lynn takes the opportunity to tap into his clients and scores. The film culminates with Ryan falling into a coma before getting better, and Jensen losing his job at Ed's firm, due to not making profit. The strict Ed releases Jensen from his non-compete agreement. Jensen starts his own company and is also invested with his family.

She helped spread Catholicism and French-Indian cooperation in New France along the Mississippi River. She was particularly influential in the area near the former Fort St. Louis. She married a French trader; the children they had were among the earliest examples of the emerging Métis in New France. Life Aramepinchieue was born in 1677 to a Kaskaskia chief called Mamenthouensa. At a young age, she and other Kaskaskia women in her village felt drawn to Christianity, as preached by the Jesuit missionary Jacques Gravier. Jesuit missionaries often stressed the Virgin Mary, while also emphasizing chastity and virginity. Conversion and intermarriage varied greatly by community, but many young women like Aramepinchieue converted to Catholicism before marriage. Aramepinchieue was the first indigenous woman to receive a sacramental marriage within the Roman Catholic Church for her marriage with a Frenchman in the Illinois Country. She took her First Communion on the Feast of the Assumption. Aramepinchieue's father hoped she would marry in a way that would bring their family economic opportunities. He wanted Michel Aco, a French fur trader, to be Aramepinchieue's husband, but she was not interested. She said she had given \\"all her heart to God and did not wish to share it.\\" Furthermore, Aco had the reputation of being an \\"apostate Catholic known for his mockery of the Jesuits.\\" Her father, furious with his daughter's loyalty to Christianity over her family, threw her out of his home. Aramepinchieue sought refuge with Father Gravier. In this way, her Catholic identity allowed her to challenge her father's authority over her. Eventually, at seventeen years old, Aramepinchieue reached a compromise with her parents: she would marry Aco if he would convert to Catholicism. Aco and the chief agreed to this. Aco converted to Catholicism, which a contemporary observer described as an impressive change to the rough trader from the frontier: \\"The first conquest [Aramepinchieue] made for God was to win her husband, who was famous in this Ilinois country for all his debaucheries. He is now quite changed...\\" Aramepinchieue's marriage helped build an alliance among the French traders, the Jesuit missionaries, and the Kaskaskias. The children of Frenchmen and Kaskaskia women were among the first Métis people in the Americas. By this time in her life, Aramepinchieue primarily went by the name of Marie Rouensa. As a married and devoted Catholic woman, Aramepinchieue took as \\"special patronesses… the Christian Ladies who have sanctified themselves in the state of matrimony, — namely, St. Paula, St. Frances, St. Margaret, St. Elizabeth, and St. Bridget.\\" Later on in her life, Aramepinchieue later moved from Fort St. Louis to Cahokia, then closer to the present day town of Kaskaskia. After her husband died, she remarried a French trader named Michel Philippe. In total she had eight children: two with Aco (sometimes spelled Accault) and six with Philippe. She came to have great influence over the men in her household and over her entire community. She amassed a considerable estate, showing continuities with her indigenous heritage as well as French acculturation. Rouensa's property included several tracts of land along with, \\"Two houses, 36 by 20 feet, with stone fireplaces that were located within the Kaskaskia village. Two barns, filled with hay, fed the livestock: oxen, thirteen cows, three horses, thirty one pigs, and forty-eight chickens...oxcarts and horse carts, and iron plows.\\" She was also the legal owner of two African-American married couples, as well as an Indian woman slave. The three women probably planted and harvested oats, wheat, and maize, while the male slaves were more likely to work in the fur trade. They were also woodcutters, for there were nine tons of wood, cut and debarked, in the estate. In her barns was a large stock of wheat and oats, and the wheat was valued at 3,300 livres. Aramepinchieueu died in 1725, at the age of about forty to forty-five years old. She was buried under the floor of the Immaculate Conception parish church in Kaskaskia, the only woman, French or indigenous, given that honor. After her death, Rouensa's will dictated that her considerable estate, created over many years of hard labor, be shared equally among her children.

The game was part funded through the Kickstarter crowdfunding website, and the first episode was released in April 2015. Development Fictiorama Studios consists of three brothers: Mario, Luis and Alberto Oliván, and an artist: Martín Martínez. This story was pitched by Alberto, and the art, plot, and music were designed to fit his vision. The developers cited influences such as The Secret of Monkey Island, 12 Monkeys and The Road among others. The art style borrows from expressionism and tribal art. One of the main challenges for the production team were designing the non-linear narrative and complex branching tree-dialogue, eventually settling on a software called articy:draft to collect all the data needed to streamline this process. The game was part funded through the Kickstarter crowdfunding website, raising $51,501 in April 2014. Plot The player controls Michael, an amnesiac who wakes up in the apocalyptic New World , where many humans called \\"the Dissolved\\" have a disease that kills them. Michael explores the areas, trying to work out what is really going on, all the while confused by strange visions and dreams that cloud his mind. According to the studio, the game features \\"space-time distortions, a dystopian atmosphere… and a dark, bloodstained plot\\". Reception The game has a Metacritic rating of 70% based on 24 critic reviews. According to Carsten Fichtelmann of Daedalic Entertainment, Dead Synchronicity was a commercial flop. He said in 2016, \\"Unfortunately it did not sell well, only a few thousand units, so we had to say to the developers that we cannot put money in a second game, because we lost money with its first part.\\" PC World praised the game as a brave and \\"surprisingly disturbing\\" title, but said it lacked a \\"catharsis\\" due to its abrupt end and lack of narrative cohesion in gameplay. John Walker, writing at Rock, Paper, Shotgun had been very enthusiastic about the game during its Kickstarter campaign. But reviewing the first chapter, he too was disappointed with its abrupt ending. The PlayStation 4 port received positives reviews, with Crash Landed scoring it 4 stars praising the games control method \\"developers Fictiorama Studios have gone a step further and transformed Dead Synchronicity - a game that would usually be more suited for the PC space - to feel right at home on the console using a controller, thanks to some smart game design decisions.\\" Kai Powell of wccftech scored the game a 7.7, praising its \\"macabre\\" setting, meanwhile Jose A.

The area encompasses an ecologically complex and geologically active landscape. The region features the most rugged side of Mount Adams, including canyons and the Great Gap section of the Mount Adams circumnavigation route, a three-mile trail-less section over two great canyons and many difficult glacial creeks. At , Mount Adams is one of the major Cascade mountains. The recreation area is on the east side of the mountain and is part of the Yakama Indian Reservation and includes the popular Bird Creek Meadows area. Recreation Bird Creek Meadows The Mount Adams Recreation Area offers activities such as hiking, camping, Backpacking (at specific campsites), picnicking, and fishing. The area features Bird Creek Meadows, a popular picnic and hiking area noted for its outstanding display of wildflowers, and exceptional views of Mount Adams and its glaciers, as well as Mount Hood to the south. =Hiking= At Bird Creek Meadows, hikers can access the Hellroaring Overlook, where they can view Hellroaring Meadows, a glacial valley about down from the viewpoint precipice. From here, hikers can gaze up at Mount Adams,the Klickitat Glacier, and various waterfalls tumbling off of high cliffs below the glaciers terminus. There are many loop trails at Bird Creek Meadows, including the Trail of the Flowers. Trails travel through meadows, streams, and waterfalls, including Crooked Creek Falls. Bird Creek Meadows was closed in 2015 due to the Cougar Complex fire and was not yet opened as of summer 2018 Little Mount Adams is a symmetrical cinder cone on top of the Ridge of Wonders, and rises from the northeast end of Hellroaring Meadow and the Hellroaring Creek valley. It offers a trail to the east base of the peak. To reach the top, hikers must traverse rocky terrain; and if there are, user-made trails. The Around the Mountain–Highline Circuit Mount Adams along Trail #20 just above Hellroaring Overlook, on the way to Iceberg Lake and Sunrise Camp The Round the Mountain Trail, the Pacific Crest Trail, and the Highline Trail when joined almost completely encircle the mountain, save for a 4-mile section known as \\"The Gap\\" on the east side of the Mountain in the Mount Adams Recreation Area. The Round the Mountain Trail extends from the Pacific Crest Trail on the southwest side of the Mount Adams Wilderness, and travels east over the A.G. Aiken Lava Bed before crossing into the Yakama Nation Mount Adams Recreation Area. It then proceeds to pass through Bird Creek Meadows before ending at the western edge of Hellroaring Canyon. Hikers can continue the round the mountain circuit by following Trail #20 to Hellroaring Overlook, then continue following the (now poorly defined) trail to Sunrise Camp, perched between the Mazama and Klickitat Glaciers at 8,000 feet. North of Sunrise Camp it is completely trail-less and suited only for experienced backcountry travellers. Hikers have to negotiate dangerous creek crossings, 1,000 foot deep canyons and valleys, and a glacier-crossing of the Klickitat Glacier. At the north end, hikers rejoin the Highline Trail which ends at Avalanche Valley in the Mount Adams Recreation Area. =Camping= There are three campgrounds in the Mount Adams Recreation Area. A campground is located each at Bird Lake, Mirror Lake, and Bench Lake. The area is accessed from Trout Lake via the Mount Adams Recreation Highway, northeast on Forest Road 82, to Forest Road 8225, and on Tribal Route 285 (Bench Lake Road), passing the Bird Creek Meadows Parking Area, and ending at Bench Lake. Bird Lake Road leads off of Bench Lake Road, and heads north to Bird Lake. All of the roads after the short section known as the Mount Adams Recreation Highway is gravel and dirt, and is known to be extremely rough and often only suitable for trucks or high clearance vehicles. =Climbing= Heavily crevassed glaciers seen from the Bird Creek Meadows area of the recreation area Each year, hundreds of people attempt to summit Mount Adams, but few attempt the faces within the Mount Adams Recreation Area. Crampons, ice axes, and ropes are needed on all routes here because of the glaciers, crevasses, and jagged cliffs found on Mount Adams' rugged east side. Climbing Mount Adams can be dangerous for a variety of reasons and people do die in pursuit of the summit.

Side effects of apalutamide when added to castration include fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, high blood pressure, rash, falls, bone fractures, and an underactive thyroid. Rarely, it can cause seizures. The medication has a high potential for drug interactions. Apalutamide is an antiandrogen, and acts as an antagonist of the androgen receptor, the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. In doing so, it prevents the effects of these hormones in the prostate gland and elsewhere in the body. Apalutamide was first described in 2007, and was approved for the treatment of prostate cancer in February 2018. It was the first medication to be approved specifically for the treatment of NM-CRPC. Medical uses Apalutamide is used in conjunction with castration, either via bilateral orchiectomy or gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue (GnRH analogue) therapy, as a method of androgen deprivation therapy in the treatment of NM-CRPC. It is also a promising potential treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), which the NSAA enzalutamide and the androgen synthesis inhibitor abiraterone acetate are used to treat. =Available forms= Apalutamide is provided in the form of 60 mg oral tablets. It is taken at a dosage of 240 mg once per day (four tablets) when used in the treatment of NM-CRPC. Contraindications Contraindications of apalutamide include pregnancy and a history of or susceptibility to seizures. Side effects Apalutamide has been found to be well tolerated in clinical trials, with the most common side effects reported when added to surgical or medical castration including fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Other side effects have included rash, falls and bone fractures, and hypothyroidism, as well as seizures (in 0.2%), among others. Apalutamide is an expected teratogen and has a theoretical risk of birth defects in male infants if taken by women during pregnancy. It may impair male fertility. When used as a monotherapy (i.e., without surgical or medical castration) in men, NSAAs are known to produce additional, estrogenic side effects like breast tenderness, gynecomastia, and feminization in general by increasing estradiol levels. Similarly to the related second-generation NSAA enzalutamide but unlike first- generation NSAAs like flutamide and bicalutamide, elevated liver enzymes and hepatotoxicity have not been reported with apalutamide. Overdose There is no known antidote for overdose of apalutamide. General supportive measures should be undertaken until clinical toxicity, if any, diminishes or resolves. Interactions Apalutamide has a high potential for drug interactions. In terms of effects of apalutamide on other drugs, the exposure of substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, P-glycoprotein, ABCG2, or OATP1B1 may be reduced to varying extents. In terms of effects of other drugs on apalutamide, strong CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase levels of apalutamide or its major active metabolite N-desmethylapalutamide, while mild to moderate CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 inhibitors are not expected to affect their exposure. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= Antiandrogenic activity Apalutamide acts as a selective competitive silent antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR), via the ligand-binding domain, and hence is an antiandrogen. It is similar both structurally and pharmacologically to the second-generation NSAA enzalutamide, but shows some advantages, including higher antiandrogenic activity as well as several-fold reduced central nervous system distribution. The latter difference may reduce its comparative risk of seizures and other central side effects. Apalutamide has 5- to 10-fold greater affinity for the AR than bicalutamide, a first-generation NSAA. The acquired F876L mutation of the AR identified in advanced prostate cancer cells has been found to confer resistance to both enzalutamide and apalutamide. A newer NSAA, darolutamide, is not affected by this mutation, nor has it been found to be affected by any other tested/well-known AR mutations. Apalutamide may be effective in a subset of prostate cancer patients with acquired resistance to abiraterone acetate. Other activities Apalutamide shows potent induction potential of cytochrome P450 enzymes similarly to enzalutamide. It is a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 and a weak inducer of CYP2C9, as well as an inducer of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. In addition, apalutamide is an inducer of P-glycoprotein, ABCG2, and OATP1B1. Apalutamide binds weakly to and inhibits the GABAA receptor in vitro similarly to enzalutamide ( = 3.0 and 2.7 μM, respectively), but due to its relatively lower central concentrations, may have a lower risk of seizures in comparison. Apalutamide has been found to significantly and concentration-dependently increase QT interval. =Pharmacokinetics= The mean absolute oral bioavailability of apalutamide is 100%. Mean peak levels of apalutamide occur 2 hours following administration, with a range of 1 to 5 hours. Food delays the median time to peak levels of apalutamide by approximately 2 hours, with no significant changes in the peak levels themselves or in area-under-curve levels. Steady- state levels of apalutamide are achieved following 4 weeks of administration, with an approximate 5-fold accumulation. Peak concentrations for 160 mg/day apalutamide at steady-state are 6.0 µg/mL (12.5 µmol/L), relative to peak levels of 16.6 μg/mL (35.7 μmol/L) for 160 mg/day enzalutamide and mean (R)-bicalutamide levels of 21.6 μg/mL (50.2 μmol/L) for 150 mg/day bicalutamide.https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2017/203415s011lbl.pdf The mean volume of distribution of apalutamide at steady-state is approximately 276 L. The plasma protein binding of apalutamide is 96%, while that of its major metabolite N-desmethylapalutamide is 95%, both irrespective of concentration. Apalutamide is metabolized in the liver by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. A major active metabolite, N-desmethylapalutamide, is formed by these enzymes, with similar contribution of each of these enzymes to its formation at steady-state. Following a single oral dose of 200 mg apalutamide, apalutamide represented 45% and N-desmethylapalutamide 44% of total area- under-curve levels. The mean elimination half-life of apalutamide at steady- state is 3 to 4 days. Fluctuations in apalutamide exposure are low and levels are stable throughout the day, with mean peak-to-trough ratios of 1.63 for apalutamide and 1.27–1.3 for N-desmethylapalutamide. After a single dose of apalutamide, its clearance rate (CL/F) was 1.3 L/h, while its clearance rate increased to 2.0 L/h at steady-state. This change is considered to be likely due to CYP3A4 auto-induction. Approximately 65% of apalutamide is excreted in urine (1.2% as unchanged apalutamide and 2.7% as N-desmethylapalutamide) while 24% is excreted in feces (1.5% as unchanged apalutmaide and 2% as N-desmethylapalutamide). Chemistry Apalutamide is a structural analogue of enzalutamide and RD-162. It is a pyridyl variant of RD-162. Enzalutamide and RD-162 were derived from the nonsteroidal androgen RU-59063, which itself was derived from the first-generation NSAA nilutamide and by extension from flutamide.

During the Quaternary, global climate experienced a recurring pattern of ice-sheet growth and decay. The length of Late Quaternary cycles varied between 80,000 and 120,000 years, with an average recurrence interval of about 100,000 years. The typical Late Quaternary glacial cycle was asymmetric having a long cooling interval that was characterized by an oscillating buildup of ice sheets to maximum volume.

By about 7,000 calendar years ago, a small ice cap on Baffin Island was all that was left of the great Laurentide Ice Sheet that had once covered northern North America.

The charity was founded in 1999, and is directed, by Len and Barbara Curtis. Background Donna Curtis was only 20 when she died having spent four years fighting cancer. Although wracked with pain, she vowed her legacy was to make lives of terminally ill children happier. She set up the Donna Curtis Appeal and worked tirelessly raising funds right until the end. When Donna was first diagnosed, locals around the Foxhall district of Blackpool and Stanley Arms regulars raised £3,500 to send her on a holiday to Disneyland. It made her determined to help make life more bearable for other desperately ill children. Donna died on New Year's Day in 1996 and she left a red box by her bedside containing three wishes. The first was to raise money for a children's hospice; the second was to raise money to send families from the Fylde to Disneyland and her third, and final, wish was to set up a holiday home for children who were unable to make it to Disneyland. Once a derelict hotel, which was volunteered by the Council for a peppercorn rent, the property is now a haven by which any child would be overwhelmed. The keys were handed over on Donna’s birthday, and Len and Barbara’s 35th wedding anniversary, which the couple found particularly moving. Most of the facilities of the house have been donated, and many local businesses, hoteliers, nightclub owners, cafe proprietors, shopkeepers and well meaning individuals provide help wherever possible, including raising much-needed cash which helps with the ongoing running costs of the house. The house consists of four family apartments, all with themed rooms for absolute escapism. Themes include Winnie the Pooh’s Den, Cartoon World, Teddy Bear World and a Tangerine Room decked out with Blackpool Football Club merchandise. All the guests are invited to enjoy the decor of the communal rooms, including a ‘must-see-to- believe’ circus room complete with a steam train encircling the ceiling, and a wonderful Disney room, bursting at the seams with fantastic teddies, soft toys and murals. Many toys have been supplied by specialist charities or retail outlets - such as Blackpool’s Disney shop branch. Families visiting the house will also receive a pack of tickets for the Tower, the Sealife Centre, Tussards, Blackpool Zoo, the Model Village, Mermaid Cafe and more, again, all kindly donated by the town's businesses. =Fire= Burglars broke into Donna's Dream House in December 2011 and then set fire to log cabins in the rear of the building, causing damage costing £80,000. A milkman spotted smoke coming from the courtyard of the Donna's Dream House on Chapel Street and alerted the fire service about 07:00 GMT. Founder Len Curtis, who set up the charity in memory of his daughter, Donna, who died at 20, said: \\"This has ripped the heart out of the charity.

It is likely a monument at the site was present in Ancient Florence, this column, made from gray granite from Elba, was erected initially in 1430-1431 by the civic officers of the neighborhood. At the summit, originally was placed a pietra serena statue by Donatello, depicting an allegory of la Dovizia (Abundance), holding a cornucopia, a theme befitting the surrounding marketplace. Attached to the column were two chains: one rung the open and close of market, while the other was used to chain swindlers and insolvent debtors for public shaming. In this it served a similar role to the Column of the Vicariate in Naples. Column prior to 1881, with bell visible.

The film is written and directed by J. C. Schroder and stars Charity Farrell and Lili Reinhart. Plot Six years after an apocalyptic event, Sarah (Charity Farrell) lives alone in a farmhouse, her time spent cleaning, piano playing and writing in a diary. One day, (after many years of being alone) her sister, Lili (Lili Reinhart), bleeding from her abdomen, approaches the house. Sarah takes her sister into the bathroom and attempts to undress her, but is rebuffed. At night, upon hearing a noise, Sarah investigates while carrying a gun. Startled by a man outside the house, she shoots, killing him. In the morning she drags the body into a shed. Soon another man appears. Ryan (Warren Bryson) shows Sarah a sketch he had made of her, years ago as she and her father (David Wetzel) were in a city, and has searched to find her. Ryan attempts to convince Sarah that the \\"end of the world\\" never happened, that there are people and cities in the world. Lili argues with Sarah, insisting that she get the man to leave the house. As Lili attempts to have her sister force Ryan away, Sarah becomes attracted to him and eventually begin a romantic event in the grasses outside the house. Interrupted by Lili's screams, the two break down her door to find her threatening each with a knife. Separating for the night, Sarah wakes alone in the morning. Finding her dress stained she changes into a prom dress that she had been making. After seeing a sign and Lilis door reading \\"dont trip\\" (which Sarah ignores) Sarah trips on a lucky charm necklace, falling down the stairs and sustains an abdominal wound after landing on a chandelier. The two sisters argue, culminating in Sarah stabbing Lili. Ryan finds Sarah bleeding on the floor. He attempts to convince her that Lili never existed by showing her the pictures in the room. He bandages her wounds and attempts to undress her in the bathroom, but denies his assistance much like how her sister refused help a few days ago. She agrees to go with Ryan to the city, departing for the day–long hike in the morning. Along the walk she confronts Ryan, who pushes a finger into her abdominal wound, he tells her it hasn't been 6 years since anything and that was all in her head. Laying on the ground she recalls walking along a city street with her dad as he presents her with the very same lucky charm necklace. She begins running toward the Fourth of July fireworks, turning to find him gone. She walks back, stopping at an alley where he is being attacked by a masked man. He shoots Sarah's father then stabs her twice and while speaking to her Sarah realizes that the man is Ryan. While on the ground Sarah shoots a gun at him, then turns to see her dying father. Back in the fields Sarah shoots at Ryan, but cannot find his body. She gathers her belongings, continuing to walk the path until she approaches the city.

Posted on The Korea Times. Posted by Sah Dong-seok on August 26, 2016. Until the arrival of Western imperialism in the 19th century, Korea had been part of the sinocentric East Asian regional order.  History  In 1931, while Korea was dominated by Imperial Japan, there was a dispute between Chinese and Korean farmers in Wanpaoshan, Manchuria. It was highly sensationalized in the Japanese and Korean press, and used as propaganda to increase anti-Chinese sentiment. It caused a series of anti-Chinese riots throughout Korea, starting in Incheon on July 3 and spreading rapidly to other cities. Chinese sources estimate that 146 people were killed, 546 wounded, and a considerable number of properties were destroyed . The worst riot occurred in Pyongyang on July 5. In this effect, the Japanese had a considerable influence on sinophobia in Korea. Starting in October 1950, the People's Volunteer Army fought in the Korean War (1950–1953) on the side of North Korea against South Korean and United Nations troops. The participation of the PVA made the relations between South Korea and China hostile. Throughout the Cold War, there were no official relations between capitalist South Korea and communist China until August 24, 1992, when formal diplomatic relations were established between Seoul and Beijing. In the 1960s, South Korean laws directed against foreign property ownership, at a time when most foreign ownership was by ethnic Chinese, led to many Chinese emigrating from South Korea to Taiwan. = Recent history = In the early 2000s, a dispute over the history of Goguryo, which both Koreas and China claim as their own, caused tension between the two countries. Anti-Chinese sentiments in South Korea have been on a steady rise since 2002. According to the Pew Global Attitude Project, favorable view of China steadily declined from 66% in 2002 to 48% in 2008, while unfavorable view of China rose from 31% in 2002 to 49% in 2008.World Public Opinion surveys, 2002–2008 www.worldpublicopinion.org According to polls by the East Asia Institute, positive view of China's influence declined from 48.6% in 2005 to 38% in 2009, while negative view of Chinese influence rose from 46.7% in 2005 to 50% in 2008.East Asia Institute Foreign Perception Survey 2005–2009, some in collaboration with BBC World Service Polls 2005–2008 www.eai.or.kr During the Seoul leg of the 2008 Olympic torch relay, over 6,000 Chinese students clashed with protesters.Donga Monthly. Chinese demonstrators clashed with local activists who rallied to protest the torch relay, citing Beijing's discouraging treatment of North Korea defectors and the regime's crackdown on Tibetans' rioting for independence. With the result of these violent clashes in central Seoul, anti-Chinese sentiments in Korea aroused great indignation toward the Chinese people. The Ministry of Justice of South Korea indicated that it would punish all such demonstrators, regardless of nationality. The Government of South Korea is toughening visa regulations for Chinese students. Relations further strained with the deployment of THAAD is South Korea in 2017, in which China started its boycott against Korea, making Koreans to develop anti-Chinese sentiment in South Korea over reports of economic retaliation by Beijing.Beijing's Anti-THAAD Moves Sour China Views in South Korea. Posted by Brian Padden on March 21, 2017. A study in 2018 by the Chinese Academy of Sciences showed anti-Chinese sentiments in South Korea is becoming serious, with the majority of South Koreans expressing positive sentiments towards the United States and negative sentiments towards China. This contradicts a previous study by the same institute in 2017 that South Korea, in the long term, will not be able to maintain an anti-US stance against Chinese and Russian retaliation. According to the study, since 2013, it has become a trans-generational and trans-political trend in South Korea where the younger generation in their 20s have higher perceptions of China as a threat than the older generation in their 60s. The study deduced three factors behind anti-Chinese sentiments in South Korea, which are cold war ideology, nationalism and China threat theory. According to its analysis, anti-Chinese sentiments first began to rise with the Northeast Project in 2004, and took a decisive turn for the worse in the THAAD conflict in 2017. According to a poll released by the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies at Seoul National University in 2018, 46 percent of South Koreans find China as the most threatening country to inter-Korean peace (compared to 33 percent for North Korea), marking the first time China was seen as a bigger threat than North Korea since the survey began in 2007.

Rector.  Early life  Thomas Fletcher was born at Nashville, Tennessee, about the year 1817. Entering upon the study of law, he became of prominence in that profession and in the activities of political life, and during the administration of President Polk was appointed to the office of United States marshal, with his headquarters at Natchez, Mississippi. In 1850 he made his home in Arkansas, and soon occupied a leading position. He was President of the Arkansas Senate during the 12th, 13th, and 14th sessions, from 1858 to 1864, and President of the Arkansas Senate (Confederate government in exile) held at Washington, Arkansas, in October 1864.  Acting governor of Arkansas (1862)  Fletcher's service as acting governor of Arkansas continued from the resignation of Henry M. Rector until the inauguration of Harris Flanagin, who was chosen at a special election held October 6, 1862. Fletcher's tenure of the office as acting governor was by virtue of his position as President of the Arkansas Senate.  Later life  After the close of the American Civil War, Fletcher was a member of the Arkansas Senate of 1874–1877. In 1878 he began the practice of the law at Little Rock, Arkansas, but his career was soon afterward terminated by his death at age 62, on February 26, 1880, at Little Rock, due to complications from pneumonia.

Conceptual origin Physicists Graeme Mitchison and Richard Jozsa introduced the notion of counterfactual computing as an application of quantum computing, founded on the concepts of counterfactual definiteness, on a re-interpretation of the Elitzur–Vaidman bomb tester thought experiment, and making theoretical use of the phenomenon of interaction-free measurement. As an example of this idea, in 1997, after seeing a talk on Counterfactual Computation by Richard Jozsa at the Isaac Newton Institute, Keith Bowden (based in the Theoretical Physics Research Unit at Birkbeck College, University of London) published a paper Bowden, Keith G, \\"Classical Computation can be Counterfactual\\", in Aspects I, Proc ANPA19, Cambridge 1997 (published May 1999), describing a digital computer that could be counterfactually interrogated to calculate whether a light beam would fail to pass through a maze. (Revised version of \\"Classical Computation can be Counterfactual\\") More recently the idea of counterfactual quantum communication has been proposed and demonstrated. Liu Y, et al. (2012) \\"Experimental demonstration of counterfactual quantum communication\\". Phys Rev Lett 109:030501 Outline of the method The quantum computer may be physically implemented in arbitrary ways but the common apparatus considered to date features a Mach–Zehnder interferometer. The quantum computer is set in a superposition of \\"not running\\" and \\"running\\" states by means such as the Quantum Zeno Effect. Those state histories are quantum interfered. After many repetitions of very rapid projective measurements, the \\"not running\\" state evolves to a final value imprinted into the properties of the quantum computer. Measuring that value allows for learning the result of some types of computations such as Grover's algorithm even though the result was derived from the non-running state of the quantum computer. Definition The original formulation of Counterfactual Quantum Computation stated that a set m of measurement outcomes is a counterfactual outcome if (1) there is only one history associated to m and that history contains only \\"off\\" (non-running) states, and (2) there is only a single possible computational output associated to m. A refined definition of counterfactual computation expressed in procedures and conditions is: (i) Identify and label all histories (quantum paths), with as many labels as needed, which lead to the same set m of measurement outcomes, and (ii) coherently superpose all possible histories. (iii) After cancelling the terms (if any) whose complex amplitudes together add to zero, the set m of measurement outcomes is a counterfactual outcome if (iv) there are no terms left with the computer-running label in their history labels, and (v) there is only a single possible computer output associated to m. Mirror array In 1997, after discussions with Abner Shimony and Richard Jozsa, and inspired by the idea of the (1993) Elitzur-Vaidman Bomb Tester, Keith Bowden published a paper describing a digital computer that could be counterfactually interrogated to calculate whether a photon would fail to pass through a maze of mirrors. This so-called Mirror-Array replaces the tentative Bomb in Elitzur and Vaidman's device (actually a Mach–Zehnder interferometer). One time in four a photon will exit the device in such a way as to indicate that the maze is not navigable, even though the photon never passed through the Mirror Array. The Mirror Array itself is set up in such a way that it is defined by an n by n matrix of bits. The output (fail or otherwise) is itself defined by a single bit. Thus the Mirror Array itself is an n-squared bit in, 1 bit out digital computer which calculates mazes and can be run counterfactually. Although the overall device is clearly a quantum computer, the part which is counterfactually tested is semi classical. Experimental demonstration In 2015, counterfactual quantum computation was demonstrated in the experimental context of \\"spins of a negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy color center in a diamond\\". Previously suspected limits of efficiency were exceeded, achieving counterfactual computational efficiency of 85% with the higher efficiency foreseen in principle.

Harry was born in Bideford (or Holsworthy?), Devonshire, or possibly in/near London, and baptised 30 March 1835 in Holsworthy, Devon. His father Richard Bartlett appears to have died soon after the birth of his younger sister Amelia Lucy. In 1851 Harry was living as a 16 year old with his Bartlett grandfather, an innkeeper in Bideford, Devon, whilst his mother was in nearby Holsworthy. Harry arrived in Adelaide, South Australia on 5 July 1857 on the Gilmore which had departed Plymouth on 7 March, with his sister Amelia Lucy and mother Mary Anne Ribouleau Bartlett, née Perrers, entered on the ship's manifest as Harry Bartlett, age 21, born Middlesex (but his sister and mother born Holsworthy, Devon), occupation labourer. He soon went to Woolundunga Station, near Port Augusta, and there met John McKinlay, the noted explorer, whom he accompanied on a trip to the Barrier country. Later they went together to Port Lincoln, crossing the gulf in the steamer Daphne. At that time the only buildings in Port Lincoln were a couple of shanties owned by Captain Bishop (later owner of Boston Island), and \\"Jimmy\\" Owen. He spent several years prospecting on Kangaroo Island, and Yorke Peninsula from Franklin Harbour to the Gawler Ranges, gaining an intimate knowledge of the country. He was elected to the seat of Yorke Peninsula in the South Australian House of Assembly and sat from March 1887 to April 1896. His colleagues were, in turn, Robert Caldwell, Henry Lamshed and Arthur Short. He was remembered for his tireless advocacy on behalf of Yorke Peninsula agriculturists at a time when pastoralists were all-powerful. He owned near Port Vincent, by the road to Curramulka. Family Little is yet known of Harry's father Richard Bartlett. More is known of his mother, Mary Ann Ribouleau Perrers (b. May 1814 in Holsworthy, Devon – c. 13 June 1902) the first born of Capt. Henry Wilson Perrers of H.M. Navy and Lucy Collins. Mary Ann's middle name of Ribouleau was in honour of her father’s first wife, Rachel Ribouleau (1764-1812) who had died just 6 months into the marriage. Rachel was the sister of then Captain, later Vice-Admiral Peter Ribouleau (1768-1847). It is likely that Captain Peter Ribouleau was Mary Ann's godfather. Peter Ribouleau's wife and only child (a daughter) had predeceased him in 1845, leaving him as the last male Ribouleau descendant of his and Rachel's great-grandfather Etienne/Stephen Ribouleau. Etienne had been a French Protestant Huguenot who fled his native Ile de Ré in France, was granted denization in England in 1687, and settled as a distiller in Hammersmith outside London. The only trace of the Ribouleau name left in England is Riboleau (sic) Street in Ryde on the Isle of Wight, where Admiral Peter Ribouleau had had his large country property. Harry Bartlett married Anne Ferrett (née Dennis) (1824–1890) on 19 March 1864. She was the widow of John Ferrett ( – 6 November 1860) of Angaston and already had five children; they had three more together: Lucy Ann, Emily Ribouleau, and William John. Harry moved to Germein Street, Semaphore in 1904. He married (Henrietta) Minna Schultze \\"his true wife\\" An enigmatic epitaph. (c. 1861 – 12 December 1951) on 21 March 1910. His sister (Amelia) Lucy Bartlett (1840 – 6 October 1914) married Frederick Samuel Sison (c. 1831 – 29 December 1891) of the brewing firm Syme & Sison (Sison and Bartlett went fishing and shooting together; Bartlett was remembered in Sison's will) and lived at Boston House, Port Lincoln; she married again, to Edmund P.

Synopsis Shortly after the end of United States civil war, Captain Jeff Madison, a Union Official, leads a group of soldiers in the search for a group of Confederate soldiers who have gone rogue and are conducting a guerrilla war in the South. The rebel group, lead by the infamous Machedo, splits in two, and while one faction ambushes Madison and his party the other one captures one of the Union's forts and decimate the soldiers and commanding officer. Shortly after the rebels capture Madison, the only survivor of the previous ambush, when he gets to the fort. Machedo and his men torture and shoot Madison in his right hand, rendering it useless for holding a gun, and leave him to die. Madison survives by pure chance when a group of Indians appear by the location. During the next two years the group of rebels and former soldiers carry a series of raids undisturbed, while at the same time Madison has been preparing to exact justice on them. When Machedo and his men steal the freshly arrived gold of a town, Madison sees the perfect opportunity to manipulate the situation in his favour, bringing Machedo and his group to a trap.

It has a 186 year orbit. It fits the classical definition of a Halley-type comet with (20 years < period < 200 years). It was lost and was not recovered until November 7, 2012, when amateur astronomer Rob Matson discovered a comet, and it was identified that the pre-recovery short-arc orbital calculations for Pons-Gambart were completely wrong because the comet only had a 1-month observation arc with poor data. The original name when first discovered was C/1827 M1. Before the 2012 return, when Comet Pons–Gambart was speculated to have a roughly 60 year orbit it was suspected of possibly being comet 1110 K1. Of the numbered periodic comets only 153P/Ikeya-Zhang has a longer orbital period.
